made their decision or they're supporting which is pretty fascinating anyway we'll just Eighteen days away from these all important midterm elections\nAnd what do we see we see that reticent has now been exposed this week in Tennessee as somebody that is purposely lying to the people of Tennessee the same with Claire McCaskill we said that Christians cinema is falling apart\nI mean literally ... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a spy to join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said oh and by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona oh by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha ... valley\nIs fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota so it seems a lot of pickups in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida both for governor and for Rick Scott is always there was an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nOf well the the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what's your agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi when she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about Schumer in the Senate\nAnd he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better in a\nIn the polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a ... so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate look like they're going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nA West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nWas really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people of New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with this Chilean Epstein guy uh that has now become an absolute verbal war between\n... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls\nAre dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think we're America stands in St John and you are right on fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think that New Jersey will go all the way because it is a operationally democratic state but\nThe other states you cite showing I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I Do have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those have deteriorated above it from my perspective in the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look I yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a\nNationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh uh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen\nSo if you can get to sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired\nParticular Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out the Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that\nYou can fit your yet he cooler in the last couple of ... in the bed\nGoing to

I Love libertarians\nWhat all you're going to do is help elect Donnelly and we learned so often that Democrats often encourage third party ticket because they know they can't win a head to head match\nAnyway but time to put your party light on\nIt's friday these weeks are tough Eighteen days ... all important midterm and that means it's time for our friday Florida Georgia Line that ground concert series let's hit it hammer\nAnd ...\n...\n... dollar bottom bottom block our\nMoon I'm reading or read them\n\nAround\nTo find out where the parties and\n...\n\n\nGoing down we know and I\nYou\nKnow bombing\nAnd a half\nI Am saying oh\n\nWe\nWind the K ... only bring the brain that are no man [noise]\nAll broken hard\nOf day I'd be in the long\nThey [noise]\nThey made or\nMan on the only\nAnd a little bit of Jake and\nDriving jobs\nOr again those to represent your staple you're guaranteed sources of income and then this third legged stool is really for the boomer generation\nIs fast becoming the most important piece of the puzzle because it's your retirement savings for one case you for all three bees okay and what do we do with that because the good news is because pensions have been going the way we have become and I say we because I'm a boomer\nWe've become better savers okay we've become more knowledgeable about four one K. and for all three bees\nOr we've got matched programs many people I speak to I say what are you putting away and they'll say well I'm doing the match and that's a good sign that means at least save you know right up and that and I know what the matches and now you know we can contribute if you're over fifty twenty four thousand five hundred a year into your plan so that's great news\nBut the problem is this as we age as we get older the question now becomes\nDo I continue to play the market as I did in the past and risk potentially running out of money or\nDo I put it in a safe place and risk losing to inflation\nWhich may involve having to go back to work at least part time to make up the difference and the fear today is is not dying too soon is living too long and running out of money so how do we walk that line between safety versus return\nRisk versus reward and guarantees versus opportunities that's the question just because we were good savers\nDoesn't mean we're good at planning income and you know most people when they don't see it and they get in there especially in our fifties we tend to not even look at us statements I mean I had a couple of come in last week\nAnd I said hey you know what are you doing I'm saving acts okay do you have a copy a statement I'm no matter of fact I haven't even looked at it in ... years oh I says well what wait a minute fifty eight maybe we ought to take a look at that and you know what I mean so that's what I mean I mean we've become better save is but now we have to become better\nIncome planners so the key here\nLet's think about that three legged stool right the main goal is income for life\nWhat does all this mean in terms of how much income can I take a month\nAnd how long will it last\nSo that I can do the things I Want to do in retirement whether it's traveling seeing my grand kids playing more golf a working part time going camping whatever your goals are we need to match those goals with the money you have and create that reality create that\nThat those layers of income I call it also accounting for inflation so when you're a boomer and you have this money it's great and congratulations for having it but now the question is we need to distribute it in a way in other words we need to do the cumulative none a cumulative\nSo there's a difference between those two there's different disciplines\nI as you know in a retirement income specialists I'm an R. I. C. P. retirement income certified professional through the American college and one of those vehicles OK are one of the vehicles is annuities and I know people who've heard those before\nAnd you know they have different opinions for and against just like anything really there's good funds bad funds ... bad stocks\nBut it has to be the right fit for you and that's where I come into play you know knew this can be very flexible they're not the annuities you heard of years ago where if you die the money dies and all this other stuff today's products for example I had someone come in the other day and I said to them\nWhat if you could participate in the s in pay five hundred gains only meeting\nOne of the market goes up your money goes up right however what if if the S. and P. drops 'cause we have no clue where it's going to go tomorrow the next week on the next year\nWhat if one it drops all your money including your previous gains are protected from loss that sounds like a win win right there you bet All right and we've worked with companies I've been doing this by the way with these products since Nineteen Ninety eight when they first came out\nCase oh I've got a leg up on most people in my industry because I've been doing it since day one with these I understand these products well I work with pretty much every single company out there I Know the ins and outs what what are the good ones and what are the bad ones and believe me there are some bad ones out there\nYou know what we don't want us handcuffs\nAs a boomer I Want it all [laughter] okay we want an all we're the ones who have driven the industry to come back with products like this to satisfy our needs I Want a good return without risk I Want income for life an old by the way I Want access to that money to in case I Need it\nGet in because that's the way my generation is the insurance industry responded brilliantly and came back with these what I feel are amazing products and parts of your retirement plan so again the whole key is to put all these pieces of the puzzle together and to know what's out there\nThat's a number five year old age for for for eight zero zero three again find you relate for for for a zero zero three more details on the Web site at family financial\nDot net thank you guys so much for joining us here today and I'm just can't be half from CNN Joni and failing financial thank you so much for making ready to retire rainy all a part of July weekend\nAnd the Steven zoning again thanks for listening we'll look forward to chat with you and I remember those first ... got a copy of the book and opportunity to sit down and saw over some ideas\nFinancial dancing with North Korea medication or any other government agency and not provide lead or tax return the accounting\nWe're talking about there but my concern over the years they're going to be guaranteed to like the only other people's rights ability to get from turkey and we make retired miners are monitoring the chargers or kept tire spread to other research that they're not good at some of the most beautiful your contract respect in place to go like maybe a quite a bit later about assurance that any product I certainly think that like the one that he wants\nUs to do just as a day every week 'cause what a grand in your hand\nMade possible by someone else for me of course you're gonna if you really want to give credit where credit's due for your weight lifting at five after the hour every hour starting at six AM we walk down the dollar second year old barber shop nowhere else to put out that give her that there are no\nThank you for joining us now regardless of who was responsible for your child that would be\n... when a grand in your hand on Youth Radio Ninety five WICK\n[noise]\nIn the mid ... doo doo doo doo doo doo de ...\nAnd then in ... in the ... [noise]\n... [noise]\nTo [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd then\nIn\n\nIn\n...\n... [noise]\nHere's the latest from ABC News island Lopez is the first day of early voting in Nevada for the midterm elections in both President Trump and former vice president Joe Biden on the campaign trail here today at a rally in ... the president urging supporters to vote and vote early\nWho follow the news and who have jobs this is for the ... Democrats operatives with press passes in the\nMajor media that to this is for so they can say well there is this study and then they'll never they'll never mentioned that the study proves that she's not in India there there is a study that's all that matters so so this is good but what's in the studies is going down the into the black hole of memory\nAnd I actually the the globe has been trying to rehabilitate her uh her her phoney baloney or ethnic heritage now for well they they did it from day one remember when the six years ago the New England historical and Jeannie a logical society was asked to check her out\nAnd they said they could find no evidence of any in a Native American heritage in her background and\nSo the globe just pretend that that the\nSociety had found out that there was they just kept report it they they ... the society said there is no evidence the globe reported for two or three weeks that they had discovered evidence is that because that's that's the way the globe operates I mean she is in the Senate seat once held by Ted Kennedy and every sixth year\nAt this time there would be running stories Senator Kennedy turning his life around Senator Kennedy is stopped drink Senator Kennedy's on a diet and this is the same thing it's just a different the Elizabeth Warren has taken the test\nElizabeth Warren is part Indian okay one one thousand and twelfth Indian but she's part Indian she's not telling a lie\nHow much he releases or DNA how can we how much he tells us where the past was taken how much she takes a real ... a a test like your meat tank I've taken my test you know I told you what what's it might test\nFifty three percent Irish forty seven percent English I think I I got the results my heritage DNA that's where it came from why why is this a big secret\nBut uh you know who conducted this past\nNine seven eight says this she she never said she was one hundred percent Indian she said that her mom was so obviously Native American that are racist paternal grandparents wouldn't allow them to marry ... that's got to be like at least fifty percent\nRight and that was that was all be asked to\nThat was I mean all this stuff is six years old I mean you may have forgotten that I I was involved in the the whole an ... masking over ... that the city but what happened was was the depression Oklahoma the dust bowl so there was no money\nSo she ... her parents want to get married so they got but they got no do so they get in their liver or their Model T whatever it was and they they drive over to the next\nTown to the biggest Protestant Church in the town and they get married on a Saturday afternoon then they drive back to the town they live in Lakewood hadn't five ten miles away and they have a reception that night now does that sound to you like in a low but now\nThe Boston Globe is finally issued a second correction to the story\nA correction due to a mass air a story about Elizabeth Warren misstated the ancestry percentage of a potential six intense generation relatives the generational range based on the ancestor that the report identified suggest she's between one sixty fourth in one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American yeah\nMean I just was telling you that before the correction bright part's been run with that for hours and because you know I get I'm no I'm no math genius\nAnd and you know the the first the first the apology or whatever you want to call it the\nExcuse alibi the glow brand they actually had the documents from the University of Pennsylvania where she changed her racial racial classification from white two women to see color whatever the hell what ... what the hell is color main by the way\nAid for four or five hundred and forty two forty to hear about this during an interview with the globe published last month Warren explained that she identified herself as Native American in the late in the eighties and early nineties as many of\nThe matriarch of her family were dying and she began to feel that her family stories of history will become [noise] so if the my when my relatives started dying off does that mean I should have declared that I was a Nigerian [noise] miss the same thing is that she's not an end the [noise] um how we are [noise]\nOkay [noise] [noise]\nI Love them Matthews brothers [noise]\nA poor for five hundred forty to forty two [noise]\nSays this is great [laughter]\nI think to legally claim Native American ancestry you got to be at least one one thirty one thirty seconds but I I don't even think that works a you know you can legally claim it\nBut that doesn't mean you're going to get back to be I a card that doesn't mean you could be in the U.S in the the\nTribal rules you know you're supposed to be on what's called the laws list if you don't have an ancestor or the dog was you're out\nIt's it's ... it's a closed club you know I got no problem with us so they they they were ... they they they lost their way\nBut I mean that's what makes it even more appalling and upward that she would try to commit this kind of ethics law with no no basis in reality\nYeah it's it's also just so weird that\nShe would continue this and like Blumenthal the liar but at least one Trump makes a jab at him and kind of died off afterwards because he's not like actually I was there at one point at some point you just have to say you know what\nI lied and own it and then and then and then it then it's dead it's not dead if you if you're like well technically I didn't lie\nYeah I mean bookers not good Cory bookers and claiming to be Spartacus anymore but she basically went up today and said I'm drawing them all\nBut ... that's ... Jay from Joe so he's on fire today\nBut it's true I Know and when you really think about it\nOkay so she has maybe according to this guy whoever he is some tiny tiny percentage does that mean that she should be checking off because if that's a new standard than kids applying for school everyone to check off that they're Hispanic or that they are black\nAnd you really can't get mad at them because Elizabeth Warren who is probably going to run for president did it oh she's running and the media's applauding her for it like you were so proud of her she is a tiny tiny tiny tiny percent Pocahontas no she's not\nSo I Want to see what I'm looking forward to seeing her if you see reports I Want to see where the expenditure is\nPaying for this test how much do you think they paid for the test\nOn I'll go down there was more than we pay for our tests let me put it that well if the guy did it for free than he it's a kind of cause and supposedly he didn't know that he was testing Elizabeth Warren's\nA spit ... ah right we believe that the ... when\nShe called him up she was so smog and proud of herself so the president always has called my mother a liar but what you're saying is she was telling the truth he's like yes there is absolutely chance that millions of years ago there was someone in your family may may happen a Native American\nMaybe potentially and oh by the way the woman the woman that they're linking linking him to is this woman the the OC Sara Smith Crawford\nNow there's no evidence that she ever claimed to be an uh an a Native American and and oh by the way she married a guy by the name of a William J Crawford do you know with William J Crawford's a\nJob was it was the Tennessee militia you know what the Tennessee militia was into when the Eighteen thirties we're too We're rounding up charity and hurting them on the trail of tears up Oklahoma\nWow so she was really the child is like a ...\nBut it's worse than that\nMaybe it's like your shoes the child of a slave and a member of the Ku Klux Klan yeah according to her according to her own testimony\nCrazy max and her father's parents must have had such antennas up to know that the person their son was marrying had such distant maybe Native American like what did they maybe\nTo a point it was like one five hundred twelve yeah so the SOS boy I mean you talk about the you know they talk about gay Darby and it was bought gave these people had Indians are yeah they could they could spot it man\nDavid spotted from mile away and I\nThink so boy and the big picture things it was even without the Indian thinks she's still alluded to communist\nYeah being in that it's just fun I Can't believe she even brought it up it's so bizarre\nAnd and speaking of um Native Americans the song half breed I have decided that I Will be share for Halloween that the results are in my results are in and I'm going to be share so that's that and speaking of myself I'm thirty nine percent levels and\nYou know the the song would have been nearly as good if it was\nOne to four percent parades to hate the word I don't think that's one would have made the top forty nobody\nWanted me around one one thousand ever percentage Native American maybe they could see it on the face kind of sort of ... yeah you just ...\nShe's Peruvian or Colombian or Mexican so you need to start going or send you read the fake it'd be a\nIt so I prefer Elizabeth though\nBut really though I mean compared to her I Am so west Asian it's crazy like I I should be the head of our culture and three percent ... point nine percent I'm ... how many times did that hurt so\nBad like one one one one Twenty one twenty fifth that's a yeah I'm as opposed to one one thousand twenty fourth\nI'm a real woman of color and not that we can you know we're we're not comparing it on the totem pole but I'm just saying that technically I Am very much west Asian and I carry a proudly and I'm going to start checking boxes left and right\nHave you submitted any recipes to west Asian cookbooks\nNo but I'm going to um in other news just briefly and then we can get back to some of the cuts of Elizabeth Warren um [noise] I Know this is\nGoing to be at such interest to you guys ... know such a thing about the marvel at nine now know that old enough to know\n'em but also that means her dad is gonna be a grandfather so he can be all over the news again get me with a spin\nWho's the father does that does that move it up on the uh on on the waiting list for a new liver [laughter]\nOh how we got dark um but that's OK so this is Elizabeth Warren thing\nObviously took up a lot of the news cycle today just took over\nBut there was a lot of fake news this weekend and I think all these quickly so that throughout the show you might forget you can address and now NBC issues correction after Trump's Robert elite comment this was a big one this actually got a lot of coverage mostly because it was so taken out of\nContext why the same people who are reporting the lives with weren't as one thirty one thirty second Indian even though that story has already been demolished\nSo this is the ... this is the corrective tweet correction an earlier tweet miss identify the general President Trump describes his incredible at a rally in Ohio it was general Ulysses S grant not General Robert elite and attached video clip lack the full context for Trump's remarks\nAnd again the weird thing is these mistakes always go one way I Know they always go one\nWas ever cutting up the clips always managed to leave out such important details\nThis is NBC I mean the other people who did the same thing with the uh the ... the exploding truck with the uh with George Zimmerman the Trayvon Martin the edited that stuff I mean this day and age there are millions and millions and millions of ... and my barnacles network ...\nSo you know it really is getting to a point where if your and I know there's not many of them left but if you're a moderate Democrat you have to be thinking to yourself oh my God guys\nStop like you're not helping the cars by continuously making errors and then having and I'm saying or as amusing that very broadly 'cause I think these are purposeful mistakes but then saying oh correction corruption the people I think even Democrats are getting fed up with it like double check your work it's pretty basic\nThe Democrats are mad but she is causing this distraction in the middle of a mid term elections like some of Obama's campaign managers are saying really great that she would do this could take all the attention away from our candidates\nIn midtown Manhattan dinner and it was the favorite of Noel Coward and the ... all of whom had a lot in the blood in them so you could imagine\nAnd how are you will be on Tucker I Will be at an event for just yell at anyone wants to go and buy was supposed to be\nThere but I figured this was this was\nThis help Jeff yeah and a lot of ways as well um yeah and so it'll be really find everything by you know the details how he will you share them\nYes seven to nine you can go to a soggy ... Assad Joe it's a it's a Frank people's quality of the restaurant Frank people's quality and uh if you know who has a bunch of great restaurants including brick oh in the north and and the\nMic Veronica who also has a bunch of great restaurants including ... another waterfront there's going to handle restrain the in Burlington\nTheir their ... their other co host and I'm a third of the third co host but I'm a I'm a no show\nSo instead of British getting great Italian food you're going to get green room chips\nI only got a great Italian Night I'll stand in for ... and I'll maybe I'll Try to\nI Want to shut Tucker I Want a chef and I watch a cold ... for me coming in today I got the I got the recipe right\nHere they asked if we should have a makeup of person for him and I said yeah well I'm like Elizabeth Warren he doesn't have a nice or the complex and yeah you're going to need a lot of makeup\nThank you I mean it brings in the black baggage and try to take the bus back so that's oh cool I'm not an off duty guys this segment is brought you by our VIP special\nIf you ever hear we're going to have a piece in here tomorrow and a lot of times people here and they contact me and they say how can you come to the idea it's really find you get ... wounds you watch the whole show from inside the studio you mean Steve how we might south\nOn it's just a great time ... special and use the promo code grace\n... has a great idea by the way the Democratic debates they shouldn't dress in costume I mean", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "20"}
