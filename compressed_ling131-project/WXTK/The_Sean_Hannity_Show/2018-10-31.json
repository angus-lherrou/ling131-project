that he really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic radical radicalization and this president has radicalized so many more people than I separate dead I think the president has

Scott's seat Rick Scott a would love to see him we did a great job as governor of Florida and I love to see him go to the U.S Senate that too is a tight race\nLet's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved well\nThis guy was posing as a developer a he went and he paid for Andrew\nAt least a thousand dollars for that ticket that's in a legal gift ended up itself Andrew never reported it\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in Tallahassee and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release were that an FBI agent is a tax thing the the main lobby its body of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah why\nWasn't he got arrested isn't that buying influence in corruption\nWell there is an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's going to happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence\nAndrew also the same lobbyists that arrange that New York John get paid for for night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAndrew didn't pay a dime of that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under roads a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaign nine twenty six team that was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you have reported that after the fact that just basically cover new tracks CYA so it'll be interesting and important\nAt all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas or one of the lobbyist attorneys release that said the public so forty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation\nBut Sean you tell me what other reason what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it's now out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew get one picked this guy knowing\nHe had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum\nHe is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders\nWhich is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement targeting Israel they actually say Israel's genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of the Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day\nOpposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nAnd when a Israel fought back against the Moffett fats and may ah Gillum blamed Israel he said oh they just use those attacks as a free tax to be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is in a relief ... organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida uh they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice\nAnd that the police needs to be the funded they pay they say the U.S is the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their words with socialist principles that are so radical it'd make Nicolas Maduro flush so he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that just who he is he believes and what they're doing\nIs endorse them personally and uh it would\nLose it as a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's please them proud to a snake food to dream defender activists during a thirty days sleeping protests at the Florida State Capitol\nReferring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical group\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement they're anti free enterprise they're anti military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know what I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making because I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help them\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized health care\nHe his the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment planned it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so it's really a fan the arrangements have millions and millions of Floridians that he thinks it's appropriate for governments to take away health benefits that people have burned and the force them to be\nOn the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to what's the impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business says and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works and high tax states\nThey're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that when I'm governor buddy Andrew has his way they'll stop the flow of investment coming into Florida because people are going to invest if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and he also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish meant a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on law abiding Floridians a duty to retreat so somebody up a criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back\nYou also support legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean it you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids down there I mean I've got to believe would this controversial background on that looks like almost the phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd you know his record I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media's ignoring who he really is\nOh without question I mean the day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and try to make him into this great candidate a they do not like to scrutinize his record uh the fact that those documents released after he lied and the debate last Sunday\nOr the media kind of had to cover that buy at the end of the day\nHe has been given very kid glove treatment so really falls to me and other folks to go out and make the case and let people know and the good news is just one Floridians figure that out or they definitely don't want him as their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery of thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle\nI Wish I had

congressman now gubernatorial candidate the all important state of Florida Rhonda Santa's going up against radical left is Bernie supporter Andrew Gillum just as a way of background you did go to Harvard how many years did you serve the country\nI was active duty for five years in a U.S navy\nYeah um you know I I look at Florida they'll they had a little bit of a red tide problem isn't that something that happens sickle ugly over long periods of time occasionally\nIt 'cause it's natural I think the issue we've had is Lake Okeechobee the Army Corps of engineers discharges feminist polluted water into the rivers and so I write who's the ... river\nInto the area where you where you live in South Florida and I think what happened with some of those nutrients mixed with the red tide and exacerbated so we we got it bad ... got a really really bad\nSo I'm committed to making sure that we're batting that stopping to discharge is that in order to do that you gotta work constructively what the Trump Administration because a lot of that state federal partnerships I'll be able to do that Gillum wants to impeach track so I don't know how the hell is going to be able to work with him on any of that so I think any of those problems we have in America\nBut I understand it's gotten a lot better sense of it so I guess it in the early part of the spring and summer of this year a lot of it's gone away right\nIt's just I'm not quite frankly Michael watched I'm a bit um you know out and so it's not as bad as it was for sure but it really yeah there was a two month stretch there in South Florida where\nPeople were just getting hammered it was a net extensive or fish kill it hurt our economy and tourism so are we need to do whatever weekend but a lot of it as a fault you know the federal government are discharging you know all this water under the river\nA round Santa is running for governor the great state of Florida a Rick Scott running for senator down there a it is one of the most important states as Florida always is I'm a forty percent business tax by Andrew Gillum would be a disaster economically but Florida\nI Hope people waking up to the fact um and you are you how you're in the middle of early voting now and absentee voting obviously goes on and a one week from today we'll find out hopefully that you're the next governor of Florida\nOtherwise I think I'm On packing up my bags and I'm going to pull out of Florida and I'll go looking at Texas no offense but my friends I'm tired I got\nAnd I look I mean we're we're going to be squandering\nEven angry business taxes forty percent forget it I'm Out\nI now I Know now that's exactly right so we're going to get it done I think that folks understand that and uh you know when I'm governor will be

happening in my district a New Yorkers are throwing a ton of money out here I think we're now number one in California for most money being spent in a congressional district\nA that's not something my eye on it but uh that's what I got and ah but we're running well we're uh we're doing what we do\nIn order your home or do you think the ... what was in the bottom line is they're throwing money and they're running negative ads because negative ads work and money helps get out the vote you know they'll use that for you know people knocking on doors they'll use it to tax people they use it to reach out a hundred different ways\nAnd I put you at a decided disadvantage now\nI kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they want is freedom of speech but why Michael Bloomberg former New York city mayor is so obsessed with California's congressional races are obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\n[laughter] why I think that's probably the reason but he's also looking at districts that he thinks he can he can do something there uh this is this has been a held by Republican for very long time and we're going to win the seat [noise]\nBut ah yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's it's gotten to a saturation point now and people are just so upset\nI think people getting wet up with it and they tune it out like I Do

I'm going to the new uh James but that's how sixty minutes made their mark in television Mike Wallace was known for this sixty minutes was known for this to quote ambush interview and this isn't even an ambush undercover very or an ambush I'm not I know on both but they did they get undercover\nAnd they did it way ambush interviews where they run in and they weren't expecting cameras it's all legal they just don't like being caught that's what\nThey walk down the dollar thank you for giving us nowhere else to go but thank you for that no you know regardless of who's responsible obvious how would we want to grab in your hand on your radio Ninety five W ex TK [noise]\n\nRaining\nSwab\nThis is Sean Hannity show once or twice but it bears repeating\n[noise] and you can keep your plan if you are satisfied when if you like to play in your hair you can keep it if you like your plan\nAnd you like your doctor you won't have to do a thing you keep your life if you like your health care plan it will be able to keep your health care plan if you've got health insurance you can keep it if you're white or health care plan you'll keep your plan\nIf you got insurance you like your doctor you like your plan you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan if\nYou have insurance that you would like Ben you won't be able to keep that insurance if you like your doctor or health care plan you can keep it\nIf you like your health care plan you can he keep your health care plan\nSo if you like your plan you can keep your plan\nKeep their plane\nIf you like your current insurance you will keep your current insurance if you like your plan you can keep your plan if you like your plan you can keep your plan if you're happy with what you got nobody is changing\nAnd if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor and if you like if you want to pay less you can pay less\nThe truth and the reality is tens of millions of Americans lost their doctors\nLost their plans and everybody paid more in spite of the lie the big promise of Obamacare what is fascinating as we now head into the\nFinal week of this midterm election campaign is what Democrats won't talk about now we had earlier in the program we'll had project baritone dot com and James O'Keefe on and he's not been able to expose\nIn Tennessee Phil Bredesen the Democrat Claire McCaskill the Democrat in Missouri Heidi Heitkamp the Democrat in North Dakota\nChristian send them out the Democrat in Arizona that none of these people are being honest with the people in their respective states they don't want a border wall they want sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nAnd in California they want to take it a step further free health care for anybody resident non resident legal illegal doesn't matter Gavin Newsom women's out in California\nOn top of your Thirteen and a half percent state income tax\nNow Californians are going to put up a sign welcome to California the home of free health care and I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen people are going to go to California just to get free health care great job Gavin Newsom watch this implode on Californians it's got to be ugly and the mass exodus out of California will even continue\nAt a greater clip and a greater pace you know so now what's happened is somehow we forgot that what eight years of Obamacare Americans slowly beginning to forget that their premiums are have gone up three four hundred percent in some cases\nForgetting that they only have one choice of a health care provider forgetting that they lost their doctor from long ago that they really liked and wanted\nAnd they forget that people with a pre existing conditions well with Obamacare you pay more higher premiums than any other plant\nRate hikes that nobody ever expected and they lie to you about people losing their doctors that was a lie you like your doctor keep your doctor people losing their plans with no choice anymore and\nThis has now become and the final week of the election this is their talking points all across the country they're saying well we're we're going to ... where we support healthcare preexisting\nConditions while the Republicans repeal replace planned supported preexisting conditions\nAnd they're trying to basically go with the narrow lie that Republicans want you to die Republicans want dirty or water dirty air they want to kill children they want to throw granny over the cliff of course they're racist sexist massage sticking it Xena phobic Islamic\nPhobic homophobic oh and by the way Donald Trump's responsible for the horrible shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh and Donald Trump so even though the guy that shot up the synagogue is hated Donald Trump\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts\nGet in a way of a good propaganda lie in an election year well anyway Republicans now are beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also direct primary care or what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum\nAnd I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress in the Senate as we move forward and\nThere are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be blocked renting money to states so that they can become\nYou know the fifty outlets of new innovative\nMedicine and they'll turn over every penny because their political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants universal free care for everyone he gets X number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states with smart governors or it can be a lot different and a lot better you know we we often go to the case of health care savings accounts\nAnd then it turned out that he'd been chasing the wrong guy and I I've always said that was the first time in human history that the Gulf Coast have identified his or her wrong killer so\nI mean there's a lot of BS going on eight for four or five hundred forty to forty
