I've told you that\nWhen Donald Trump's first became president I thought to myself there was such\nA hate you describe like backlash like women taking to the streets pink hats everywhere and I thought wow this is going to be hard for him to win again because everyone seems really riled up and they really seem like a lit a fire under them energized their base and then I thought\nThe first they'd have to pick somebody to run against him\nAnd now I'm thinking like oh my God they have to pick one of these people they have to pick between\nWillie Brown's ex girlfriend Spartacus the fake Indian\nJoe Biden who is Joe Biden I think is like their Trump like they think he's all he says what's on his mind but whenever he goes off script he said something very offensive like stand up to a guy in a wheelchair so there it's just when picking for them\nWere Russia Today you drop I get to the debate with race or to say how how could you be an Indian you're on a seven eleven and a lower number when Joe Biden subtlety and in\n... Oh yes you have to have to have that yeah\nYeah and it's just like the other part of it is that when they run because all these\nNot so much like Donald Trump where you're running because you think you could do a good job they all just want to be president really badly like Spartacus you can see it and those eyes every time he cried he wants says it's going to get messy\n[noise] um our car [noise]\n\nBefore you say oh no ask are prone to handyman outlined with Larry and Saturday afternoons from one to three on news radio Ninety five WMGK [noise]\nWe are in charge local news authority WMGK west you're much Cape Cod and I urge radio station use radio Ninety five WMGK\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm Linda Lopez President Trump in the bottom and the final day of his campaign's weighing stumping for Republicans he repeated his threat to shut down the U.S southern border over the caravan of Central American migrants that's now at the Guatemala Mexico border\nBut the you know so we used to I we started referring to what his one sixty fourth and the Breitbart News started referring to it as one sixty fourth but the globe kept running with it because they want to allow all the moon bats that put their Facebook pays postings up saying that it's one third that she's she's got evidence\nSuch as it is claiming that she's one thirty second\nBut it was false so finally about a half hour ago they posted a second correction saying but at at most she is one\nSixty fourth India\nOr Native American or non white and of course here's the thing the average\nWhite America and the average American or European descent has more Native American blood than she apparently does but she is claiming to be an indie and she is claiming that she has a right to uh to have gotten and affirmative action position first at the University of Pennsylvania and then at Harvard University law school\nAnd of course we have powwow chow or cook what\nOne fifty five Elizabeth Warren she's a member of she's a Cherokee according to this was before the Cherokee and her uh her her she's got several recipes and here they're all lifted from various places my favorite is called omelets with crab meat which lifted from uh New York times French cookbook\nAll right uh [laughter]\n[laughter] you know this is this is just such a such a crock and it's so classic of the Democrat Party and the mainstream media the print fake news and then correct the fake those\nAfter the uh after\nThe lives of gone around the world and that are already posted and so tonight I guarantee you if you go to the the usual left wing cable news cast they will still be repeating the lie which is already a been retracted\nBy the uh additional fake news outlet to report it the Boston Globe that she's one thirty second Indian but you know what it doesn't even matter if she's one thirty second Indian that's not good enough to claim to be an Indian\nWhether it's a bureau of Indian affairs standards whether it's the a tribal role she she claims she's part Cherokee part Delaware that's not good enough she's not in India\n\nIf they if they were printing truthful headlines in the in the ... left media the headline would say white woman's DNA test proof she's white woman or a DNA test confirm Elizabeth Warren\nFate is a fake ending 'cause that's what she is she's a fake Indian\nDidn't achieve some attacks there says didn't the Cherokee Nation state that done our ancestry and could not find any connection\nYes of course yeah she's a she's a fried she's a fraud and now they're saying that the oh she's she's proven that she's in ... she is she's proven she's proven she's not in India and and we don't even know where this DNA tests wasn't on\nShe gave it to some uh Stanford University professor\nWho is a a I guess he's a biochemist these not even a geneticist these of I think a biophysicist and dies he they let him do the analysis the quote unquote analysis of the DNA and he's and he's given her this uh this this bill of health although it's not a bill of health is just proving she's not in India\nAnd yet they're gonna yet this is going to be this will be today's big ally from the ... left media Elizabeth Warren prove she's in India\nNow\nNot by the way back in the back and Jim Crow south used to have this thing called the one drop rule if you went ... ... if you had one drop of black blood didn't matter if you were like one sixty one thirty one sixty fourth black you were considered black so now Elizabeth Warren\nHas returned to her party's a Jim Crow Ku Klux Klan reconstruction bays and she's she's reclaiming the one drop rule the one drop rule she's got\n[noise] with only a [noise] a husky ... and ...\nBenjamin Franklin captured lightning\nIn a bottle over two hundred and sixty years later with a little resourcefulness ingenuity and\nWe're not only capturing confusing well it was confusing not anymore I'm telling you about true price from ... it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including season accessories and basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because true car shows you what other people are paying\nFor the energy\nEnsuring Americans have the energy whenever the [noise]\nLove Matthews brothers [noise]\nA four for five hundred forty to forty two so so they're reporting that hurt her ancestor has ah that hurt possible Indian ancestor even though women never claimed to be India has a a woman named who see Sarah Smith\nFor great great great grandmother\nAnd it's odd that you would be an Indian because she was married to a guy named William Crawford\nWas a member of the Tennessee militia that rounded up Cherokees from their family homes in the southeastern United States and hurting them in the government ... and what was then called Ross is landing\nWhich is now Chattanooga, Tennessee that was what a trail of tears started in the thirty seven\nSo he was he so he was one of the white man who racially cleansed the uh the\nThe southeast United States and then he married an Indian does that make sense this is from up right part by the way they also did they also did some research\nOr about some of her other ancestors in the in the old Indian Territory Oklahoma and uh I think her great grandfather\nWas a a was he was he was a sharp shooting you might say\nAnd according to a newspaper account from Nineteen hundred or Nineteen\nOh one I ...\nDrunken Choctaw Indian beat his son severely and uh the grandfather came upon the beating going on and a ... price tried to stop the Indian and the Indian jumped on a horse and was riding away and so a was with Warren's\nPaw paw paw I don't know if I don't know great great grandfather whatever\nPulled out his gun or his rifle I guess I was a rifle and he got and the Indian down was ... who the fleeing drunken Choctaw and they the story said the the Indian was in the hospital a local hospital in critical condition after he got shot by Elizabeth Warren so these are these are the these [laughter]\nThese are her her and says I'm not saying that you know that uh the shooting was unjustified you almost killed the uh the\nThe other the kid but still I mean now she's telling us She's a ... she was a victim of this terrible um racism\nIn uh in or her parents were a victim of the terrible racism and I again we've we've gone over this a million times but it's always knew their their new people that are listening and and watching\nNow ... one of her stories is that a is that her parents had to a low in the Nineteen thirties and Depression era era\nOklahoma because there was a such a endemic racism against Native Americans that and ah her her uh her paternal ancestors didn't want a their son\nHer father marrying and indeed\nAnd that that they had to is low to had a two to ah you know to have true love like Romeo and Juliet\nAnd somebody went back in twenty twelve and checked out the a clip the newspapers the old weekly newspapers in this town where they live\nIn rural Oklahoma and what really happened was that it was everybody was dirt poor gospel you know but the the uh the Joe what's the grapes of wrath et cetera everybody was broke\nThey had no money for a a honeymoon or anything like that so they just jumped in their car that to love birds and they drove to the nearest town went into the biggest Protestant Church that wouldn't church\nAnd uh got married and then they drove back to their own home town and had the reception that night now does that sound to you like in a low but\nNo of course not there was no low but it's just more more jive just like her her stories about growing up on the jagged or ragged depending on which adjective she wants to use edge of the middle class Jagger or ragged edge of the middle class\nBy your own account other account she had the family had three cars when she was a senior in high school in Nineteen sixty five three cars Nineteen sixty five\nNot too many families on the jacket a rag an edge of the middle class or anywhere else had three cars in the United states of America\nAte for four or five hundred forty to forty two um six one seven says Warren is more Native American then Sean King is African American that's not saying a lot though you know I don't think that's a a a good defense for a a for a fake Indian\nNevertheless nevertheless she is persisting and saying claiming but she's an Indian uh Bob your next with how we ... go ahead Bob\n[noise] paid Ali thanks for taking my call real quick I just wanted to bring out the\nThe identity politics of creating all us into different categories is just making war and a thought completely opposite of what we saw this last week with Kenya west where Warren is try and become a victim in her own mind\nA as trying to uh put yourself in a condition that she can't help\nWhereas Kanye West has the thought of individual isn't in trying to be more of a person that he wants to be\nUm and I think that I think all this identity politics these just the way and we all get back to the preamble saying we the people of the United states that we the Native Americans now we the Irish American so on and so forth\nWe need to maybe maybe war or not it take a look back at the at the a discussion with sharp and\nKanye West and it may be learned a few things from him I think is more common sense then oh\nWell she is she learned is that she could benefit from identity politics a even as long as she was willing to uh not tell the truth about her background then she's and she has benefited handsome really you know before she became a a Native American\nShe was a just an instructor at the University of Texas law school I mean not a bad law school but it's not the ivy league you know when she wasn't a tenured professor and you know as soon as she started checking that box she she started moving right up through the ranks\nWell money money is one thing that we could talk to a county was to Elizabeth Warren as she benefited but there is a daycare enemy about the all seeing lizards worrying a professor from art where versus a kid from the south in from Chicago yeah who is making out better today and their thought ... well\nI I agree I agree in the again the irony here is that uh this this story breaks about her uh her persistence in claiming to be a Native American despite the evidence to the contrary\nOn the same day that the trial starts in us district court of a of of Harvard University being accused of ah basically playing identity politics on the other missions\nAnd this is this is a really really important case that's being tried the Asian American groups have brought this suit against Harvard\nTo show that the Harvard has a different standards for different groups\nAnd again that's what that's what Elizabeth Warren's career is all about you know she she figured out a way to game the system\nAnd uh and and now she's caught and she wants to be president she somehow has the rig a lot of it so so she's using these uh a friendly fake fake media fake news outlets like the Boston Globe to to put forth this myth that she's actually proven that she's in India\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two pet your next with highway car go ahead Ted\nHey how are you doing [noise] good\nI've listened to your show for years I listen a outside radio news or let's just say we're probably going to disagree right off the bat but I can be respectful of you can\nBring on the ... go ahead come on what do you want to say\n\nAll right uh\nMail is ... you know we're talking about our heritage and that's that's not even\nAn issue right now I mean we didn't have so many other problems\nWhy why do you think you've got to make sure that everything\nIs going to solve problems for Americans right now no butter\nHeritage did solve a problem for her she wanted to be a good to be a tenured professor of law at Harvard University and so she checked the box and she became she became one even though she's a white woman\nRegardless of who she is whether she's Chinese Japanese ...\nHey that's eligible or ... according to her she is you know she could call ... village\n[laughter] yeah she got there there are any number of things that you could call it the you know in the ... at the ... a village yeah thanks thanks for the call Joe\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two ah Monica Showalter in American Thinker says are so Ken a white guy now who is who ... who was one one thousand twenty fourth\nBlack kid he claim a an an affirmative action slots at a at Harvard University for law school do do we know that Paul your next with how we car go ahead Paul\nHey I wanted to address the famous call the long before or is it like white bringing up say what\nWas it the people that brought it up she brought it up having to test that's number one right number two is the other thing is um the legitimacy of the test I mean okay so she performed the test now you really want to prove it to us so I can do is you get five samples\nSent it to the independent lab give us the results of the fight until we know what the results up I Can't get your Y DNA and say you're tested you know it's you can't fall if she didn't get the result ... one of the thing that ... ... you know you can address but I just said\nAbout uh the capital of the number one is I haven't really quite figure out why they wanted him to go first to one and number two\nIt was obvious calls ... ... how can you answer the question again\nI mean I think playing out I mean it wouldn't have made any difference you know\nAnd nobody actually already ... ... how can you deny something if you don't know what you're going to be charged with Paul I mean that's real basic stuff and this goes back to\nThe middle ages I mean even the ah you know people the nobles and the kings that had a had ultimate power and there was no bill of rights there was no constitution me even they agreed but you have to let the uh the the accuser speak first before the or before the the accused\nAddresses the charges I mean that's that's real basic stop thanks for the call Paul uh Steve your next with highway car go ahead Steve\nHow're you doing how we got\nSo here's my old thing it it it's pointless on even if she gets another attach it does it get another test because of the amount of DNA that Native American is miniscule\nSaid think that at least go back to the liberals are going to find a fight why it's native of energy and when she really more Native American in an average\nRight they don't see anything these people's mind they're going to call up like that and he's going to say shift the focus to something else because they don't want to address it now\nRight there what they're going to say this is settled science that she's proven that when I'd say it's settled science that she's proven she's not\nIn India isn't it\nYou know exactly exactly I took a DNA that then I Would point Darryl one percent Middle Eastern I don't go around saying I'm Arab now\n[laughter] no but the grace those thanks

and and I mean who told her that this was a good idea you know ... you know Elizabeth it you know once you once you have this past you know from from you know from some lab that you're not even going to name and it says you could be one one thousand twenty four percent\nPeruvian not even Indian per via\nThis has got to put everything to rest senator and on the oddly it didn't work out\nWhat do you think the moment was yesterday when she's slowly realized that this backfired on her like you think aids had to come in and bring her the news\nI think probably when they said you know you know Elizabeth a Senator Warren the you know the globe said it was won five hundred and twelve that it's actually one one thousand and twenty four\nAnd then I Wonder if she if she knows enough about math to say well if it's twice as much on the bottom and then it's really not one thirty second it's one sixty four\nSo do you think this so all my people who told me this do you think it's really going to impress people but I claimed to be a minority because I was because I claimed to be one sixty fourth Indian and oh by the way it's not really Indian it's Peruvian or Mexican\nBut that ... you get sweets like this from the Associated Press President Trump lashes out at Senator Warren over DNA test result she released indicating she as Native American heritage and he says her claims are a scam an ally despite her\nProof for proof for ...\nYeah again this is why no one believes the mainstream media outlets it's ridiculous\nI say\nWell the other frustrating thing is you didn't even get the

...\nWhat questions related to\nA ways to do that [noise] our local banks seemed to be low of course I don't understand why there's such a disparity in the local banks but then you also see online ads for much higher than that\nOr do you have any commentary on whether those are safe or where where to get CDs\n[noise] well I think if you are dealing with a brokerage firm a a like a vanguard or a facility or one of the larger brokerage firms you um you might be able to get them to get you a offerings on CDs have you tried that\nI have talked to them about it it it seems like a lot of trouble

I Believe that the vanguard charges thirty five ... points for their\nLittle [laughter] yeah well I'd say three percent that that's wrong it's it's it's I think is one by one point point point zero three percent yes yeah you're right\nOr something like ... thirty of let's let's say thirty to thirty five bases was so now what I Would do is ah I Would check with them to find out whether they can be helpful in locating bonds I Know they're commission structures very low and bonds\nAnd I just see what they can be helpful also you might wanna check with the brokerage ... or you might wanna check

they're they're so expensive and I do a um they knew what he stress tests with people who bring in these variable annuities to show you the fees that you're paying in the in in all of that and how where else you could do so much better\nAnd so I I Do that for people all the time no obligation so if you have one of these verbal annuities you know please come on and if you're a moderate moderate some of your money might ... you don't want to be in the market some of it might want to be safe\nSo yeah ... ... for you and if you're really aggressive well if you really aggressive you're probably a tolerable market fluctuations in a fixed annuities probably just not the ... because it's not going to give you a those super high returns that you're aspiring to the come along with the receipt your typical\nKim someone owning annuity and not know it\nCan somebody\nAnd nobody and not know what I think that happens are often really they won't ... ... right they um they're sold\nAn idea yeah but they they'll come in and see me in a review what they have and a lot of times they'll show me and say oh you have this this type of newly I didn't buy the newly and I said no you're right it's right here wow I Would never buy an annuity\nWow but the fact that they have and they just um didn't go over the details or you know with their advisor whoever offered it to them you know it wasn't a displayed in so uh ...\nThat's another reason you want to come see me because you may on something that you don't know anything about really and how it works and actually recently I've met a few people in that situation where there's no way they did know they had an annuity but they didn't know\nHow it operated yeah and uh they were very disappointing to hear on the variable annuity that we went over our already in the ... so yeah it is possible and I do see if people don't understand what is that they own\nInteresting back to our class does your income cover all your living expenses including medical\nWell it's going to be a yes or no answer right Ah yes that's great I mean to you probably have a pension and in a couple of with Social Security you're meeting your daily living expenses are and that's fantastic uh for most people out there the answer to that is no and therefore\nWe need to look to generate income and we just went over a great place to generate income a guaranteed income that you can't outlive is and I knew witty and so if the answer is no to that question than a new to definitely be a consideration for\nIt or just to remind our listeners if you would like to get in on this complementary no obligation personal retirement exposure review you can call Chris at five and eight to one seven Ninety three six eight ... eight to one Seventy nine three fate or go to Cape retirement radio dot com\nRight next question do you anticipate changes in your out of pocket medical expenses\nAgain a yes or no answer and uh you know let's say you have\nBasing it on your current situation you currently have your income in coverage of medical expenses but then you have you're out of pocket expenses stuff\nAnd beyond that uh ... such as a nursing home or type situation a dinner nudey oriented life insurance may be a good option for you to look at a if it's a\nUh nudey that maybe one additional income down the road you can send money aside so you can kind of give herself pay raises\nCollateral yeah like you would do upon letter or or if that uh is is uh some monies you just want to set aside and the eventual\nA option or or of you know the ... that you might have out of pocket expenses that are going to come up and you want to make sure that the money set aside for that is their case you need it and then again you wanted to serve it if you want a guaranteed so again if the answer is a [noise] um yes you probably like an annuity\nGotcha okay do you have an emergency fund for unexpected expenses and we know those pop up during retirement might need a new boiler system or air conditioned system as your mom had to had to deal with recently\nRights on the un nobody side or you know if you have an emergency fund that frees you up to than tie up money for a period of time whether it's two years five years ten years whatever it is and therefore\nUh annuity contracts with the most part are going to have these time frames where you tie it up yeah doesn't mean you don't have access to some of it but you don't necessarily have access to all of it and so a ... like\nAnytime I meet with anyone I Want to make sure they have money set aside for these unexpected expenses as you just mentioned and or if you do then we can start looking at where can we push other funds that you have to increase yield and annuities would be one to one of them if you don't have money\nAre set aside for these expenses you must do that to a you know get that liquidity issue out of the way before you look at any annuity\nOkay final question which statement best describes your investment goals\nWell a answer one would be looking for safety in principle protection annuity mhm\nLooking for a guaranteed income stream the new ...\nTo focus on growth of principle well\nIt could be ... or it could be\nA you know money management are being the markets are just depends on your risk tolerance\nOkay well that that gives us a lot of food for

annuity\n[noise] okay well\nLet's look at some of these reasons I mean you don't buy under new to you have a successful experience managing your own money\nSo the question is what how many people have that many people have that and in my experience over twenty five years now mhm aging myself [laughter]\nDon't end in over twenty five years now I find that uh you know\nVery few people are successful managing their own\nOwn money it's tough it's like a ... it is a fulltime job well our times or this happens and it's happened recently a quite a few times you know I ... I see people who are really successful businesspeople mhm they own their own business they make a lot of money\nAnd uh I met with so many not that long ago they ever for on Cain they're you know or for their self employed there ... all this stuff [noise] he's managing his own money but what does he managing actually you're managing his own business ... and so what I found was\nOver his contributions and it was four okay or less like four or five years or sitting cash\nWylie because he hasn't time to focus on that aspect of it mhm and he doesn't have any one like myself to oversee that\nAnd you might you might be listening out there and say all that will never happen to me I've seen this time and time again to people who don't even on their own business who just they have an orphan four O. one K. or they did our process to roll over and then never addressed it [laughter] and it's out of sight outta mind this has to be paid\nA attention to detail day in and day out three sixty five which is what I Do for my clients and then you get so my question you use um do you do that for yourself\nAt best people look at a monthly maybe yes man and a lot of times you know things fall through the cracks these mistakes these not the mistakes like that we're not invested in one of the best bull markets and in history this probably costs this gentleman\nA guy on them out probably in a couple of hundred thousand dollars and oh my gosh so that's a lot of money yeah and uh for a lot of people that I mean they can't afford them\nSick so again um they're not a lot of people who are good at it on their own\nUh the time or have the time to do a good at it do it\nIf you're an index type of nudity as an example uh you know maybe you are in cash or reason maybe your cash because your risk adverse well annuity is going to simply pay you a much better interest without taking a risk so we're not jeopardizing your risk tolerance at all or just increasing or ... ...\nIt's just simply that and no one can argue that you know more money's not better than\nYou know more money is better than more or less money ... I'll never fight around now never ever actually do but the more money is better I mean less or more money is better than less money all the time in my book that's that's my job [laughter] so if we can without you making any sacrifices at all just make a change\nChris the tone deaf tape retirement less advisors wants you to be informed and protected\nCall now for your free Cape retirement planning kit that included\nA document check placed an organizer\nFive big threats to your retirement and seven beneficiary mistakes\nGet your free tape retirement planning cat\nAnd then ... personal retirement exposure review\n... less advisors for your free Cape retirement planning ... here's the number five eight to one seven nine three six eight that five eight to one seven nine three six eight or just go to his website Cape retirement radio dot com\nWarning just a few moments of your time listening to this little town and I leave her in can lead to a happier and more sustainable retirement [noise]\nThis radio\nWelcome everybody to have retirement radio I'm aiming terrain here with with my time founder of Cape retirement wealth advisors\nAnd if you are joining us for the first time welcome we are glad to have you with us by waving production Chris provide services for retirement income planning management a Social Security Medicaid an estate planning and he offers that\nComplimentary no obligation personal retirement exposure review talk a little bit more about that a little later but in order to get any of this information it's really easy to do\nOr you can call Chris directly final eight to one seven nine three six eight that final eight to one seven nine three six eight or visited website Cape retirement radio dot com did I get all that crap Chris\nI think so I think that what you seem pretty ... [laughter] how are you you forgot to mention that I'm real easy to work with I mean why do you buy a lot of this\nOne in Marshfield when McCain rain depending on where you're listening what station ... across the country [laughter]\nUh yeah I've been getting a lot of calls recently and holding a ton of appointments been really busy yeah I don't know I think it just switch from summer to fall and now everybody is now looking you want to take care of this looking at it before they get into the holidays so my counters open\nAnd all the work late for you and or just give me a call and look to meet with the well\nOff and that sounds really really really good uh we have something very interesting that we're going to do on the show today correct\nYes we're going to a dive right into it\nTake to get a ridge is going to take a annuity a suit ability cause\nYou know our and knew what he's right for you because I got this question all the time we talk about annuities as an option for some of your money some of the time you know everyone that I mean there's different in annuities aren't necessarily suitable for everybody depending on their situations rank you know everybody has a clean slate where they come in and then we build\nYour meat you know based on your knees we build a retirement plan but I people ask me all the time you know the coming to call me when they go well I Want to buy their duty or I Want to have an annuity also okay well let's back off year let's talk about why\nAnd and what do you want to ... exactly what has much to talk about what that is so I'll have you asked a question about and you go over the answers and we'll discuss it cool\nOkay so our first question in our annuity suit ability quiz we like saying that uh nudey ability um I didn't think you're going to be able I didn't think I was going to be able to said either I had two cups of coffee though so I'm moving uh what are your investment objectives\nThe answer we had our uh income growth safety of your principal ... in a you know passing your assets or to your beneficiaries now so\nCan you only have one of these or two of these are all of them but to your question let me just go over I'm sure if you're interested in generate income there's a lot of ways to do it but I knew what he is one of the best things to use to generate income okay\nOr certainly with the the bonds away or they are today the low interest rates annuities or you know are in first place with respect to generating income in a lot of times depending on how you set up its income you cannot outlive much like your Social Security or if you have a pension and so people really liked that so if you are interested in generating income it's a consideration for\nGrowth so uh if you're interested in girls everyone is pretty much ... in some kind of growth rate and are there are new things out there that allow you to grow your money and uh so if you're looking for growth but you're conservative\nAnd I knew what he was a good option for you because again it'll give you a potential are much better rates than the other low risk investments out there like bonds and CDs and those things so it offers you a better ... greater potential for for for a return therefore more growth but not\nA you're not a getting away from your risk tolerance is which is if you're a little low risk person ... you know and you still have to grow up you can have the best of both worlds in annuity fits in that that the situation so if your principal well safety a principal\nThey're different types of annuities generally what we talk about on the air is fixed they knew what he's right fixed index annuities right when you hear that word fixed you can't lose money right All right so when you hear the word variable which I don't talk fondly of now if you lose ... um you can lose money so we talk about safety a principal we're talking about fixed\nAnd that's what I introduced to my clients when that's when ... yeah\nAnd uh your your your principal is guaranteed wonderful which is great for a lot of people I've had people come and just recently in the ... of course I don't want to lose any money and also you know ... ... I agree with you know you know nobody really wild eagle any money to them but so ... so for somebody who's really\nDoesn't can't stomach any market or you know fluctuation out in that type of thing\nWith ah whatever portion of money we're talking about here is a good opportunity for you to protect your principal and give you growth and potentially give you an income depending on how you want to set it up wow that sounds really in the last one past year better fishery a lot of people will want to set aside some money and make sure that their money available for the better fisheries these are a great way to do that\nOr you listen as your your\nYou know you know primary um beneficiaries on these contracts if it's a non qualified account moneys that go in will grow in a tax deferred basis so this money you're setting aside\nFor your heirs you're not going to get a tax on as it grows ... ... tax deferred already are but again I'm people do it all the time they'll say well you know I have a million dollars on I'm sure they get a half a million and I was set that aside for that but you can put it in a product like this you know they're gonna minimum at least get\nA half a million because I Would just went over your principles protected yeah but\nI also mentioned grow up you have growth there as well and so as you of growth overtime that data ... will grow and grow and grow and then if you know if the trial you pass away whatever's left will be distributed equally amongst airs as you've put on your beneficial designation for\nWow so much so much to no good thing we're taking this class um our second question actually reflects a lot of what you just talked about describe your risk tolerance\nWell restaurant tolerance as funny as a that's one of those things is a moving target it's really hard to nail somebody exactly ... and uh but for the uh I get more in depth with people want to talk about risk tolerance and when I meet with them but for the for the show which is going to keep it simple okay or a conservative or you know modern or aggressive\nReally simple you're ... you're one of the three and generally speaking if you're a conservative in pasture we just went over this and you are looking for safety\nThey knew what he is a great thing yeah fixed annuity again our fingers index annuities knock variable went to differentiate too if you're a conservative and you own a variable annuity you must come see me\nMatter of fact if you own a variable annuity it all you must come see me because I'm going to show you a much better cheaper way\nYes you can get the goals and objectives you want to do in other areas are waging in that review correct right 'cause there's there are so expensive and I do a um a newly stress tests with people who bring in these verbal annuities to show you the fees that you're paying in the in in all of that and how\nWhere else you can do so much better\nAnd so I I Do that for people all the time no obligation so we have one of these verbal annuities you know please come on and if you're a moderate moderate some of your money might ... you know want to be in the market some of it might want to be safe\nSo yeah ... ... for you and if you're really aggressive well if you really aggressive you're probably a tolerable market fluctuations in a fixed annuities probably just not the ... because it's not going to give you a those super high returns that you're aspiring to that come along with the receipt your typical\nCan someone owning annuity and not know it\nCan somebody owning and nobody and not know it I think that happens are often really they won't ... right they um they're sold\nAn idea yeah but they they'll come in and see me in a review what they have and a lot of times they'll show me I'll say oh you have this this type and really I didn't buy a new witty and so now you're right it's right here wow I Would never buy an annuity\nWow but the fact that they have and they just um didn't go over the details or you know with their advisor whoever offered it to them yes and it wasn't a displayed\nIn so uh ... that's another reason you want to come see me because you may on something that you don't know anything about really and how it works and actually recently I've I've met a few people in that situation where there's a ... they did know they had annuity but they didn't know\nHow it operated yeah and uh they were very disappointed to hear on the variable annuity that we went over our to operate in the ... so yeah it is possible and I do see if people don't understand what is that they own interesting back\nUm if you want ... take a look at what you have and how you can have a better plan in ... in a stronger plan\nAll you have to do is call him for a complementary no obligation personal retirement exposure review file eight to one seven three six eight\nFive eight to one seven three six eight or you can just got away sweat type tape retirement radio dot com\nI Want to go back to that one just for one second you know\nThe reason people aren't reading that goal inject is is because we're living longer\nYeah you're right you know we just are living longer live ... years in retirement now it was ... it used to be about ten to Fifteen Years now that we're looking at like twenty five thirty years I have clients in their nineties now or in in\nYou know you've got to look at it that way a married couple who are sixty five you know one of you has a really good chance to live into your nineties\nAnd so you need to plan for that in\nYears ago they they didn't do that and so that that is why people feel and so we didn't we didn't we need to protect against that longevity may have in your family or in your future is actually isn't necessarily genetic mhm mhm\nYou don't know um okay so our next don't lie in a new lady ... after your gas your spouse is capable of managing the remaining are fat and not need a continuation of the income you are receiving boy\nThat doesn't sound like most people ... usually are one\nOf the if you're a married couple one of your managers the funds right okay and if I'm\nYou know if if if that person were to pass away having an annuity with income coming in\nOr to protect the surviving spouse I think that's a swell idea oh yeah\nI I've gone over this with my personal experience with my mom yeah and I've seen it time and time again with other clients when somebody passes away and certainly they are the than the manager of the financial burden the first thing that happens with the surviving spouse is air their first concern is\nHighly doing financial yeah you know you you wouldn't think that but they're looking for security right you know the you know they're looking for security and that is one thing that comes to mind and they ended up not being able to grieve until they had that they have their questions answered mhm\nAnd it's a really big deal so if you had a in this and this happens all the time I Will I'll have a spouse they'll come to me and say I want to set aside a half million dollars so that if I die income will come to my\nMy my my surviving spouse yeah for the rest of their lives and so that they don't have to worry about anything and I think that's the extremely thoughtful because\nAgain the one thing they don't want to have to deal with his finances right after you know somebody passes away level passed away so I think it's great to consider for a situation like that\nYeah especially if that that that's a spouse that passes away if they had one of those um pensions that doesn't have doesn't go to the\nSurviving spouse you know you take a larger distribution during that person's lifetime but once they die they pension goes away so that could be a big chunk of the retirement income that they're they factored in if that person dies it's no longer", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "21"}
