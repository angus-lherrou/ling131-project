Mendez on a carry on state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal\nGuilt or when the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things I in some very very unsavory rumors were built around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nBut having to pour millions of dollars that they'd like to go somewhere else more

of\nMenendez or they just stay home that many actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure it out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nUh how these things are involving right now because they're they're very ... very much in the air and there are I think ... no no for the rest of us should assume\nThat this was over or you can stay home and then they feel about run out one voted for him if he ended up not having to buy election they do not do anything else go day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics and they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are\nSafe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or work with the Republicans have in the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again as a pretty frightening thought\nWhere do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally ah I I my personal range is returning the bottom of about two oh one between policy where speaker and hiring them around to twenty to thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up his speaking [noise] um\nAnd I can't have them in all honesty you know I've always been candid about these things I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nYeah I Can't either when I really can't I mean and I think now and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that the answer you blow see what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back\nA sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nNot anyone who does not bode has effectively voted for Nancy Pelosi the speaker no one should kids themselves if you do not want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd hard to have to house and people like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services committee which was just saying the phrase it tells you how crazy their party is how how could you then again she was smart lady she's not somebody I Want to have watching over banks in our financial services\nUm until you go down to less than you think of\nAnybody who says I'm tired of it all he don't like them or is it senator or I'm not going to not voting\nIs in effect a half vote for Nancy closer to be speaking [noise] um I think that's\nGood yeah I don't have to tell them that there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home or you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for ... the the same in the Senate races\nYou know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you vote for\nReticent in Tennessee you're you're voting for humor and I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote that's who they are going to vote to be their leader\nMuch I just tell everybody and he wanted to some of the claims or a moderate Democrat asked for the poor for a leader can I say I'm a moderate Democrat in the house of of course and went on for ... you know I sort of have to do that fine\nDefeat them there are a level if they said you owe I'm really kind of a moderate Democrats you know I got to vote for ... defeat them who's killing health care\nAnd I think uh we have every evidence that this is a team sport 'cause the radical end of the Democratic party's in control of their quality that their leadership or is just utterly unacceptable and that I think we have an obligation to a\nHuman to feed them and the waiter to treat them as to

countdown is on the midterms just six days away and President Trump's back on the campaign trail rallying voters in Fort Myers Florida\nAnd the only way that she's going to get that capital back history a California it in orange county and in my district it was the first time in eighty years since FDR ran for president ... we had a Democrat nominee for private where\nOrange County and found that Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they had the ... year old in\nWell this is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think of California raised as being that important but\nNow it's become crucial in terms of you know we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com\nUm that they're really focused in and which means it could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four safe democratic seats a hundred Ninety nine safe Republican seats\nAnd all these thirty some odd toss ups are are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all this money\nUm can money ... exactly\nSo tell us about you know what are the issues there do you think\nIn your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest employment in forty nine years that's you know in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we are really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living a America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era too where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes where you had government in your life\nAnd I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district\nWe have over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... the return over the Democrats so we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the house it's just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power they have forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS eat\n'em and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job for the people ... and you're\nA state and in your district but the you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment or to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out vote so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now and the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we've got to turn the state around you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that come out of Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that uh it is getting more and more at four to ... to live in the state and we need to have it\nGet to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOne of the ... you will ever happen swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations on high taxation of states like California and New York\nIllinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave the liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it I mean it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your dues that unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nWe may start to see that money go out of the hands of the ... the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future and the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California\nYou know have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions or California Democrats than in tight races and one other article came out and said literally spending ... million dollars just on
