wins and that is the one seat that seems safe or red state Democrats the only one at this point\nI think that's right I think and and it really even Asian if you watch the ... even when he voted for governor the numbers narrow the race was closer today than it was a week ago because I think what's happened is people hooked up suddenly realized what a team sport dishes\nThat you got two teams and and there's a really simple question forever so called moderate and I'd say this I Would also says to mention is he going it was really going to vote for humor\nAffairs question everybody needs to be

I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you got a notice this week you noticed the market went down its ... up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations that business is what the economy and they would want to raise taxes again and that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash\nOf about the whole having a hearing it how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down right and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nWe have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nDo you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your closer to raise taxes take what you got to take away the jobs to take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had polls in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfair will among all voters she has a she has the fifty three\nPercent unfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country so these house races you're talking about\nMost of the ones in play a Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's agenda they started selling off\nI mean to be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to admit is looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice they won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear averages gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively in that direction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they're really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of New York I have\nNoticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo does anyone want me in the state did you know that\nI Know but if I got\nI got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat that problem is not me at the end it themselves or are they really\nMade it that are that are conservative you notice that it's not\nIt's simple no one has tons within a wife oh no need\nUh um right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nI'm Sorry but there's no places for me in the state of New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything you love and vote for one's me out of town\nSo am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice you have it like to run for it I think my friend John and I can\nI ... well you disabuse our friend Doug I'm very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kit for Franklin square you're still you're still am with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join ... New York that's our biggest export is is the people and taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way it does hold an ad on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\nRent I heard it oh yeah yes I I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him because he's moving so far left\nChat it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we're basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be governed have control of their own healthcare\nBut but if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\nIs it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you do\nI Want democratic candidate at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal races absolutely going to should go period\nStyle absolutely and and does point about in previous times are good on the radio as you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again what's the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time\nWhat should it be should be better stop Nancy Pelosi from getting\nOh I think it's got to be harder than that I I think look if you if you like the success of the last two years\nIf you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you if you believe in secure borders if you believe in energy independence if you believe in health care plan the free independent market healthcare plan\nThat actually would work for the American people like the concierge care for blue collar workers that we talk about all the time with our buddy Dr Josh over all of those messages eyes and constitutional originalists on the fourth I think those are all winning issues\nPresident Trump and congressman Kevin McCarthy are working together to keep the Republican majority in Congress to gather we must protect the house that is giving you back your money with historic tax\nYour jobs was drunk or trade deals and your security with tough border enforcement the Republican Congress just taking power and money from Washington and giving it back to you but Democrats think your money belongs to government the ones who raised taxes protects criminals was things were cities\nAnd reverse the twenty sixteen election with impeachment\nThat's the Democratic agenda and the only way to keep the the Democrats from reading your taxes is to do your part vote for Republican Congress on Tuesday November ...

canine handler job only bring of rain on that and no man [noise]\nAll broken hard\nA day I've been feeling alone\nHow ... they\nThey made\nThe only\nTo answer that lately I mean think about it you've had so much stress in more in your life as in the working world and now that you finally transitioned into retirement you know you want to make sure that you're staying on the right track and you can have bumps in the really unexpected expenses taking care of your parents and\nThose type of things but and that's why finding for retirement is a process it's not just a endgame right and there's always going to be just to make and you go to Steve and say Hey Steve didn't know this but I have to buy a new car my car blows up on the side of the road or guys I'm Out and trying to help my parents get into an assisted living and I'm going to help pay for that so I Need to kind of adjust some funds\nThese things happen every single day I Would venture to think that there's probably not a scenario that seed hasn't heard again with over Thirty years of experience he sat across from lots of different people lots of different walks of life and he can help you and he's a retirement income specialists and I tell you in just a few moments\nHow you'll be able to sit down with Steve one on one and we talk a lot about having that stress free retirement right that worry free retirement with that added sleep insurance well one way to do that is where this zero is your hero talk to me allows misty\nZero zero I talk about that in my book a little bit but what I mean by that is again I'd been around a while and I love the show these illustrations overtime because\nPeople are just laser focused in on what happened after the crash and they just they live a short memory right at the market's done so well it's been chugging along so well that they just forgot about what happened in the past and that's a dangerous that's very dangerous because\nWhen that market does you know adjusted by the way you just think about by low sell high right we all know these little clever terms right now and the market is is or was that at all time high it's kind of going up and down these past few months but\nUm you know if you just look at the old adage by low and so Hi this is probably the smart time to get out of things right but yet people are just\nVery gung ho and they get into it and that's fine and I've done well to listen I'm not complaining but I'm also positioning my money to make sure that if something happens you know we need we need to learn from my past so what ... is one of the market goes down negative negative twenty negative thirty negative forty\nZero is a great return\nIt's just super return one hundred percent agree my gosh and and just think of the road to recovery when your money is at five hundred thousand you earn zero versus negative thirty right wow your road to recovery starts at five hundred when you lose arrow OK\nSo think about two thousand and eight if you had five hundred thousand in you lost ... K instead of scarring to recover for four or five years to get back to where you were and then making money can you imagine being at five hundred and overweight and going up which the s impeded\nClose to three hundred percent since that crash so can you imagine your portfolio with a three hundred percent gain instead of maybe [noise]\nYou know maybe a hundred and fifty are you know you know ... percent game which is still good by the way but not what it would have been because when you lose thirty you need to earn forty three percent just about forty three percent just to get even and that's without fees\nAnd by the way fees hurt you\nGoing up and they hurt you going down there is no help on the these when you're when the market's up twenty and you have one percent the Europe Nineteen right mhm [noise] well the markets down thirty one percent the year down thirty one\nGotcha so no matter how you do it these have an impact on that so\nWhat if you could again protection money earned that zero when it's negative and have no fees in the process think about what that does to your wealth thinking about what it does to your\nPeace of mind to think about what it does to your income your stability of your income when you could still poll from that portfolio at a higher amount and that is why zero can be your hero\nAnd it's a beautiful return in a negative environment so uh\nWe got some pieces on that too and and we talk about it in the book so you know I just want to leave it with um it's really important uh to not so much it and you've heard this you may have heard this quote before I Am not so concerned with the return\nOn my money as I Am with the return of my money\nAnd never is that more important than when you retire protect your principal a it's Warren Buffett rule number one right protect your principal don't lose principle so with that said ah let's reach out again to the audience and offer them the opportunity to get a copy of my book\nTeam members are standing by right now to take your phone call five zero late for for for eight zero zero three again for the first caller's five zero late\nFor for for eight zero zero three and make sure you check out the website family financial dot net get more details on those events coming up October six teens and the twenty third you've been listening to what he sat retire radio with Steve and Sonia family financial we're here each and every Saturday evening at six o'clock on WXXI ...

I'm just saying there's a lot of weird weird leap going on by the way many ... from signing a\nBit of trouble back your well I think the the thing that was crazy to me was all of the never Trump or is in the in the moon bats trying to find some like proximity reason why she left like oh you didn't like the way he talked about Brett Kavanaugh last night didn't like the earth she didn't like the confirmation hearings or she disagrees with the trade policy or there's something that she disagrees with\nWhen according to reports they've been talking about this for months now and it's just now become announced right\nI I Know it's a ... yeah this is I mean again they're they're just fantasizing\nI mean it is a little odd though then it comes before midterms what'd you typically expect something like this to be announced after Mitt terms like unless there's some other you know act in the play\nIt's like a it's like Rosenstein wasn't fired yesterday you know because the midterms are coming up and they don't want any distractions of of you know although you know they're all these rumors going around that there's big announcements coming down with the president is supposed to have an announcement tonight right some kind of big announcement\nI Hope it's a I Hope he's talking about releasing the uh the unwritten pact that uh Feisal applications and everything else I mean I Know um\nThat's what this thing but yeah so it's something that the VIPs are here to there they're hoping for that as well I just I Want to get this stuff out I I'm just I'm just still appalled by this whole thing and you know a lot of people are so there's one that's another ... conspiracy theory that's going around is that uh is the Trump\nTook Rosenstein or excuse me his new name as redacted Stein though it took a deputy attorney general\nRod redacted Stein down to where land though with him so that he could like you know just have them in one place on the air force one and just tell them look\nYou know I I could blow all you guys are you at all I have\nTo do is sign one quarter ... uh you know releasing all these forms and you're all I don't know if you're going to prison but you're all going to be totally humiliated totally disgraced even even in the uh it in the ... media they'll they they have to be shocked by these multiple violations of every bodies civil rights\nAnd so I'm going to just uh I'm I'm going to keep you guys at the arms length and I got this hanging over your head and I'm not going to do anything right now now I have been a ... here here's my conspiracy\nTheory oh boy he took him on the air force one because as he was concerned after the election that Trump Tower was bugs or not but but surveilled because in fact it was\nI think how about this he he brought Rosenstein on the air force one because he knew air force one wasn't bug\nOr surveilled the skiff yeah yeah and also it also was Rosen was were back then Stein was he ... he was he was he frisked\nBefore he went on I mean again I mean Trump does want to bring stop and frisk back to Chicago so why not bring it back to the air force one I think he needed war there I think you need more with dealing with redacted Stein than you do or you know in the loop\nYou know I mean he ... he's on the record we have the fact that he said he claims it was a joke but he's never denied that he that he said to some of the other rock corrupt or hacks in the FBI and the de OJ that he would be willing to wear a wire against the president of the United states\nIsn't that isn't that something this guy is\nThe deputy attorney general and you still have to keep him around after ... we really are in uncharted waters here as far as the United states of America goes I mean right now\nYou know were riding the tiger and it's it's it's working out for us but this is dangerous you know when you when you have slime like redacted Stein and everybody in the mainstream media and every elder dams on the Senate Judiciary committee this\nIs a really really something to meanwhile is a is a six one seven points out a CNN has run another story on the presidential uh Jetta Talia today they so they're back to Stormy Daniels does this mean that a Michael Evan Eddie is going to be rehabilitated\n\nOr they this desperate that they have to bring by Michael ... you know they've spent the last forty eight hours blaming him for the fact that they weren't able to succeed in uh in burning\nBrett Kavanaugh at the stake to be fair I think Michael have and then he could get better ratings and Don Lemon\n[laughter] than much yeah I mean none of them I I mean they're all they're all terrible though there are terrible I someone says give Elizabeth Warren the ambassador ship to the un\nI who who wouldn't want to I mean I guess I guess some people have made something of it that wasn't Daniel Patrick Moynihan the ambassador to the un I mean he made something out of and he got elected to the Senate it is technically a cabinet level position yeah the key word is technically you know it's\n[noise]\nI just uh I I mean if it's no ... ag secretary but it's in there\nYeah I I don't know a a five oh wait I Want Trump to kick Pence off the ticket it run Haley as BP at twenty twenty\nNow you never get ... you to get kicked off the ticket as BP you've you've got to be something not like Henry Wallace had forty four where you have to be on the verge of indictment like LBJ and sixty three and that's you know that's\nThere's a good chance he was going to be thrown off the off the ticket at sixty four but something else happened\nA four four or five hundred forty to forty two so these these are just some of the uh the these are just some of the theories where whereabouts around here

I told you yesterday she she lost me nuts you ever had me when she started going out with corner Kennedy\nShe wrote a song about the ... of these uh dopey sought who got the got arrested a few a few months later\nThe ever hear the song about the Kennedy said she wrote ... like ... or ...\nI had like\nA bridge over troubled water\nAs hot it I like Taylor stuff she does a lot of charity work she goes to a lot of children's hospitals in these little kids I mean she definitely gives back a lot but I just don't think that's I mean for me it doesn't make me like her more\nWell there's like a running joke in in social media about oh has Taylor Swift commented on net neutrality as she commented on the cabinet nominations and this is the thing that she's going to come and I know and nobody in the Senate race why but there's a very long on with\nMarsha Blackburn in the recording industry because she's got a lot of money from Nashville and she she represents Nashville's interest in like the recording artist interests\nAnd she ... she was going to be something going on to your point Steve that's a very interesting theory because she's just coming up on the end of a contract with the company that she's been with and she was like fourteen years old and she deciding on nuance so maybe there's something like ...\n... ... how does she stay among the\nCleveland Browns because you know the governor of Tennessee's brother as well so the Cleveland Browns\nI think she supported by the air frigid she does she go out with the new rookie quarterback Baker may feel I don't know maybe it's a rural trying to start\nYeah on and so that's my celebrity actually I have one more member James Gunn\nRemember Peter gun ... he was the producer of the guardians of the galaxy who wildly successful ... he's a he's a he was making the ... are going to get the get go yeah it was making pedophilia joke\nWell and remember for a brief moment he was like a ... yes are literally for forty seconds and then they were like we actually these jokes\nI Need to really look at all but they took him off the latest crappy movie guardians of the galaxy is not a crappy movie okay it's a crappy series no we're really good movies you've never even seen him for your ... to judge against the U.S so loud enough feels good to be back rice yeah\nWas seen as like oh go ahead with the galaxy movies they are if you\nHad that either of you guys have seen them do you guys are like divorced from American culture\nThat is not American culture American culture is like football the American flag Abraham Lincoln apple pie\nIt does give me a brew it's not like Chabrel a light saber or an indelible part of American culture in American history\nWell my point is genes gotten is in talks right suicide squad too and he may also dragon legitimately awful movie but I'm just saying he's back in you know he's like working again they signed petitions to get them back on guardians the galaxy or whatever so\nI'm Glad to be back at work making crappy movies is my life you know when I was going to do you think there's going to be a a anti enter a movie in the future\nOh probably um and also lastly before I Move on from celebrities busy Phillips claims James Franco assaulted her on a set of freaks and geeks way back when\nFreaks and geeks there's like a show in the nineties and that's kind of where a lot of people actually got their start on English learning molesting people Seth Rogen James Franco and Judd Apatow was in that or he directed it or something I don't know but he was like I was\nWhere these guys freaks or where they\nYou know I think there are a little bit of both but the funny thing about this as you read the headline you assume it's ... but it's not she's saying that he he pushed her down onto the ground like just like bullied her like old school like its playgrounds right like grabbed her by the shoulders and just threw it out on the ground\nSo this this woman's definitely above
