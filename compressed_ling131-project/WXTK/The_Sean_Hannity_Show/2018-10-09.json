I mean in other words I talk about every election Republicans a racist or sexist massage Ines\nHomophobic Xena phobic Islamophobia they weren't dirty air water and they want to kill granny I enrolled her over a cliff and they want to kill children well now with you know hold hangers being sent in and they're it's it's just the same tactics as those\nTactics I think are backfiring on the Democrats and all of the activists in protesters and and these special interest groups the polling data Sean is very revealing there was some apathy among Republicans as is often the case in a midterm election\nAnd suddenly that changed and transformed GOP voters into energized and motivated voters to get out on\nElection day next month because they see what is going to happen if they lose the house and the Senate because Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Adler who would then become\nA chairman of the Judiciary Committee if Democrats win the house are vowing to a ... exact ... van ... a retribution\nInvestigation to remove calving off those from the Supreme Court by virtue of articles of impeachment and and there's nothing that will motivate of Republican voters more\nThan that kind of what to undermine the Democratic process of confirmation and to try to stabilize the Supreme Court for partisan reasons\nWell going to be interesting to watch do you think politically John you watch a lot of campaigns is they're going to be as big as the American people gonna be motivated in twenty nine days and are they going to remember this\nWell I Can't read the tea leaves\nBut what we just saw with the confirmation battle actually was a an example of our separation of powers in action where each branch exercise it's appropriate role and now in our democracy the people are going to decide and you know they're going to be irresponsible lawyers who are going to come\nGo on T.

three cases how would you handle them thirty six years later in each case no corroboration in each case\nUh well uh with I don't know anything beyond what's in the public record but without

location\nShe can't remember an exact date or a place not he's struggling to know the year and the case of miss Ramirez she's calling other fellow students from back in the day she's asking them if they remember because she's not sure she remembers\nA in the case of Julie sweat neck who who made the you know change her well Brett Kavanaugh gave out red solo cups and he was near the punch bowl and I saw him in a hall maybe not lined up in a hall\nUm which is very different from the these sworn affidavit that they had originally laid out a week before I mean you ... if you look at that but in the prosecutor's office what are they going to say\nWell are they going to say these are all frivolous accusations but uh as far as we know regarding doctor for\nThat one nine or ten witnesses interviewed and people are going to say well there were so many more who didn't weren't interview it's not the number of interviews it's the what they have to say and if it's all cumulative you don't if you don't count the witnesses and but I think\nSome of those other people as I say now I'm going to want to have their twenty four hours in the sun or you know in the in the same and they're going to want to go to the national Enquirer or something like that\nBut there are no criminal there no criminal cases are no civil case is a good man was confirmed he's now a justice and we need to move on\nLet's talk about the news that we are pretty confident as coming out this week um let me just say this very up to ... if\nI can that if a top ranking FBI official word a confirmed that there was an orchestrated effort among the upper echelon within the the OJ and the FBI to go\nAfter Donald Trump or retribution for the firing of James told me what would that mean Greg Garrett\nIt would mean that this was all a hoax the Russia hopes and it wasn't Trump Russia collusion\nAnd that would mean Greg Garrett was right from the get go but yeah I\n... and and yes and the latest information only corroborate the thesis of the book there there wasn't Trump Russia collusion but there was Hillary Clinton Russia\nCollusion she had on her payroll British spy or who is using Russian sources and now we've learned a through the interview behind closed doors of James Baker the top uh FBI lawyer\nThey documents were being passed him from Hillary Clinton lawyer and the ... lawyer\nA shoe in this is astonishing information uh and in fact we've also learned that you know this was part of the vice a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign none of it\nWas corroborated a federal regulations are very clear you may not submit the Fisk\nInformation and evidence that is on corroborated in yet that is precisely what they did and so I agree with you when these documents are classified and the inspector general has a has had enough time to look at them and decide I think they will be explosive\nIs there any way that Rod Rosenstein who signed the fourth buys a warrant we know the bases the bulk of the information in the ... the application John was the\nUnverified are uncorroborated\nDot CA the political document that Hillary paid for I\nMean how is it possible that they passed for those and I mean that was and he has to be held accountable for that\nWell let's wait and see when the documents that declassified but the answer to your question is of course\nUh we talk about the president does not above the law and he's not but certainly knew there was the deputy attorney general but ah I see one thing a little bit differently and maybe we're going to segue into this and that is everything you're talking about should be thoroughly investigated\nBut I think it's separate from what the more people are doing and I think that the Mueller investigation can conclude by showing independently that the president was just not involved in any wrongdoing\nAnd it doesn't have to be one of the ... not necessarily linked\nThey would he have an obligation to this is what frustrates me I think that

Court justice Brett Kavanaugh says he takes the office with gratitude and no bitterness\nAnd those are the conversations between Bruce or and Christopher Steele and we now know Christopher Steele was bundling information trying to get it to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann and Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker Im south anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago with this is about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some document we've gotten a lot of documents and access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from but some key key documents including the so called McCain memos which could very directly bear upon this question of\nA war with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel and are these allegations that are in the New York times actually prove a I think that can be a a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we'd been requesting for quite some time are made public\nSo as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or to say this week\nWe aren't going to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peter Struck personnel file some of the struck page a tax ah\nThe um the the Bruce or three of one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back all the man that than the middle of all of this\nAnd I said you know what the news is tomorrow view getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere ... there we have people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan in a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president I'm hearing a lot of\nBig hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is going to be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you\nUm you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work\nBrought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligence CIA up guys absolutely and other intel community people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trust that you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any\nInternational relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted there was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love\nNo but I again I'm happy to share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah but what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hostile regime\nAt and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that who does have a network of of their own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talk about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead\nAt the DNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington\nWho we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter at that I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd listen first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I ... I first started getting phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ...\nThat they had the spies a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report or I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't ... I think\nFirst ran with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there's a Pfizer Warren on the Trump\nCampaign or were you aware of our reporting at\nThe time ... it's funny Sean writes a interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know and these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but there\nAgain because it's all about you know media perception\nWhat were they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've never been charged with

to how we are in Cape Cod local news authority WICK west you are much Cape Cod and I argue radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK\nIt is there one and only play book and we have chronicled this now for years on this program but the stakes couldn't be higher for weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house\nAnd committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York I born Jew over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better\nOr they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare\nShort of that what else do they stand for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot are new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago is America's stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago\nIs the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts while he's kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation these kept his promise on building the wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a bolt bill today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall we now record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years the last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for Asian Americans also record low for a veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nPresidents kept his promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea the sanctions in Iran are now paying off\nWe see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he was select from any selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd then twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nNancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts of working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either you know we've learned a lot\nIn the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nYou know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage have all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally ... do\nAn election of the president first we know that just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice once she deleted some painted emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it\nThat's obstruction but of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company\nAnd told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in may\nTwenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing and then all of a sudden they interview heard Peter ... one of the interviewers\nMan that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet an issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James cone may\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney remember the company Perkins Kuwait that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait\nWhich is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group\nThat they went out and hire the former am I six agent or the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and an inter August ... and Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI who is now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or or stepped aside\nAnd anyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the material\n... again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's done in terms of what it reveals since uh directly contradicts Justice Department an FBI official sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath\nAnd Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election\nIn other words he was a cut out it was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in effect\nYou know its application then for the price of warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that even the guy to put it together doesn't stand by but anyway the ... the application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nThe bigger bombshell to come out of again we were busy last week with the cabinet issue but the bigger bomb that come out of the testimony of James Baker memories the top legal counsel at the FBI\nHas to do with the issue that we discussed three weeks ago which was Rod Rosenstein saying that he wanted a surreptitiously record Donald Trump and maybe we can get some cabinet officials in both the twenty Fifth Amendment anyway it turns out\nThat not long after that twenty Seventeen meeting where Rod Rosenstein reportedly discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with President Trump remember this was this was chronicle by both\nThe deputy director Andrew McCabe in and his lawyer Lisa Page That's Peter strokes boyfriend they went into the office of a third FBI official a girlfriend rather sorry\nLisa Page was it was she was his boyfriend\nHe was her\nShe was his girlfriend alright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third FBI official general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump\nAfter Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you\nKnow that's not how top FBI officials took it\nThe thing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source close to the investigation of of bakers house interview\nHe was conveying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously because he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one statement says they got along you know fine but\nNo Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving this thing [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nRain in the swamp politician at a time this is Sean Hannity show\nBy twenty five other top of the hour scary hurricane season continues in hurricane Michael now is headed straight to the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit land that a category three a and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined\nFort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings of all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of started the official weather man of the Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I say I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City or that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf\nBut a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the of sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal immobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain but once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially at that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember Florence was off its peak when it hits in North Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a at least that strong category three perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean to look to the average person including me\nHas no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much what is the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into powder in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency\nIt's maps came out and said look out October fifth through about the nineteenth and the Atlantic face it you notice all the tycoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely\nAnd say well what does that have to do with us well when the action stops there like it did last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to happen or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and once we got so last Thursday and friday you know it's been shown knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto\nWe hit it off to the east over there with sports this is going right in between and instead of coming western North West setting it's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nA lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain\nComing Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between K Patterson Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it\nBut it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe ... hurricane force along the outer banks and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia\nUh Augusta places like that as it moves lupus going accelerates we're there we're we're looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is
