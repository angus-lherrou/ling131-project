{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "Are they so well you know hopefully they didn't make a choice like that with their pain I I work with a pension elections ... week in week out with everybody in the area who who has a question looking to retire that's part of the things that we talk about but uh in addition to pension you also lose part of your Social Security\nSo that's another income last I mean right you know if my wife and I have Social Security and I'm getting\nTo her in a month and she's getting one thousand a month and I passed away she gets my two thousand but she loses her thousand so ineffectual or incomes have gone down a third yeah and then you couple that with a mistake like a pension election that you just mentioned that really hurts\nDefinitely and plus you would see Chris [laughter] hey look really ... okay so what is the moral of this annuity story\nWhat is the moral of the story there just you know for me it's an arrow in my quiver they're extremely valuable tool ... there are so many pros for them in certain situations they're also cons and so you got to weigh them out I go over in detail\n... minute detail with every one of my clients ... dental exactly what they're getting involved with it whether they are they can consider annuity is a good option for them\nBecause at the end of the day like for example we talked about earlier people own ingenuity that they don't know it or if you want a new threw me you'll know your own inner nudity and you'll be able to tell your your friends all about it because you will be educated you will you and you're going to know why you own\nA house that's in your portfolio and how it's going to be utilized very simple and uh but again it's it's one of those things that the it is a piece of financial planning a piece of retirement planning mhm and uh when you hear people like a ten Fisher out there to say I hate ... he doesn't know what he's talking about I could tell you I\nIt's just a marketing thing for him to try to get people to call it but yet it anybody who says they hated ... you probably don't want to speak to him\nIn addition to education you also offer something that's really cool well card you get a quick description of that\nI Will let's first look at some statistics here who stock market once again you know making headlines interested you know a number of ... where the balance is over a million dollars a jumps to a hundred and fifty seven in the first quarter of two thousand Eighteen that's up to seven thousand right up wow forty five percent from a year earlier wow\nSo you know thanks to the market thanks for the savings that you're doing thanks to the company contributions you may be receiving but my point is you have the million dollars you have that nest egg\nProtect tell ya [laughter]\nAnd so that leads into what also upper when we're managing money or doing things we talk about annuities and their protection\nBut not all money goes to the new what he's still goes into the market yet but there's ways to be in the market and there's ways to manage risk in the market and what my friend does is managed risk mhm and what we do in doing with our manually off or something or to with ... counts called welfare wealth guard is a simple as it gets\nReally it is you know you have a wealth card number when you sign up depending on your risk tolerance yeah so you have a million dollars maybe you're You're welcome number is ten percent if the account drops to nine hundred or below you sell out ...\nAnd they are partnering with several of the island's hit the hardest in twenty Seventeen hurricane season and some of the projects include rebuilding damaged schools\nAnd bringing back children's playgrounds yeah so I don't see that\nAt least they're putting a they're they're putting their money back out there and the communities that are participating in a nobody likes to talk a lot about Hoover and this week they received proposals from Wall street banks valuing the ride hailing company around a hundred and twenty billion\nAs they prepare for their ideal and early twenty Nineteen\nThat valuation very mixed Cooper bigger than General Motors Ford and Chrysler combined no go ahead and really what what also grab my attention they're competitor Lyft is launching a monthly subscription service\nAvailable across its user networking which users pay a flat fee of two hundred Ninety nine dollars they'll get thirty riots per month essentially lip subscribers or can take up to thirty rides at a value up to Fifteen dollars\nTo go over that number they're going to pay some more uh over that thirty minute window a and then additional rise beyond the thirty will come out of five percent discount\nHuh Interesting All right well Jet Blue in the news this week by the end of twenty Twenty one Jet Blue said that it will retrofit a hundred and thirty eight Airbus a three twenty aircraft with vortex generators what's a vortex generator well apparently it reduces noise on landings\nAnd believe it or not the entire retrofit will cost less than one million dollars so that's a good thing since twenty Fifteen Jet Blue has been taking new deliveries of Airbus eighth ... and a three twenty once with for tax generators All right\nSo now we know we all know what a vortex Jane now with that is now too quick item landing too quick I was from a a United Airlines first this week they boosted their profit outlook for the year as the U.S economy continues to home right along\nA and they're seeing big jumps and passenger traffic at their Chicago Denver and Houston hubs plus more business travelers are paying higher fees for those premiums seats\nBut they also made clear flyers who buy their cheap basic economy fares on United that they're going to continue to pay the carry on their backs despite moves by American delta who have relax their policy and then this last one from Mary Elizabeth I applaud for its honesty but perhaps not for liability\nDid you see this week that Nebraska tourism debuted in New tagline for its new tourism campaign that says Nebraska\nHonestly it's not for everyone [laughter]\nAlthough I'm not making the scientists say they've obviously you know they're attracting outdoor enthusiast to the state as they have so much natural beauty there and their new slogan is going to replace the one that dates back to twenty Fifteen Nebraska nice\nBut we really need to watch this because the purpose of the tourism department and they don't need me to tell them this but maybe they do if the cast is why did that as possible and attracted many visitors possible so I'm not real sure about the success of Nebraska honestly it's not for everyone will\nNebraska nice it's how well mine was in Nebraska because when the fifteenth so that clearly that wasn't working if that's the only three years old and they're ... they're getting All right I see well it all the hard have that cloud and the honesty\nThing are folks before we pause for a brief sponsor break and get ready for British writer and Christine cars who are coming up we'll be joining us in mere moments or

history\nHas already Giovanni I was looking on your website and I saw gallery so no this is from people that have taken the chores [laughter] when or Arabs and goes I mean these are that's an awful lot of oddities on these tourists um have you ever seen it goes to what you think might have been against\nOut absolutely I'm definitely seeing a ghost um yeah so we ah well one of the house or the way it's considered the most haunted house\nI'm In the city and that's where the corps when family had lived on those grounds the house is not there anymore it's another house but\nI was there telling a story and something went through the tree um we've seen stuff in our office to we're on the old custom house so there's several custom how does one second to last oh my daughter got chased out of here one night a found his voice is behind her head so she got a little freaked out\nSo yeah but I've slept in my own building because sometimes you know I guess stay overnight waiting there so I've never had anything happen then but I definitely have had stuff happen on my tour\nYou know I think the part of the country that you're in and for folks that haven't been to Salem, Massachusetts I mentioned a just a couple of minutes ago when we were about to introduce you that\nYou know it's easy to get to I mean you're thirty forty five minutes I guess depending on traffic from Boston northeastern right there on the coasts as you said and also this time of year I mean I guess the folks want to go about forty or forty five minutes south you've got plenty of so you can kind of hidden all their uh\nYou know I got a few questions right now for you to tell us do the tours Ron during all types of weather and how often do they run and do you and your team you know do you ever get that real bright or scare while you're out on the tourist\nYeah we're on every day I'm through November for this year and then uh that Ben daylight savings time happened and so we uh go the weekends but um yeah you know the Boston sale employment combination is really\nA great combination people go to Boston and then they take the train up here the train comes right\nThe city and it's a nice easy ride and then they do fail until the spend a couple of days here Dubai can maybe go planet so it's really great combination I mean our areas rich in history you know what part of one of the oldest part of the country so um\nBut yeah so it's um it's it's a great combination all around\nWhen people come there for the tourists uh ... what do you find it what surprises them the most when they leave that to you you're always going to chuckle about because you thought they would know and they just don't\nI think one of the biggest things that we are older than Boston and everyone doesn't realize that and then when we call them or stuff like Alexander Graham Bell lived here for three years and ah we had a very\nFamous revolutionary I'll say a conflict I won't say battle that preceded Lexington and Concord and it's actually the first confrontation of the revolutionary war\nSo there's a lot of like stuff like that that wall with them and then we call them all the stuff that oh my God people are just blown away because about ... and you know some of the little stories of the trials that are just so incredibly interesting and explains so much\nOf this trial certainly in visiting if something
