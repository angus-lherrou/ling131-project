hurdle we've heard all the allegations\nAnd know that professor Ford's so called by witness was contradicted her testimony and her accusation\nWe know in the case of ... Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even polar publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one\nNumber two or own words that she was ... they'd quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before and that Mr ... was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yo classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug or and rapist of teenage girls will give me the evidence and cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from you Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I Know do I and I'm not the one who was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week wait a minute what everybody's talking on the head\nWith a full and fair investigation getting married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I Know and the FBI added\nNo excuse me every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself and then we all watched Julie sweat Nick alter shift\nAnd backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so could you have any cooperation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not getting any education that I don't expect the next day and I did\nI mean all you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of corroboration people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that happen that way at all\nSo the charges are college or in that scene on at the last twenty four hours at looking about ah

the presumption of innocence but also to leave that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair and ... and that is why you're going to say on the left a huge outcry and I understand that this is energizing the geology hey\nI'm not talking point what hang on a second I Want you interview looking in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the abandoned the one eye witness says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do is we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location and she doesn't know how she got there I got home from their what else did the FBI to do they had already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... at the FBI just\nJust not that was can they possibly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when we don't know huh\nOK okay she thinks the fact that she doesn't run into wearing out where and when exactly it's not necessarily\nDon't you now you're you're trying to what you're trying to change it look follow the bounds of the people if there is for people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't

I'm twenty five now tells\nThe top of the hour eight hundred nine put one Sean is our toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program\nAll right so this vote Friday Saturday big votes big opportunity\nAnd we have Susan Collins and senator snowflakes saying that they are satisfied that the comprehensive investigation of the FBI Lisa Murkowski saying the hasn't had time to read it Democrats in an uproar angry upset lashing out at the FBI\nWhat were they supposed to do except to interview the people that was supposed to corroborate the stories of this\nThat's what they did they got what they wanted and it never ever gonna be enough All right back to our phones as we say Hi first Brandon is in Colorado Brandon Hi how are you glad you called and welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nHey thanks Sean I grew up and spent most of my life in Arizona where my family's still is and I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a\nA good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that you'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday sounds\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it's just you know I I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a secret people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and not be able to really recognize that I feel like that happened with McCain I feel like that's kind of happening with just as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he made was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted when asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters he had an absolutely not\n[laughter] I'm and I'm like\nOh so you're you're only stand on your principles when when you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I I just look at a guy that can't doesn't know is old mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is the\nSame guy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know ... you don't look at him and uh you'll find

now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delayed they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations\nAnd they're not going to offer opinions here and all they're going to do is give you a straight data and that's what was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations of problematic from the start you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it it is so it's so dark I'm having a conversation with a friend of mine who's religious\nAnd we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\nThou shall not their falls witness against the neighbor because it's devastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and\nA media hysteria that's ... that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people with innuendo falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four
