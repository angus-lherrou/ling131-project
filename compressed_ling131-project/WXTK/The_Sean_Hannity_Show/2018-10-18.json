that they're ceding most about that what they're most hating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them as the United states senator had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage you mean it's\nIt's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri or their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journals do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like a Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about her somebody's position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate me Sean for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now exposed as

sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about the ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is polite and ... who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the

one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us\nTo take the money ... indirect means in order to I guess appeal to moderate to the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats were shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri are kind of see you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we ... the American people had it when the Democratic party a band in any sense of due process under\nThe law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute the cabin all was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then went all the the the allegations are

a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage she was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that is less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the\nAverage white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this they and tries to prove\nTo her

guess I don't know if they say in Johnny Rocco was a Democrat in Chicago [noise] back in the day [noise]\nFour or five hundred forty to forty two this from a Breitbart Joel Pollak is talking about this this narrative that somehow a Trump killed the a journalist so called a shaky to show ...\nEvery administration has tolerated Saudi pirate tyranny but none so eagerly as the Obama administration the forty fourth president literally bowed to the Saudi king to show the U.S was prepared to adopt than a sequel is posture toward the Islam\nI'm a world Trump's friendship with the Saudi regime is at least sensibly ground that in a strategy to fight the Iranian regime which is actively seeking nuclear weapons and poses a direct threat to the U.S and our allies\nBut here's here's the key of what the Breitbart says in the in the wake of the collapse of the Russian conspiracy theory the media are trying to make Saudi Arabia the new Russia\nI eat a foreign power that supposedly exerts undue influence over President Trump perhaps journalist hope because of some ... to one discovered financial interest\nInvolving the Trump family actually there's a quote from a there's a there's a kind of hear what the we have from a a Swalwell the or the geeky a Democrat from California who was who's you know Adam Schiff co conspirator a number of twelve states\nSo I thought a just a couple of days ago that the president was parity in one of the Saudis wanted him to stay as to what happened but now it seems more like the Saudis are ... what the president wants them to say as he is in a really empowering on them to use this deny deny deny approached that he always use and it seems to get away with\nAs far as you can tell ... while you're implying hairs that President Trump and the Saudi Government are working together essentially to cover up what happened here well since the pattern\nOf every time Donald Trump is presented with overwhelming evidence he thinks that he can just deny his way out of it\nSo what exactly is in it for Trump now but here's here's the Russia cut cut Thirteen\nKind of fall back on my work as a prosecutor where\nOr if it takes this long to come up with us explanation as to what happened while we kind of already know that the Saudis are responsible and now they're speaking to mitigate or just you know who knew at the highest\nLevels and actually this is very similar to many of the witnesses we had in our Trump Russia investigation a number of times we asked to witness a question and they would take a timeout consult with their lawyers for five or ten minutes and then come back and we figured you know what we already know the answer because there was a pretty simple one and\nI was so disturbing here is that the United states is actually a part of the you know facts\nHe's invited himself again if it takes this long to come up with an answer than we know the answer the same thing could be set up the Russia investigation if it takes this long to come up with something I think we know what the answer is there's nothing there do you think that would have been a potential follow up question for Rachel Maddow\nBarbara your next without ... go ahead Barbara\nHi Sally I just wanted to say that religion that's Lawrence shouldn't go back to your heritage diet eat crow\n[laughter] yeah it ... you know it would require her to have a sense of shame and remorse for her to have the pro Barbara and that yet and as you well know there is no there is none of that they're a rust very quickly Ross go ahead\nYou know I I like that at as far as I'm concerned it was based on fact of history\nAnd I believe it was not over the top you know the Democrats as far as the cabinet or a a a areas or can strike it really acted like Nazis and and suddenly they get to the past\nThey did I I mean there there was a total lack of due process here and and you know ... and then why they keep saying ... I think the maybe the scariest thing that was that was by Cory Booker she was telling her true I mean that there is is there is a level I mean that's a very much a but something you'd hear in to kill a mocking bird isn't it you know the ...\nThe ... the the girl was accusing the black guy of ah ... she was telling her truth wasn't she wasn't she Spartacus and [noise] we'll be back tomorrow I'm our guard [noise]\n\nAre you looking for a pre own car well before you go to the dealership we'll be pounce on like pushy sales people give the guys to try\nTo build up a Jewish in my job is to make finding the perfect used car as easy as possible that means I Do follow the tough language for you once I figure out what you want out of a car I go find it I've been in this business for a long time and I know what to look out for ...

campaign rally acknowledge what turkey and other nations reported for a week a journalist ... is did\nAnd it never worked out that way for any body and frankly Republicans this was their moment in and look we got rid of the individual mandate\nIn Nineteen days we can create a system of health care second to nobody in the world that's why for seven years I have harassed and bother port Josh ...\nAtlas MD Wichita, Kansas not only do I put them on radio and TV oh no that's not enough I set up meetings with him he flies to Washington on his own we should pay him\nYou know that I'll probably

Ninety five percent reduction\nYou you need chemotherapy got breast cancer well for a lot of those drugs it's six dollars that treatment\nGood luck getting those prices anywhere we couldn't institutionalized this\nAnyway so there's ... they're not running on what they believe we've learned that with Brett us in in Tennessee thanks to project beret toss we've learned with Claire McCaskill caught on undercover videos you can play they outrageous we needed investigation\nInvestigation into what the fact that you and your own words are saying to the people in Missouri I'm a liar I Am a fake phony fraud I Am a I'm just a phony\nI'm a liar I'm saying whatever I Need to say to get elected I don't mean any of it my job is to bamboozled the people of Missouri lie to them they can go to Washington and I'm going to govern just like Iraq Obama\nThey can't win if they define who they really are they can't win if they give us their true agenda\nThey can't win if they say yeah we really want to impeach Trump impeach forty five ... forty five impeached forty five reclaiming my timer claiming my time they tell Maxine Waters don't say it when I'm ... now I don't want to talk about\nIt just don't say it they tell her and she says they told me not to say it but I'm gonna keep saying in any way\nSo their gender is impeachment and lists never ending investigations open borders eliminate ice\nCities now we have a sanctuary state California\nThey want ... why do they want open borders to they've calculated that's going to benefit them at the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision and every agenda item is about them wanting to hold on to power period\nIt doesn't matter the output uh the the what the end result is doesn't matter Obama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics again if you listen to this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well\nThe only reason I say it so often is that so everybody knows what he can't say they didn't know\nWhat that's what they want to take us back to that but they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven by a borderline psychotic hatred of this president they want to go back to what\nBack to Obamacare they won't open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power forever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans of people\nAre going to talk about what the president's planning and it's like that's what they stand for\nThis is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs he pulled by my care open borders impeach Trump endless investigation what name one thing they're that they're doing to make your life better\nBut goes after losing Thirteen million Americans and and having them have to go through food stamps to survive and sustain themselves in eight years of a failed do Tommy of Obama the only president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in American history\nYou know they want to what we don't want to add more people why 'cause they're dependent on them the crumbs they're handing out the irony of that they're ... what what did the leftovers they have\nYou know when they're done building their gyms their Senate gyms their house Kim's there you know house barbershops their Senate barber shops the Senate dining rooms their house dining rooms or they treat themselves while they're not they're not on Obamacare they got to separate out system just for them very different\n[noise] so that's what's at stake you know I'm going to tell you something about this border as I watch this care of it\nYou've got to understand this is the about national security this is personal security\nI think I'm the only person in the media that actually took the time over the years and I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times site antidote you've told us that before\nYeah I bet on horseback yeah Ben and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah I've been on foot Yemen all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego in many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life floor to ceiling drugs confiscated his where they were headed\nTo Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever\nBut there's now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis in this country is is one the one issue is oh kids go into grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet they try a bike and then a Percocet anoxic on and\nThen they go back there got another one next thing you know they're addicted next thing you know they're buying them on the streets God Knows what those pills really aren't the drug dealers don't give a rip it these kids die\nThen when they find out that can't afford eighty bucks a pill well then some genius idiot friend or deal or friend quote of theirs so why don't you try heroin does much better ... totally ten dollars a bag\nAnd they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon as they call it new light up in smoke it and then eventually you're going to remain lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave\nAnd a life of a living hell\nAnd that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where it's human trafficking happening right over the border what's happening all across the border there's a new thing it's called fat and all\nYou know talk to my buddy Eric Bowley his Nineteen year old son ... bought an than that which is you know to relieve anxiety\nAnd and and it was laced if you have three grains of fat and all the size of three grain of salt it will kill you and we have nearly\nA hundred thousand kids dying every single day one death every seven point five minutes you know almost a hundred thousand deaths a year and we keep talking about opioid crisis left and right opioid we can stop it if we secure the border\nCaravans now so I think it's right I think ... what do we see what's happening all\nThe total total elimination of anything that we recognize as the U.S constitution the rule of law equal justice under the law equal application of our laws or the presumption of innocence what presumption of innocence I Believe her never heard from a bribe believer\nYou know that no corroborating evidence I still believe her\nYou know but then with no no no but but they were lined up almost on a weekend basis they wind up in the hall first they spike the punch bowl and after they spike the punch bowl the boys would line up in the hall every weekend\nAnd then they rape the girls in the room they take turns and it happened almost every weekend and then the story evolved into well I didn't see him spike the punch bowl but I saw a mirror punch bowl\nAnd I see I saw him give out a red solo cup\nThat's what that became\nSo and then Dianne Feinstein wants to bring that up again\nAfter eight FBI investigations what are they offering for you because since Trump spent president you got for a million new jobs since Trump's been president four hundred

El Salvador and whose leaders are doing little to stop the large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico or to the U.S and he said that he will poll aid for these countries\nAnd then he said the assault on our country at the southern border including the criminal elements and drugs pouring in is far more important to me is president then trade and the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada\nHopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border this is all the Democrats fall weak laws and of course they don't want to build the border well guess what it also
