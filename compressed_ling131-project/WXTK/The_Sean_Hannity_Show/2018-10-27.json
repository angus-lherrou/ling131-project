have open borders you know she's going to want to raise taxes you know show hunted killed jobs she'll put back in regulations and guess what they're going to try to impeach president so\nYou've really got just over a week\nTo try to stop pull a few of the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focus on that and run a very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent of the story I think Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amounts it's by big amounts so you have a rational race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in Virginia\nTen were Barbara construct running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point that had all the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks versus are two million between the Republican uh groups in the center of ... I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats flows he become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by it I guess any measure right\nJust split decision except that the Democrats will have a focus they will control the house think of the committees that are going to change to think of think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it\nYou'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the with the with all these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go\nThey'll go check his taxes they leak all this stuff and it'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us\nPollsters we get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election or you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same area you said it's getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time could jak thing they\nBarely even when they are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nI Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare and I think he's right to say that the Democrats are mobilized can focus on the um on the house\nBurn your degree on line from her\nRenovations presents\nChampionship cybersecurity\nJoined secure renovations for cocktails and conversation with just a

election uh what about these these bombs that have been sent out now we have the one person we believed to be responsible in custody does that have an impact on the election uh Doug Jones\nI think if the caravans going to have any impact it's going to help the Republicans are the county fair minded person\nSay that as with the down fourteen devices showing it's very hard at frankly hope there's no impact it it's it's it's I think just terrific and I just hope we can pull together as a country\nAnd not try to demonize them what is a big ... which is an assault on our democracy and on and on our marriage\nWell Diana CNN guy today John McLaughlin John outlawed I I\nActually go out there and say um that deniro is not like the others why Robert De Niro one of the things that I found was on October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting De Niro but things he said on Alec Baldwin show of all places and\nSaid that the Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil let's play a little bit of Robert De Niro and the things that he said why been critical\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's ... he's a dog he's a big he's a con\nArtist a mutt who

supposed to talk about the John\nI Know it but you know what let some people are hoping that\nAfter this election it all goes away it's not going to go away what this is about is Donald Trump is a historic president and the reason that he is a historic president is he's not from the establishment he beat the Republican establishment he beat the national establishment he's there he's not\nHe's not only draining the swamp but he's a threat to their very existence so it's going to happen is\nThe presidential race is going to start right after the election November ... where the Democrats are going to put up a big deal to people who are going to be all at the president and if they get the house and Nancy Pelosi the speaker it's\nAll about feeding Donald Trump so this race November sex is not just about control the Congress it's really about\nThe what the Democrats are doing to get rid of Donald Trump what the establishment is doing to get rid of Donald Trump and the sixty three

closer and uh it's typical of a lot of races that are going around around the country he pulled us out\nYeah it's tough it's not the race just for my life it's for the people that live here it's for protecting the tax cuts\nThe one time we finally got a real tax cut direct money into the pockets of the people that live here instead of all the high taxes spend that we've received from Albany under Governor Cuomo I'm a progressive socialist and ... and New York city that basically run our ... our state and my opponent is one of them he\nActually has a lower conservative rating than some of the most socialist\nLeft leaning Democrats in the New York state assembly and he's trying to cast himself as a Republican or a moderate in his district he's breathed wants the word Democrat he's trying to deceive and conduct voters here\nAnd just say okay I'm a moderate I get along I work with everyone you know when he gets he sucks up to Cuomo silver and whomever is telling them what to do and he's

president's doing his job of course these are the latest polls and Trump won the district by a healthy what ten point margin over Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen eleven points to be specific\nAnd it's a district that has benefited not because of anything Albany has done I mean there was a recent editorial about how bad upstate New York has become\nUnder Cuomo and you know I sat with him and he looked me in the eye and said he's going to open up tracking before the last election he just lied to my face he did the exact opposite right after he was elected\nAnd meanwhile Pennsylvania's economy

calling to urge my fellow and to get out and vote vote Governor Scott needs are but they're hoping that will be too busy with doing recovery then to get out\nWell in Florida early voting is ongoing so that means you can go any time between as I understand it now and election day\nUm I Know it's hard especially for people some people have lost their and everything they lost their entire home they'd been relocated and they don't have a chance to change their voter registration probably so that means that have to go back to where they live in or they can get an absentee ballot I don't think it's too late for that\nEleven days but you'd have to check in with your local elections office\nYes that's correct I saw it on the news of the day about that's about it still viable\nMainland courage

I Believe ... to people who are\nA bit off maybe they're fighting psychologically to rangers somebody but when they hear the left wing calling us Nazis and calling us racist and ... and and having

to confront this caravan and the issue of the caravan for going through the threat\nAt our nation's border and showing you know I've talked to for the fish is a threat to this is\nOne of the biggest problems for national security has our southern border we have you know we have a sovereign nation to have a sovereign nation you need three things you need borders you have your way to secure the border and you need a central government well we've got throughout history we've got a structural government\nWe've got a way to secure if if we do not have secure borders of the southern or\nYou know let me play for you we have a list of crimes that I'm guaranteeing many in our audience and even though we've talked about it so often\nDon't even know crimes perpetrated by illegal immigrants against innocent families now when I went down to the border and was briefed with then governor Rick Perry and I've been down there Thirteen times I was shocked to learn and a seven year period in Texas alone\nCan you imagine getting seven percent of a pile of money guaranteed for the rest of your life to matter what happens when that's incredible that's pretty comforting and since income as the number one objective\nMen if you could do that in layer that on top of your Social Security check and hopefully you might have a pension too\nOkay then you know I'm not saying the rest is gravy but\nIt's so comforting to see a layer I had a client matter of fact I had this one of my favorite ... came to my workshop earlier this week [noise] and he talked to the crowd about what I did\nTo him how he met me two years ago he was but he was going to retire at that point at eight months to retirement he gathered up all those assets he came into my office we had a conversation and then he left\nAnd then he checked me out [laughter] oh man check me out and then he decided okay I'm going to come see you again so he came to see me again\nAnd we presented some ideas here's your income here's your cash flow here's your Social Security check we're going to turn this one on when you're sixty six and we're going to turn this check on when when the when your wife Seventy and we're going to add the pension and we're going to do this this and this and he says you know Steve no one's ever ever showed me\nHow this money can be laid out and worked for me he goes I was so concerned and he goes I knew I had a pension but\nI had no idea if my if I could retire I just I was so nervous and when you broke it down and you didn't talk jargon I wasn't totally confused ego Steve I was a little bit I mean there's a lot of stuff\nHe says but boy when you made it like that I felt so good and so confident that I could retire and then over six months we started to put the pieces together some of the rollovers came to be some of the monies that was in his money purchase plan we started to pay him on an income\nAll this stuff that we talked about we started to put the pieces together and about nine months later he got his first ... she was like a kid in the game you store and I was telling us to the audience he goes I mean I kind of felt comfortable with but I saw my first check he goes he calls me up and go to Steve Steve she goes I got my first checks\nI go well yeah that's how it works it goes she goes this is unbelievable she goes I'm getting up in the morning going fishing he was a big fisherman and he's been fishing every day since he's retired\nAnd he's so it was so happy and I think that really helped the crowd\nYou know understand what it is I Do I'm I'm I'm just a quarterback you know I just help people take the hard work and the money they saved and I visualize it for the my help them see the picture better and\nGive them either the green light like they're ready to go or maybe they're not so ready yet but at least when they come and see me they know where they stand\nAnd that is so key today most folks don't know where they stand I mean they have a rough idea of a pile of money but they don't know what that pile can produce the don't quite know what the Social Security is yet and they are not sure they can retire I can help put you on the right path\nOkay to determine whether you are your retirement renting is whether you are ready to go where they need to do this you know few pieces whether perhaps you need to see a CPA to get something right or your attorney to get some pieces in order or even even the money managers because I Do not manage money\nI manage income\nGay which I feel is way more important so I work with professional so\nWith that let's let's take a quick break and let's throw that I'm off are out there again about that book and for the first time in college will give them a free copy of my book tee up your retirement which is exactly is the name implies I help you to see it up and if you're already retired\nIt's a great read to see\nOr what have you done other pieces that I'm suggesting do you have those pieces in place and don't worry if you don't because things are always new and improved and changing and just because you retired doesn't mean you can't make adjustments and your situation to help keep you on track\nAnd Steve something I think it's so care about that story you just shared is that that that individual didn't really know what he had 'cause he hadn't lead everything out he hadn't done you know some of the ... he hadn't even just late everything out and buy and sell it at home on the bed and said okay I got pension I got a four one K. I got savings\nAnd that's so important as well when you sit down with listeners and that you put it down in black and white lets it go through each individual item that you have\nTo put everything down and then I'll give you some option give you some ideas and you don't makes things complicated which I enjoy here on the show you know you can turn on the TV to talking heads or maybe a different show and they're using all the fancy jargon where you lived there for ten minutes but you really have no idea what's going on\nThat not the type of show that says we want to make it easy to understand and we're here to educate you and when you sit down with the ... he's just like he is on the air is talking about golf he's talking about football he's talking about Boston you know being in the world series is it really friendly guy\nAnd then we sit down with you it's going to be like ABC language when he explains how he can help you with your retirement income planned now onto the book here see

beautiful your contractors contacting me by their nature about assurance that any product\nBecause like I said he wants\nUs to fall chances a day every week to what a tragedy weren't possible by me

so\nAnd that's when they came up in the ... move the transition team out of Trump Tower down to the golf club or New Jersey\nThe very next day after he met with Rogers he moved it now here's here's something else this is really fast it the committee has also been told that missed this is great stuff Ash Carter remember Ash Carter is that he is the secretary\nMen's writer nobody ride he was from
