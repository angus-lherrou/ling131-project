house speaker is hitting the trail for an aggressive final stretch of campaigning in an attempt to help more than two dozen vulnerable Republicans and save the house before he retires USA Today congressional reporter Eliza ... got the scoop it was what do we know\nHe has a really aggressive final sprint he's like he's going to twelve state he's going to campaign for more than twenty five candidates a lot of them are incumbents who currently serve with him a handful are\nOn incoming aries helping their incoming Republican candidates specifically like the person trying to take his seat because he's retiring\nWould you keep this kind of schedule normally if he were seeking reelection himself\nWell he always had a pretty aggressive schedule because he had to read lots and lots of money for the party he's raised over seven eight million dollars\nFor the party with a lot of that going to keep these candidates safer attempt to keep these candidates have cuts heat certainly doesn't he's not running again and just keep an aggressive schedule\nBut it is new for him to be hammering sort of just well you know basically like a skate a day on multiple districts and\nJust go kind of on his final sprint that we should remember he's retiring\nAnd it would really help is like the if the Republicans are able to keep the majority when he leaves like\nJeez are so I thought it

really interesting as well I've spent the last couple of years covering the Freedom Caucus and did that for a been a thorn in his head be there for a trip conservative fire raid\nMembers of his party who will threaten or in some cases have actually send legislation that as a Republican priority because they did not think it was conservative enough um Republicans need two hundred and Eighteen votes in order\nTo pass anything and they can do right now on their\nOwn um but they need buy in from the Freedom Caucus because there's about three dozen of that so they have power when they sort of voting bloc and they've done that and they've threatened to do that\nAnd so they have sort of forced Ryan and his leadership team in a lot of cases so I was just surprised to find out that he is actually on the trail for three of them\nOne of them being a congressman Dave Brat\nWho is sort of one of the leaders of the Freedom Caucus he's not just a rank and file member but he's one of the people making these decisions on what those things get and what they'll vote for it but he's all three of them are facing really competitive races\nOr speak with allies are Collins congressional reporter at USA

to kind of the\nWorld from candidate to candidate what how do will change from candidate to Canada in some places that might be like a business or or you know a rally\nIn some places it might just be a closed door fundraiser it really depends on the candidate but his messaging basically it's like you're better off and a Republican leadership on the economy there talking about opioid legislation
