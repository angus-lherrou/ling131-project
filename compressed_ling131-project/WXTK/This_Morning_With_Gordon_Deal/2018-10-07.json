swing and a ... maybe we'll learn some things tonight as we go so our first guest here\nNever been on pills before\nBenjamin a Radford calling been or at least I'm going to Colombian he sciences emails Ben or one of the world's few science based paranormal investigators he's done a firsthand research into all\nDifferent phenomenon and\nThis is cool he's been all over I don't know how he's getting to do this because\nThere's not a lot of money in studying this for sure so he's done well ask him about that that he's been in sixteen countries four continents\nA study in this kinda stuff psychics goes on houses ... miracles is that you know and that's one by the way a lot of people don't talk about miracles that also makes like like monsters and you know a lot of things like that us knows reincarnation crop circles all sorts of goodies\nAnd he is known for solving mysteries um the Santa Fe court house goes into thousand seven\nUh also it will have to ask you about that you\n... Cabrera in twenty can he he knows a whole lot about creeping clowns he calls them bad clowns I'll call them creepy clowns they are bad clowns and\nHe's the first to bull to fully examined the evil clown phenomenon and I was going to talk about that tonight within the there's so much to talk about with him I think I Want to say that for something else\nOr another gay 'cause you can actually talk about ... bad plans ... ... you know three hundred and sixty five days out of the year right\nSo uh we're going to get some we're going to get we're going to learn about the origins Halloween\nAnd uh it it's just really cool to meet him because he's been all over and you know he's been all over television as well and he does like to keep it science may so let's bring 'em on here for the first time ever on ... welcome Dan to coast to coast am how are you\nI'm doing well thanks for me I I Love will if we need a trademark that that's great\nI Know right I should have went over there and check out the domain hurry up get it for me please [laughter] somebody's got snagged that right all of it\nThat's fun stuff so you're very similar to me he got the old TV background and the passion to know the truth and to study everything and try to pull it all together so when I you know found\nYou know I was like oh my gosh he's like he's like this is great so now how have you been able to go all across like the planet I mean you've been everywhere this this is this is good\nWell there's a there's a it's a good question actually as you point out there's a lot of money in grain grow by some sort of X. files department but I'm not exactly\nYou know I I work for a nonprofit education organization called the center for inquiry based in Buffalo\nAnd for them I'm the editor of uh magazines coupling choir and new things like that but I Am but even aside from that I just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to go into an open mind and I tried to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking folklore point of view\nAnd so one so partly the answer question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like for if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all been looking at goes again\nAll right you know they're like well give me a bit of the ... going to go to the beach and like that's really cool are you there was a monster there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos and\nSo that that that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere uh you know I I happen to be there anyway and so I turned into investigation one I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean\nAnd so for example in the Eighteen hundreds or they were different customs that were that were involved holy which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that the that are for example a woman on Halloween would be able to tell the future\nUm and it would be a proxy and oftentimes the prophecy a was um either dealing with like people who died the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there's very superstitious about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would be what a what a candle from a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the deal with a with a look in the mirror and midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\nAnd so all these sorts of another one example is a body for Apple you know if we're not new apple bobbing and there was there was a particular holiday tradition that if you cut a pie if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was an act when it when it landed it would spell the ... of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting Glenn of you know two worlds coming together and pass the credit coming together\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] so I Do it you know the midnight\nRide on willfully night that's right will swing and [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know 'cause I I get there are people that say Halloween oh saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um you know I always see it is fun I see it\nAs a I I mean if you say Halloween\nI immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think of fall whether I think of orange and black colors yeah I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which is an led goblins\nAnd and it varies bond funds things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they kicked the fun out of it in the traditions out of it and and uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here\nBut what we have is a banner rapper with\nUs he is as an investigator and an end to all the things that were into a as coast the folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know does a lot of writing and he
