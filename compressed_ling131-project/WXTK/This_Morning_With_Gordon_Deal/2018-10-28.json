with you so\nSo a couple of news stories to get to this morning I I don't know if you heard about a ... ... if you go to coast to coast am dot com there's there's really ... is a great piece\nAbout the experiments that inspired Frankenstein so as you're heading into the holiday weekend a and getting up to a Halloween on the way this is a it's a fun story to read because it it goes to show you the science behind what was this since ... science fiction story\nNot people don't think of Frankenstein as science fiction that you know sometimes it's sort of is like a big morality play but it really is in many respects ... one of the first major\nBig selling Science Diction works and that's because um if you really if you think about the ... like like a I robot\nBoth the ask them off version and then the robot that came before as most they're all kind of play on the same themes that are that are explored in Frankenstein between you know the creator and the creation a and in fact in that very first\nVersion of a robot before the asthma version of a robot um the robot that is created in the very first version of I robot which was in the late Nineteen thirties or sits down and read Frankenstein and then has a better understanding\nOf life afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot com it's a great story to read and\nAnd also this one to from the sun\nAbout eight or a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to the defense insider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada\nUm and what they have recently uncovered but\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a Gemini let me just tell you very funny book you resist great sense of humor is really enjoy all the sort of a comic sides on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this ... this was this was a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\nAll right uh there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how in itself it's about a hundred thousand people a lot of course of the month and a quarter million so it's a massive amount of people for the small city to have to the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drilled down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween in say about the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in in the implications\nOf the er the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really important I mean we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that a ... ... that there are other places around the world outside the Salem\nThat had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that film wasn't the first ever which wasn't the last one the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for the you know there are you know the first for trout America the victim was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nThe honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still being being asking for being with us but the the strange thing about that to me of course all the things on the planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and I feel in Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween and the way um I like to rub zombie story there in the book to\nAnd then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer in American history and you've never heard of that either that's coming up next our coast to coast am this is the input\n\n\nThe race or first our school district state representative is coming down to the wire with the incumbent Republican Tim Whalen facing off against his

coast am we've been punted so plain that bumper on purpose it doesn't sound\nLike it would be Halloween bumper but it is for anybody who's seen the Netflix series the hunting of hill house [laughter] because that's been the theme they play a kind of a slowdown ... version of it in the promos let me tell you what a great show that was\nOn Stephen King praised at a ... it's been getting you know terrific reviews from every corner ... deserves it it's just a great great story and it's told really well has nothing to do with the book\nRight has very little to do with any of the other versions of the ... house that I've ever seen I think I've seen every version they've ever made even the bootleg versions were these slightly changed the title\nUp but it was just ... it was great and I was skeptical of it going into it a ... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but it just it's that good so if you're looking for something\nTo be a little bit spooky more in the area of terror than horror\nVery suspenseful the hunting of he'll how so Netflix um is is just one of the rare a Netflix series that lives up to all of its building I think everybody I've talked to watch is loved it I'll just tell you that much and I think what even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with\nWith the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie is that they they make a point to do a lot of stuff off just slightly off camera was a little bit out of frame\nSo it it there's there's plenty to you know give you a boost in chills but I mean there were some moments there where\nSome of the coolest stuff you can't see and that's what it was like in the first one I remember that as a kid when I went to go see it it was like I couldn't see it but it was it would almost scared me more than I could see and I I don't know if I go to handle it if I had seen it so they look for that and you're going to join
