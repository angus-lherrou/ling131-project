that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is Laura ... distill the wall Street Journal Laura where do we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\nWhere at four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent rates are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for a thirty are fixed was just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher as a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I'm a I'm a little bit younger uh and even though I cover this all the time and I know that right to to be cheaper than a it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as adult I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a ship for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the extra than is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that than\nUm with that said though I think we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a sense that it has been in the past and I think one of the reasons is what we just touched on that we have younger people who don't remember rates being left high and I think the second is because we saw\nA huge run up and prices when rates were low and I and so I think a buyer they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the high rates of negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who's refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner has a rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway a full percentage point at least below where rates are now I'm so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they had their credit score up or something like that but there is almost nobody anymore was a strong incentive tree\nAnd what about home sellers are they being asked to reduce their asking price\nSo we're seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing above price growth is slowing and I am definitely sharing especially in some of the more\nExpensive markets um but I went to some of the hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a New York we're seeing or hearing more and more up price production\nSo what does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think that you bought a home good for you [laughter]\nI think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought this is the biggest jump we've seen in rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go on it are going to reflect that right away prizes are still high um but I Do think for a virus that just got\nExhausted um for for a bidding war Roseanne cash buyers and the real frenzy that we've had in the market that has really cold and so I think for buyers who want\nA little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes sense for them and uh and maybe adjust their prices downward a bad I think it can be a good time to buy\n[noise] thanks Laura Laura ... of the wall Street Journal\nPortion of the program is
