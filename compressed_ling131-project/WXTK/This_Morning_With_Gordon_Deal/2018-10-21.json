{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "[laughter] now as for FDR or he was sixty three and I mentioned you know that was pretty good age for Nineteen forty five today that's fairly young or by just because he he surpassed\nThe average lifespan I don't think it was as low as forty nine back then but I mean George Washington you know live to be in ... I Believe in his seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be um the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts of the time and um you know I spent ten years researching this stuff\nAnd you know after you are not quite that much for sure but um there's this the information in the book is is pretty compelling I Would check it out\n[noise] uh east of the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi Maher said good morning welcome to coast\nHank it Richard thank you for taking my call\nMy play the\nIdea that had been Hans originally made their money to the slave trade them for a day a

days ran that down nice guy\nThat I never have no idea how the relatives out well and and they\nHave a clue as to how they made their money ranching right\nWell\nI Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually in the tour guide at the Roosevelt mentioned mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when they came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the\nStock market was not as big as it is today\nAnd there are only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced things they create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly\nAnd Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the actually see the security Exchange Commission\nAnd FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote it takes the courage\nTo crush across [laughter] really interesting\nStuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I Love to hear it but their their their money came from Denver\n[noise] um and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family uh probably it's money so you know just kind of a ... to me elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all the money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those nice to call them the Boston brain than those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be some of that as well\nYeah I had heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging and these guys are never written a book let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour\nI'd be lucky [laughter] by the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach names who wants to be as

voices offering some of the clearest guidance on enlightenment and spiritual awakening Thomas dig deeply into these subjects to reveal their core wisdom in simple clear English the first time Thomas heard this wisdom was when he attended one of Timothy Conway's sat sang in the summer of two thousand and five\nThomas's taught a class based on the SAT saying for the center for lifelong learning he's spoken publicly numerous times both in person and on the radio and in September twenty twelve you spoke to the prestigious lecture series mind and super mind\nWhich is run by the SBC see Graham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the month for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty four team\nIs the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and his article\nHoudini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry who d'nese um how should we practice I mean he was not just a skeptic of after\nYou have communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise]\nHe um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so we as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little\nBit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to\nSay back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean I Would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and you'd be ready for that but this time there's\nThis guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma into his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for\n'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer who take a picture and\nAnd uh you know the fake medium would be totally surprised if it were you and you say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps\nSome of these a cabal of of disgruntled a psychics and mediums and put this young student at McGill University\nUp to the task of of uh yeah this writing on beating on Harry right into my\nThat's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems that makes sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA door oil was a prominent spiritually so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an avowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend uh and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a ... to find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nA matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nAnd then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford howdy howdy for get in touch with best\n[noise] well I took an interest in it but I just wanted to point out I think that this worked\nBecause bass and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine\nAnd I think it's really important for us to think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion\nWe're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry die [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in his mind putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to ...\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul were spirit with surviving gap and so this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware of\nHoudini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDid taught us I gotta jump in here forgive me Thomas I gotta jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with
