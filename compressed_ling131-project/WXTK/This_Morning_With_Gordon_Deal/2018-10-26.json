where's second such\nYou know if they said he's on vacation or she's on vacation then you know there may not be anything to worry about but if they come in and they say air thanks I gotta go gotta go

by Ron Hansen\nCongressional reporter at the Arizona Republic part of the\nUSA Today network round give us some numbers\nSo Phoenix the T the TV market a forty one thousand ads\nOn just broadcast television that doesn't include all the cable channels as well so it's even worse than it sounds a but we are a number one market in the country that turned out for a huge political ads and you know as I noted in the story if you think that it may be\nBetter in Tucson for example there are actually number three they have over thirty thousand so Arizona's really kind of getting bombarded with

Mark and mix Sally it's one of the last ... competitive wages on the map it looks like right now\nSo let's just universally fought well financed and uh had its share of sort of ugly messages from both sides but especially each alarmist messages from the mic Sally ally camps\nAre those are my layman's observation near the nasty ones tend to get exhausting after a while our our focus saying to you that I'm okay enough already can we fast forward the calendar November six\nYou know somebody posted a great tweet on this you know practically begging for a car commercial\n[laughter]\nI Know I mean that's what it's come to where we're just like we're we're tired of this people are like skipping TV they're just sitting it out for the next couple of weeks\nOr they're tired of this messaging it is you know no surprise the messages are almost overwhelmingly negative in all the way the Senate race in particular has been a pretty ugly from the start\nAnd uh you know people here have seen that across the board for us this is a little bit different just in the sense that we are increasingly politically competitive states so this is something that yeah we've seen politics get ugly bookstore but it didn't you know\nCar carpet bomb us this way now we are definitely seeing a lot more action on both sides\nWell respected Ron Hansen congressional reporter at the Arizona Republic had aids essential dot com they're part of the USA Today a network\nYou got a piece about how Phoenix has just been overwhelmed with political ads this election year um you mentioned to kind of more broadly this has been significantly sharper increased over the last midterm election was that the measurement\nYeah it it's a compared to the terms even compared to twenty sixteen we're seeing a lot more action than what we're accustomed to and I think it's again a reflection of the stage growing political value or on the board\nOr Arizona used to be just a solidly red state it might still be a red state but it's a far lighter huge these days Democrats feel pretty optimistic about their chapters and a number of house races again the Senate races greenery too close to call\nAnd so we are just a you know inundated with these uh outdoor Wellman negative in a in a lot of different races a lot of different corners of the state\nKendall lower ballot candidates actually get air time or they squeezed out at times by the ... the Senate and governor's race\nYou know I think that they can they can get on the fact is that they just don't have as much financial power to do it so at any price they would have\nBeen relatively low octane a campaign you know we have a Democrats running for example in in each House Ways are they are challenging guts move us and ah these are some times low budget affairs\nAre we even had some Republicans running in places where they don't normally rod ... so you know they are at least a casting these races\nBut again these folks are are pretty far away from having a TV money at any great quantity\nAnybody saying that the saturation or perhaps consistent negativity can actually work against a candidate or is it a TV is king and candidates are going with it\nYou know look at people who actually hate negative advertising but the fact is it does sort of help define your opponent and so people still do it it's still leaves an impression with voters
