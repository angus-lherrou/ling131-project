experience so you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some other more remote areas such an Appalachian\nA and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is\nI said as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good places well whether when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector your work again so I'm\nTo the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that a ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world ah and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer what it has to be asked by people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left\nI think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go a\n... but you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does it extend another words doesn't mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years or does it mean that we're overheating at some point you just can't improve any further and that's the answer that only comes after the fact\nAh but

Texas He has refused to employ a pollster for air negative TV ads\nThe latest Wall Street journal NBC News poll rated young people and Hispanics as the Democrats least interested in voting in next month's midterm elections here's Wall Street journal national political reporter Reid Epstein read what's going on\nA year and a half or so now but our work or a previously a sort of low profile

seen in a state in Austin at a concert with Willie Nelson the true fifty thousand people a which is probably the biggest political rallies since President Obama's to those made campaign but the question for Mr O'Rourke and protect us Democrats is that\nHis appeal is strongest with young people and Hispanic voters and those are the demographics that\nAre as we know from twenty sixteen and past election tend not to show up in numbers proportionate to their share of the population really admit trouble elections when turnout a goes away down compared to presidential years uh and so ah the award campaign and then Texas Democrats think that\nUh they will have a surgeon voter turnout or like what President Obama did in two thousand eight or similarly to like what President Trump did with white working class voters or non college educated voters and twice sixteen but there's not\nSo far a lot of evidence already hard data to show that that is going to be the case\nAnd it was it it'd be interesting uh data deep dive you did because as you point out Texas Hispanics or Texas Hispanic voters or not the same as Hispanic voters elsewhere around the country\nThey tend to be a little more Republican than a faction of the country I think in twenty sixteen it was a next thirty four percent of Tetris is panic for the Republican compared to twenty eight percent and the rest of the country um but the bigger issue is that\nYou have a lot of these congressional districts in Texas are are fairly gerrymandered too many Democrats as possible in them and they just haven't seen competitive races are not just for Congress but the can down the ballot for for local races uh you know and so that the general elections have been a cakewalk short one party or the other\nUh and there hasn't been there's been no add add onto that there really hasn't been a competitive statewide race in Texas for anything in Twenty years uh\nAnd so there's not a political machinery to get folks out to vote or the ... campaign has had to build that on the fly over the course last year and a half a and whether there'll be able to do it\nUh in time for November six of the big question\nFrom speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Reid Epstein is written a piece titled Beto O'Rourke draws big crowds in Texas but he's voters tend not to vote the reluctance to vote is a presumption that a Democrat can win like what we're what does that come from\nWell just no I mean if you ask a Mr O'Rourke he'll tell you that nobody's I'm an ... uh and he is he talks a in his stump speech about having it all two hundred and fifty four counties in Texas and the ... the big state uh and some of these counties are very small uh some of the county is that\nIt is that I was a bit in Texas twice this year to visit him a C is campaigning and uh in February when I was down there he was visiting counties a inch having more people show up to his to see him\nThen voted in the twenty sixteen election in those counties are and so he thinks that he's able to draw\nA people out who haven't participated before because there's been a little reason for them to court because Texas has been so Republican uh one of the things that he says on the campaign trail is that he doesn't believe that Texas has a red state but it's a non voting state or he can just get Democrats to show up\nA then it'll be competitive now the corollary to that is by his house district in El Paso or haven't voted much either so there's not while he is certainly been very compelling on the campaign trail is drawn enormous numbers of
