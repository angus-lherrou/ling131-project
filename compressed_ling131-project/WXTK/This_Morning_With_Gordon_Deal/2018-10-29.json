there are there are things that happened when people are falling asleep or waking up in the sleep browser thing is it's scary ... is a very common\nYou know people wake up and they can't move um [noise]\nYou know and it can I think I Believe that can be accompanied by\nSeeing things and and hearing things and so on so [noise]\nYou know uh get the question is you know is is merely a a physiological biological um issue or a problem um or is it somehow opening the spiritual world\nI guess my answer is I don't know I think that if you if you do look on line or consult the doctor or they will they will tell you what I said which is yeah these kinds of things happen and sometimes when people are awake there in a kind of an in between state of consciousness\nI'm you know and that they'll talk in terms of psychology and neurology but um it it could also be um an opening to\nOther realities of the spiritual realities or\nMaybe I don't know you know in some cultures um in some

S. P. S. so all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages going through these facilities everyday that's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to\nPut a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages [noise] um\nYou know that this is a an order of magnitude that we simply can't handle when ah you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders and handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat up a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious that\nThinking about is is that they're just a dropping this in some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed right 'cause they wind up on some sort of security camera is that what's happening\nRight essentially that's what's happening and I think that\nSort of the the the way that the terrorists often tend to do things according to the experts and so you know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for are the you know basically a package that has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this you know without\nA some sort of specific reason I'm obviously you know a sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing\nUm but you know the good news is any package that put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened it's suddenly ... times the the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages for\nSpeaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming he's got a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is it seemed like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that that technology is improving and they are capable of doing spot checks random checks so to speak [noise]\nUm and that's a good thing uh you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up in these facilities as we speak but UPS and FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now the you know consider that to be security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their protocol here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far or sent to the the mail\nThrough the post the postal service and so um you know the postal service has investigators who they've deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these packages go through 'em but the problem is ultimately you know tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with um

anxiety and women's ensues ... just flip a long held GOP how steep that's located outside Seattle is it enough IRS Wall Street journal reporter Joshua ... and Joshua what do we have\nWell basically what you've got you got a mixture of factors that are playing a lot of races around the country I'm the chief from being the Republican incumbent in the district there is retiring [noise] um and so you've got a battle between a long time Republican in the state law or almost became a governor a few years ago\nAnd a brand new political candidate first time a candidate who is a pediatrician from the area and it's a we're seeing a play on districts across the country where the suburban women voters who are ... that risk of losing\nAnd but the thing about this district in particular outside of Seattle is\nIs that you are you going to use those voters at a faster clip than um the district was recently redrawn and faster than the rural voters can keep up with the Republican I'm so there is a bit of that but also the Republicans in the suburbs I'm voting for\nBarbara updates like her perform and if they can keep them in the fold then that's where the Democrats have a problem with this district\n... let me come above polling to indicate helping how\nA ... internal polling on both sides that show with the fiscal tie so both sides are convinced that it's going to come down to turn out and you see that playing out across the country where\nUm it's really about who can mobilize the voters of the most and we're seeing in polls that a national polls that different cuts are more energized than Republicans I'm an African the trend off\nSo uh the Democrat who's running your who's the pediatrician that's uh this is Kim Schrier ... okay so her she's been really hitting hard on healthcare stuff\nThat's right I mean she using that as a direct appeal to people who are nervous about their health care costs that seeing their costs to go up um and\nWho have pre existing conditions I'm and she feels from directly at the pediatrician in their community um she's got a thousand or patients that are in that district\nUm she feels from after type ... diabetic herself as someone who has a preexisting condition [noise]\nUm and he's with as part of her pledged to support that provision of Obamacare but it's a very direct appeal [noise] um that a Democrat from Washington

and the the\nThe power of this district is will that be enough to keep 'em some of these Republicans in the fold or will they reflect to send a check on Donald Trump to washed\nBecause this is a long held Republican district\nHas drawn in the Nineteen eighties after the sense of um in Nineteen eighty and it has never sent a Democrat to Washington or um but even though it has that Kim ... says

really interesting I was trying I was out there and I was trying to talk to people out in the vein of hers who lived in a district and they kept telling me they were from Seattle and that's common um you see that in other races where people um even sometimes cross state lines forget it to get into any foods they volunteer and all my money [noise]\nUm so this is just another example of that where
