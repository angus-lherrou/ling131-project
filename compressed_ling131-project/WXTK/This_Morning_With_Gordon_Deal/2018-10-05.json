Newman his piece is called Trump's base strategy on trade rebranding how much of this still might be geared just toward China and getting them to do something different [laughter]\nWell I well I think what we've seen in Trump's overall trade strategy is an evolution\nOr where he began earlier this year kind of like picking fights with everybody or he's picked fights with Iran or he picks fights with everybody who in court steel and aluminum and the United states that includes Japan and of course she picks fights with China with China and with Canada and Mexico\nSo as we progress through these development it does seem that ... that Trump's strategy is getting more shrewd\nAnd he's actually listening to trade experts who say look\nI'm we really don't have that much that trade problem with Canada we really don't have a problem with Mexico either the big problem you know the real problem here is China and if you want to confront China you need to make nice with everybody else they basically ally so why are you picking fights with allies um when you need their help\nTo put more pressure on China so that's actually what's happening\nAt what point or how long into the agreement you think would be fair to measure it against the old NAFTA this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement or a U.S MCA how long is you know worth letting it go and then in analyzing it yeah\nYears uh I mean we may not really no er during Trump's first four years okay um it it it it was first of all it has to be ratified by the legislatures of each of the three countries and that is not a given um if it turns out the Democrats take control the house and or the Senate or both chambers next year\nOr that will be very interesting dynamic because while Democrats actually support some of these protections that Trump are also a favors they may just not want to give Trump a victory on anything so it's possible we can be stuck with the NAFTA for the indefinite future\nIt's Rick Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman\nReminder by the way we can connect on social media you can find us on Facebook you can follow us on Twitter with the user name at this morning show you can follow me directly on Twitter as well with the username at Gordon Deal twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas burst news\n[noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "05"}
