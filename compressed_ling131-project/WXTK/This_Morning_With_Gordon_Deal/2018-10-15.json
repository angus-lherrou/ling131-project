bedrock\nThat's not human stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded to sort of you know allow for stores to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has insinuate it is that he thinks that maybe there were shrines on the in the three locations and they were aligned to you know the belt stars for Ryan a dating to step peppy\nAnd then you know in the old kingdom are Egyptians came they basically built their pyramids on top of the shrines\nAnd so uh and the softer so what's under the pyramid also you know the subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks much older and when you walk into the red pyramid or you walk into the what's called the kings chamber\nThere's also a you feel like you are you are basically in a new phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on

seeking smaller economic wins\nWary of being too reliant on single industries mills once among the largest employers in Maine has mostly falling off the radar as a guaranteed a job out of high school small economic wins in the smaller towns should make their economies more sustainable but it can be a long path\nWall Street journal reporter John camp made a couple of visits to the region John what you see\nIt can be hard for any town or city with a big employer shuts down but the shock waves are\nParticularly strong when you're talking about places that in some cases what purpose built towns to serve the wind industry while you know and the prime example was mowing docket man which is a fairly remote town I'm up in central Maine deep in the woods and\nIt was a place that was really tethered very strongly to a huge meal there for a century\nAnd there was a time when people coming out of high school would say they they pretty much had guaranteed jobs there and it was a way of life and it was really the heartbeat of town for for generations\nAnd it was also really the only game in town and they get paid most ... pounds taxes it provided also the jobs and that mouth shut down a decade ago and that's the town that was very badly by that population shrank\nAnd the town had to lay off a lot of employees they under was close to bankruptcy and they're trying to pull out of that dive right now I get some other things going but that was certainly a really major shock\nAnd hearts of who's doing what now 'cause I there was at least a one guy I think captured maybe what others are thinking that's you know I'd rather have a what ten employers hiring fifty people then one employer hiring five hundred\n... well that's a very common theme all around me and all of these towns because they all realize that there's danger and being a one horse out it's great when you have that one big bill and playing hundreds or even what House workers and you know paying most towns taxes but\nObviously it's dangerous when you have all your eggs in one basket and that basket just take it away [noise] so what the towns are trying to do is rebuild\nBrick by brick really trying to help small economic wins and they realize that that's a long road it's not easy to do but the hope is that you know as you get further down that road that you're going to call it to me that's more stable\nThan less vulnerable to these kinds of sharks\nYeah we're speaking with John camp whole Street Journal reporter based in Boston he took a trip up the central Maine and wrote a piece titled means mill towns search for new life um what kind of companies might they be looking for state of a an no populate stores on main street or\nHow they might maybe refurbish some of these are empty
