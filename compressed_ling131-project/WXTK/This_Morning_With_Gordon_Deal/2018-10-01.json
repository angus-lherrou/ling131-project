looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes\nI Can't remember this was a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting areas in the rain forest in the woods [noise] um\nThey were like blonde hair blue eyes again just like of aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans it was like they were too perfect\nNot a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the cloud shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\nThey kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they pulled off and they kinda parked a little bit and I I stopped in I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake\nAnd like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life sometimes don't sink in until after the fact and you know I started thinking about it well wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto the road that show [laughter] alone\nHow weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that the records their their sounds it was in those sim woods\nWhere I heard this ah ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal and I don't think of the best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated the sound\nAnd I'd encourage you to find out what coast to coast did with the audio tape they used to play of this a legit big foot recording ten or more years\nGo Georgian or used to play it I think art bell used to play it hasn't been played for years but I heard that up in the shame which is a unique recording never heard of it before I'm starting to buying more and more to the fact that these big which might be dimensional\nMight have the extra terrestrial connection the humanoid that I saw in the woods the more I think about it there's\nI'm Ninety nine point nine percent sure those were not humans and hindsight I'm just glad they didn't take me whatever they were doing up in that area\nWell we're glad to cause a ... you wouldn't have been able to call in presumably thank you Jason for sharing that story that's a that's a pretty strange you need to start carrying some recording equipment with you wherever you go thanks very much try to get one more caller in close to home here Brian in Las Vegas hey Brian what's on your mind\nOh yeah a couple of comments on the on\nThe Michigan for one one on one on previous callers and over quickly maybe to get the story in real quick um I had kind of a big would experience and it wasn't until he played this year sounds like coast to coast they realize that that's what I heard I\nWas up um the Willamette or for national forest it's a lot of ill up between um mount bachelor and a three sisters in Oregon\nAnd um it was up there a late night watching the stars and hanging out and know like to play music stuff that's just kind of hang out somewhere where it's quiet and there's nobody around for\nHours up there and we went down at looking at stars through binoculars and I heard that same sound that he's talking about as best as I Know what he's talking about [noise] um and it had a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else it had this experience but um it was kinda like hey what are you doing up here and I've\nGot a second guessing but [noise] well it's really far away and uh you know maybe I'm just imagining that and\nSo I kept hanging out and look at the stars in about ten minutes past and they closed oh I'd say at least three five miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psychic it personally at all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nAnd me I jumped in my car so that got out of there\nAnd you know I never really piece it together when it was you know I'm like I've heard I Will do a lot of reading once in a while because posted and when the theorists down it was like oh my God that's what it is it has a musician so I listen to overtones and frequency and stuff a lot\nBut I and I'm I'm Sorry I'm apt to cut you off but we're at the end of the program I thank you for sharing that story with the

America's electronic voting systems are more vulnerable than ever what's being done to fix them we're joined now by cyber security journalist Kim Zetter who's got a piece running in the New York times can what kind of security that we have\nIt's really and what I Would refer to his band aid security and there were really not and I'm much of a different shape than we weren't you that the sixteen there are some some some differences some changes but certainly not um ah what you would want\nWhile what are the band aid by the way let's let's let's work backwards I guess\nSo um what's the ... prior to two dozen fixing it reached out to states and it I'm offered the scanning service that it does\nUm what's his name is it simply will scanned the Internet facing system to these where they um the servers like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line\nThe jets will do this remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability that are none south of ... that we know about that um all kinds of patch a valuable\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and um it will keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a bi weekly basis to see when the um the customer has a patch to them\nSo they did that to a few states before um the two dozen sixty left and then they've done that to more states are more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the mound is I think it's a less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it's getting at only the Internet facing system could not getting at the core ... they're supposedly not connected to the in it or not getting at the voting machines at all it's not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nAnd it's often not touching um water the election management systems and these are the system to sit in a county headquarters a there used to program the voting machines and they're also used to calculate the so these are actually the most critical and not the Internet they think that some\nOkay so if if you're an average voter do you walk into a polling place in November with the utmost

Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat\nBut um it's the the ... the situation is not new I Would not tell voters not to vote uh definitely I Want to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is um the back end\nStates and counties need to implement um mandatory audits and they need to have a paper trail is either a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produced paper trail on and they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want to voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't that\nYou point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they\nProvide that type of backup\nUm yes there's so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballot today at all those can be altered um have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines I'm\nHappy to have other idea Nate optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets scanned at the machine for um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um states the

didn't actually do we count a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh assistance and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems

never go down in price and banks had made loans they thought\nWould never defaults and repackage them into securities to make them seem risk list with time even the deepest traumas wear off and there are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from Greg if she economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how to use it\nWe've got to Christ basically because uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk letter was bankers who thought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline in price\nThey essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of us bankers investors and individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether it's in regulations\nOr attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts and crises but it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting do your own household and investors are much ... of risk what's the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example I used to be that aren't really year we'd build one and a half million new homes\nAnd its expansion so far it's more like a million and there's several rates for that one is that well I'm an Asian country so maybe fewer people need homes but also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that's the limited who can buy a house\nI and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess those that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand and the crisis and they've kind of learn to be more cautious they're investing\nAnd so we see investment if you look at housing and business investment combined it tends to be a little bit more muted you don't have as many people going out to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know used to try to hold equity loan to start your new business [laughter] those are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and it sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do [noise]\nSure you have your ... those here and you're ... months there but it really kind of the exception you know it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley what people want is to not start the next Google and Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook the level of new business is being forms actually historically quite low I think it's troublesome I mean essentially\nThat people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nOr speaking with ... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk for a while so you mentioned before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean\nOnce we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or the ... related\nI think it helps explain why would the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bull mark markets climb a wall of worry\nThat is to say if everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people ... and fell into that so in some sense pessimism is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nAnd that similar for the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy project she left like if you've got to bust in a recession now that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well and some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off I don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I think those are the circumstances by about which the risk to start to grow\nAnd if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis\nBut you know risk that kind of like goes away that sort of changes shape it sort of like water running downhill and counter the barrier tried to find a way around it and and we hear happening now some of the risky types of loans have been banks will make like to like heavily indebted companies\nThose are being made by other companies like investment banks are private equity funds so you some sense still have risk out there it's just it forms that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence about whether\nThe system would be safer as a result\n... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal reminder by the way we can connect on social media you can find us on
