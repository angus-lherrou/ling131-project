well no one guy there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that so I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part you know I've got to ask I Believe you did a show from near the man's school reform matory\nYeah we sure did and every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and if I could I'd like to share a love story was sure\nOkay my mother and full blooded Cherokee of Columbian quite a few times a following runoff but anyway ah my father died and three months later my mom she's really depressed didn't know how things were going to work out you know to put\nTwo kids and just before they liked the world cup my father was there\nYou came in the bedroom sit down on the bed mom soon enough he heard gr kissed her and said honey everything's gonna be All right but it's beautiful and the strongest power of everything is love and I was going to share that\nWith sweet mhm\nThese sometimes these stories are just emotional was well Brendan\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part in in my in the ... and the accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative and it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye\nSaying you know it's okay um you know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that there's sometimes paranormal experiences arts uses coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes goes scary scary scary\nVery not like that and realize it's going to join the Bronx I'm just going\nTo a ... good\nI'm Brendan yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe really a story about a full up origin or seen um [noise]\nYeah the um the question is do you think that there is a supplemental under channel of communication going on between the go see a permission and the recipient of that goes to experience\nUm maybe perhaps subconsciously there's this supplemental um communication to weigh communication going going that precipitate the ah grossly apparatus\nAnd appearing and I had a full reparation experience uh after my brother passed away um I sing a song writer and I was having writer's block on a song not related this story before on coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm [noise] he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital\nI'm short of 'em and uh it's it's during the day or at the foot on my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears

a it's a ... before you know maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years\nOkay All right I'm while answer your second question and we'll get back to the first question was like so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know with the husband thing his wife and and the wife kind of said hey check behind the workbench and you find the pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is it happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with a complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother\nAnd I and when you resonate with something it's not just information it's visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that I'm unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there's one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night and he has this\nFeeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog laying in the water injured and\nYou can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow I feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions and then he wakes up cars finds a dog that type of thing so\nYou know why there isn't physical communication or words there is some sort of like I'm understanding or collapse of the uh reading of mind type thing\nWhere do we get the book the girl studies sprinted\nUh the study is available at Barnes and noble a it's an Amazon

believed that said history does not favor the political party of the president during off year elections\nWith a look at three bill whether states that could determine control of the Senate ears Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury side Jerry set this up\nWell so for Democrats to win a control the Senate and the Republicans have only a\nFifty one forty nine margin there so it's a lot of big margin obviously it's the smallest possible but Democrats would still have to defend\nA whole lot of tough states win those states keep ... seats and turn a couple of others in their direction and that is a tall order because I'm a lot of the seats the Democrats have to defend ten of in fact are in basically red states that Donald Trump won so they have to hold on there\nAnd find a couple of others that they can turn their way and when you look at that um the equation that they have to put together\nI was trying to figure out what is it what are the bellwether state that will tell you whether they can pull this off or not and it seems to me there are three of them one is Missouri where Claire McCaskill the Democrat is trying to hold on in a state that is going to increasingly read over the last few cycles\nAnd were she really did have a problem in how to handle the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a there is a liberal base a progressive base in Kansas City in St Louis that was opposed to Kevin all wondering who oppose it which she did but also a southern Missouri is very much Trump country so she's trapped in the middle and\nIf she holds on it'll be because she's Claire McCaskill kind of an institution in Missouri but it's a very tough environment and that's that one out in the ballots should be teaching the important for the Democrats second one is Florida where you have a Bill Nelson a Democrat and other democratic incumbent\nFacing Rick Scott the incumbent Republican governor so that's a big time match between two heavyweights [laughter] very very uh a heavily funded from both sides\nAnd the wild card there all of a sudden is hurricane Michael and does that help Governor Scott 'cause he's seen is leading the rescue effort or does it really hurt him if people think the rescue effort has had been sufficient so\nAgain Democrats need to hold on to that one if they're going to have a chance to answer it is an interesting open seat in Arizona where there's a Jeff Flake a Republican retiring ... there is on his kind of become the ultimate purple state it can go either way ah in any election\nOr and you have to ... you have two women from Congress Martha Mick Sally on the Republican side of course the cinema on the\nDemocratic side in a year of the woman going at it uh well Martha McSally running pretty much as the Trump Republican\nAnd Kirsten Sinema running as a kind of a moderate Democrat in a state that can go in and which direction depending on who shows up and if Democrats are going to flip one to get them to their fifty or fifty one vote a total\nOne of those is probably going to have the Arizona so those seem like the three to watch if you're trying to figure out how this adds up at the end of the night on November ...\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor Jerry Siamese\nBut an online video talking about the three bellwether races that could determine control of the Senate with regards to Missouri in Florida the kind of the late are arriving debatable topics like a cabinet in Missouri and then hurricane Michael in Florida will will those be enough to determine on election outcome\n... that's the great question I it's hard to know is this um [noise] he's going to be late breaking events or is it basically the fundamentals and I think in a certainly in in Florida there's a big question about uh you know who turns out is it\nA a suburban voters or is it Hispanics or is it working class a more conservative voters in the panhandle where where's the turnout going to be and I think in Missouri You have a similar situation in which there is a\nPotentially large voter suburban women for Claire McCaskill but also millennials and minorities those are two groups of voters who simply aren't as reliable uh in terms of just showing up in the mid term election compared to their performance at a presidential election so\nThey're you know events on the ground are difficult to predict but it's also difficult to predict turnout in the mid term there seems to be a lot of enthusiasm on both sides but you know it's easy as in three weeks before the election and actually showing up on election day or two different things\nWhich juries Wall Street journal executive Washington editor Jerry ... it is twenty minutes now in front of
