I'm always thinking among spiritual line here with the decline [noise]\nUm [noise] I I ... bridge will be very seriously I'm interested in a book called the aquarium cock roaches yeah\nI'm from the from the turn of the last century right\nYeah yeah I think it was published and or like you know eight um apparently with what they say according to the production of ... it was kind of transcribe a written transcribe by Levi golly transcribed at home the classic record\nFor no also known as God for book of remember is the way of putting it [laughter]\nI'm fascinated with this book because it is her role in many ways for gospel um and and describing like Jesus and off who covers like that so called missing years of his life\nOf highly ... locking in years or so [noise] um but it does talk about the different ages and that is full of full title of the book is very current gospel of Jesus calmer the price of the highest in age\nAnd somewhere and I'm a I'm not an expert on this book but I'm fascinated with the idea of the return of the Christ and I'm not in a lot of conservative Christian I'm ... I'm more in line with the Quakers and I have a crack at it with the idea of um\nThe beginning of an age and when they get the current age began if their disagreement about\nThat and oh yeah ours is that I'm going because\nThey're throwing I'll go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in or\nIn this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and Neal Marxism and you know all we could ever do is the arise because we can't there's no there's no met a\nData somewhere that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... [noise] so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what something that just otherwise would be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I mean I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I've looked it up several times and\nAnd it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it it's sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time they'll missing so called years I'm big because there's a lot of different books that address that I don't want that they all tell the same story though do you\n[noise] I don't know I'm not familiar with all the ... the only one I'm familiar with it covered right ... years I'm ... I didn't want to\nA wrap it up quickly a lot I could go about this book I wanted to say um I I agree with what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something that earlier caller\nI'm Talking about the live along the lines of\nA it you're you're Christian creatively how are we we all worship something you know whether it's money or sex or materialism or whether it's God him or her so um that we really appreciate that freedom if you're ... you're cooking Russia your way\nI I I appreciate that but I also think that it is it now either that or [noise] sure\nI have an edge because you know we have the freedom but we don't always use it responsibly\nOh yeah we have a responsibility not quite how individually or are we cut it collectively\nCouldn't agree more have some kind of fair value\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political you're I I think what holds us together as a country is I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance or security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut when people talk about the border that makes as a country that's just not true you know is that the border that makes me in Arizona and write or soon to be a a cans and [noise] it's not like we didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think what holds us together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to philosophy should be where every educations START I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers based the entire country I think that's\nWhat we need to always focus on [noise] that's the that's the most important thing to other things are also important that is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot [noise]\nAh for people who don't find it interesting pardon the blather but gosh darn it that was great thank you so much for jumping\nIn an open lines and a look forward to tomorrow night so the most elusive serial killer\nIn history [noise]\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case [noise]\nLet him make that decision I Want to think a George ...

from the train\nOr as scary as that story is um it's still a lot of scary it's respects to some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael Guillen was going to join this just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd if you go to the coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we

there's there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on\nCoast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel the no prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell ah you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I ask you a bit\nLater on a ... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group of science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a lot to tell me and\nYou know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent do me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else should be a great gift for for Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but\nLooking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that are Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in the sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it's more likely that um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or\nThe first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sections in I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about preserving their actions and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of a you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to\nCapture them and then put them into something else [noise] I think it's\nVery real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran must are being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars evolved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nYou know regardless of who
