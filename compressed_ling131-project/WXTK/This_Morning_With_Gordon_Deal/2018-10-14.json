Institute in Virginia and William sounds as they\nSet aside he therapist and he guide you do these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that things just from my experience they love to hear more from William welcome\nTo shadow [laughter] thanks for joining me William\nHi how are you feeling good aid\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create centrist is ten ... out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer and then there should be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was a message to self initiate and out of body experience so\nI explored them and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily exercise um I initiated my first fully conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a\nBeliever but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and\nIt's quite a life change your family who had actually the your tire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is that now you had your out of body experience was South Indian state wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise or that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to developed other techniques to help or negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your hope he will get you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you reach the arm out\nOh no I was not ... I didn't realize it was that you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them standing in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment with a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I at first stepped into here and uh\nOver the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it\nYeah well it's it's it's exciting because you can finally a pain the answers for yourself ... ... that said I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh\nThe indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can\nYou can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience from another words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that\nThe physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible as our our world is and you\nKnow this incredible below that were in\nIt doesn't stop it couldn't stop here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all the system's information than the Indy why would the universe just create one type of human being and that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and and that there is there is trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human and it has\nTo be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you know one of anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent than than we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and union of their meal because especially they feel real you know he was playing because they're usually not a language to really clearly defined what an idiot and mention is\nUniversal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to it passed and all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words\nLanguage is no longer a barrier we we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing\nIt's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere is no um when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say\nTo go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow your classes you teach at the mineral Institute tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called in Asheville tourism [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nOh great in Virginia I'm only\nTwenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop\nI'm generally what I each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron ... and um what is that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in personal isolation both and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber and then I present\nOr that but that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say\nTo people that and there are people that have died but they are law store for instance someone that may have died um quickly and they were just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI can do that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and up\nAt ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guy it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in\nThat um [noise] and\nTo let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMm mhm so to assist him in crossing over have you ever done this after a a tragic incident and national tragic incident where Massachusetts toll free number one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact or during that period of time um that was a that was one of those ... where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way a matching you're having coffee one morning in your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're shifting those are people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and it it's it's functions and different names and different cultures\nBut nothing that I went to ... we\nWe presented in I think I'm more or let's just say are very grounded in a scientific waves at least a scientific as we can ... that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in\nA very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really loud person to have their own experience and all that I went to find out a little bit more about what other cultures\nI got this and what it calls and other countries are going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what other countries just exist and and also a little bit more on how you can get it on your own and eliminate that can make ... million bum and I am ... and\nFind out more about two nights just log on to ... dot com\nAllowing\nOnly won na na\nNa na ... while we were getting\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] this\nIs ... you know your guest does lead cigar\nWelcome back to ... am and what does it you know then I also have a show on the same network that George ...\nIs on on the guy a network if you love watching him on beyond belief you can watch my show there it is called inspirations on guy a cigar and if you check that out inspirations on guy out which is ... ...\n... nine seats in there and we have brand new shows I think yesterday actually it's going to be one of my upcoming guests on inspiration to definitely check that out information on ... dot com I Will be right back with William moment and I mean now you're listening to coast to coast and\nBoy it's going to be a fun twenty Nineteen especially if you're a fan of the live feed her experience everybody producer time here and we're in the midst of planning our twenty Nineteen life stage shows and we're kicking it off with the show in March twenty thirty beautiful Everett, Washington for tickets and information you can go to the coast to coast damn website\nIn the event section where you can call four to five to five eight six seven six six\nFrom there will hit on to Columbus ohio in Fort Lauderdale Florida so please keep checking back with the coast to coast am website show details we found in the event section go now to coast to coast am dot com that's coast to coast am dot com [noise]\nMy ... to try to come and watch them so I had I lodged top condition he's also the biggest killer had just had to stop talking kinda Bora it's just incredible feeling suddenly ... around my heart when I had the auditor and two and a half months later\nSomething amazing ... which will taste while on my hot actually contract staggering about baseball staging a chick Rick ... ...\nYou kind of sweet ... results coming for like a kinda barbaric ... hot excuse the pun ...\nNetworks beautifully on a Richard astro here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system which has heal this gentleman's hot perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fears this powers to he'll visit\nC.
