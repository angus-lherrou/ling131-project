this year President Trump and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi meanwhile are featured in tens of thousands of ads Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie biker which has been looking at the data Julie what have you found\nThat bottom line is that both President Trump and minority leader Nancy Pelosi are turning up in quite a bit of mid term advertising on specific to President Trump we found that he it's only topped by two other issues in terms advertising and that's health care\nAnd taxes [laughter] um so he makes his number three in most common themes in mid term to
