Democrats are considered the favorites to win back control of the house many of the races now tightening or in districts where President Trump won modestly and twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot\nAt a pair of Nevada races it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christine explain this\nWhat I was thinking in particular where races that were kind of not worried at the beginning of the cycle and people didn't think would become competitive back in the last sort of final stretch here have become closer than people expect that they would\nAn over the net in particular and a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge in that\nFilm ATF forty nine percent victory eight fifty fifty three percent the districts you know that he comfortably carried by where there is more room for a Democrat to pick up votes if people have come to satisfy but the president and\nSo one of them was like in ah in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington\nThey all year and there is a third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people and becoming very competitive and that the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie Herrera butler um she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory\nIn recent years but this year has a significant challenge or has been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats and garnered more votes than congressman\nButler in Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as the highest performing Democrat who is a woman named ... she's a political science professor so it's an unusual waste there in that\nUm this hasn't been considered you know one of the sweetest districts but Carolyn lungs campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points um so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight great well\nAll right how about the Long Island New York with the the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYet probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger democratic female opponent\nAnd this is the year when those candidates are attracting a lot of energy and enthusiasm for voters especially female voters um our pool and other polls have shown a gender gap and and it reveals that women\nAre show more of a preference for\nA democratic controlled house and are often more energized to vote this year so you know it's a truism of terms that it comes down to turn out but if that is indeed the case it looks like women are more poised to turn out and that could help\nSome of these female challengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the votes and not a huge blow out for him there\nDraw to speak with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter for peace was called house races tighten as mid term elections near or to about down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman rub what'll\nYes this is an interesting way to I'm going with all its definitely being outweighed by Carole and a boy do who is also a professor at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta so this could have been some one of them are like classics above and battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while one of the factors that could be at play here is that Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down on the ticket and that\nUm but go could benefit from that\nAnd so and as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats and uh so does you know they can see the Republican feel they have a better shot rather than an seating a democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hardy\nAnd then the second ... the the Republicans are optimistic about is currently held by congresswoman Jacky Rosen who's a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada\nUm this is a little bit\nProbably a little bit more of a

Bush in Nineteen Ninety two was the last president to do it it's not unusual for the president you know historically to say what he thinks the fed should do it again it has not happened since Nineteen Ninety two\nWhat is unusual for the president to say things in quite the manner that Donald Trump is obviously Donald Trump has been a kind of a difference in many respects the president and the other example he's saying things about the fact that he's blaming them for the market fell off you're saying that they've gotten crazy\nHe said that they were his biggest threat to them and that's not something that we're really used to seeing rights\nAre so he feels what the fed is moving too quickly raising interest rates\n[noise] that's what he said but part of this is also laying the groundwork to blame the fad ah if anything should go wrong in the economy or financial markets\nAnd you know even though there's some speculation there about why he's doing this if you look at the ... the president has\nInfluenced fed policy the president has a lover [noise]\nThey get to nominate the people that sit on the fed board and the fed bore along with a rotating number of presidents that are not picked by the White House boat every few weeks on monetary policy\nDonald Trump has not pick people who would really take monetary policy in a radically different direction um so what he's doing this just to kind of a running public criticism of the central bank\nAnd the you know the fed faces some hard choices potentially over the next year\nAnd while the fed says presidents or criticism isn't going to change how they operate does you know up the stakes here a little bit because now they know that if anything does go wrong the president is probably going to blame them for it you know\nIf nothing else or as per usual when the president does something like this he started the discussion right so is there a debate now among the experts about whether or not the interest rate hikes are are too sooner too frequent\n[noise] ... exactly right people are always going to talk in the markets about what the fed is doing but President Trump is probably elevating that debate and saying look the unemployment rate slow\nAnd the fed might feel it needs to raise interest rates you know as as a flak disappears and the economy because you don't want to have inflation but with the President Trump is saying here as well world see inflation why would you need to raise interest rates for not seeing an acceleration and inflation\nWe're speaking with Nick tomorrow's Wall Street journal economics reporter his piece is called presidents sustained criticism of the Federal Reserve complicates a tricky balancing act there was one person who sit in your story or it might be more likely that the fed doesn't want to appear to be ... to the president so they might just continue to do the opposite of what he wants\n[noise] that's right the question isn't very ah difficult right now the most officials believe they need to keep raising interest rates so the decision to make right now aren't particularly difficult but that may not be the case a year from now let's say a year from now\nYou have the unemployment rate continuing to fall but inflation's maybe not rising much and so it's a close call about what your models tell you you should do and so the question is on a close call where you don't have as much conviction about the policy pass through the president's criticisms again in your head at all I Know some people who say\nLook this is creating a political risk that they may have to take more seriously the point that you um identify as the other side which says look if markets begin to question the credibility\nThen that's even worse and so it might actually from their backs a little bit but the fed so far as saying we're going to ignore this\nOr we're just going to do what we think we need to do for the economy and if people criticize it and then we'll deal with that\nThat Wall Street journal economics reporter Nick Tim morose it is twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news\nF.
