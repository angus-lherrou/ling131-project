replacing Obamacare but the real action this election might come at the state level here to explain is Maureen ... Washington correspondent at USA Today Maureen what's up here\nAnd there are two issues than us direct way that voters could be a have a say in health care isn't some ballot initiative that we're seeing in Idaho Nebraska and Utah or some of the states that did not go along with the Affordable CARE Act six Medicaid and this time um because because the governors in the state legislature there haven't done it\nBut are trying to to do it themselves they are ... ... they're saying that they want their legislatures their their public officials to go along and expanded Medicaid to people the way of Obamacare intended\nTo do these state legislatures and those three states think they can handle it\n[noise] well there's a there's some some pushback\nFrom state officials in some of those states and one of the interesting things that's going on is that for example in Utah their ballot initiative include the way to pay for the state's share of expansion the federal government pays her most of the costs of the state does have some ... a portion of the cars\nAnd in Maine which was the first state to do this to ... to expand Medicaid true about initiative\nThe governor there has three she has to go along in part because the funding issue so in Utah they're trying to avoid that additional roadblock\nBy including a finding initiative along with their I'm finishing their ballot initiative trial\nSo how similar or the initiatives that are going to be on the ballot in Idaho Nebraska and Utah\n... the main threats as a saying that the Affordable CARE Act allowed expansion of Medicaid up to for people up to earn enough to a hundred and thirty eight percent of\nPoverty I'm the one difference there is the ah the funding element in Utah that goes along with that um this is an issue one reason it still I'm practically and as an issue in state that there's a lot of\nPressure from hospitals particularly rural hospitals and other medical medical providers in these states that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all the federal money available that would help us\nAnd we're not tapping into it even though my tax dollars from our states are going to find these things and you know across the country one argument for why that is happening by mail initiative is there is neither conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public official Republican public officials to look like they're supporting\nThe Affordable CARE Act but if their voters say we want this and there's a way that they they can do it without having to take direct responsibility for it\nWe're speaking with Maureen grabbing Washington correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece titled midterms healthcare is the key national issue but the real action may happen at the state level\nOr could this be a trend where state legislatures are addressing this\nIt potentially to their Seventeen states that have not expanded Medicaid and I'm a Republican\nWho has worked on health care issues for a number of years on on the hill and he said a foreign with healthcare reporters that he thinks if these\nInitiatives these ballot initiatives in these states passed that it it could have started trend for the rest of the states that many of the other states that have not expanded Medicaid but the only thing that's going on is some states that haven't expanded Medicaid interpreted states have been asking Trump Administration for permission to do so but they do so in a different way in a way that\nAdvocates for the Affordable CARE Act don't like such as ah imposing work requirements and that's another issue that play some states might be willing to expand Medicaid if they can do so in their own way but some of the things the way they want to do that\nThat are being challenged in court and we're saying that for example in um Kentucky smoker\nYeah you've written to that point you mentioned a couple of states where governors races or to have an effect on his right\nRight that that's a little bit of a it's not quite as an immediate impact is about and it's just because the governor aren't the only ones in their states that have the say in it they're just in the state legislatures are due to but it's come up as an issue in several governors' races Florida Kansas Tennessee in Georgia where the Democrat candidate for governor saying this is something that we should do\nThat to to look like tiny too I guess that the federal government money would there be guaranteed that would be there every year\nThat's the way the law is written by one of the arguments that are opponents of I'm expanding Medicaid 'em when they get the argument that they're making is that you can't guarantee you can't guarantee the states that funding will be there forever\nSo they and their their argument is that if states get dependent on his federal money and then if the federal government can't live up to bargain of funding Ninety percent or more of the expansion than states are going to be on their own\n...
