confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court legal minds are starting to buzz about who could replace him on the ... the nation's second most powerful court\nThe DC circuit court of appeals has known not only for the cases that region but also for being a pipeline to the Supreme Court more from Lydia wheeler legal affairs reporter at the hill Lydia what's up here\nThe DC circuit court of appeals is this a really in the court on it no not only for the case of that region\nBut also the career short trajectory of though to get on a bench and it's known as the second most powerful court in the country and it has had a a justice and let the justice that chief justice John Roberts Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nOr Justice Clarence Thomas in the late Justice Antonin Scalia all offended from the gate to the Supreme Court\nWell what are some of the names are being floated right now with potential replacements for Kavanaugh\nBy my sources are telling me that this administration is going to look for somebody who really scraped and administrative law\nOn because this is a court but here's and kind of regulatory challenges choose to regulation that the federal agencies issue as well as separation of powers issues to basically at hand or anything and that or any of the uh\nAdministration's actions that are being challenged those are the cases that here\nAt the ... they're actually paying that Trump's regulatory thought Neomi Rao could be on the shortlist and she is the administrator at the White House at the information and they get tore affairs and she'd been instrumental in helping Trump and his goal and cutting down regulation\n... we're speaking with Lydia wheeler legal affairs reporter at the hill she's got a piece called Trump's faces new decision on second most powerful court talking about the DC circuit court of appeals where\nBrett Kavanaugh left when he joined the Supreme Court how eager by the way with the Trump Administration would be to fill this is this something or is it a race against the clock say head of the November midterms\nHow quickly and they're going to look though at that kind of been a little bit lower um I can put them in their main focus was on the Supreme Court and now the ... and we haven't heard any room and they had in a back seat or nominate anybody\nAnd they're not sure how quickly the best and you know they thought that was the question of if they put them on the head of the term\nAnd whether or not defend it would have time to get them ... gets liquid unlikely that they would\nOn because uh all the senators will be leaving and I took it back to their home page on to get ready for the term at though you know and then we have you know what happened in the near term could could really shake up the seat and because that could be held open for a long time especially if Democrats take control the Senate\nAnd the euro too that the the DC circuit court differs from other federal appeals courts and the types of cases it here's how come explain that\nWeight than it is a court that exclusively on it has a special responsibility upbringing rockets challenging federal government action than decision and that means that result constitutional question involving separation that power is shared and challenge it we're making\nAnd so you know it kind of any time like an agency action challenged go directly to that caller\nAre good and it's the the balance right now at least a politically would be what is it like seven Democrats three appointed by Republican something like that\nThat's right so it's a and a court that is most of it stretch it had been appointed by Democrats\nAnd got the cat and I was a a a Republican appointee I mean keep moving on to the Supreme Court to his replacement who would likely be nominated\nBy Trump would be another conservative judge so whoever replaces anything and it changed the ideological balance of the court in any way that one conservative for another day now and just kind of waiting the uh what who the administration to attack\nOn and off the credit for that happening I think at the same thing that we go fix tickled they're going to be paying attention to 'em and could and could get more attention moving or just because the court is interim instrumental and I don't think people realize I'm the type or\nHow instrumental really at all I'm a
