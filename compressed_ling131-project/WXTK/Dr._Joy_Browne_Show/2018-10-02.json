everywhere and I remember we said that was in his intelligent evil dust\nAh because of his quote unquote top secret thing we revealed\nA back last month I mean it was a few weeks ago I Believe about three or four weeks ago we talked about this need classified statement\nThat uh you know somehow they were releasing nanoparticles nano box a and of course Muskie even talked about the ... project with which is another nano technology type of project and\nNano domestic Quayle was with something that we were talking about in the theory in the in the uh delivering so be\nOf no shooting the it'd be classified statements and we said well look barren hurt but hey everybody has them everybody has picked up on them and of course a lot of that said well and everybody knows that this nano particulate is actually connected\nTo more gallons and I'm a Brad Olson called the program who's a writer and he said he has had more gallons or has more gallons he said that everyone can be tested for do we all have their their propensity to develop is because of the nano particles that are in our body\nAnd man I'll tell you people were like going this is nonsense it's a pseudo science this is crazy and now ...\nHe said that he made this he made the statement before\nHe's he's last this was this was his last broadcast that he said before and we don't know what's going on with Julian Assange right now just today well I don't know if I have time to get right into it but uh it was funny because uh today is I was\nLooking over some of the the reports\nAnd in the in the clip service I go in every day and they check out the clip service don't these reports have links don't kinds of stuff with the stuff that I use the stuff that I don't use but I always have to see things in a follow up senses I talked about in the beginning of the program the\nBlowback of course there's always blow back to some of this stuff but when you talk about in all ... back and\nYou have to say well look this is this is how it is now\nBefore we were talking about if you were like God that and now it's like this is the real deal people smart cities uh they're they're saying well we have trillions without one trillion sensors that we have to put in place by the you're twenty twenty\nThe FCC saying you got six Ninety Days to start figuring out how we're going to install smart city networks in your part of the woods and you got to do it quick because if you don't we're going to go in and do it for you\n\nSo this will control spectrum is gonna be mandatory by twenty twenty or at least moving into twenty thirty\nRight\nAnd so the FCC say it's got to be done it's got to be done it's got to be done and people are gonna be moving like crazy and of course you're going to have to pay for this installment of his new matrix of surveillance matrix they want to put in there but how are they gonna move all those sensors\nHow ... put trillions of sensors in place by twenty twenty that's a lot\nBecause that's a lot of sensors putting bike but within two years or even less than two years\nSo how do they how do they fix that problem evil intelligent dust that's the way they do it it's easier to drop\nOf nano particles the size of a grain of sand or a grain of salt and they can do it in that less amount of time I'm sure there\nBe putting sensors that are bigger and and and more capable and and fiber optic and all this stuff with daddy and yeah be restructured could have changed and yeah the matrix of all things are going to change your city of tomorrow weights but while

understand he has to serve at least three years of the ten year sentence let's head over to the cell phone good morning or less I where are you this morning\nThe morning then in reference to a Bill

their money to get him a private guarded taking to the bathroom and taken to the shower taking to the cafeteria is he going to be escorted everywhere because of his condition number one yes ... number

doing life two life sentences that will want to take him up killing to make a name for themselves and so I'm Wondering what is apparently going to do for a Bill Cosby to keep him safe\nThey're probably going to put him away from the general public the prison they're going to take care of him they're going to uh uh they're not going to allow anybody other than the guards and stuff like that near him he's still going to have the ability after thirty days do\nYou know maybe use libraries or do the things that he's going to do and yes there are going to help 'em around because legally he's

Christine Blasey Ford\nAll working for the green economy right and the smart city sounds like a a digital utopia and of course they're pitching into Generation Z this city's from Generation Z\nBut the as far as city is a place where data eliminates first world hassles dangers and injustices that's where they're claiming but there are problems\nAnd see smart cities are are based primarily on data all day and if you want data unique sensors it's not like roads buildings and street lights are just going to wake up magically and started chatting about the weather no\nWe need sensors to see here smell tasting feel on the behalf of these machines\nWe need sensors to tell us when the bridge needs to be repaired we need sensors that tell us have been damaged gonna break we need sensors to remind us or do you tell us that made me a floods about to happen on earthquakes about to happen\nAnything they can be thrown in his data any data information they can get they'll have to do it by using sensors\n\nSensors measure temperature traffic patterns foot traffic air quality infrastructure integrity must go down the list of things that these data sensors are supposed to give us well Lux research and innovation researching advisory firm\nFiled report that suggested the world will have to deploy one trillion sensors by twenty twenty in order to fit\nThe criteria for the UN's edict on smart cities and smart city networks shows redesign smart cities around the data we want instead of the wiring we have\nThis is where it gets more complex because mass data aggregation will establish a lot of truth about how our cities are being run it's going to lead us to a social credit score for you or me and everyone else and a social credit score\nOn the quality of life metrics that each city will have so let's say you want to make a choice on where you want to move your family you could look in a smart city or\nThe smart city metrics guide based on a number of based on social credit based on what kind of people live there for the social credit scores are extremely low in a part of a different part of the country people don't want to associate with people with a low credit scores\n\nAnd so we're going to create you know where to move everybody in the city and then we're gonna have to figure out which cities are the best in the most desirable vibe behavioral Bye bye bye have your data data by a way of life data or the quality of life data okay so we're going to sign these smart seems to be perfect and then the aggregation\nWill be reviewed and we'll be adhered to and it's going to lead us to score cities is the latest the score people uh you know it'd be like one big Yelp fast have you ever been to Yelp you know you can destroy your business by giving a business a bad review on Yelp\nIf you get enough people to rally around the basically a you know a right some bad stuff about a business you do that on Yelp yeah chosen business right there and there are businesses that have sued\nTo get yelled to remove certain things because people look at that and they go oh well managing that being you twenty four hours a day I imagine that being your city twenty four hours a day but how are we going to drop one trillion sensors\nBy twenty twenty okay that means we have to drop a trillion at once we we can't do it we can't drop you know one\nSense or a year or even a million ... a year or once a year you you can't do that right and so it can be difficult to meet that by twenty twenty\nSo how do we do is how do we how do they get the problem with the smart city taken care of\nWell we do it with dust\nWe do as smart as we do it would then particles we get I mean look I was discussing this to the ground zero around and said this is the future this is the
