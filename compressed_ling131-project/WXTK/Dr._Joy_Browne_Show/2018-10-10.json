which forecasters say is now better organized\nWhat I'm beginning to realize something and that is I I should have done this a long time ago on my show but I think the reason why I did is because I didn't think it would be a popular thing to do but now I don't care if it's popular or not\nBecause I had made a commitment\nTo all of you to be truthful to tell the truth can be as honest as I can be with my radio program\nAnd that he is\n[laughter] I Know there's a drinking game out there so please get your drinks ready when I was in South America and I lived there and I lived there in the middle of well it was ever event in the middle of his towards the end of their civil war that was there the dirty war but it was more of a civil war I saw civil war and a whole new light it was different than the\nTwo sided civil war we had in the Eighteen hundreds it was uh something else it would civil war in contemporary time it was it was civil war in a in a in a major city\nWhen I say when the Saudis I'm sure many of you think that it's just some backward city in South America no it's it's actually a\nSouth America is Spain or France or or or it it had the feel of Italy or France or or Spain or any of the European cities it's it's an amazing city very or urban very ah advanced but an advanced technologies there\nBecause they try them out down there seemed to work down there they do they come up here sometimes it's the other way around\nAnd so the biggest concern\nFor a lot of Americans is what's going to happen to this country what what is going on and when you speak of bike civil upheaval in civil war and you say to yourself well it's not there yet or we should people have said quite it's not there yet\nBut I'm Wondering you know Judy know did they ever lived through one do we know what it's like to live in one\nAnd\nI said to myself that maybe I've waited too long to talk about the reality in and and how\nWe're smack dab in the middle of a reality that is out of control\n\nI mean we have new laws do you have executive orders that pretty much enable the president\nTo act would be emergency powers act I mean he could make plans any time to just\nArrest people you know and I've heard the rumors that that's probably in the works some sort of a\nA rush structure somehow they're going to go after they're just making the plans to see a big illegally go after people who have been creating problems in this country that would be a more or less involved with what I call this this this island or or this or you know very soft coup\nOr the the soft espionage or you know it's all it's all get soft espionage soft\nCoup other behaviors with a you know certain people\nAnd how uh you know they they try to say that it's a constitutional behavior when it's not I mean look\nI Know that if you say that if you say well maybe the president's planning on doing that he's planning on exposing all the way back to twenty sixteen some of the problems we have even during the Obama administration even before that the Bush administration or a response to that would be well here we have political sour grapes\nAnd the political sour grapes you get political splinter groups and with political splinter groups you get the uh marginalizing fragmentation of our republic\n\nAnd believe it or not it's a fragmentation of our republic the destroys then it will destroy us for sure\nAnd\nThere will not be and there is not I repeat there is not a unanimous front\nAgainst an abusive government does unanimous front against ourselves\nAnd we're easily exploited easily exploited by political Jagger nuts that have been hijacked\nBy neo cons anarchists socialist anti ... black lives I go down the list okay and the media basically all the American people like sheep and it being ... and what they're doing is they're basically encouraging what I call divisive coats\nAnd these groups do nothing to further the cause of change it solves the entire\nProcess as it appears to be mired in nothing but fanaticism\n\nWere stuck in this Myra fanaticism is beyond protest signs and pepper spraying people camping in parks or a pepper spraying the homeless or what did the overall feeling here in America\nIs that it's wise to have a gun\n\nOr everybody's saying the gun violence should be curbed that you should you know revisit the second amendment there are many people who say that that are still\nWanting armed security and they think it's wise to be armed to have a gun concealed carry and you're feeling in the United states is if you don't have at least a gun\nThen you should have at least some stored food batteries radios you'll become swallowed up into the onslaught of attacks in the homeland from an unseen enemy but be unseen enemy has been seen we're identifying the enemy all the time the enemies within and the enemy is among all of us\n\nBack or what was it um you have a few years ago\nActually show this program I says I think it's wise to know and and find out just to your neighbors are\n\nAnd I said you know maybe we shouldn't organizer neighborhoods on her own or the or else someone will come in and do it for us\nBecause the cloud that hangs over the United states now\nIs it no group is safe unless it's legally armed organized openly advocating return of more localized government state constitution rules against the federal government\nRun amok um I remember it was a civil war of the Eighteen hundreds that brought us the bloodiest conflict on American soil and that was our first war veterans right there\nYou actually they were having Lincoln an Eighteen sixty was the final straw for many southerners in an all eleven states or their religion states that ... that succeeded from the union for these Virginia Arkansas and North Carolina Tennessee did not succeed until after the battle for Sumpter that occurred on April twelve fifty sixty one five additional states were border slave states\nThey didn't succeed for the union Missouri Kentucky West Virginia Maryland in Delaware\n\nNow we're not talking about the session tonight I'm not even though there are a number of\nStates foods that basically says they want it to you know form their own governments maybe like California's been when they want to separate the three states and and Texas has always been wanting to get out of the union and they have a you know their constitution says they can\nBut Americans have been angry with government from from way back I mean ... when\nObama was president they wanted us to see now with Trump president they want us to see they want to but they say they want to move to Canada and all this other stuff in the fall but just trivial path that they like to spread out there to make themselves look important\nBut\nA lot of this has to do with the end of the the the thought that the it was a part in the declaration of independence I want to jump to a historically an actor but I think it's um there's a I'm\nA part of the declaration independents that says something that the governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes

told that it will never get that bad quiet and then I fear mongering for the sake of clicks or ratings or whatever you think I'm doing well I always say back to people\nBut it's certainly cynics bitter there in order to keep telling yourself that America is still United however it appears that that ship has sailed and living through a civil war in South America can teach you what to expect and it it's a real experience that I talked about that in the first hour\n\nI mean I Want to make it clear that during a civil war in a modern day in a modern city modernist city like when I ...\nI mean life was normal except for little things would make you wonder if you would make it through the day or if you will be able to do routine things I mean I can imagine the United states the civil war would be similar\nExcept that we have the Internet that's the difference the I mean the outbreak of a civil war in the United states wouldn't look all that different to the normal news cycle\nRegularly you know and that's the thing that I think people don't understand it doesn't look different than the normal news cycle and would they would regularly report it's the same thing I mean it begins with something like a politically motivated mass shooting\n\nAnother example would be a biological attack on the United states either in a major city or directed at Congress wrote to the president\n\nI Know I've talked about the final blow I don't know if that was the final blow but it certainly sent the ball rolling\nBecause it was a political attack using rice and a poison that was aimed at certain people including the price of the United states if they would have sent all that the members of Congress we would have had an attempt to the decapitation exercise\n\nWe all know that the anthrax attack happened in two thousand one after nine eleven attacks\nSeattle we have the rights to check that happened just before the cabinet vote\nWe talked about the Russian ... called an al ... tried to use biological warfare is a way to get people not to vote or to somehow change the direction political you have an area here in in Oregon I mean these are simple politically motivated attacks\nAnd these attacks are usually supposed to not only change directions politically but they're also there to generate copycat attacks\n\nAnd these can be both domestic terror attacks in foreign attacks whose sole purpose is generating a backlash they're simply done in order to provoke a response if there were sponsors overwhelming and police department's going to keep up with a politically sectarian violence then we will see the next phase of civil warfare\nAnd that is the domino effect if there is an insurgent\nThe domino effect you shouldn't play military crackdown on any kind of insurgency will be inevitable this will be your martial law scenario except it will\nGene approached it officer because of her background and she asked if an ambulance or EMTs had been

did this to her but she was heartbroken because she was trying to do the right thing and was met with violence by the officer she is pressing charges by the way\nGene expressed to me how she felt but not only was it an attack against your home and her community but um it's ... attack against women at a time where the division against men and women are not big news story\nAnd it's going to get worse virtually\nEvery major American institutions being radicalized you're being reshaped by the radicalization of our public lives and since the president's election reporters on both sides of the

so right now we're in a unconventional so or at least that you\nKnow it's an unconventional all the civil war this is how civil wars are fought in in modern times it's not about dying it's about

it it's a civil war I mean what what what do you expect that show\nIf you compare it to our first civil\nCivil war was the first civil war this is an unconventional what you want a Confederate union

the angry mobs and\nOh well that's another thing you know civil war President Trump has no power let's he wants to enforce a sedition what'd you haven't done so I mean he has in civil wars there are no power the president will not be park as we want to do what they want anyway and the argument with one\nClient at the doors that looked like a scene out of the walking dead is exactly right\nBut you know what's interesting is some of the tactics that are being used like a giving out the first cell phone numbers of people in the address is yeah and confronting people at their whole set restaurants in the halls of Congress\nRight and this is this is ... this is conversion theory because what it does is it can ... people over to be the same way it starts the domino effect if one person decides to harass another person or another person or another but it all happens it happens it happens\nI mean you know uh it wouldn't mind Maxine Waters said to harass people she should have been taking in and she should've been talk to but she didn't she got away with it and now people are doing it\nWell Maxine Waters and uh what's the guy's name Corey Booker or something like that Cory\nLet her know but anybody who sit there and encourages this type of a yes\nThey've been encouraging this type yeah anger\nYou know immediately to the media doesn't too they encourage you to\nWell I I think it could lead to assassinations because\nIf you look in our past oh remember we used to have abortion doctors that were assassinated mhm\nAnd and this is the level of hatred that we're at right now that it you know if you're confronting somebody in a restaurant or at their whole who's to say that they don't have a gun and they're not going to assassinate somebody", "city": "West Yarmouth"}
