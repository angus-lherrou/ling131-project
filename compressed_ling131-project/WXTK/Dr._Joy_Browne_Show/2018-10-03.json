something after the eclipse you know last year I said hey this is going to be this eclipse and then we better be prepared for something happening because you know\nUm we see the ah\nWe see the repercussions of everything happening you know September through through October and then we have the shooting and uh of course ah when I was talking with Alex about nine eleven\nUm I say I said to him I said you know you look at what they you know the project for new American Century look at what they wrote about in the new Pearl Harbor idea that they produce the demand you are the signatories on the on the document\nAnd said you look at the uh you you look at what they've written about new Pearl Harbor and then they then they said that there was going to be or there can be a even a a biological attack since we're a biological attack\nThat could happen and ah it would certainly uh make differences in political movements that would change the way politics would run and of course I'm In nine eleven you know during the nine eleven attacks after nine eleven attacks in fact I Believe it was a\nJust a few weeks or a week afterwards and then everything you know started happening and it wasn't until about like October fourth I Believe of ah\nOf two thousand one where we started to see that many people were dying from exposure to anthrax\nAnd so I'm Jones said to me you know when I was on the air with him I said uh what do you think the final ... going to be and I says I said to him I said well I you know I kind of hesitated bit because I was afraid to commit to something because you know you commit to something like if you if you if you're a born again preaching say the world's going to and\nLike if it's going to end at the end of the ... you know damn good well it's not going to write because just saying it makes it not happen um so I told him I said I'll tell you it's a biological attack on the United states\nAnd ah I said\nYou know things are just kind of bizarre right now I talked about the ... to exercise and I talked about the\nThe er the pandemic and they told them about how they're all being ... they're all preparing we have all these uh\nYou know tabletop exercises about biological pandemic advance biological attacks and um you know the idea of a biological attack or some sort of biological chemical weapon being use I you know we speculated on many different ways\nOf this would happen will be carried out whether it would be through an arrow slice attack\nOr you know made him skied owes it'd be released I I was very surprised though\nUm\nIt was very surprised and and I and I and I wasn't I guess because I I wondered when it was going to happen I didn't think it would happen today but I read today that the Pentagon reporter that envelopes containing the biological poison and rice and\nArrived at the Pentagon I'm the opposite the president's Senator Ted Cruz is office\nSo I'm a biological attack or happen today um\nBiological poison rights than I'd taken from caster beans I remember when you know back in the day with made you drink castor oil in order to purge crap in your body well there's a reason why is because Castro beans can be made into poison\nAnd um it's a it's it's rice and\nAnd it was reported in the two packages containing rights than were intercepted on the way the Pentagon\nAnd he was confirmed by the department of defense officials that the parcels were there they indicated that the um the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flagged mail delivery building\nWhich is located next door to the defense department's massive headquarters in Washington DC\nAnd you know I'm\nThe FBI now is involved with this and they they're actually been called in to\nLead the investigation into the packages which are addressed the secretary of defense James Mattis Angie of naval operations admiral John Richardson and of course there was a letter sent to the president um here's the FBI statement they said uh this is the FBI or the statement they they issued\nOn Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen in coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents to possession of too suspicious armed groups\nThat have been screened at the Pentagon mail facility those on the lips are currently undergoing further testing is this is ongoing we will have no further comment\n\nSo as the Washington DC area work to determine the origin of the rights that attack news also broke out the two individuals have been hospitalized after being exposed to a powdery substance in the mail send to the Texas set to Texas it was a actually a ... it wasn't in Texas it was um [noise]\nIt ... I maybe I'm trying to figure out it was his office Ted Cruz's office where it happened yes there was in Houston, Texas Houston, Texas they sent a Senator Ted Cruz is off as a a writes you as well or two people were hospitalized or we don't know um\nHow they're doing a cruise office said they received a piece of mail\nAddress the Senator Cruz this morning when the male is open it contained the white powdery substance the ninth floor of the Phoenix tower\nWas evacuated after the packages found the Pentagon also reported that rice and was the fact that in the mail and of course the writes them since President Trump\nSo um you know so as we predicted um this has happened much like what happened I mean if you remember a half a dozen leather letters um\nContaining anthrax spores were mailed to journalists and politicians beginning one week\nAfter the nine eleven attacks for leaders was spores and threaten messages have been some recovered all were post smart from Trenton New Jersey which meant that they had been process as opposed to the distribution center in uh actually near Hamilton jewelers or post marks September Eighteenth want address the Tom Brokaw NBC\nTV\nAnd another was sent to the editor of the New York post the other two letters for stamp October ninth and address the senators Thomas ...\nAnd Patrick Leahy so as people became infected in September October and November local\nResponses revealed gaps in preparedness for biological attack for example the first confirmation of anthrax case was on October fourth\n\nIn more than two weeks after the initial as her male so I mean we look at the retrospective assessments of all this and um\nWe we learned that nine people they were exposed to um\nThe rice in African ... about the rising sorry the anthrax had already contract\nTo visit the or their illness previously had been missed identified because faulty diagnosis erroneous laboratory\nTests but in the end the final result at the end or in the end twenty two people had become infected\nFive of them died meanwhile they were buildings that were\nBelatedly found to be contaminated with anthrax spores and they leave from the letters or at least thirty thousand people who are deemed at risk required prophylactic antibiotics except for all and millions more fearful and many of them anxious about opening their own mail after that\nNow\nLot of this information then I'm telling you right now about the anthrax attacks I'm sure many people have forgotten and there's a lot of stuff that after doing research I found out that I did not know about I I did not know there were plenty of other buildings that were leaking some of this\nUh some of his you know biological a powder and uh the anthrax spores I had no idea\nAnd show\nThe seriousness of the rice you attack I Believe I'm you know warrants a lot of questions one is is this would this be considered the first assassination attempt on the president [noise]\nThe

yelling and talking about this ah\nBut yeah I told him that I felt it would be a biological attack on the United states I speculate on many different occasions\nThat this will be carried out because I started off talking about ... ... in may I talked about the the tabletop exercise of a pandemic so there there are preparing for some biological attack some\nContamination some toxic release um I talked to gain a function exercise is something that most people don't know about and I'm bringing to the forefront of talked about how sometimes in order to do a test run they they take a lesson virulent form of something and they released into the public\nIs test to see you know how people react to it\nSometimes they provide them with Anna does sometimes they see how many people check into a hospital how many people stay home how many people bring it to work that you know it's just the way for a the CDC and others to to to monitor the moving the disease and some people do support this and a lot of people say it's not good to do this but they do it anyway\nUm\nApparently this new t._v. show about doctors called New Amsterdam\nOr apparently that was a ... that's a show that's on TV Now and somebody had said that it deals with a guy who gets a bowler Andy brings it to the United states on a plane\nAnd of course we talked about the arrow play we talked about you know the situation that happened ah with the uh Emirates plane for other planes where uh you know there was a different diseases monkey pox and uh gosh all kinds of things are happening\nAnd it's all happening at once and they said this is a is is again of these again a force exercise\nAnd ah I said you know something is going to happen where are the real thing is going to go down and when it does you know we'll know that this the beginning this is the beginning of the final blow them\nAnd so I actually well and it could have been ... through the camp trails that could be you know given through mosquitoes and so today I read that the Pentagon reporter the envelopes containing biological poison rice and arrived at the Pentagon\nOr the office of the president and senator Senator Ted Cruz's campaign office so two packages containing rice and\nWhere is intercepted by on the way to the Pentagon and the existence of the suspected packages was had been confirmed by the department of defense officials who indicated the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flagged in the mail delivery building on Monday\nBut in an ounce and they were here until Tuesday that was located next door to the defense department and right there is at its headquarters the FBI has been called in now\nTo lead the investigation into the packages which we're addressing the secretary of defense James ... that there was an address to James Mattis\nAchiever naval operations admiral John Richardson and the president said Cruz's office the FBI released this statement this is a statement\nFrom the FBI on Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen in coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents took possession of too suspicious angle ups that had been screamed at the Pentagon mail facility\nHe's envelopes are currently undergoing further testing and this is ongoing will have no further comment on this\nShow as Washington DC has been working to figure out if this you know this was any threat to the president Ted Cruz's office said they received a piece of mail that was addressed that Senator Cruz happened this morning when the male is open to contain white powder and so the night for the Phoenix tower was evacuated after packages found\nPentagon also reports that rice and was detected and that uh and and so we're having a full on biological attack biological\nA poison rice and and just reminded me if you remember when I was talking about the project for the new American Century I said something to the fact that ah one of the other ways that they can change the direction of anything politically is to use biological\nWarfare and even biological warfare that has a certain abilities to mark\nA\nYou know biological markers that would you would actually activate this stuff and and rice and acts upon your DNA if ingested or if it's injected if you inhale it it's a you can survive a inhaling a rice and it's just that you can die if you're not taking care of\nSo uh it's just some uh pretty scary stuff going on right now and so you know timing is everything and uh I think that uh once again we're seeing history repeating itself because remember back in Nineteen eighty four the Russian each called here in Oregon tried to poison the group of people to try and change the vote\nA in Dallas, Oregon and uh\nI think here we're seeing a somebody trying to either stop the investigation into cabinet or to believe that the investigation into Kavanaugh or what they're doing is they're trying to find a way\nTo um distract us from it ah there's there's a number of things you know especially going down during this time that that I think is volatile time in this country and ah I said the other night on the ground zero lounge they probably will have this investigation wrapped up by Wednesday\nThey'll hand down their decision and the American people probably won't hear what the decision is and they don't have to the FBI doesn't have to reveal anything about their investigation they could put it to a vote and cabinet can be confirmed and I think it would trigger a lot of anger\nA lot of people in this country if Kavanaugh actually becomes chief justice and so tomorrow it to Eighteen eastern time they're gonna be doing that test than emergency test on your telephone so as I said timing is everything this is peculiar\nAnd uh I think we should have a discussion about this because I think that uh you know as we were predicting it I predict it on our showing the show I talked about it at great length on this program for a good long time and people who is this program know lived on this people who list is ...\nBut ... if I'm On to something and I see the patterns these things go down and when they go down it's not necessarily to the exact no because I remember we talked about the pope stepping down when Ratzinger step down and we said oh you\nKnow he would probably lead retired die within three months he left the ... you left the papacy\nAnd one of my friends was really blown away by this but it was because we could see you know the talk we heard that we heard the Marines and rumors coming up from Rome and there are several other times in instances where we have a pretty much reported ... be prepared for the students out but\nWe're not always right before damn close believe it or not for damn close and so we're obviously seeing the beginnings of what would be the final blow if\nIt gets out of hand they'd be prepared because if the word goes down tomorrow back cabin off some people aren't pleased we can see some more civil unrest and some of the major cities across the country [noise] so we have to prepare for that not that it will happen but\nRepair if it does happen [noise] truly

today ... ... what happened to the court system back there they let them go on a bond\nYou know you know we've had that conversation or mess but anyway this cabinet thing now I understand that a correct me if I'm wrong\nOr ... I was actually discussed is whether it's been ten years of marriage is that what is that it would\nI have no idea how long they were married and they said two thousand in or was it two thousand twelve they went to see a therapist because they are having problems in their marriage and I guess that's when this came up items\nOkay well that's my point um she is she going to testify why wouldn't they have been ... been buying the\nIll refused suggest upon that mean to you know they'll they'll ask for the eastern I can I I I don't he's never going to say anything against his wife and nobody has to\nNobody ever will Bob well that's not what I'm ...

know what it could all end tomorrow\nAnd you won't know what the decision will be and people will freak\nOut those who are all you know invested in this those who are like harassing people like Mitch McConnell and others those are invested in this we need to be careful because you know anything can happen at this point in with rice and being a delivered to you know the Pentagon some addressed to the president I don't understand why\nThis is not being investigated and and uh people aren't wondering if this was an attempt to assassinate the president\nFor in a in a more broader sense a decapitation exercise because they make good sand do all of the uh the people involved with the cabin off for case you know packages of rice in ... they could have killed at every single one of them or make them sick enough or too sick to vote\nAnd they said before a this is something that the ... called did back in Nineteen eighty four and this would be considered probably the second\nA biological attack or there would be a domestic terrorist attack to actually toward a vote or decision\nTripoli six Seventy three thirty seven hundred and go to Ben in Pennsylvania Hi Ben you're on ground zero\nHey how you doing good I'm really excited to talk to you good but um I I'd I'd rather be at a nice taverns drink a beer with yet but this is the second best okay great [laughter]\nBut uh no ... yeah I have a couple of different thoughts um I Do I like how you uh you know you always see these patterns and it is interesting we're right before that that called them are that that text tomorrow [noise]\nUm the the thing I keep thinking is is a couple of things is you know is it possible that I mean it's not anything is possible but is it possible that this could also be a distraction or I use that word by word but\nCould it be that actually the right side the right wing so to speak\nYeah could be putting this on as a distraction or whatever I'm too you know get some sympathy or whatever and then the other thing would be is um it's kind of interesting that the targeting of course Donald Trump you know he's the head of the right and then you have\nTed Cruz which if you Peru's Facebook\nYou know everybody seems to he hey Ted Cruz even though he's not really in the squalid anymore and the other interesting thing is is that Ted Cruz at one point wasn't he kind of a a guy that would have been considered to be a good a Supreme Court nominee so\nWell I don't know forgetting to bench a secretary of defense James Mattis was targeting also chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson was it was also targeted\nSure yeah I don't I don't know where their political affiliations law but\nBut see that's the thing is is that if this was I mean obviously this is politically motivated\nOr we don't know do it for what reason it was politically motivated I Would say it was just work the investigation and the book the confirmation vote\nI think that yeah it would give them a reason to we're going to stop this right now and we're going to investigate who was involved with sending the rice and but it's not going to stop the FBI the FBI's already made the decision and and I know they've already made the decision because uh you know uh actually we were to ground zero Allen's discussing this and somebody said to me they said well\nThey're going to wrap this up by Wednesday they don't have to wait till friday they said well at ... weeks time they don't have to wait all they have to do is go back over should existing papers get all their ducks in a row dot the I's properties come back give their decision the vote goes down he gets confirmed the American people were dumbfounded they don't know what's going on\nPeople who don't like the idea get angry and they started harassing people even more and maybe even worse than that\nAbsolutely and and the other thing is it's it's just um\nAnd if you're like the classic look of our rhino fireworks

kept them from going anywhere near the White House so they were sent I'm sure there was sent yesterday or the official announcement income today because they were wanting to inspect\nAll the mail to find out of rice and was involved and made the announcement the rice and was in the package is one of the of course\nSend to the president United States but what I find interesting is no reporting of this on other major networks none in fact that they're focusing again on the ah there was again a cabin on board in fact right now they're talking about the protesters I just talked about confronting\nOf course the Mitch McConnell and others of course giving in the faces I mean like they do it's like you're not getting in the faces of the senators\nAnd basically blaming them and saying that the Republican Party is the party of rapist and and this is this is amazingly out of line in my opinion\nYeah it totally out of line\nSo I mean who knows if he was responsible for these rice it and who knows what the motive is\nBut it just all sounds like it like I said the Nineteen eighty four tempted thwarting a boat or changes vision on a boat by the Russian each called in Oregon in Nineteen eighty four it's the same ammo\nIf the same purpose to somehow stall or otherwise uh for the efforts of either the FBI investigation or the voting for senator cabinet\nYeah\nSo yeah the

nine eleven and a matter of fact that morning at nine eleven forty a fight our\nHead hunter reporter's stand outside and look at senator name that guy ... ... and and the investigation on the ... shouted lady remember that\nYeah I remember that it it after the planes hit the towers\nAnd they was getting a function of the art but after the towers that story was that was God I didn't hear about it\nOr have you been to China levy yeah I mean but she she disappeared in May of two thousand one right and uh yeah I mean that was the the hot news item into the the towers went down and then that everyone was like by after that you know no more are talking about Gary Condit\nWell I'm thinking this is comparable with Kevin for\nWell I I yeah I but Gary wasn't planning on a a ... ... being a chief justice [laughter] which I mean once again we have an extramarital affair story we have\nA a dead woman Chandra Levy a we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map after that no one cared about the because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know there's a ... that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have that but uh I Would say that you know they're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people lost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case\nWould Gary Cohn did that is if they were able to look through the ... the nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I tried to put that on out there and I'll let you get to know that not a good\nVery good point though very good comparison history you get your brownie points for being a story and I think it ... and I loved it and you've been I Love you too man skilled at TJ in Rhode

this two plus there are a plus one plus eight at up to\nUm London\nOh that's right and when was nine what was what was that date back in September and\nThen I ... when when I was\nOne plus one add up to nine plus one plus one\nYep twelve\nNine oh one eleven sorry that's right although nine eleven had\nThe total eleven twenty Eighteen eleven you have this thing going on at two Eighteen as you said right which is an eleven\nEleven yeah and we just had a jogger who was murdered in DC not too long ago\nRyan Miller to what was discussed just recently by the previous caller\nRight Kentucky yeah it does have an air quality to it and\n... you might want to get technical when was the ground broken for the Pentagon\nWhat I've what day was that September eleventh All right yeah\nI Would say just one thing but I was calling up about the rice and and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side\nBecause if you recall back in terms of predicting programming what happened to the general in Venezuela where they accused him of staging his little assassination attempt with that drone ... might have tip\nTheir hand right they're letting you know in advance what was coming\nWhile I mean you can see that there was something going on with these uh when I called these gain and function exercise I Believe the Emirates plane was part of that\nI Believe that when you have a group of people on the on the plane and they all complain of flu like symptoms all at once that's not a flu that's something else and it does\nSmack of of rice and poisoning and I'll just to be cleared Nineteen forty one nine eleven September eleven Nineteen forty one was in the Pentagon round was broken for the Pentagon then so you know nine eleven to be a talked about two\nMen then remember overseas there's a lot of provocative behavior taking place upon the part of the United states where there were already threatening to strike a Russian missile or install installation because of start treaty violations and they're moving a shift to the ass off to see a off\nOf the Ukrainian coastline over there and they're Crimea right and so I mean there's a lot of powder keg occurring right now within the world\nRight and so there are a lot of distractions but the thing is is that how are these distractions affecting the vote how are they affect you invest all\nThe vote I Will tell you you don't have to I wouldn't even worry about it because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down to that is going to be a dramatic decision that will be the battle cry\nWill be confirmed yeah and when he finally does make a decision for something that will become a fifty fifty unpopularity then it will be pointed out that while you can politicize a court you can't make it political\nHow would you feel though if the FBI did not release the information about Kavanaugh and his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I Would be ripping but I've also ripping based on the fact that there's this ... this a speculation on the part of Fox News that they're going to already be finished by\n... now you have the astronaut elation CJ I'm Sorry to tell you it's not speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when as far as news that I heard it already from inside of that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just a value wait a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell and they wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but I doubt metro call has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nDoesn't matter they're getting what they are getting and the American people are going to a prize over it and that yeah well that's what I really don't\nCause you when you when you start playing with the very last word because it's not right because that's the last word but it's ... it's the last it's ... it's the last word not because it's right but because it is the last word why don't you start making something from politicized the political that nobody's going to have\nFaith and or in in the integrity of that institution anymore\nWell I think we've lost faith Eighteen years ago you didn't really I Do I did and I have that's why I'm not political\nWell see

and and number three there's got to be somebody that has nothing to lose somebody doing life two life sentences that will take want to take him up killing can make a name for themselves so I'm Wondering what is apparently going to do for Bill Cosby to keep him safe\nThey're probably going to put him away from the general public the prison they're going to take care of them they're going to uh uh they're not going to allow anybody other than the guards and stuff like that near him he's still going to have the ability after thirty days do\nYou know maybe use libraries or do the things that he's going to do and yet they're going to help 'em around because legally he's blind but I don't think they're going to let them or anywhere near the general population or whatever prison finally
