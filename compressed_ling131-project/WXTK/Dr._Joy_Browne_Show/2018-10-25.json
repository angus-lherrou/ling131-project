Trump and chief justice Cavanaugh\nI mean who would even think that it would be part of the mainstream to say which is gathering from all over that area are banding together\nTo put a curse on Donald Trump but something more than a binding spell on Donald Trump\nCabinet though got the worst of his was a harm spell his was the harm spell we had a cold writer Thomas shared it on the program exist Sherman in the cold writer and he said you know\nHe called us we're on with him he was in Ireland we were talking with him and he says these spells will somehow backfire\nAnd cause harm to America cause harm to the families cause harm to the children cause harm to America you said this is what will happen ... last night remarkable show that was Paul ... appeared on the show to talk about the

spiritual form of Armageddon taking place\nThere are those who see the material world crumbling with geopolitical tensions that went analyze you know when you analyze them thoroughly it would be considered civil war in other countries I mean they'd say well look at every ... ... we're on the outside looking into what's going on here we'd say ooh that\nCountry's in civil war today I woke up uh with the news\nAbout these suspicious packages that allegedly contain pipe bombs that were sent to the Clintons the Obamas and to CNN's offices in New York and this happened today after George Soros the yeah the suspected\nExplosive device putting his mailbox\n\nWell this is ... mass hysteria in the news rooms that are predominantly left wing and and and and the left wing mouth pieces are simply speaking for the resistance now and it's all Trump's fault again\nBut this is happening it's got to turn down the rhetoric stop saving news is fake all these they use the excuse is to just explain the attack is similar to\nThe rice in biological effects that happened before the Kavanaugh decision was made it is I reported there would be a final blow event\nIt was certainly affect us remember I said that the final blow and I said it would be a biological attack and I was asked to be on the Alex Jones show and I declared there I said it will be a biological attack\n\nAnd when it happened I was suspicious of it because um it failed and and it didn't you know it was a biological scare okay\nWhen I was thinking that this would be a trigger that would create copycat attacks so I was asked to go on the uh go up to begin to go into the ... when the infowars again\nAnd Alex asked me what is next quiet what do you think is going to happen next and I said well we're not going to bend would start a war footing in the United states\nAnd he said I agree I agree well today I was notified it'd be tempted bombings and it was sent an email\nThat featured in October third at twenty Eighteen article for the Daily Beast and this was a headline said Kevin are could be the final blow\nFor Democratic Senate everything happening around the issues the final blow\nIs about Kavanaugh Senate war what comes with is asymmetrical leaves me they symmetrical attempts at a decapitation strike all is it appears to be perpetrated by deep intelligence conspirators within the opposite agencies and you can call it an inside job if you want\nBut in order to declare it a false flag which I hear everybody calling it there has to be\nA suspect in order for the accusation mystic but what I mean by that is we need to see what they decide or who they decided to bring forward as a suspect in so far there is no suspect which it makes it even more suspicious that this uh this is a bad day false flag if it if it's a false flag it'll okay\nIt really did happen yes the pipe bombs were sent me didn't blow up any one\nBut I Want to know who they decide dependent on and then we'll know just how keeping how many gaping holes are are in the story there already gaping hole in the story now and I'm sure I'm not some guess on the pointed out we have a\nA few people that are ... you know well versed in this stuff they're not conspiracy theorists they're very uh important people and you'll be hearing from an soon\nBut the final blow issue you know whether or not you know we reached that point now I mean\nWhat does happen today I mean like I said you can call them inside job I mean no bombs were detonated it makes the entire attack a bit of political theater in order to create a terrorist bogeyman that attacks the left in order to gain sympathy for the vote and this is what they do and the third world you know they just in third world countries and most of the time the suspects are always traced ... intelligence or rogue military actors\nI mean like the guy who\nUm ... for the rice and he was from Logan, Utah and I think it was an ex marine\nBut yeah rogue military actors are rogue intelligence actors but do that somebody who was involved with intelligence or military uh is usually the suspect they they they choose or they they use a scapegoat or a Patsy and this is with a false flag starts to ... starts to materialize\nMean these extra always carried out for what are called decapitation strikes which of course is a military strategy\nWhich is aimed at removing the leadership or command and control of what is perceived to be a hostile government or group so it's a tactic of civil war or strategist with other government plot to eliminate military generals or even political leaders you know if you recall the rice attacks\nWere aimed at the president and military leaders and the latest bomb attacks are aimed at Democrats who are former leaders\nSo this is a tit for tat exercise this has been copycat exercise this is\nPart of the final blow affect it all started back when Kavanaugh was appointed chief justice it all started the you know and it it it it lingers\nLive explosive device\nAnd the implication is that the city and the other devices had the capacity to kill\nNone of the devices went off their lethality is not yet been confirmed by bomb technicians we have not heard the lethality of\nOf these so called bombs or the feds wouldn't disclose a drink any of the press conferences exactly what was in the packages they said well it's consistent with the other packages let's just put it that way so we have the investigation is ongoing of so\nMany crazy things have been done a lot of what we call security theater happening I heard something about New York and the national guard being called out why how's that going to prevent the mail from\nThe finding is that it it's just I just find it interesting now do you remember back when we were doing the rice and report\nRemember that remember that I was talking about the rice report and how it's going to you know all those people that I said wow this is the biological attack I guess I I I predicted and I was all over it and I was reporting it there was not really that much of any type of reporting going on in the mainstream\nFrom CNN or or or MSNBC or any group I I Know the Fox was all over because this was an attack on the president\nBut now\nThis has happened to democratic leaders this has gotten you know this has got the most attention I've ever seen and the truth is is that the rice and was sent to these uh to the mail rooms with these leaders with activity could've poison someone and made a few staff members at Ted Cruz's opposite sick\nBut not one of these bombs went off\nSo they were sending a a pipe bomb with the triggering mechanism on it you know they weren't there those those bombs were there to take anybody out there were there to scare people they were they were they were basically scare type of tools there were there do ah they weren't there to a a\nKill anyone and uh and so that raises my my eyebrows just a little bit but I also saw the\nJohn Brennan or ... or bomb below ... they said the bomb below John Brennan Time Warner CNN ten Columbus Circle New York New York just standing there and apparently all we have are just maybe six stamp there are no post marks on the\nOn the package so I'm Wondering if it was courier hand delivered or what [noise]\nBut um\nYeah he he just there's so many things that\nI have to get through the night to make this a thorough report as one of those situations where\nI wanted to get on with Halloween and uh I'm\nI'm [noise]\nI'm committed to getting the story you tonight I got gas and everything lined up at the store to you about what's happening what's really happening and what to think about what this is meaning for all of us so stay with me tonight and uh like to hear from you as well your thoughts on this Tripoli except at three thirty seven hundred\nTripoli fix every three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back\nStates arguably the biggest local contests this November the Senate race the incumbent democratic senator Chileans deer his Republican opponent John ... double ... status\nMaris moderate their lives debate at Cape and islands association of realtors Tom prints that are caught in mid tech drive in West Yarmuth sponsored by did checks payroll our local company supporting the local Jeter to stay informed is you can be used radio Ninety five WMGK [noise]\n... all\nOf a political to somebody you know ... or they weren't sure pretty shallow trial ideological\nWas\nCalled communism are coming and going\nWanting a violent walking around looking down on\nThose walls fought out\nSo we say All right we're going to do to about\n... you don't want anything to\n\nIn line and I know around here\n\n\nTalk of the things that France together point out our similarities and differences ever hear about a shock for me I have some\n\nGround zero you know it's really\nTough and he said knowing when you uh read headlines that are\nWell for example let me go here this is a headline I just got a mainstream media blames Trump Alex Jones pipe bomb false flag infowars mid term as it's like\nUh okay I Want to make some things clear and this is why I waited\nDay usually went away to day 'cause I don't want to go anywhere near Halloween with this nonsense I Want to do it on the same day but I always say this first and foremost local and federal for a while you'll get local federal authorities here they're investigating this now\nThey have not commented on who who the bomb maker or bomb makers may be they don't know what their motives would be\nI mean we can guess what their motives are Trump condemned the X. today for the White House was not built for CNN no but he did a\nBut the whole lack of evidence the whole mystery I mean there are holes in the script\nI agree but you know the fringe voices on both ... both right and left make this a prime opportunity for misinformation\nAnd are you a check in on on the Internet it said that something was going to go down in fact they said it was some sort of a plot to stage a shooting at a rally or something like that and that there was some sort of political spent in the works a and even\nThough you see the media going after she went on and you go after all these others or you go after a Alex Jones\nThere are a lot of liberal people too and that just as quick to pin the blame on Republicans without knowing anything about the bombers identity or motives\nYou know I saw two week do you own this GOP every last ugly I oughta but structure of our democracy you oh this this is insanity okay\n... the other person a Philly eh Philippe rhyme who is actually a Clinton advisor said President Trump\nVisits argue fish is all about you know think about the rice and attacks\nAnd know condemnation of the rights but that even though President Trump was the target even with the generals were target\n\nThere's also some reporter the bomb being sent to the White House there were no bumps into the White House CNN reported it and then of course CNN being the factual news organization they are we're wrong okay and then of course governor pale and Sarah Palin she shared it wrong so\nIn a nothing happened at the home of the president it was all these democratic you know outspoken kick him when they're down types that they've got that stuff\nSo\nThis is the first and foremost thing that I Want to kind of cover as as soon as this is my job I guess to uh be a conspiracy analysts misinformation buster okay these bumbling hopes\nThe bomb scares all that this is going to create a perfect storm for misinformation\nI mean what you get and that I Am I'm being\nKind of in and out ah and and doing some analysis I mean an analyst here what you get as you get breaking news reports and we we prove we we've proven is with nine eleven the nine eleven shall we did a while back I wanted to I Want to just kinda reiterate this\nYou get breaking news reports which are always riddled with holes there's a lot of unanswered questions is a lot of a gag and going on where they the gag police officers and FBI\nI mean who sit in the packages were they address to what was inside where they really are bombs et cetera et cetera set in any incidents involve\nHigh profile polarizing figures in American politics who already are the frequent subjects of misinformation who already spout misinformation and then of course you have the networks that are constantly pushing misinformation to push the cognitive biased for their own constituents\n\n\nOh are you considering

what do\nYou live through it or\nAnything like this\nOperation con door\nA red sauce civil war ... looked like a couple of flights um\nNo no that's not what it looked like operation outdoor art operation ... happened on September eleventh Nineteen Seventy three okay it's or South America was under civil war it was called the dirty war and I was there for the last part of it\nI was there for the discipline to see those were the government went in and did do an orange brought people out of their houses I was there when reporters were killed I was there were reporters were were asked to leave I was there when the bomb threats were being had the opposite of\nWhat part of that is like now because of that seems like that\nNow none of that's happening now we just had a record and we just had a reporter in Saudi Arabia that would die step into little pieces we've had reporters trying to get the truth out better suicide id no one knows why they get they get suicide\nSaudi Arabia\nNo no it's not just Saudi Arabia okay we've had reporters that had been that had disappeared that have been gone through American reporters have been killed for for trying to get information out the confines yeah what about Seth Rich what the hell happened to Seth Rich\nWhose Seth Rich\nOh my God you don't know who sets ridges\nSounds vaguely familiar\nBut I don't know how to whistle blower okay and then he got killed he was killed and die he\nWas he was he worked for the Democrats he worked for the Democratic national ah he worked for the center for Hillary Clinton's campaign and it was believed that he had some information that he wanted to get out and he was killed before he could get the information out\nYou know a an order for you to know what's going on you got to know what's going on and obviously\nYou know I Know about Edward Snowden and the whole government they I mean you've got pulled down to an airplane that was Panamanian read history and the guys forces to land just because it snowed a lot of American people know that we're all getting spied on by our government\nWill see he was exiled say and that's what they do some of the reporters are exiled okay and so you have a a you have exiled reporters you have killed reporters a you have several other reporters that you don't know what ever happened to them they're gone they're they're they're taking out uh it's because they're the messengers and they get they get shut down\nBut that's not a civil war\nWhat do we met over the top you know it's not over the top you know because I look civil wars I mean what do you think of civil war is what do you think of civil war it ... the American people right on you that's my question I don't need you to give me your American people nonsense what's the civil war\nWilliams eleven million cars a year in school and said it's really er ten billion rounds\nYet at it's not what a civil war in you know that's not what we have a war is okay you dig a civil war is going to be like Republicans whether guns fighting the liberals is that what you think it's going to be is that what you think it's going to be where it's it's not what it is that's not what a civil war is a civil war is certainly a number of factions\nWith in a government with in a country that are fighting amongst each other it's not one against the other\nBut there's no fighting there is no fighting [noise] there are no bombs being sent to the Democrats there are no leaders saying that violence where the rub the we don't vote a certain way\nThere are no riots in the streets in in New York or or people killing other rioters or we don't have ... trying to block traffic we don't have anything like that going on in the United states [noise] pretty minor stuff that's not\nMinor [noise] [laughter] no I live or die and how many people are dying how many people are dying a hundred people have not even that it's not as\nPeople look [noise] not everybody is going to die in this type of civil war it's a war of ideologies it's not tries we don't live oh we don't live in the jungles\nIt's not okay okay okay it it's not it's not out and you see look it's not the way we find the Eighteen hundreds and what happened in Argentina and she was the civil war [noise] and there were actions who were warring with each other and they were torturing each other's torture there's [noise]\nThere's a what would those black areas where they have in Chicago where they put people in there and they tortured them you don't even see 'em again [noise] black spots you've heard of those right\nBlack spots yeah a lot of people are doing so\nI'm no no no no the okay I I Can't do this anymore I just can't do this [laughter] oh my God will be back [noise]\nHere's the story\nAnd more than a year ago there was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressmen during a charity baseball game\nI notice how I mean this does not seem to register with the media today this is all about being attacked on the on the left\nThe continued attacks on all political figures from shootings to attempted bombings are part of a civil war tactic did is becoming more and more pervasive these are attacks on the republic and the intelligence linked to the resistance is usually get for sympathy\nThe truth is Democrats are not unique snowflakes they too will suffer the consequences of the civil war that they wanted to perpetuate and conservatives will also suffer these attacks\nAre happening to a lot more people in the Clinton to the Obamas we need to wait to hell up and realized that\n\nFrom the two thousand one anthrax attacks of the Unabomber case is using the mail or other services to deliver deadly weapons has long been this this uh it's\nBeen a frightening history and reality here in the United states anytime things happen like that it's a wake up\nCall to wake up call\nSo then I I I decided that I think it'd be\nWise to turn some time over to a a good friend and informative the program\nWe we ah we've had him a on before John ... and he's a veteran law enforcement officer rubber twenty five years\nJohn worked for the U.S Secret Service San Diego police department us been police in the U.S customs service in his capacity within the secret service in Nineteen Seventy four the Nineteen Seventy seven he served for over three years John was directly involved the protection of the president first family but White House the vice president and his family masters embassies in has a stake\nThrough the experiences as well documented whistle blower within the U.S customs service regarding corruption management abuses John has been interviewed numerous times on television radio shows talk shows many newspapers and nationwide or a affiliates regarding these vitally important issue since Nineteen Ninety five John Carmen welcome to ground zero\n[noise] good to be back or are you doing today\nI'm doing great I just ah [noise] you know I run into a a a ...\nI guess you could call it a quandary as kind of a confusion here because you know when you jump on a story this soon especially something like this that appears to be\nA dare I say at an inside job but it inside job from the standpoint of who the players within the intelligence community is responsible for this you know people tend to want to play politics again with this and it's not\nIt's it's an attack on the republic we've had Republican a leadership being attacked with rice and we've had a congressman attempted assassination attempts we've got all these things going on and people are saying well since nobody died it's really not a civil war but no this is this this civil war would you agree\nThat those type of the force of responses you're getting her from from the left for educators\nThey're just trying to throw a monkey wrench into your flesh and you are for runner and if you are the best of the information I've ever talked to\nAnd I'm telling you your head and so on line with this stuff that's all they are left to do is to try and you know for people to tell other responses this stuff has been going on for years I mean I I keep thinking 'cause I was quoted as some other national magazines about a dozen usual this judge Scalia\nRing a bell yeah a friend of mine Gary well this goes back\nAnd there's another reporter Gary Webb dead I mean how many hours you can I say ... you know said richest Gary Webb that's another reporter John ... I mean a\nCopy editor for all our all yeah Danny capital narrow he he got killed I\nMean you did it on the Olympics this takes me back to the nineties\nWhen I was working close with Mike roofer LAPD who helped expose John Dory each of the CIA or the ... of the ... about the cocaine in infiltrated the black communities where the ... freeway Ross left the rapper and I knew\nArea with I got a picture of me and Maxine Waters on my page on these two cars scripture dot com [laughter] she didn't do anything to help us out really related Feinstein I'm Sorry there's a big D right after each of those names right right right\nWell we're just seeing or just seeing how you know ... we had to be rice in attacks just to just a little while ago and there wasn't that much commotion with the rice in the tax and even at a suspect within you know what a day or whole yeah yeah the um\nThe um on a miss is in my words you're the social scene rice and beans is um [noise] the the and\nIt wasn't actually the process of cows are being you know the castor bean that's right so when they're shoving a tons of castor bean is\nIn the mail is like wow really I mean\nLet's say ... but this goes back years so if you pick the part of the stuff like you do and I do and I know rod those you sift through intelligence and information you guys are on top of this stuff and that that's good because that means that\nUh I don't have to explain too much but it's like with all my background and training I mean I was within two or three hundred yards of explosions the Russian embassy off sixteenth street which is two to three or four blocks away from the White House of Venezuelan embassy ring a bell yeah yeah and also outside\nThe White House a couple of times Seventy five Seventy six right around that time frame that was four and then\nSo are we to say is it safe to say that this has all the earmarks of a criminal element within the intelligence operations that allowed this to go down to that was a somehow put together by um a number of aerobics I guess you'd call them rogue agents or I mean I hate to use the word deep say 'cause that's kind of you know let me make\nLeft wing left wing Democrat socialist or oh this is what you're saying is that we believe yeah that's what those guys are yeah\nOkay so you're ... so do you believe that that's what this was it was it was basically staged by what eight extreme left group\nYeah they're stressed out they don't have anywhere to throw a little arguments like Maxine you know block this ... that a lot of do this create a crowd or you know why it riot and also the ... that's ... that's a that's a felony and that's inciting riots\nWell do you think though that you know I Know Donald Trump has been also raising the rhetoric and I find it weird that with all the rhetoric has been raised elsewhere immediately they seize upon Donald Trump Donald Trump is contributing Hillary Clinton actually contributed to this is why when she said well if you want civility you gotta put Democrats in the Senate\nAnd then Donald Trump said well if Republicans don't make the Senate there'll be violence so you have the president saying there'll be violence you have a you know the the one who wanted to be president saying that there would be violence violence will continue until they get what we want\nNow we have bombs being sent to people I mean it's like why don't we give the equal opportunity to everybody that's inciting the violence and and actually encouraging it\nRight and they've had assassinations already already brought obsessed rich I'm very familiar I was working on something\nThat I'm not going to talk about um\nThere were some other cases where people were assassinated\nAnd um it's all tied in with the shooting at the ballpark Deasy says the thing so all these things are excited but when they talk about violence and things like that\nThere is a philosophy from the left that it's okay to lose its a communist philosophy it's okay to lose half of your country or half of your population as long as you with\n... with us on ground zero for those you know though former Secret Service us Secret Service for doing customs us when police or has background he also served a President Ford under President Ford and President Carter\nUm he also of protecting the vice president his family first family and the president and and I can comment on what happened to be with these bombs that were sent to a number of a democratic leaders Tripoli\nPlus weapons yet bandleader autonomous weapons that are\nOkay yeah three rats three grams or something like ... so just used as a possible and and then they throw them in their thousands or even just one and they had one that was a a different type ... by the White House months and months ago\nAnd that's that's a a violation of the air space over there but that's a separate discussion kind of live right at the same technology which means that they target you and it's got recognition on it they\nCan take your picture off the Internet and they could let it go in there and if you're in the area it'll zoom in and it'll attach itself or shoes that thing right\nTo be like ... said forget it they just take an autonomous drones and they said that your way and then bam you're gone [noise]\nSimple ways of doing that there are a lot more I guess you call them advanced ways of doing this not that\nThis would have very good at Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred will be back\nIt's arguably the biggest local contests this November the state Senate

was there was the only way to report it finally decided to report it was all over the news the mainstream like two days later after they found a suspect but it wasn't it wasn't as much hysteria as we have now because so many of the Democratic leaders were mailed these packages\nOr the Obamas the Clintons a you know Eric Holder is Maxine Waters says that she got one or so a number of people have gotten ease and uh none of the bombs went off\nOr they said the one that CNN had some sort of a logo on it it looked like something from ISIS\nOr which basically was it was kind of a parody that says get her done I'm basically a ... this is all something that uh it it sounds it it just got the earmarks of intelligence written all over it and I and I'm going to make a prediction that if they find a suspect\nThere's certainly going to say that he had some connection to the FBI or the FBI knew the guy was going to plan on doing it I mean that's what always happens is that right John John crime and

at all these ... these are groups and saw you know have Soros riders really you know when did you ever hear about stuff like that back in the fifties or the sixes have right\nNow the question I have to as ... wasn't it always been a situation where\nI guess Soros is the draft is kind of private no one really knows where he lives\nAnd yet they're a low yeah onto his house I I always wondered about that because you know I guess maybe his addresses common knowledge but I'd never really knew anything about George Soros we've kind of like that phantom and then when he gets a bumped into him do it set right to his mailbox I'm thinking\nAll right that's interesting and I'm sure it will be Googled that right yeah I mean ... can you really isn't that easy to get\nSomebody to dress like George Soros is address\nThat depends on how he hides your formation 'cause most of those people don't even have a real regular address\nOff I used to represent you bought a guard work for a movie stars and

suspicious package what center former vice president Joe Biden bearing similarities to other package bombs filed today it's not believe this suspected package ever reached its destination this says the Los Angeles\n\nWe trust our system of government enough that we abide by its outcomes\nEven though we may disagree with that it's always been the case Americans even if they disagreed with ...

based on a constitution but solid\nFor centuries\nNearly centuries almost to the trees but more than two centuries actually yeah more than two centuries a little over\n\nNow we've had disagreements in the past and that's something that this country does it we have a debate we have conversations we talk we have dialogue hopefully dialogue with his balanced and uh\nAnd and that's something I think we're lacking right now I mean we're writing off people because we disagree with him and that's nonsense\nEighteenth sixty one\nThere's only one time in our history Eighteenth sixty one where\n\nJust stress the system so much that we decided to have a civil war or we had a civil war I don't know if we decided that the civil war broke out because we didn't agree we had such a disagreement about how our system was run we have a ... we had a civil war there was so much instability at that time the civil war broke out\nWasn't declared it broke out there were divisions on on a on the front lines there were a\nYou know border divisions and things of that nature it was clear cut as to what a civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties anymore America's instability\nIs increasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now\nBut I Know it's difficult to see that the civil war is happening because we always thought it would be an armed conflict that one day President Trump or whoever would step up to the pulp and say what about your guns guys we're going to war here in this country\nWhen he established with a battlefield America had already been proposed during the Obama administration is proposed by none other than John McCain\nWho now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict where we would be shooting other Americans every day with the police would be forced to shoot Americans every day we're martial law would be declared\nAnd all that can happen but at the moment the symptoms of civil war have not been diagnosed\nBy the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis you get about wars are from history not declared by the president but ... be declared the aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military had identified illustrated the point by point sign post as to what a new\nCivil war would look like in America and this is based on contemporary standards not the standards of the Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there were major coups in the planning for Truman and for FDR major coup of course\nPlanned and and and uh actually executed by those in the deep state against President Kennedy but a new civil war in America look something like this according to military planners number one\nThe country would be infringed in national polarization with no obvious meeting place for resolution\nNumber two\nThere would be increasingly divisive press coverage information flows weaken institution notably or Congress and the judiciary\n\nNumber three\nThere will be a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimacy and the illegitimate edition of violence\nTo solve any and all disputes now I Know that that's pretty damning\nTo actually point all these out and of course we have been analyzing and speculating about dean state\nManipulations it's a ... we've been told is conspiracy analyst that this is a\nAn invention of Donald Trump would we know that the shadow government has not been in Ventura Donald Trump the shadow governors always been the dark command it to a\nLeads from the shadows but it needs to be clear here while we're\nLooking under rocks for false flag proof while we're having these disputes and the symptoms of war here in the United states the effect is working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs into a moment where their persecution complex can be proven which makes it even more suspicious especially when\nThe media should be talking about how more than a week ago Senator Susan Collins a Republican from Maine received a suspicious letter and again early this month President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis and chief of naval operations John Richardson\nWere sent rice and and more than a year ago there was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressman during a charity baseball practice and yet since no one died this doesn't indicate civil war does it no not at all just were attacking officials\n\nBut this isn't registering in the media today the only thing that's registries the persecution complex we see on the left because the left is all one sided in their pain\nBut continued attacks on political figures from shootings to attempted bombings are part of a civil war tactic is becoming more and more pervasive these are attacks on the Republicans and and the intelligence that are linked to these resistance they're using it for sympathy they're using on the Democrats were simply be the truth is Democrats are not unique\nRepublicans are not unique in the American people are not unique we can and will if we're not already\nHaving a civil war in this country\nThe attacks are happy to do a lot more people than just the Clintons in Obama's there're journalists that are being attacked we've had anthrax being sent a journalist we've had rice and being sent a journalist\nSo time to wake up\nSome Americans if it is Suze Orman since they're not affected directly by the evil in this country they walk around like outsiders just like in John carpenter's a movie they live they have not put on the glasses to see the real world that has been glazed over by an overly political narrative that does not wish to expose the demonic Lee infected among us\n\nThe movie they live created by John Carpenter was actually released Thirty years ago this November\nThe film still remains chilling only appropriate as a metaphor for what is happening today of course John Carpenter is responsible\nFor the movie Halloween which is having a bit of a renaissance as it's forty years sequel selling out two theaters across the country the original Halloween introduced to Michael Meyers who was eventually referred to as the shape kind of evil that cannot be killed\n\nJohn carpenter's films or horror metaphors exploit what trauma does to the soul you also\nInfuses his films with a strong anti authoritarian messaging concerns about how our society is unraveling and there's always some evil hidden in the shadows ready to pounds of every moment in the film they live\nCarpeted portrays the government working against its own citizens that appears to be some silent alien infestation echoes the films invasion of the body Snatchers you remember that them however in the body centers movie there were some people that we're realizing that their loved ones were losing their humanity\nIn a film they live\nCarpet of shows that the majority of the populace are out of touch with reality and they have allowed technology to run amok they have allowed believed to choose their values they are unaware that a war has been waged against them and their way of life do you recall\n\nCarpenter also did the film escape from New York where the future of America is fascism\nSo the bottom line is\nThat the message has been quite clear and no one seems to be listening we're being fed a series of\nCarefully contrived fictions but there are no resemblance to reality\nAnd the agent provocateurs create these attacks in order for us to feel as though we are threatened by forces beyond our control [noise]\nAnd with these tactics they're able to destabilize the country making us distrustful of each other divided by our prejudices of the others throats these types of events generate a lot\nOf fear based retaliation\nTheir symptoms if part of or within the realms [noise]\nIn the confines of civil war in the United states of America\nUsing the constitution eliminates these problems using the rule of law limits these problems [noise] any of the corruption impunity that would eliminate these problems but until then we will be the other's throats will accept the pictures that are fed to us and we will not admit nor we will see the civil war on our doorstep until it's too late\nTo relief except for three thirty seven hundred\n... six seven three thirty seven hundred coming up\nThe founder of liberty beacon Roger Landry was right here on ground zero to relate to examine three thirty seven hundred woman [noise]\n\nWas in ... when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with aids lists male Macs\nIt didn't happen the way they were told it was going to happen we're not having an armed conflict right now\nBetween America and they'd be Americans just shooting Americans well I mean American shoot Americans every day or Chicago or it seems to be a highly climbed written with guns going up and things happening like that but when we have bombs in the leadership where we have people who have to a planet around mob these are ... and parts\nTalking parts of the sign post symptoms perhaps of what would be a civil war and as I say the diagnosis is not come from you it comes from history and I said sometimes you don't know what your rent until you\nHave somebody step out until you you're in the middle of something you better get out of it sooner what's going to get worse

don't see they won't add up to say hey we're in the middle of something really bad year\nAnd it it it's like but the civil war that happened in South America and the Nineteen seventies and eighties it's like what happened prior to Ukraine and then when he was destabilize these things are happening in America and no one sees it for what it is\nRoger why is that people are not paying attention why don't they why don't they just stop\n... they they they're they're completely incensed and they want to continue this I guess maybe it's it's just a way for us to get our frustrations out or why do
