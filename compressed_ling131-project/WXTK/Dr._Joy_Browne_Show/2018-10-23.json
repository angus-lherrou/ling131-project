didn't decapitated chicken ... and they called it the headless chicken monster this is true it was my I got the science ... I mean scientists that ... if it's all you know\nTrue science because you have to look at the true scientists ... bake\nSo I saw this thing and I'm thinking it's gotta be CGI it's gotta be crazy right\nBut you know [laughter] I spent I spent the whole afternoon\nLiterally reading about the headless chicken monster\nYou're probably laughing but it's true headless chicken and you know ... chicken those who have listened to my show\nKnow about the famous if I can find it I'll play it they know about the famous chicken rent okay he'd say well known story the legendary ground zero story about how I went to a Halloween party and\nI came back just a little bit tipsy went on the air it's first time I've ever done that 'cause I don't\nGo on the air and drunk or you know high or anything but I went on the air this was when I was local and I was feeling a little kids who went to a great party in the afternoon which was afternoon parties thought I'd be okay came on the air\nAnd I just started you know talking shooting from the hip shooting from the hip I started getting to how terrified I was of chickens okay and\nThe reason why I'm terrified of chickens is because when I was a kid\nI once tried to sneak in my backyard from a field okay and there was the barbed wire fences next door to this this family the we 'cause we lived out in this rural area called mid veiled Utah\nAnd next door to us was this a Mexican family I mean they were they spoke Spanish they just beginning ... spoke English but uh just barely and are are you saying that this kid named junior usually Jose and he spoke English ... broken English\nBut I decided to sneak home from school\nWell through the field crawl through the barbed wire\nBarb wire fence to keep the roosters and the chickens from getting I crawled into the barbed wire fence\nGot attacked by the head rooster just poking my face is the debt tacking me and it was like I'm bleeding I'm getting attacked it's like something out of Alfred Hitchcock's the birds right but it's chickens chickens\nWhich most or just attacking me right and just talking in my face\nAnd Iran to my mom Iran and my dad I'm bleeding and so my dad goes over\nThe course the old man's over there man he's drunk ... drunk and my dad says\nYou're rooster my son in law is new and so I guess Miguel who is one of the older\nKids\nSaw me bleeding and he said oh that's it so we went and he got himself a rake and he went any chased after the rooster would the raking finally hit it and there'd been goes and it just stops\nSo he grabs a knife and he grabs the nicotine chicken and goes his ... head off the chicken right\nAnd then the damn rooster comes after me [laughter] you know you're a little kid writing things coming up you were the way they were the\nHead chopped off and these were bad enough Jose found it was funny he went he grabbed the chicken ... the chickens foot and he found the nerve on the end of the chickens putting pull on it in the chickens that she can handle it would do a class\nYou know it cost ... terrifying as a kid right terrified by one had experience\nWith ... we went to a place called we were farm would go visit my folks at Christmas Time I told him that was the Thanksgiving went to go totally am and said hey we can get a ... a a a nice uh uh you know pumpkin pie good wheeler farm hang out we'll see the animals\nThere were horses and everything and so they weren't chickens and ... them is like what four or five years old six years old at the time and\nHe thinks the rooster chase after me scared of the ... and I said you know what you like me\nWho just like me man we have problems with chicken so we're we're going to do is we're going to go to KFC [laughter] and get some chicken he wouldn't told me he has his great idea for a horror film with chickens so he and I both bad we we've had our experience with chickens but seeing this\nHorrible breasted compensated chicken swimming through the ... I spent the whole afternoon just looking for information on this creature because how terrified I Am of chickens\nAnd I was thinking of this creature was from my nightmares materialize in the real world and after a whole afternoon of obsession I found out the creature had to name it was a real thing it wasn't some you know optical illusion CGI it's called\nAnd it ... it is a senior\nAnd it ... ... that's a Spanish leaders and ... states and it being ousted ... for\n... that's creepy he got over his career by by just no you can't do that being an executioner of chickens does not change your

have\nThis [noise] yes his chicken bigotry I have I'm I'm very bigoted when it comes to chicken [noise]\nAnyway coming up I got a story I Want to talk to you about and speaking of strange creatures are strange things that don't fit the mold [noise]\nI'm gonna Barbie on the show or to talk about [noise]\nNice things in our house okay they come from the wall and [noise] near the weirdest things I've ever seen\n'em there we just got photos of them I'm trying to get a video of what it was so\nWe're going to put the ... we're going to put the pictures of what these things are\nDark reddish brown to crimson though juveniles are typically pale pink according to a study published in Nineteen Ninety in the journal Smithsonian contributions to marine sciences so they're really fascinated by the sea cucumber gave me the creeps we're always we're really weird is that uh it got me thinking about second genesis\nAnd what second genesis is is well scientists have said\nSome have suggested that there is there was a a there is was there was a second genesis that took place in the beginning in the beginning or God created having the you're got also created an heaven and heaven and heaven and heaven and earth an earth and earth an earth meaning there were several genesis\nUh beginnings several different ones ah where there's a fifty percent chance\nOf other life forms which opposed the norm and they do exist and sometimes they show up and when they show up we didn't know what you call them we know what to do with him and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster I'm not going to any of those things I'm Talking about things that you know you look at them and you get a second look\nLike this chicken that swim so it's a chicken and see this set chicken monster type creature that I have in\nMy uh uh I have in my article that I\nUh but when you're looking at the multiplicity of creation and you're looking at\nHow the diversity of multi versus unseen in the multiplicity\nThe agents would call that the underworld creatures from the underworld they'll come up from nowhere like the Demi Moore gone from you know stranger things or\nYou know I don't know anything that extreme but still I mean stranger things called the upside down we called the abyss or the timeline of creation and the creation as we adhere to are the ones that have been handed down through millennia and each one is unique it's interpretation or the concepts pretty much\nAre the same wherever you look so scientists are speculating\nSciences are speculating that strange organisms that might be alien in nature exist on the planet\nAnd ... there isn't\nA very far jumped to suggest that stranger life exist on the planet that well you've never seen before and that if you were to blow up in the shadow biosphere lurks every monster involving that no one even wants to see or or take on her have contact with there was another creature that I saw that and somebody was kind enough\nTo actually send me a picture of this thing it's called the tangle and\nI don't know if you've ever seen a tangle and but I saw a tangle in today for the first time I've never heard of a pain Gulen in my life it looks like a mini Godzilla with armor looked like something from a Japanese horror film tiny thing it looks like a cross between an anti during an armadillo\nAnd uh so he says well bring up the plight of poets will apply to push the ... isn't terrify but I I think the penguin it's cute but it's also scary looking because I have this armor all over its body and it kinda like conscious over like God village looks like it could take out a a you know if\nIf it was big enough for you could take out Tokyo\nThat that's how we're to this see these ... we're creatures that nobody has seen before or they've seen them or they can identify but didn't know what they are and this is what I mean by second genesis these are things that\nYou know you've heard of unicorns yeah right well you know this is a lot different than ... I think there's a lot different than that you know okay you know and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster this is beyond my band is beyond the flat with monster these are things that you see and you're like going what the hell is this and it's something that's never been seen\nOn in search of a sudden has never been talked about on coast to coast day I'm not saying that uh you know I've talked about really that I that I Know about that I've seen\nAnd you know that ... this reminds me of the myths\nGave the movie the mist remember the missed\nIt was it was a ... veil and it was also a a movie okay and the idea that\nYou know that some quantum joke science conveyed us with dimensional theories that point to the possibility that there are areas of planet where the veil is thinner or\nThere's some extra dimensional vortex where a second genesis occurred\nParallel to our own and their locations throughout the planet which suggested to be the most powerful due to their position and the the appropriate ritual perform there by the writer fish it could actually be a cleansing moment for the planet it could open the best new creatures could come out and take I mean we're being warned\nThat there are wormholes reporters that can be open through ritual or through the auspices of super collider is like CERN and it was real into these can pass through and haunt mankind and change the direction of the future\nAnd as I said you know the mist they had a project they're like ... it was called arrowhead arrowhead project\nAnd\nThe whole catalyst for the story was a dimensional breach project arrowhead actually creates this myth and rain and enveloped a small town and during the night large insect like creatures are seen and\nTara doctor like creatures attack livestock and small pass eventually these creatures attack humans as well\nThose horrifying creatures from the film we're known as the great widow wars and they can only be described as deadly spider like predators each about the size of a small dog\nAnd these creatures produce corrosive Web strands which burn through materials like coughing flesh and in both the book in the film great widower is simply killed their prey would they're acidic ... put it in the film they also had the ability to capture and hundreds of eggs\nIn the living human host the eggs take about a data hatch and they multiplied quickly now the looks of these creatures were terrifying and there were even some\nThat were the size of a human being Ruben ... remember the there was a show called mimic I didn't know that a dump ... did the show mimic is one of my favorite scary movies\nBecause of the fact that this this Roach or whatever it is gets to be the size of the human and you get to see it looks like a man and black standing there in the subway but it's not it's a big mop like creature scary looking creature see when you're looking at these creatures in the midst are you looking in in in\nThe movie like mimic these creatures are terrifying and and and you know if they're the size of a human being even worse than it was explained by the producers okay other movie and then they said we based many of the creatures\nOn supposed second genesis creatures that were proposed by science\nWere based on real animals but from an alien ecology admittedly dangerous wild animals\nFrom a more brutal ecosystem that we are not familiar with but still basically just animals made of flesh and blood nothing's supernatural about them okay but they are from a second genesis ecosystem\nThe brutal ecosystem is the same ecosystem that the scientists at CERN and land a guy by the majority rows\nHave talked about with regard to opening dimensions and allowing these vile creatures in for study journey rose is a co founder and chief technology officer of the wave which is the Canadian companies selling machines that he claims exploit quantum mechanical effects\nTo solve certain problems hundreds of millions of times faster than traditional computers\nAnd rose is also the c._e._o. of hindered systems\nWork hindered AI which is to sell the start up your founded with others that was back in twenty fourteen and he dedicated the whole company to delivering advanced tell operated autonomous robots but his goal is within the way of quantum computers he wants to summon\nA tsunami of demons or aliens or whatever they are the equivalent he says to the old one spoken of\nBy horror Arthur H.

something strange you don't know what it is [noise] no explanation could be a bug could be of animals could be something doesn't fit in with the big butt Loch Ness issue for Congress stories dumping\nBarbie laid on the program something if it's something is invested her infested or homes you know what it is she wondered if it was some sort of demonic\nBeing one of some sort of a ... an alien thing wondering if it's something that she doesn't understand but we do have inspectors literal inspectors\nThat are going to go to our house and inspect this way she doesn't have to pay out any more money to find out something that she doesn't already know or what have you but we have them we're going to be arranging the get them to her\nAnd uh that we will get a logical scientific explanation now that doesn't hold we're going to go further we're going to uh probably up some goes to the theaters or maybe in some other investigators ... just to go and if there's something demonic going on there\nUh but uh you know one of the things that we do on this program and we've done it many times is that we actually have to vet the stories now the thing with Barbie is that she came to a news press conference\nOkay and we were at a news ... press conference in Oregon or some of the tour went to Seattle and beyond she came to that press conference to ask the news department\nWhat could be done about the home and ... how could be inspected so it was not\nBut she had me she asked me if I knew anything about it there was something paranormal about it I was at bat\nI thought I don't know what George my audience and find out of the biggest paranormal enough and so this is why I brought Barbie on the show this is not\nTo try and convince you something paranormal this was an investigation and process now\nUh it's also I thought appropriate for Halloween to talk about this and the reason why is because I don't know about you but creepy crawly crap coming out of a house whether it be spiders or any other bugs or or whether it be rats mice or anything else are terribly creepy\nThey are terribly creepy and a and this is why I uh this is why I wanted to talk about this tonight\nSo uh if anyone you know if anyone has had this happen to them or something that they can claim that they've had happened to them I'd like to hear the story because you know things that are out of the ordinary things are anomalous\nOr certainly worthy you're talking about especially run Halloween and so I said the chauffeur around this time because I wanted people you know because it's all part of our we write the creepy crawly he'd see we see spider things going down up and to the ads crazy but there are these are things that happened\nAnd uh but I'm going to talk to ... this is something that's really out of the ordinary Jason calling us from California how are you tonight man\nGood how are you doing great now you sent me some pictures tonight of of what you say you were doing okay you're a rock musician and my correct\nYeah I play in a bad in a little bit here in San Diego we were filming a video and I used to have a black\nAnd white backdrop mhm and when this
