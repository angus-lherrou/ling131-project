die\nMean death is the great equalizer isn't that right and that's what Halloween is all about you know thinking about the dead\nPraising the martyrs in the praising the saints and I'm remembering the dead are that's why you have the the L A smart if those are all saints day on November first you know the real you know we focus on\nThe uh the darker side on the thirty first and then of course November set aside for the sacred November first set aside for the sacred in a lot of people forget that\nAnd even though we see a lot of schools that a lot of you know that kind of ornate\nA type of decorations for you know all saints day or day of the dead or DEA Dale is marked those\nPeople in a mini cultures have long believed that communication with the daddies possible and throughout time\nMany people have claimed to speak to those who have shaken this mortal coil I've experienced the VP I've I've been in you know goes in ... ghost hunts getting ... goes to an subjects Thursday VP I felt what um\nHow you felt that uh to me\nSeemed like an attack by Nancy I'm so uh I was on the year when it happened in um it was terrifying and I and I uh I always tell a story that when I was there and it was all going down\nUm\nI felt a little sick to my stomach because it was like a something was uh something surrounding me and I could not\nBreak away from it and I started crying I was on the air when it happened\nBut I always tell people the reason why I was crying was not because of the fact I was scared I mean I knew that something was going on and it was like it was uncomfortable to spin the thought of not being able to say goodbye to your wife is that was in California and I was on the air\nAnd uh just the thought of not being able to see my wife\nAnd if it was going to be the end of me I I just thought it would be so devastating that um\nYou don't get a chance to say goodbye to both my mother and my father\nMy mother and her own little way had a chance to say goodbye to me before she passed away and my father said goodbye to me twenty minutes before he passed away on the phone he was in good spirits are just there was told that he'd have to have\nUm his tube removed and if the two was going to be removed he died and he didn't want to be resuscitated and so he passed away and uh you know a lot of people have had those moments where after a loved one is passed away they have contacts somehow in a dream or they seem in a crowd or\nSome even have claimed to you know gotten a phone call and a lot of people of course you know they say hey you know this happens but I never got maybe it's because I got the good buys from my my parents before they passed that some people aren't that lucky they don't have the goodbyes and so sometimes I'm sure\nAnd they say sixty percent of the time it's happens is that most people you know come in contact with a dead loved one within days after they pass away that come to a ... dream or they appear to them in a room\nWhere you see them in a crowd or you know something indicates that there with you that their presence was there\nAnd\nYou know a lot of people say well there are new such things as goes well I Would I Would beg to differ there's something about\nThe other side there's something about the spirit realm it's it's fascinating I mean go shores spirit and demonic communication they show up often in classic literature including mythology there in the Bible or I remember Shakespeare utilized go a lot in his place\nAnd you all it back to a going back to a Victorian England and it was fashionable then in many circles to conduct surveillance is\nUm and they had ... boards back then I mean you go all the way back then they had something similar to we were three legged tables candles a table tapping all those things they were used to try and contact the dead Edison actually Thomas Edison created a um\nHe's tried to create and make it as we could use ... contact the dad and what happened was instead of contacting the daddy he created somebody can record the debt\n\nAnd what I mean by that is that we listen to a Jim Morrison album we know he's dead but we can still hear his voice\nPatsy Cline like a ghost you listen to her on a record and she's singing crazy\nIt's like you're listening to a ghost mean prince Michael Jackson they're both going but yeah we're hearing them on records they're like goes goes on phonograph dose recorded for posterity something that Edison\nHad done rather than communicating with that we are able to keep a dead in a bottle we can play them or listen to them or talk to them in that way\nAnd then of course there are those who say that they preserved a lot of the dead thinking a lot of what the dead possessed by writing pages and pages\nOf what could be called automatic writing I mean the psychics hands allegedly guide the goes to convey these lengthy handwritten messages and sit since that time since the time of all the you know the communications you know go seem to have\nLost their will or ability to writer even communicate effectively now so we have to use electronic voice phenomena we have these ... electronic voices and so the spirits can be channeled through mediums or they can be channeled through electronic means that can come through your computer or your phone and I always had this experience because we've done these shows about this before\n\nBut sleep a lot of the time when you're dealing with the spirit will get this big nebulous information and always leads to\nInterpret it moment where the so called experience or the medium or whatever is given a word or a science which is knocking or tapping that indicate that something from\nThe serial round which is to make some sort of contact now horror films they began to reflect the public's belief and concerned the contacting of a dead could not only be the gateway to a more simple ... neck romance the but invites possession by evil spirits\nHave you remember The Exorcist I was actually watching the Internet on the Internet they look at the some of the scary moments in people's lives and they always talk about The Exorcist I mean sorry about Reagan McNeil the little girl um she was first contacted through a seemingly innocent encounter with ...\nAny entity she thought she was communicating with and who were mother chalked up to as an imaginary friend called himself captain howdy but later we reveal that he's the demon so so or the demon ... and what's interesting is that\nThe demon ... also kept in ... a lot of people after The Exorcist came out and said that they were experiencing the contact with so so ...\nAre on the board okay [noise]\nI think The Exorcist [noise]\nHad [noise] probably influenced a lot of people into thinking that we use the boards are ah [noise] and ah I don't think I'm bored itself is evil I mean [noise] you know there's no monastery with demon in which is making weeding boards everywhere going that are ... and then putting them in boxes and telling kids\nOn the ... tonight and it's gonna [noise] you know hopefully in light and you do what it might be and what ... what it is [noise]\nI don't think I've really done an extensive\nExplanation of\nWhy we gee words make great tools if you know how to use them and why they may or may not be [noise]\nTools where you can tap into the underworld

parents would directly say do not play with it don't touch but which board don't ...\nBut then you know came the improvisation then came the ritual is ticking off it effective ways of\nTalking to the dead and it turned out that it scared a lot of people when they called upon\nThe spirits come speak to them I mean to be used to the borders for bitten forgiven Asian\nYoung people just opposite
