attacking their fellow students during the school day and according to police department\nYou know they were thinking there was going to be a school shooting something bad is going to happen so the police were where somebody was going to happen and uh\nSo uh somebody and warned that would be a a something bad is going to go down in building five hundred of the middle school or they're in a bar to bar to middle school or the staff immediately began to search the campus they found two girls in a bathroom\nThe girls were holding a goblet what should the ministry of suspect who's going to use to drink alcohol but the ones that are in the principal's office the girls empty their pockets and in their pockets or a knife knife sharpening her a pizza cutter\nUh they also found a butcher knife or in the girls said they had a bag they carry a two admitted the two girls admitted the planning to kill students as they entered the bathroom and when asked about motivation of the girls said well we worship the devil\nAccording to police the girls plan to drink their victims blood\nOut of the goblet they were found with they also discussed eating their victims flesh and living body parts of

pagan traditions that have evolved over time and it's actually a time where it was time to perjure yourself of people's spirits that's why ... because they were put out to scare away evil spirits and then of course a there was a fall festival that was\nPut on by the ... called the Sam hanging summers and not say I mean sorry Sal when I said Sam hey not some people call and say I mean I used to call family and for long Sanford south when\nA meeting summers in\nBut then the Christian missionaries came along and they used as an opportunity to learn about the Christian heroes and martyrs so that day was set aside to remember the Christian heroes and martyrs in fact the day after Halloween was observed is a moment to officially recognized and commemorate the soles of their bless the dead\nWho'd been declared saints\nAll Hallows eve or how low mass is what they call it but you know it kind of you know things have evolved over time [noise]\nSalad [noise] was the only night of the

[noise] part of the thirteenth century Christian literature coming out of Italy engine mosaic law all talking about blood and the importance of blood and how blood is the life and blood and gives a lot [noise]\nYou wonder why there are plenty of vampires out there willing to take that [noise]\nAnd coming up we're going to talk to a real vampire about how she deals with this time of year and what she feels about what's going on [noise] all around the world would be strange stories ... except for three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis will be

now Gabby explained to me how low rate mortgage can help you get out of debt faster\nWell I think I have discussed just before I I'm not really involved in an empire lifestyle that uh I'd I'd say that\nIt doesn't really surprised me that this sort of thing is going to crop up when with\nThese girls when\nAll the adults around them are acting like lunatics and I in this at least in America things had been cut up now\nYou say you don't live the vampire lifestyle but you are of empire right you you do drink blood you and\n... yes yes and of course those two are are very different things\nOkay so what is the difference bench so we can I just wanted to make it clear for everybody to have a better understanding and I'm sure that's why you're here on the show was bringing a better understanding here to the table so what is the difference between the vampire lifestyle and being a vampire per se\nUm well I'd say that they're dramatically different because the vampire lifestyle is generally about ... and fashion right and uh drinking blood is its own thing\nSo do you think or were you born of empire do you think I was you know we're not when you're drinking blood or the young age\n[noise] well no I don't think so because uh I mean I wouldn't say getting uh most of us tend to start to show signs at that are around ...\nAround Thirteen fourteen this is very typical it's a typical story and I've I've heard it a lot so um and that's all you start to build up a\nSort of a stocker\nStories on how these things come to be and people and almost all of us have the same\nGee you're born with this and do you you started to use it in your teen years in puberty you started craving butter you started realizing you knew your first taste of it what was your first taste of it what was it offered to you or did you or or was it something that you did for yourself\nI think the first time I asked her deliberately drink blood was when I was having a a blood draw at a doctor's office so when they told me to hold the the guards there\nI didn't and while they were turned away [noise] it's ... and I take them down so that would be the first time when I was probably Thirteen [noise]\nWas it insatiable craving what you just wanted to do it as an experiment [noise]\nI wouldn't say either one I think that there's just something we're drawing scare [noise] it's not like we become robbing and control the bulls [noise]\nIt monsters at chess [noise] fat [noise] something big to us and pushes that in that direction and some people call it the uh\nUh a beacon and we have a nasty tendency to to find others like us and um [noise]\nAnd that's generally how we learn about it so we'll talk more about this coming up ever can be with us today on the ground zero\nA vampire focused about how it begins and what she's doing will be back\n[noise] you have to file chapter tank every week just what a tragedy or had\nMade possible by me of course you know uh if you really want

world and her story is unique when maybe not unique I mean there are probably others like\nHer out there but I remember a she approached me one time and asked me if I Would be willing to talk with a real vampire about the difference is between lifestyle the differences between the real vampires of how you know they feel and what they do and how they are among us and that they do drink but\nUh in the last segment she talked about how her first taste of blood came from a blood drive it was flowing in a doctor's office if she drank the blood from herself\nSo that's how it began for you um [noise] and after that then what I mean to ... you were you trying to find ways to\nGet more blood did you uh go through your life not drinking it to ... I mean it your first time you try it it's awesome you like it but then what what do you do after that\n[noise] well it's probably different for most of us but uh I spend a lot of time trying to deny\nMy thoughts on it I had a lot of intuition pushing me in that direction and of course being rational and reasonable [noise] of course I said to myself that's not real let's not make up stories [noise]\nSo ah do you question your sanity I mean as you say you know so you you had that craving for blood\nYou your eyes after that first show or were you saying like you said these things aren't real and then you're you're having some I'm sure some thoughts about you know what is going on with me\nShort well it wasn't just a craving for blood it was some intuition I\nWould get messages internally um\nI'd have dreams\nThat would hinder towards something like that and eventually they got fairly\nIntense what do you think we're who or what do you think was speaking to so you were hearing voices are getting messages what would who or what was speaking do you do it\nI don't know and that is one of the things that I Am trying to find out I don't actually now\nI I Know a trail\nUm it to this day it hasn't stopped\nI don't hear voices continually but I Do occasionally hear voices guiding\nWhether they are what are the voices tier is a female male what what's going to voices and\nNow it's a bit like hearing your own thoughts but there's something a little different about it and so um [noise] say do you find yourself wondering am am I just thinking that or is something about to happen\nAnd often some things about to happen and when I listened to it things go really wow and when I ignore it things down\n'cause never prompted you to do anything aggressive do that\nNo no it's anybody who has ever been in a situation where they've been they've heard a voice that says\nUm duck or turn the wheel to the left or something like that now is what I'm Talking about\nSo it's
