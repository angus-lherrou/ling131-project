Nancy thing about Nancy and talks about being in the oval office and\nAll kinds of cool things but yeah I I don't know if they cover though that Reagan was the president they told us be ready for extraterrestrials because if we ever find ourselves in a situation where the entire world's at odds with one another you will always be that\nAlien threat that would unite us and that's and that's the thing is that so we're we're needing now I think we need that alien threat that Reagan talked about um maybe even uh what was it a Jimmy Kimmel Bill Clinton said the same thing but\nYou know you said like he's a David alien thing or something\nTo bring us together and you know that that's a long haul the president's talking about alien threats you know it's so easy thing\nReally to\nSearch for signs of intelligent life beyond our solar system\nI'm\nIn addition to the incredible distances involved and the fact that uh we really\nOnly have indirect methods at our disposal to look for us to trust your life and we have people who say they look up and they see the stars and they they see the the flashing lights in the sky or they see UFOs during the daytime which by the way there seems to be this inordinate amount of UFOs sightings there was actually a signing on the east coast\nUm some ... in the Carolinas before the earthquake and not the before the before hurricane Michael hit to the Gulf apparently it's going to get into the the the Carolinas Carolina's having some really harsh weather since um\nSince Florence and and so now Michael May give them a little taste of some more water and more more rain but that doesn't mean that after the hurricanes they didn't see UFOs and apparently I like someone sent me footage I'm\nFrom ah Myrtle Beach actually someone saying that a UFO oversight over Myrtle Beach and they said was just what the black he was talking about\nAnd um I really in Cedar you out for myself I was looking at the footage but I didn't see the full I sought whites but I don't know\nThat we could call that something that's outer space but you know I guess if the person you know when they saw heard the black to show said well you know you hear the UFOs supposed to be seen that I was what Carol David Davis was saying\nThere will be a UFO that would seem to be at three o'clock in the evening east coast time\nSo I don't know um I don't know if that counts you know it's like I told somebody had said you'll sixty percent of the time I think the cubes right you know the times I don't know but uh you know it just depends on you know if you can really understanding here\nWhat's being said and so you know unless you use something like that but then again it's still specious as to what you're getting and like I said a lot of integrate indirect methods to contact or at least try to find 'em signs of intelligent life in ... I mean there's also the small problem of not knowing exactly what to look for\nAnd I think you know while we've had many people saying well this is what you're supposed to look for these are many UFO researchers and writers that have to take it upon themselves to researchers and writers scientists are like oh we don't know exactly what we're looking for so they're arguing\nOver synthetic lives are arguing over extraterrestrial biological life they're arguing over ... organisms are arguing over aquatic life maybe like on cell it is or\nYou know other uh ice planets icy moons like hop in Star Wars if intelligent life does exist beyond our solar system\nI've always wondered well okay you want to communicate with alien ... how are they going to communicate with us I mean I'm would they even communicate like we do I mean would they use radio transmitters that use other forms of technology to communicate\nI'm probably not and while people say well they should be advances left in our language not necessarily I mean there are plenty of\nSmart or intellectually advanced human beings who don't speak the language you speak and sometimes we if they don't speak our language of misconstrued is being not as smart and that that was one of the problems I had\nWhen I was learning a foreign language and uh you know I was a young kid and I was like you know\nI was learning a language but I forgot that you know when I'm listening to someone else speak English from a different country you know they're trying to speak the language\nAnd sometimes we say well listen to them the way they speak they they don't know language enough so we we misinterpret that is not being very smart but the truth the matter is that the fact that he can foreigners that they can even formed sentences the fact that they can even formed sentences that are even intelligible makes them intelligent\nIt's like the argument over whether or not millennia Trump was smarter whether or not being an underwear model made are stupid and they were comparing and Michelle Obama and I thought well God you know yeah I'm a shell has her good points uh and she's pretty smart but then they said no millennia Trump stoop and they wait wait wait wait wait she speaks like what eight different languages\nAnd uh you know it's so ... I don't know how many that that Michelle Obama speaks but come on I mean if a person can speak that many languages they're really smart and if they're able to keep track of those languages they're pretty smart in fact I envy when producers he speaks Mandarin Chinese\nHe speaks ... I Would love to learn how to speak Mandarin Chinese because then I'd be able to say I speak English I speak Spanish and I speak Mandarin Chinese\nThe three languages that most people should learn if they want to get ahead in business\nOnly got two of them Spanish and English\nAnd Spanish is the language of labor or English and Mandarin will be the language in big business because we all know the future and we all know where China is in our future so Mandarin Chinese baby\nGotta learn Mandarin so you can get around and you know border things on the menu other than general ... chicken so that's that's important of course if you want to be in business but see that's the thing\nYou know communicating with alien so that's a bigger deal\nDoing if we were you in language of the of of other people's air on this planet ancient languages would be difficult I don't know if anybody speaks aromatic I'm a\nYou know made up languages I guess that's Broncos made up we're going on is made up but you can still be going on in Esperanto but are using radio transmitters using other things are lights signals hell even smoke signals he's or a ways of\nCommunicating and so\nThis seems to be what the preoccupation is right now\nI mean it used to be well we want proven aliens have arrived we want them to land on the White House lawn well Sadie and Medi course the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and Medi messaging extraterrestrial intelligence international\nThese groups are don't care ... sign on the White House\nThey want to be able to get a signal a techno signature they want to be able to get something\nThat can prove that they're out they're communicating they they and and believe me I'm I'm going to tell you this today I was looking over notes and what prompted me to do this show tonight was an article in business insider\nOkay Business Insider talking about what we were talking about few nights ago\nWith regard to extraterrestrials with regards to um the numbers with regard to techno signatures with regard to listening for the communication looking up and this guy seeing what ever it is it's out there keeping your mind open\nLooking for extraterrestrials in space or\nLooking for a you know that moment you know we should be looking for those moments because those moments are happening more than we realize\nLast night there was a um there was a a huge media or I guess the crash in a place called ...

Scott south pole station it's in Antarctica and uh the University of Wisconsin is a the group that I uh basically runs that Madison, Wisconsin University of Wisconsin Madison\nAnd then there's the ... brewery neutrino observatory located in the form of a mind complex there suddenly Ontario and it's operated by a group called snow lap okay so\nWe use ... detecting facilities exist and they're in in various places around the globe but I find interesting is that they have one in an article called the ice cube\nAnd they're they're they're trying to detect neutrinos but recently there was a story in Scientific American that indicated that something was happening in the ... actually was happening um in in Antarctica\nBut may see the baby and seal the deal on populations restaurant communication or actually a signature left behind\nBy extraterrestrials or there are bizarre particles to keep flying out of an article ... and they may shattered modern physics reserved neutrinos there there are special kinds of neutrino and physicists don't know what what they are exactly but they do know\nIt's uh it comes about in some sort of ... high energy particles blasted its way through space in the beer and then back out the poll yet\nAnd and so this isn't an article or something comes in at the top of the planet comes out of Antarctica but the particles that are coming out\nA physicist are saying this is going to change the standard model of physics if uh we find out\nOr why these are these particles are doing or something they don't normally do I mean see\nYou know when you look at the standard model model of particle physics\nThese nano particles were these neutrinos or whatever they may be they shouldn't be able to do what they do but they're doing so I mean look there are low energy neutrinos that can pierce through miles upon miles of rocket affected but these are high energy neutrinos as weather\nAs well as fighting a detecting other high energy particles [noise] they have large cross sections that means they almost always crashing something soon after zipping into earth and never make it out the other side but [noise]\nThis has been going on since March twenty sixteen [noise] okay [noise] march of twenty six teams [noise] now do you remember\nWhat happened in February [noise]\nI'm twenty six [noise] remember what happened with that [noise] well a refresher memory I certainly there were a lot of people who fought but aliens and landed\nIn Antarctica and maybe they kind of have\nBut ah [noise] I'll tell you about the timeline here\nAbout a month before the discovery or the month after the ... with a month after the discovery\nOf of these nano particles that something bizarre happened we had a number of people we had a Russian patriarch few others go down to Antarctica to visit and this may be why we'll be back [noise]\n\n... phone\n\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] we have to celebrate his ... ... ...

I found this\nTopic very interesting and uh um so I did a little research on the train goes because it was my understanding that you know neutrinos generally just came from but\nRight during my research I found out it uh they were getting emails from a number of sources are ablaze law law that you get you do it well and and there are no Nineteen eighty seven\nEight mhm and and it ended the fact\nThat neutrino detectors have to be buried so very very deep in the wild and they have to be extremely large\nBut what what where it came to my attention is this has been in Arctic or where are you know at the poll a media right in in media or where they're all they're they're found very easily and and it's common place to Park City it's just all stay\nIn in that region of our\nPlanet right um so you know it came to my attention\nWhile they were building this neutrino detector system has to be so deep in the ground so large that they ran across something they ... the lady shouldn't have

...\nDifferent radio frequencies out there and from what I understand you can control does and uh uh as well and I just wanted to mention all the same thing about a national thing by nickel test up

down there I mean nothing that can be verified I guess but history seems to speak otherwise I think you know\nWell they they they said that he was he went he had about five thousand twelve five thousand at least or a soldiers and a scientist it it took down there and\nUm he was attacked and then he had to retreat leave enough or they were ... you know a a usual aircraft\nIn ... things like
