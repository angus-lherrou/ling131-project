because I think people are beginning to see that like we were talking about the arch of bail and how that has a representation that it was directed during that time of the of the cabinet forward a discussions\nThat it represented sexual perversion uh the killing of babies and sacrifice\nNow we're getting into the numbers game are getting into numbers and we're getting into a what is coming maybe a a footing a war in the future and these numbers are all adding up give us an idea of what the black cube is and what it represents and how it is\nSort of a a a voice box or recorded for what is going to happen\nFirst off on the subject of ball or bell ball or a bell in relation to sexuality is interesting because ... is a fertility got in on the fact of the black cube if we look at religion and we look at history we fly if we find the black ... all over the world we find the Jews used the black cube called the capital and a little kid where they have a piece of paper inside of it with a prayer on it\nWe have the holy of holy and Solomon's Temple the perfect cube we have the ... is a black you've located centrally within all ... all around the sacred site of Muslims at mecca\nAnd then we have the cube in a modern day Azerbaijan which is a fire cult I'm an area where there was a fire called\nA and historical days and that Cuba as a representation of those fire deities so you see this throughout a religion you see this throughout history but when you start to break the cube down it takes you into more magical and more a cult\nStudies and one of those studies is the study of what is called the magic square so you have each of the seven classical planet that has its own magical square which is derived from the number of that planetary intelligence and it said\nThat each of these intelligence is has a\nForm of consciousness that is free from the body free from flash it the more it'll end of the ... and all things that are\nThat are of God if you will and so physical son is typically broken down for example into the spiritual Sunday intellectual son in the material sun and in the ... ... you have a mix of Muslim and Jewish believes there\nThe intelligence of the sun is called ... which is a name and the metro area equivalent to one one one the spiritual son is known as so Ross\nAnd that's new at that numerical value is six six six and both of those numbers both of those spiritual essence is\nAre derived from the magic square of the sun which is a square with six columns in six rows\nEach line all of the numbers in every direction add up to one one one\nAnd every grow every line one one one time the six\nColumns in rows equals six six six so that is a number of the sun than they are of course is the magic square of Saturn which has a square with three columns in three rows each line adds to the number Fifteen and numerically the number Fifteen if you look at that numerically and apply it to numerology when\nYou count to ten and just start over again one two three four five six seven eight nine\nTen has won again and so on and so forth a number Fifteen become sick so Fifteen Fifteen Fifteen for each of those three lines equals six six six and that's where we get\nThe magic square of Saturn ... six six six Saturn is the father I heard you and Alex Jones earlier today and you mentioned Jupiter\nAnd it's interesting because Jupiter is Jew Peter and Peter is popped her father as in the dark father or the dark lord the lord of the rings Saturn the black cube is a representation Clyde of the material world ended his

something of Fort Night or in one of the seasons Liam place for it and I I was noticing that there was a a black cube that showed up from out of nowhere that was in a uh the area there that ah Lee and was trying to figure out how to conquer it\nAnd ah I don't know exactly what happened but apparently the Cuban transformed itself into a floating land mass over the area and I was fascinated by this because the cube itself had what looked like a Jewish riding on it it had a number of things that looked like gold Hebrew writings\nAnd I I was curious as to why that would show up in a game it had to it at a very a cult\nOr I guess overtone in symbolism to it that I was very ah mesmerized by it I figured this image is not going to go away his images\nFriday's from five to eight and Saturday some

the ... the minds of men are given hope and working for a positive future we can we can make major change in the ... and what's happening right now in the world and it's not like we're\nNot we're just one person or whatever we can work together on this and we can make big changes of the skull or you know when you some people see it they say they don't think of it as something positive because they have these thoughts and their mind about\n... calls but when you see that especially in the ... and you see the workman ship and the love that went into it and the uh just there's a special energy

and he goes why would a girl up guys are crying is something he doesn't know what it is and it turns out to be a crystal skull as interesting because of the old time for the crystal skull it was not a lot of that ancient walls is a lot of information and\nYou may understand that I couldn't let go anymore\nThat is how I started to search to wheat and it is interesting in that time is up many pistols calls route and so on the Internet ... which was the first of all I'm that appeared\nThat Michel ... is the all I'd had this fascination that one day I Would need them in July and just a ... to ... thousand seven bill and bill came for the call for us that the\nCoal organized and that is on I saw this call but in the meantime I Will be studying calls and trying to understand and it was interesting what you were saying about the ... the black box a cute is that's the right name of that\nLike ... like you know\nAt a because the key words\nI think as soon as you start working list crystal skull is\nCalled ... yes and you were mentioning and that's absolutely true you also work with material that calls for a mother earth so it links and to the earth but it's also links in to the fact that the ancient people\nOr putting information in a system is while the best systems or you are without their knowledge or you can put information and that is quite right or they use these ancient courts as a storage of inflammation that'd be now try\nTo access at a lot of the interesting things and that is is\nWe have not being very successful yes there are channels and that it isn't that are that is far more information and officials call [noise]\nSo people are searching for how can you access even this information because ... contains Charlotte's inflation I remember a story of a I called you know which which a\nCompany was working with feeding itself courts and they were putting inflation into this tiny piece of artificial girl and crystal and they say that the size of shook it along chicken put almost whole library\nWhile anyway imagine and I look at the ... Michel ... how much information that can be ... ... no brain and the human brain that can really get all that information\nSo I think the reason that I was only a crystal skull out in the wall nuns asked to give people the opportunity to train so they can access\nInformation and crystal skulls so that to gather and this will be a very very important point to get it we can piece to gather information at the ancient put into the crystal skull\nAnd I think that's important it's very important because as you say or quartz crystal is every quarter it does ah maintain a or at least holds onto a ancient technology and each of the information and as you were saying you talked about the the ... we talked about\nUh just what they used it for the use it as a transmitted ... the value of arc of the covenant was an example of a of a cue\nThe holy moly the temple example the cube and are they actually utilize the chords crystal crystal skulls of course I Love the Mayan temple ... they were able to utilize these very artifacts ancient ancient technology has been used in the past that we have here in Studio tonight\nBill home and with his notes on the phone Dr Jonathan with us to talk about the crystal skull more information coming up\nAnd your calls for believe six seven three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm Lou as you listen to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\n\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it seeps are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet wouldn't it be great if there was a safe that had to look up a beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino\nWhich allows you love all the way to go to receive more insulation but also to proceed which means to solve late at the end of August ...\nThat we're already talking about the fact that first of all schools have been used to store information all you can put as ... as you walk in to it if you have no way to get it out and Charles laid it in one way or another\nAnd then we still miss the key aspect of what crystal skulls are so the angels all like markers all the pop they're being used by people in the past to help us to at least show\nIf you can access it out to work with them and that he had all this ... that are that to train us to make it easier to easier to access all of this out the information chest up\n[noise] so actually you can say that's working this crystal skulls is a journey off ... spend any potential and expanding consciousness and awareness\nThat is that gift and I think the ... that they make it to shape off a\nCall it put information in any\nParticular uh courts yeah Hollywood even know that that is what the information that study ancient that ... be neat have to make sure that people in the future\nWell the shuttle I realized wow that is for the ... so that is why they let the people feel when they call an all access crystals felt\nAlways remember Renisha always remember crystal whose court soon crystal provided\nThe means by which we could communicate now with one another using crystal radios crystal radio that were the first radio is that where we can broadcast information to and from each other long distances\nThere were ... you know people like Tesla Marconi there were very much aware of using crystal in order to create that sort of a communication not only that but to get records\nSuch as what we had with the idea of the photograph or the or the or the digital recorders these are all the technologies that came from the original crystal from the original\nPorts and so it's important to understand that some of the ancient technology like what we find in the crystal skull is not being utilized in our technology today a doctor about it and I appreciate\nYou coming on this program thank you for your thoughts on this matter I really did enjoy our time together [noise]\nSo did I thank you so much a and we will talk with you to pick your\nOkay Bye bye Tripoli except with three thirty seven hundred

glued together and listening to the radio of course radio began with court some crystals and\nWhy we're here's the crystal skull go home and how you feel and so far about what we're talking about that I mean there've been many people coming to students like\nPutting their hands up against the school and feeling the power I mean these are experiences that I remember one time I had my hands there crystal skull and it came towards the end it in when I walked away from a move towards me\nSo for some reason I had this magnetic attraction to the school is that it does that signify anything in your opinion at your magnetic personality [laughter] I [laughter]\nI don't know eight certainly a happy a completely mesmerized\nBeen baffled I had never\nHad an experience like that with any inanimate objects so to have a school moved towards me after I put my hands near it um it it certainly had the healing power in a\nA you know I remember when we first had a Shonda Roscoe in the studio I was not convinced that this will be anything you know worthy cause you to the school itself\nIs a visual thing okay and we will be doing a ... a ... will be doing a a a will be doing a Facebook Live so you can see this but it it is a visual thing or you have to see it to believe but first of all then to be near it is to feel it\nAnd that is the second part in many of you are not going to be able to feel it and then comes the idea of communication and experience in that comes with both internal ... feeling and spirit\nWhich of course you get from it and of course tonight we're going to also bring about the new technology with the old black cube so we're going to have the best of both worlds here and building so grateful for you to bring this again into our studio and this time give us an opportunity to utilize both\nAre we today of cells along with new technologies that will bring forward what we would thousands of years of knowledge and and intuition and and all the things the skull represents\nYeah I Believe that's what the schools all about is this a learning and knowledge and keep evolving and uh what you were talking about tonight is is is right on the edge of what you know what we should be learning what we should be working on right now that I feel\nI fully agree it's like a what a what Ryan cities is bringing together the feminine and\nThe ... and the and the in the

in my hand and I thought I close my eyes they'll think I'm doing something for found them\nThey'll leave me alone because I don't see anything in this thing and I but you know just so the next thing I knew I so so I sleep\n'cause I had this noise snoring oh I Know how do I get out of this so slowly opened my eyes and they were saying that was wonderful that was terrific and I said yes it was [noise]\nAnd they did you hear it said uh he was an eight six do on a tape recorder and I said\nWhat did that come from thinking I was definitely asleep and they said that you I said no that's not me it's not even my voice and they said no it's definitely you and what has happened as I thought I had fallen asleep\nI'm so much of this information to pull it out through a couple of tapes without stopping and um I was totally freaked out actually it\nWas you were to showing you were showing a yes or no let's go\nTo a that kind of situation I'm used to being sort of in control of the well semi in control are giving my permission and allowing\nA none of that has happened it was just boom and um that that was my first introduction and a semi seemed very happy yeah because it started to give its history and I was not happy\nAnd thought okay it's goodbye and we won't do that again right that again\nYou know what I remember I was ... one time I went through a trembling session and it scared me so much like throw away the tapes of the recording I look back and regret that now because I remember was so amazing you know some of the things that are my ... my body did they have on tape and ah just terrified me to the point where I didn't want\nWant anybody to see it nor do I want to experience that again but now looking back I'm bringing you matured understand what this is an hour an hour the operates\nI I won't back to the time when that happened to me and ah would which would have kept a recording of but maybe somewhere out there somebody's gonna recording of been recorded some of my old shows but it was something definitely the traveling aspects are are are really amazing what can be done through the human body through your worst\nYes absolutely so that that was my first initial I'm meeting with the skull and um then they asked me to go back like two months later I said no no no no\nNo no one and then sent me had started calling me which struck up a friendship and and she was saying if I wanted to see you do want you to come up and I when Sammy cold you jumped [laughter]\nI did go back a second time and I said okay I Know what you're about so I didn't look at it I kept my eyes off it and everything and [noise] and Sammy said well let's see what this guy has to say today puts it in front\nOf me and I'm not looking I don't get involved and\nUm the people that had come what kind of expecting something and I said look I'm Sorry but I come to I don't know how to do you know\nIt won't be anything showing on command and starting to do well even though I may ask you to do it later so be ready to accept that I put my hand on the skull and that's the last thing I remember\n[laughter] on my bike\nAnd so I said semi I you know I Can't do this and I can't do this anymore is is this is a tricky for me and to look at all these things you said anyway it went on for many many years\nAnd I they are being me I I like prove it\nAnd I don't know if I told you about the storms so they had this panel of experts come there was a physicist scientist a medical doctor and somebody else and they what\nWe all out and touch me to a machine things and um to see what happened you know basically it was fraud if it was fraud and but I think anyway they\nThey during the session they said the instrument you're working with um you told us that this could be used to control the weather so we'd like to see that demonstration\nAnd it said oh my okay storm so within minutes\nThey stormed a lot of really bad stone and then it said stop storm went away so when I came back they told me I thought well that's good\nThat's that's some kind of proof the next time we were up there said well that could be coincident have them do it again so they asked for them you know to coach showed a storm again or do something\nAnd it said the yes control the weather right\nAnd that led put my hand up didn't even say anything it started to rain really hot and we had some sun lightning and a pretty significant that they thought took notes and everything will record it and uh and the\nScarlet had enough of it it's that stop and it did within you know unusual amount of time minutes with is it time [laughter] it cuts Carroll said yeah\nThat could be coincidence to you know this guy that\nI mean and that's one of the reasons why I Love you so much is because you know well you know you talk about you know these experiences you also weigh in coincidence you where you and the practical major up at all and you're very or you have a critical analysis of even of your own work\nWhich I think is a million things are ... words to break and then like I said I'm going to be if we can do to communicate with the scope and maybe in parts and we've been to was from the school\nOn the program tonight so it'd be nice to hear that from you suspect to Colonel Davis with one of my favorite people I always say like every time I talk with er it's like I just enjoy [noise]\nA positive
