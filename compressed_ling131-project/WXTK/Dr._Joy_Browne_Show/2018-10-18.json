I just searched high and low all over the Web\nTyping in key words armada space armada stark clusters Russian scientists these dark clusters living there alien armada think they're an alien formation or some UFO\nFormation could not find the story\nAt all sure he was gone\nI Will commute to try and find the story on Google if you're near a computer and send it to me on Twitter so to me and my in my Facebook feed on our on more than happy\nTo uh you know good Mitt that maybe it is there but I cannot find that story\nCan't find that story\nSo it was like one of those off the cuff comment so I didn't do any research on I'm thinking well I Want to do research on this I Want to find out more can't find a damn thing\nSo last night\nI don't know if I'm any of you know this but there was a full worldwide shutdown of YouTube last night\n\nAnd I got an email from a guy named Scott ... emails me all the time and he kept mentioning this story about uh have you seen this video this video is going around the Internet this video of guys in uniform of the military and you say that something is about to hit the moon\nSome large object is about to hit the moon well apparently this is the this is a conspiracy theory this is a conspiracy theory cause I cannot can from it so it's a conspiracy theory meaning that since I Can't confirm it but it's weird\nThat I think I'm having some sort of a mental breakdown or something I don't know what's going on here but\nUm there are rumors flying around as to why the this this this this outage occurred\nLast night and the chief rumor is that viral video\n\nThe viral video of a guy something on YouTube relief that purported to show a man in uniform announcing that\nSomething large he didn't asteroid a rock a UFO I dunno something large was about to crash into the moon\n\nIs this and that was notified by email and Scott if you're listening please send that email again I Want I Want to know if you send an email too because I read your email sometimes they don't reply to them but I read your emails and Scott you know who you are I'm Talking right to you\nI Want to know where that video is about man or that that footage of something hitting the moon because from what I understand is that they shut down you two last night they shut down YouTube last night because of that video\nThey didn't want that video to go viral so they had to shut down the system see they won't tell anybody way the system shut down it just shut down because they wanted to weed out any and all of these videos going around that would show something hitting the moon\n\nNow eight I Can't find proof of this and I can't find a video or if I Can't find the story about the armada and the stark clusters and the Russians and the art the story it all sounds like some science fiction misinformation\n\nMaybe got leaked out it wasn't supposed to be heard of ... or or thought about right so\nScience fiction is information may maybe some history to play a joke on people\nBut\nI mean\nIs it really or was it really science fiction this information really because of circumstances it just seems a little odd\nRussians say they see be stark clusters say but they don't want to start clusters they look like do you remember the famous than you might remember me saying this on the air is what I'm Talking about the neutrinos coming out of Antarctica right and I said oh and now they're saying that Russia has said that they're seeing ... looked like our motto UFOs blah blah blah blah blah you remember I said something about that haven't been able to find\nThat quote [noise] but I have a friend who said you did say it okay I did see it\n\n\nI said it and then the shutdown of YouTube and a mysterious email not really mysterious was a guy who sends me emails all the time saying that he saw video in fact I Want to check my emails the abuse on this year to see if he wrote me back I Want to find out to be listening to me if he's writing me back immediately\nUm see no he hasn't written me he has not\n\nSomebody sent me some better rushing star clustered [noise]\nNo that's not in jail thank you but this is your story [noise] because you the story [noise] I'm thinking of somebody sent me a [noise]\nA something about a Russian star cluster that joke curry who I met in Virginia\nAmazing woman when she met started I'm Sorry decided [noise]\nNothing Scott if you're listening man you got to tell me did you see that video something hitting the moon hitting the moon last night\nBecause I hear that that was the reason why they shut down you too [noise]\nAnd I'm feeling I'm honestly it misses in for a fact I Am feeling really nervous than I I'm\nI feel it in my neck I feel tension in my neck something definitely\nHe's weird about this whole thing\nI mean as I say\nIt'd be science fiction disinformation it could be something else\nI'm Still looking for the proof will be back don't go away [noise]\n\nAre you considering a safe

about that film today\nEspecially when I was reading that some major space mishaps have been happening recently that seemed like an eerie coincidence\nLike for example the Russian rockets so use MS ten failed to launch on its way to the ins and according to a statement released by NASA\nBut still use MS ten spacecraft launched from ...\nTo the international space station of poor forty am eastern stand eastern daylight time\nOn Thursday October eleventh carrying American\nAstronaut Nick ... in Russia in ... Alexi ... shortly after launch there was an anomaly with the booster and the launch\nWas aboard it so they had to have a ballistic landing of the spacecraft\nLaunched appear to be going smoothly but Ninety seconds later NASA on his life's dream reported that a problem seemed to have occurred while the booster rocket between the first and second stages of operation the space agency NASA tweeted that ballistic dissent involved they sharper angle of lending compared to normal\nThe capsule continue the astronaut successfully separated from the rocket booster and parachute into the ground with a rescue teams helicopters we're ... we're actually standing there waiting for him it's also interesting to know the two NASA or two of NASA's important space telescopes when did the safe mode\nMeaning that something forced them into shutting down the Chandra X ray observatory\nWent into safe mode\nAnd halted all that science operations a few days after that Hubble are actually ... shutdown first toppled shut down to a gyroscope failure\nShawndra X ray observatory shut down a shatters transition disabled is probably they say this is what NASA said was possibly triggered by an issue but it also has something to do with this gyroscope as well so we're looking at\nComponent shutting down on the ... the X ray observatory the Hubble Space telescope ... owned by the way the curiosity Mars rover NASA's curiosity rover that also health and science operations it went into glitch mode as well [noise]\nOkay\nSo we have these different\nObservatories the Chandra X ray observatory the Hubble Space telescope\nWe have a rocket that couldn't go to the I asked that because it it it went into some sort of a [noise] ah they went in some sort of malfunctions who had to come back down and then the

the moon\nHad been hit by something but let me let me read you read it as\nSaying right now okay or read it is sitting on a bulletin at the moment or read it's Mooney impact reason for you to shut down that's the headline and it's on a rabbit joined a discussion Mooney impact reason for you to shut down ... says ah\nSomebody had posted a video of what looked like the moon being hit by something and then they say that's old footage from two years ago if anyone has the footage of the man in uniform warning of an impact last night before you to shut down please share\n\nWhich footage e referring to answer where did you hear about the man in uniform video I've heard it from various huge Hoover's\nWhat YouTube or what kind of impact demand warned about\nUm\nSecure team can as mentioned there a website that uh have their UFO er video website or somebody mentioned secure team Tim mentioned it ah there'd been a handful of you to reclaim this issue but the reason why they shut down last night was because of the moon\nSomething about the moon men in uniform moon it was a bad after effects quickie that's all it was so the ... that they're going on and on and on about the other footage a\nBut it's just out of the cameras and telescopes to look at them at all times why were we were really find this and there's and then they're saying well you have the Chandra X ray shut down you have the Hubble shut down there is no one at the INS\nWhat's going on [laughter] although it leads to the south that telescopes were down a\nAnd they talk about the sunspots observatory in

from is just to show you that he is discussing what he saw a and on on YouTube before we shut down this is a John ex army was another\nHundreds of patriotic comments on there are rumors spreading fast that there was a live stream of the moon tonight\nAnd something huge impacted the moon\nAnd sent chunks in pieces flying everywhere and like Marshall will said the the video went on trendy and it started to get hundreds of thousands of views in a few minutes and then all of a sudden you two went off line\nAnd ah nobody can find the video\nOf of the\nSomething hitting them are now that's just a rumor I have seen no proof that that is true but there's a few things I Want to talk about the first thing I Want to say\nIs keep in mind the planned alien invasion the fake alien invasion\nA lot of you guys just got tricked remember we warn each other all the time\nThat the next battle is supposed to be against fake aliens\nIt's awarded drain in the world really lesions\nOn terrorism is finished they're supposed to start a fake alien invasion so keep that in your mind 'cause they just got a lot of people trick tonight [noise] all of a sudden rumors are\nGoing around there was a video of something hitting them ... YouTube goes down and worldwide\nJust like\nThank you a message you when I get off stream Cindy and I'll give you the way to the ex army chat room [noise]\nSo keep in mind that uh\nJust might be one of the first uh steps they do towards the fake alien invasion\nSo John ex army is thinking that what happened last night was part of the fake alien invasion and uh you said that he actually stream something going on at the the the other night with the moon or and or you've got to a green screen for this is what we can get this summer really underwear [noise]\nYou shouldn't we're off the air somebody shut us down we're off here find a way to get and then all of a sudden alarms went back up nothing was wrong but that tone set up or shut down radio station\nThat open shut down your radio station that people are saying that was being cut off but I was being jammed remember that remember that night I was at night okay my memory is it's kind of faulty right now\nOkay so so okay so\nThe whole Russia things Russia Today I went to look for the notes and\nNothing nothing\nSo something weird happened last night too and this is this is a this is from a read a page I write a reading his reporting that there was a fall worldwide shutdown of YouTube last night there was because we were having a hard time preparing our show that gives a lot of that stuff we use for a montage has been for\nMusic in liners and stuff we get from YouTube or we get the audio from you too we couldn't get audio last night for a lot of things because you too but ... had been shut down full worldwide shutdown of YouTube\nAnd there are rumors flying around as to why this outage happened and one of the cheap rumors is and I'll read it directly from a from this this is from\n\nRead it okay if anyone has the footage of the man in uniform warning of an impact on the moon last night before you to shut down and took it off please share\nSo the rumor is that YouTube\nHad to shut down a viral video of a man in uniform there was pointing out that the moon was about to have struck by something or he\nDidn't say what it was he didn't have type ... people say they thought it was like it had a hundreds of thousands of hits and then it was taken down and then all of a sudden you to shut down\nOkay\nSo that's a mystery that's tacked onto this you know I was notified by an email a guy named Scott who told me I got to go back and see ... ... email us ... told me he says have you seen this video he was mentioning the video he said it to be like five six teen\nOkay okay\nAll right so we have you seen this video and and I didn't know what he was talking about All right so you to shut down to the moon get hit by an asteroid or was it as a cyber attack here's another Youtube video saying was shut down because of this whole moon thing okay\nSo I mean I'm getting now I'm getting bombarded with emails and all kinds of other pointers and and and references to what happened last night with you to shut down\nUh [noise]\nSo that's something that's mysterious something had crashed on the moon and they didn't want anybody you see it hit the moon so they shut down you to keep people from watching it because it was going viral\n[noise] now\nIt's like I said this sounded like a lot of science fiction misinformation right and and the fact that you can go back and reference things but I Do know what I talked about two nights ago I Do know I played those homes I Do know that I played a frequency that was being sent by the so called armada\nAnd this armada apparently that sounds coming from is shut down the radio stations across the country now you to shuts down okay it's back up again today but\nAll this reminded me of an old science fiction film called earth versus the flying saucers and what happens in that film is that rockets and missiles and satellites all get shut down because the aliens are planning to arrive there plenty of land\nAnd so I got to thinking about what's been happening in the past few days first of all the Russian rockets so use MS can feel the launch on its way to the I. S. S. according to a statement that was released by NASA but still use them as\nTent space crap watched from about ... or cause the drum in Kazakhstan to the international space station for forty ... am eastern daylight time\nThursday October eleven or carrying American astronaut Nick Kagan Russian cause not Alex C o and shit and\nShortly after launch there was an anomaly with the booster and the launch ascent was aborted resulting in a ballistic lending up a spacecraft\n\nLaunched appeared to be going smoothly but about Ninety\nLater NASA on his life's dream reported that a problem seemed to have occurred with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separation the space agency tweeted the ballistic descended Bob the sharper angle of landing compared to normal the castle containing the awestruck successfully separated from the rocket booster\nAnd parachute into the ground with the rescue teams were there to pick them up it's also interesting to know the two of NASA's important space telescopes when\nDid the safe mode shutting down about sending information back but the Chandra\nX ray observatory when did the same boat and ... and all the science operation is a few days after Hubble the Hubble Space telescope\nShut down due to a gyroscope failure according to the agency ... is a transition at the same boat was possibly triggered by an issue that also had something to do with a gyroscope\nComponent in charge of pointing and stabilizing telescope however there are some investigators and those were into deep space conspiracy theory they're saying that something is happening in space that NASA does not want us to see\nAnd ... and and just outta coincidence NASA's curiosity Mars rover it temporarily halted science operations to there's been a glitch with that so that we can't see anything from Mars\nCan't see anything from Mars here's an overnight bulletin\nHasn't made national headlines yet but here we go NASA's planetary defense coordination ops are offices two year old a two year old a a organization that NASA's it's NASA's planetary defense coordination office two years old it started with a budget\nIt started with a small budget and now it's gone to overnight and they they spiked it to a hundred and fifty million dollar budget for this a planetary defense coordination office\n\nFirst of all there was Ninety million dollars I wouldn't know sixty million dollars I went from sixty million dollars to one hundred and fifty million dollars overnight and says you're amid growing concerns of humanity is utterly unprepared for the unlikely but still an ... an asteroid strike of climate it's proportions the White House has also recently\nIssued a new national near earth object prepared to strategy an action plan intended to energize a host of agencies who could contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster\nSo Ninety million more dollars I mean we have not been concerned about why is it the shot up to a hundred and fifty dollars hundred and fifty million dollars\n... white issue a brand new plan that it's intended to energize the host of agencies who can contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster if there is no debt disaster looming for the foreseeable future something isn't right about all this something is definitely wrong here\nI mean it feels like a really scary B horror science fiction film it sounds like a war of the world scenario it sounds\nToo weird to be real but it is real it's happening I mean these these shutdowns I mean remember the sunspot observatory was shut down on September Six twenty Eighteen and then all this stuff is good chicken shut it got to remember all the other space observatory to shut down after the September ... shut down in New Mexico\n\nI mean these shutdowns remind me of what happens before an alien invasion well he's from a science fiction perspective I mean and I don't I don't want I don't want it to be about this but I guess it all depends how you look\nAt what is going on around you and everything around us this is is it it just it sparking a lot of anxiety I was feeling really\nBizarre all day to day a lot of tension in my neck a lot of ah I I couldn't concentrate\nI couldn't concentrate something was up and then when I'm reading all of these posts saying did you see the video of the man in uniform stadium to the moon was about to be hit by something I said no it went all over the Internet\nFlew on the north\nEastern ... on the right side of the Mona you're looking at it the right side I Would say it was about to me looking at it was eighty percent brighter than it was darker so it wasn't quite happy\nBut it was somewhat fast at a\nIt was weird though oh ... night I could not believe what I what I see I I just it was just really weird and then here you are talking about what happened last night and it's like what the hell\nYeah really I mean\nWell there there were some guy the Johnny ex army the name of the video stream or there were some guys that actually a shot some footage\nA from a were they were and they saw a cluster go around the moon in near the moon and others say they thought hit the moon a them getting more mood footage uh sent to me\nThat oh there you have your plume I have another video of this plume sort of a kind of a Milky kind of weird color\nAround the moon I'm there you go up\nThat you know there was\nYeah it was weird and I you know you could tell when you look at the shadow them on the side of the dark side where it was just started I which I couldn't figure out it was stored I checked looking at it looking at it and looking out for all night when I got closer towards the western part of the United states\nUh it was it cleared up and the Mona was Vegas how I mean I could see it that I you know are shut my day off I stopped and turned myself off but off that ... throughout the night\nFrom the time like fall yet so I stopped around so four or five o'clock and I'm\nWell I'm going to let somebody sent me a somebody sent me a video of the moon and in the cloud and coming in and it's not something they're and they're saying nothing happened to the moon the

something cropping would infrared day I'd be that night vision\nAnd you could see it pass on the front of the moon it was amazing so something did happen last night we just haven't found the video the guy in uniform was saying something was going to hit the moon there was allegedly why you to shut down so anyway I think my recall thank you so much\nTripoli six Seventy three thirty seven hundred a

it look fake but no they slowed it down so you don't miss it ah but ah I saw the faster version that looked pretty damn scary very I could say OK so this is supposed to be on my Facebook page right now\nAh\nOkay it's supposed to be on my Facebook page right now this is the NIH can't vision\nOf a something going past the moon\nAnd uh this is what was used uh as as proof but there there's no uniform man that I see but is that the thing is shut down YouTube that's the question or something else but I Want to remind you of something that uh\nThe EEO all there's all these things are going down and we we talked about a Scientific American a story\nThey indicated that something was happen something was happening in Antarctica that child I thought sound like good seal the deal on ... communication and the story was there's these bizarre particles that keep flying out of an Arctic is ice\nAnd they might shattered modern physics they were saying if it does is it just is not knowing exactly what these things are\nAre there high particles bitter blast they usually blasts through space it on the planet now they're coming out of the planet to go into the planning to go out of the planet and so these particles you know they make up what scientists call ... you know the standard model these things break\nThe particle physics standard model and so scientists are going this has gotta be something but it could be alien perhaps\n\nSomething alien you know they say this could be which means that or something is leaving behind a trail\nAnd unknown trail in it I don't know if it's ... some some guys will be fuel it's burning or what have you but since March twenty sixteen researchers have been puzzling over to advance in Antarctica where cosmic rays did burst out of the earth and wood attacked by masses Antarctic impulsive transferred in China the Anita it's a balloon born in China drifting off of the southern continents\n\nNow need is designed to hunt cosmic rays from outer space so the high energy neutrino community was bothering with excitement\nWhen it seems to be detected particles it seemed to be blasting up from earth it's sort of zooming down from space because cosmic race shouldn't do that inside is beginning to wonder whether these mysterious beams are made of particles never seen before\n\nNow\nMore anomalous activity was reported recently what scientists monitoring the Ross ice shelf in western Antarctica\nAnd this was just recently\nThey were monitoring the Ross ice shelf and the western part of Antarctica and they caught something\nThey caught a signal\nAnother signal that this time I don't think I'd be shutting down radio stations with this signal okay the other single for the armada for some reason every radio station most every

on your keep your eyes to this guy's too because I think a lot of people are curious as what's going on I mean I don't know I it's just like all the coincidence I mean think about it I mean a lot of people are probably thinking that this is all not nonfat but if you were to read what's going on mainstream media is not going to talk about that\nYou certainly aren't going to talk about it and we got to get used to be ideal they're not going to talk about it and just because it's being talked about on the show like mine rather showed it's not conspiracy\nTheory this is happening okay tell me
