lead because of the fact that he wrote a book about it\nAnd um I uh I heard about it I I Can't remember who told me first about the book and a and what and what it's called final events and ah I read some of it was really intrigued by the ... the lead and whether or not new Ernie ties the vampires are we're ... or anything like that so\nI decided tonight it'd be great to have big Redfern on the program\nTo talk about this and so Nick Redfern of course works full time as a writer lecture and journalists he writes about a wide range of unsolved mysteries big foot UFOs Loch Ness monster you encountered you've seen him on all of the shows are from ancient aliens to a lot of other special ... and I've even appeared on some of the specials he's been on\nSo we're gonna go right to the phone now Hi Nick you're on ground zero thank you for being on the program tonight\nOh hey guys how's it going it's good it's good to have you on tonight I'm like I said you know Nick this has been a long time coming to you know you've been very busy\nAnd uh I remember back when final events ah came out I I was turned on to the Collins elite\nWhere the ... group and a family goes all the way back to the engine druids and uh the um the the meeting you had with rabies Shay and how that all came about can you give us a little bit of a background of of what the ... the leader about and and why does\nThe secret family secret society are so ah are are tied to perhaps the empire lives in the we're ...\nAnd I've actually never heard that the man [laughter] I I actually don't know what the ... family is that\nThe Collins elite Collins family I've not heard of that\nOh you never heard of the constants that you've heard of the cones lead right\nWell yeah I wrote about that but I'm ... and any links with ... and ...\nOh you haven't you heard of aliens right what's that\nYou've heard of the ... were the ones that are ... are are ... you you're meeting with rabies Shay remembering your book you talk to ... and he was with new funding in Nebraska and he says something the effect that perhaps the aliens that have been released that or a mutilated cattle are probably tied to the ...\nWell I mean\nWell yeah but not in a ritual they stick fly or anything like that\nOr how were they tied up with a college late tight to\nYeah what what what was exactly the story with you and rabies Shay\nWell\nBasically what it was a back in two thousand is seven I was looking for a new idea for a book and I thought about doing water on the ... forest UFO landing case in England in Nineteen eighty\nAnd the reason why I thought about doing it was you know I mean that in a number of books they read on the subject so ready\nBut there was some interesting threads and late suggesting that ... like I'm almost like an M ... things sort of testing new technologies on the on the militia personnel on the base rather than a rail UFO London\nAnd he turns out that Dr Shay um it was I'm a former Nebraska and a direct ... and also appraised so he had you know sort of a unique back right when you get to you and ate backgrounds want us as a ... director and the other one is a priest\nAnd I spoke to write ... seven and he said yeah you know we can have a ... day and age there may feel like if I have to read and stuff and I thought about doing the book on it\nBut when they get on the phone and he said well listen even more interesting story and might be interested in in so intrigued about it and that which we all make a better story I said well let's face and he said that\nThe guys in the government in the departments of defense she told him that the rental showcase was basically like a fabrication is holograms and mind altering technologies and whatever [noise] um he said that they were actually part of a program that was trying to or is it was sort of looking into the angle\nOf the UFO phenomena as being demonic rather than ... than me and so basically he told me the story of how he met two representatives\nOf this particular group um and and that for a number of decades they think quietly castle a\nInvestigating the whole issue of the UFO phenomenon and trying to put threats together um to face or at least um to confess I'm the idea that this was demonic you want to say I confess I'm\nFed lives were pretty much made up they would pay for their open minded they were absolutely sure that's what rights\nSee I was I was under the impression that were re was saying oh they were saying they were trying to tie the aliens to um uh the demons or the demonic or ... or the demonic personalities ... these were they classify them as non human entity right in my ... year old\nAnd a non human entities but they fully believe they literally damons from electro al ... and um they the story was that they just said he went back a number of decades and so I was ...\nThe belief system was not a belief system it\nWas an absolute fact and um and that's one of the things I pointed out in the book was the path that um\nYou know they they they didn't really ... the phenomenon as well that day today ... guys today to budge information that they didn't sit well in that scenario they ignored things that dates sits in that scenario they embrace states yeah it's all about the best way to go about it\nRight it is not about what you report you exclude too and that's
