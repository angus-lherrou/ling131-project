requested that people not use his terminology and so uh I started using\nBasically a slang terms that the ah students developed oh for instance a analytic overlay which is basically your imagination taken over all of my students called stray cats\nAnd so uh I took over that terminology simply because and go\nOh put out I'm a\nLittle basic letter saying please don't use my terminology mhm and ah so\nAh basically oh I Would say as far as terminology goes ads is more edges closer to the original than than anything I teach um oh\nNo no it's not as you're wise there I think they're basically the

is this oh I'm Sorry this is Lyn Lyn okay I've been\nWatching this on the net and ah [noise] if you look very closely or the the\nConcept or the feeling that over ... years or squared off at each other is a form of sort of disinformation in itself okay the ah\nPeople who are squared off at each other seemed to be a\nAt squared off that Dave Dave squared off it it\nUh it and I are at and Joe ... and uh I think soon to be at and Paul oh and and uh several other people and if you may notice a pattern growing there oh\nWhy do you guys let me restructure the question what are you guys not love it [laughter] [noise] ah there are several reasons\nOne I'm a [noise] for one thing oh when he got out of service have started a a started giving classified information to the public\nOh I'm a while it was still classified uh\nHe uh is making claims that he oh\nRan the project that he started the project that it was you know that he brief the president and and I mean these are laughable thing as a\nIt not happen you say not true or not true All right uh I'd I'd like\nTo make a comment here as well uh this is Joe ... is also made claims that I've worked for him\nAnd uh and that sort of thing and those are fat actually not true statements\nYeah he said I worked for him to and I didn't [laughter]\nAll right here's a fax a Mr McConnell goals as has said that ... or ... was never a remote viewer ah with the government but was simply a person who was employed interview prospective candidates for the government remote viewing program could you please ask him to comment on that\nUm this look look let me jump in on ... this is Paul okay well that's actually not completely correct to end this knows probably Joe's because they didn't overlap had came in on the scene a long after Joe was gone\nUm and actually did indeed do did participate in some operational won't be doing projects however that wasn't his primary function or he was indeed a a\nA more an analyst a task or a managing training and stuff you know he did he he he was kind of a Jack of all trades in that regard you wasn't hired primarily as a rule viewer and only under exceptional circumstances if you do that but he didn't do indeed\nDid do some operational during I got that he did one the ... uh no he ... to Mars is on for on for a number or um I haven't gone through the list but uh I'd say uh I saw at least six or seven that he was a list as a viewer on all I really I didn't\nHave that and I didn't remember that from a database of ... this is Joe I'd like to comment on my comment [laughter] ah that's not an exact quote for what I said All right\nUm the claim was made a um by a\nA dams that that he was the only person who who was qualified the trainer or teacher of the people remote do and that he was the the most accurate remote you're in a in the project and the only one who was responsible for your and my comment was that\nHis primary job while he was with the unit was to to act as a monitor and interface with the\nThe viewer in terms of uh handling are setting up remote feelings and that he was not a primary trainer he may have trained\nOr in the sense that he ran practice sessions and that sort of thing and and that's OK that everybody had specific jobs within the unit 'em and every one performed as they were required and I suspect that he perform\nYou know righteously ended the job or very well [laughter] or or I have a problem is where he makes claims then then attributes them to himself when they're in fact I don't have anything to do with him they had something to do with someone who perhaps is not even with us anymore to that\nIn a private moments are you gentlemen have have you not referred to it deems as Dr Doom\nOr this was a nickname that was given to him and the unit before he came to us or he was a he was called Dr Doom over there ah he's been predicting\nDoom death and destruction for years and years and years now\nUh-huh or would you say that he has seen things that the rest of you have not seen\nThat would be a perception this is a a\nN and that's fine um well one of the remarkable things about remote doing is that when you when you make a prediction or you make a statement about something a one would hope that there would be some validity or some method by which you could prove whether you're the veracity of the information sure or I could\nCertainly choose or pick targets that are completely I'm verifiable and make all the claims I Want and that's okay um\nThey'll never be shown are proven one way or the other but one would hope that if you're going to be making claims about remote viewing and its in its capabilities that you would be a opening yourself to being tested in some way or producing information that can be verified\nNo right well that ah opens up another topic and maybe a little bit in the sense that danger\nUm he's been on this program and said I'm sure you're all familiar with the amazing Randy so call [laughter] um and it has been on this program and said uh as straight out he accepts a Randy's challenge there is something like a million dollars are now more\nSitting there waiting for somebody to prove psychic ability\nAnd deems has said I accept\nI called the amazing Randy so called and asked him to come on he settled socks and said okay there's numbers in my safe tell add to come up with these numbers I said that's not fair\nUm you're in control of the uh uh the numbers and I I don't like that oh so how about coming out in the program and setting up\nA structured test uh with the controls set up here on the program and the amazing Randy so called did not come on the program would not come on the program I'm do any of you feel that\nThe amazing Randy's challenge could be a taken and met\nUh as it stands a he's he's basically a a magician has a slight of hand and sleight of mind\nUh and if you if anyone does things on his terms uh he wins I don't care if you were a hundred percent accurate uh\nDoing it on his terms you'd you'd uh\nYou'd be subject to a magician sleight of hand and uh I mean it's a it's a gimmick a you know that he uses or for his own a popularity and so forth\nOK buddy that yes but if if the controls were set up a independently uh from Mr Randy\nThan he wouldn't participate in the eye\nAnd so now why he wouldn't come on the program\nSure right that this is Joe I'd I'd like to say something about that he he doesn't except the current scientific controls that had been verified proven and used to cross a nine to eleven labs in the world\nAnd so he's not hardly going to come on your show art in in establishing a valid or reasonable protocol and allow someone to attempt to do the remote doing\nSo I have to support it in in a in this because he he really hasn't been ... offered the opportunity to demonstrate under an appropriate protocol\nWas talking about Lynn may I interrupt you because we're the bottom of the hour and

[noise]\nRide back down to then Buchanan Joe ... model and Paul Smith a gentleman uh we left off an an interesting point I'd ask whether whether anybody had remote viewed Jesus once the on this earth was he the son of God what are you know if anything\nI'm this is Len yes Lynn a I had started a a an old war story here uh I had been doing the bad guys for for weeks and weeks and I went into the director and I said look\nJust wants to get my Mother Teresa are those are the clown or something these these targets are killing me and the answer was a year soldiers suck it up to your job\nOf this is Joe and I'm In in my response I'm going to be probably a little bit more specific I'm All right I one of the problems I have is the definition for alien and there's a lot of construction immediately jumped to mind when someone brings that subject up [noise]\nI I Believe are based on a remote during my experience is that uh the UFOs or real or let me say that up front I have not seen any evidence that there aliens associated with beautiful phenomena of not seen direct proof of that\nHowever are within the context of aliens I Would have to say that are also based on my experiences um I Believe that there are a entities that people would perhaps call Ian\nBut that doesn't get guarantee that there extraterrestrial they could be um and they could be essentially time travelers a extra\nDimensional a projections they sure almost anything\nAnd I don't think we possess sufficient proved to say one way or the other yet what they might get an answer Joe\nI'm very [laughter] however all of you agree there is certainly something out there other than us\nWell this is Joe again I'm ... this isn't a new issue are this is this has been around for two thousand years that we know of and it will continue to be around because those are simply experiences that are that people are having\nIn a while we may not be able to say ... very much specifically about it other than they are experiences doesn't mean that it should not be properly investigated or or looked at\nA what happens unfortunately is that a lot of the data is a is mixed with this information or it's collected improperly or poorly and\nAnd we wind up with some very interesting uh concepts about it but we we don't get any closer to the truth\nOr are there are there are aspects of uh Stargate that history of you are still unable to discuss publicly\nYes of course it\nUh I Would have to say about Ninety five percent of it\nOn my God really yeah absolutely so when they said Stargate is declassified they only generally meant the fact that it existed\nA generally so yes well here's Paul um the the biggest ... of of material is still classified and and probably ought to remain classified deals with the actual projects themselves and the reason for that is not the connection with ... remote viewing but the connection with other intelligence sources and means\nUm if there is material on some of that some of those projects that would that that could potentially harm our intelligence collection capability that it might have to disclose the existence of some human source that we have you know and and a\nHuman asset him at risk or you know ... there's a lot of stuff in there that isn't even involved with the real young that that is sensitive to end are important to ah American\nSecurity I Would agree with that\nAren't you made a rather startling statement one of you or that it deems you felt disclosed some classified material before it's time uh well this is Lynn yes Lynn\nI'm not only on a on a few uh T. V. shows uh I think there's one called the other side or something like that and a radio shows but also um\nI was down in Atlanta one time a working with a student and I had the chance to meet a person named uh Courtney Brad ... who was going to put out a book or this book was about the Stargate project\nAnd he asked me to take a a copy of the manuscript that he had and read it and then the first chapter of the manuscript never remember everything was still classified highly classified\nI'm In the first chapter of the manuscript was the list of names of all of the viewers\nAre [noise] I went back and I said I said Courtney you can't you can't publish this and uh and uh you know if you do they'll they'll confiscate your book or something in in any way that got him to take that first chapter out mhm uh I ask him where did you get this information and he said well look at it from it\nAh [noise]\nWhen I was a kid watching you know the old world war two movies and all I knew that the absolute worst\nTrees and that any agent could ever do was give the names and the other agents or I mean you you you bite the cyanide pill and die before you do that and yet\nIt was the entire list uh\nFor the purpose of being published while this was still a a a clash of a thing now the reason that upset me so much was because um of another incident where it at a meeting had gotten up and told what I had done a\nAgainst Hussein and uh I called him on the phone and I shut it\nThese are crazy people with guns and uh I've got a family here and who just blew it off well the only purpose I could find for giving those names to coordinate the publishing the book while it was still classified\nOh deals with the idea of targeting for remote viewing\nOr if you have a name basically you have an address\nAnd a the a history of Russia and\nOh or psychology has been more aimed at remote influencing\nThan a remote viewing or data collection and ah ah so I could still fun no other reason for giving information to coordinate than to have something that but the ... and uh that\nUpset me very much and uh uh I stayed around well coordinated not only took the first chapter out but also deleted it from his computer ah I wanted to make absolutely certain that it was completely gone\nLook guys or we're at the top of the hour anybody here have to bail out or can you stick around a little bit\n[noise] so I can show for a while a meal or [noise]\nAll right dawn [noise] uh then they're they are [noise] this is kind of a gathering of the eagles something you will not frequently hear rams never has been done before I don't know [noise]\nMy guess is Marlin Buchanan Joe McCosker Monaco will get that eventually and Paul Smith [noise] all three in the military projects known as\n... ... is premier networks that was art bell who's being coast to coast am on the [noise] um where in ...

A. S. C. dot com she'll em slash\nTilda she S L slash index and D. E. X. dot H. T. M. L.\n\nJ. I got it uh so I assume my Web Web master did it will be up within minutes any others\nUm are you there are two were opening up a new a portion of the Web page for the controlled remote viewing or is the one that you have paradigm ...\nUh let me see yes it is\nOkay there's another as well and it's the older one uh for those who don't have a graphics capabilities or a a I don't want the graphics capabilities you know because they're overseas and and what the faster transmission\nOh there's another one which is WWW dot of merit L.\nA.

R. viewer and then it ends with a slash\nA can any of your remote view of the day when these damn world Wide Web addresses will get shorter and easier [laughter] All right we will get those up I'm now before we leave the subject of aliens or dimensional beings or whatever it is that you all sins and agree\nOr would be out there are one obvious target in this area or would have been the Roswell episode and I've got a a person vaccine me from Los Angeles saying uh somebody must have tackled that one has anybody looked at Roswell and it's so ... what have you determined\nUh I can I can respond to that first I guess this is Joe okay Joe\nI'm I I had a private client who actually targeted me against Roswell and uh at the time of course was totally blind to the actual target\nAnd uh what I produced was essentially a very accurate description of the location that was being targeted Roswell which was the police crash site\nUh there were some indications that there probably was an incident there but it did not involve an alien craft it involves a a possible miner collusion between uh uh some earth birth bound traffic and probably involved some materials the worst\nAnd I'm sort of\nEnhance a then of course the story about the weather balloon\nYes I ... the data I had to not specifically match a weather balloon but uh it it did a indicate that there was probably any that but it was probably not a ... a alien associated\nAren't thought Joe I'm a vaccine are you from Orange County aren't in reading ... book mind track which by the way I thought was a great book he talks about a stage in which he sees creatures or goals for spirits\nAnd the person wants to know does everybody who remote views eventually get there\nUh in in regard to what what their referencing are uh some chapters in there where I was discussing or my interaction with what you might call entities that are took this took place essentially as an experience outside of remote viewing on it I Want to make that very clear\nAll while these these may have been a personal experience on but I think is balance uh they they were not the separation was not obtained a piece of the remote feeling um\nI I Believe it it's my personal belief um based on Nineteen years of participation in the project and in the remote during that I've done\nIt's my personal belief that um that we are by nature a central existing in two worlds a one foot physical and one foot in the spiritual and to ignore the experiences from a spiritual side would be taught him out to cutting off the left leg so to speak [noise]\nAll right ah ah here well then here's another good question other than the remote viewing of\nChrist um Kent any of you or do any of you aside from your personal religious beliefs are in in in the context of remote viewing ... or is it possible to confirm the fact that there is life beyond the physical\nI I I Will answer that uh this is Joe again I'm In my opinion yes oh\nBut it's not life as we know the physical and it's it's obviously something else right and uh I I Believe that uh we do have frequent interactions with or what might be termed as as enemies or spiritual being\nAnd that uh they had a profound impact on us as a spiritual spiritual beings ourselves in that those types of experiences or had the because of the profound impact of them have exactly the same effect as if you were run over by a Mack truck in the world so\nThey should be paid attention to it and that's up to each individual as to what they do it at\nAll right this is for all three of you are in the process of learning or a in the process of remote viewing is there any danger to the remote viewer\n[noise] this is Paul I'm I don't think so I'm In my entire time with the program I never experienced myself or heard of anyone else experiencing anything that would be considered dangerous\nI Know there are claims out there to the contrary but uh um you know I I just don't know where that's coming from\nA well a dangerous to the psyche of the remote viewer in other words that you might see things for example that uh uh would drive a person over the edge\n[noise] uh this\nIn here for a second guess um [noise]\nFor each person when you establish a sort of contact between your conscious and subconscious mind sometimes there are things that your subconscious and conscious of been waiting for Twenty years to say to each other and there's a period of time generally when a person gets very sensitive very a\nA reactive to things uh fly off the handle easily and so forth uh but that gets over with\nA any real danger that comes to a person I think is basically\nCaused by the fact that the subconscious is harboring the danger that is then let loose um I have never had any or even actually known any person who has had a a\nA remote you in session where the session itself or the target itself\nA had a had a danger to the viewer\nOh I think what you carry into the learning process for remote viewing may be a danger to you but that danger has\nBeen there all along anyway I'd ...
