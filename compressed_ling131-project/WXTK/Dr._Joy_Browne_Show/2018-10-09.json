I. B. L. E.\nHey Dan can you believe it that ten year anniversary of getting a great\nNight sleep I Know Trina for ten years the quiet has been helping couples like us kicked snoring out of bed think\nOf the millions of lives we've changed and that'll happen years before other snoring companies shut up on the scene the quiet really started a revolution high were ... as the founders of the quiet people often ask what sets us apart from the competition it's easy knowing was our problem and we know what ...\nYears the latest from ABC News I'm Chuck secrets in Supreme Court\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh has been sworn in again at the White House but not before the president condemn just confirmation as a campaign of personal destruction\nAnd she was there for me and ah she did everything she could to support me so I wanted to pull my resource do everything to support her and so that's why on the fourth of July I came to the office and I put together a go from me page for her\nAnd if you've been to the Facebook page you see the Janine is there and I tell the story as to why and how we came to this and\nThe general support there was already been pouring in for Janine he's amazing and I'm so thankful and grateful and Janine even since her love and thanks for all of the prayers and all the support\nAnd ah we do have a goal but we're going to try and see if we can surpass that goal because that would give us more incentive to at least get some more things in check that she can use to get better quickly\nUm in in what we're doing is we're we're ... we're literally having to plan\nKind of ... kind of been a two months away or how to get around all the things that we need to do financially to get out of the situation we're in we're still of course paying on some of my\nMedical bills from my cancer skill or because of mine was a little more extensive hers of course we can cover now because of the fact that you know over time\nYou know you're able to meet financial goals but we were coming up short so\nI wanted to ask\nAnyone out there if you could to go to the go fund me pages on my Facebook it's also you can see it on my uh my ground zero site you go there and take a look at that and if you can help contribute to helping my wife\nAnd William too you know we keep the family together and and that way we can we can still\nYou know\nWell to provide help to the family\nAnd it's hard to ask that's why I'm having a hard time trying freezes because ... you know I'm dealing with a lot of things right now behind the scenes and it's just it's so good and I'm gonna tell you this from my heart is so good\nTo know\nThat your love and that people support families mhm\n[noise] so that's why I'm going to say about that and um it does my heart good that with all the bad news in the world [laughter] there are a lot of good people out there to listen to my program\nA lot of good people they're looking out for my beautiful white Janine thank you thank you so much Janine says\nThank you too so I'm going to [laughter] I'm going to let this go just go to my go fund me page I put out for Janine help us out please I really appreciate that very much\nAnd I show is a is going to be a mind bender for everybody and the reason why it's so fun subject for me ah you know one of the weirder aspects\nOf quantum mechanics could be explained by an equally weird idea\nBut I've always talked about and that's retro causality we're talking about causation that runs backwards in time but then it can also run forwards and time Einstein\nCame up with the idea of spooky action at a distance quantum mechanics he said that's how you can theoretically explain or\nBring about evidence to show that retro causality exist which is the particle equivalent of you getting a stomach ache today things to tomorrow's bad lunch\nAt the idea that you got a stomach ache but there was nothing that you ate the gave me the stomach ache but something that you're about to eat is going to give you the stomach I does that make any sense\nI don't like explaining it that way that's kind of a waste science would explain I like explaining it as for example\nYou're at a bar or somewhere like ... uh like let's say that a guy sitting in a bar and a woman comes up to him and says I Want to marry you\nAnd they want to marry you on this date so you set a date when the marriage is going to happen right you set a date for that and uh and she says but there's one thing you need to do you need to cut your hair you shave your beer to you to get yourself a suit and tie and I want a house okay\nSo you're thinking okay I'm going to marry this woman and this is what I got to do and you don't even know what's gonna happen\nYou just do there is a date set ahead and that that future date is going to be affecting the president and the past okay so they passed after you\nYou know after president goes away and continue using continues so vinyl you do go to the day and you find out that all this stuff you prep for was retro causal okay\nSo you're you're preparing for some people that may not happen but it's happening it's it's because the futures influencing president passed\nIn in that way which is you know a simple way of explaining it probably not it's probably too simplistic maybe but that's that's the way I see it as the way it works this is causality you know there's cause and effect but what effect happens before the cars and that's something that's hard for science to grass although there\nIs a pair of physicist right now from the ... from a from the United states and Canada that actually took a closer look at some basic assumptions in quantum theory undecided unless we discovered time necessarily rent one way measurements made to a particle could echo back in time as well as forward\nSo we have kind of a shadow or an echo and trains and pretty much are we all know quantum mechanics is is weird right we we know that part of that we're just comes down to the fact that at a fundamental level\nParticles don't act like solid billiard balls rolling down the table but rather like a blurry cloud of possibility shifting around the room\nNow Stephen Hawking that told me all about this when I met him long time ago when we were discussing Heisenberg and uncertainty principles and Adams and all kinds of other you know who are particles moving about\nAnd we're talking about the blurry cloudy and ... and and the blurry cloud comes into sharp focus will be tried to measure particles meaning that we can\nOnly ever see a white ball hitting a black one into a corner pocket but we can never see the countless white balls sitting by balls in every pocket okay we can have we can face forward okay and we see everything in front of us right at our feet\nBut behind as there are so many possibilities going on behind it but we don't even if we take a look back\nWell she what's going on but with our back turned there are so many things are happening that we don't understand\nWhy we can't understand it all at once otherwise our brains would explode so this is all about ... hey this might happen this could happen right so when we're dealing with maybe in ... I mean these are\nThese are all part of a of causal progression it's all part of the trends that the ... the transient move whether it's an echo or whether it's cause and effect whether it's effect before cause whether or not you're going and loops so have you can prevent me just a minute\nMisrepresent these ... these clouds ... represents something very real\nPossibilities on a positive level can be very real see that's why I don't like the idea that you know we're all feeling like we're doomed to some fate\nWhere everything falls apart and collapses I mean for some for some reason in that mindset when there's always hope for something to go better\nWe should always try and focus on that hope that things are going to go better you know what I'm saying so if if if if this represents something real up all the particles are like bouncing around and we don't see the possibility is behind this but we only see what what's in front of a sometimes we can't even see behind beyond our own feet so this is just a convenient\nRepresentation of what can happen [noise]\nTime goes by time goes back and forth [noise]\nAh [noise] it's beginning we're beginning to see that it's kind of like [noise] having a a [noise] kind of like a [noise] a number where you can push you hadn't time go back in time that sort of thing [noise] and it's becoming more evident that the future [noise]\nIs changing the panel\nWe'll talk more about that coming up on ground zero Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis [noise] you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\n... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text prepare to seven nine six four or five\nThat's P.

closet wouldn't it be great if there was a safe that had the look of a beautiful empty so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the\nSo that's a a broadcast from Nineteen forty five not dated but the year was Nineteen forty five according to apex TV a company that is a setting that out are putting out for the claim that the broadcast came from England\nThe broadcasters probably aired right after World War two would add to the early days be taught in the case but disturbing part of demands announcement is where he talks about the erosion or dissolution of the right to privacy which of course now we have the smarts cities moving it\nOr we have the cameras everywhere as he said he said that TV screens will be reduced down to you about the size of wristwatch is well of course back then I'm sure they had Dick Tracy or or a several other science fiction type of things to look at and say yes but what they didn't plan on was that TV screens be reduced down to your phone\nAnd to be on your hand so it's kind of like that you know he was very close course talking about Mars and the moon metal set foot on a he talked about many places to get entertainment\nOr he said the big companies are not a lot of big companies we owning a lot of entertainment sources\nHe's half right there I mean most of our mainstream entertainment is coming from big companies that own a a lot of a movie companies they own a lot of a TV and radio conglomerates magazines\nBut we also have a lot of independent entertainment and interdependence programming in writing such as what you hear on this program or what you see on the Internet that uh it comes from just regular people reminded me when I met Timothy Leary uh back when he was doing his tours he told me he he felt as though the future\nOr would be a time where kids themselves would be making commercials on the computers uh that would be a high school project like they'd be making a he said well they'd be making commercials for Pepsi or they'd be making commercials for a Adidas or or some other company a where he said that this is how it would be done and of course\nNow we see that a lot of these uh you know commercials are made with just south of\nA digital in fact some movies are shut on cell phones a lot of independent films are done by younger people these days a lot of TV shows are done by younger people these days is they're producing these out of school and then they're getting big companies to buy them and produced that was so they go back and they do different edits and that sort of thing so that broadcast from Nineteen forty five\nHad described in in more ways than one a perfect\nFuture I mean he I mean we have to wait and see what happens in twenty forty five but he says a hundred years Nineteen forty five to twenty forty five what he believed was going to happen what he believed was going down and I just think it's fascinating to hear\nOnce again how something for the past seems to have a grasp on what is happening today or what would be happening in the future of twenty forty five so very interesting to go back and listen to that Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's triple eight six every three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero [noise]\n\n... it's because of the best to ground zero please hold all your calls\nHaven't ladies and gentlemen welcome back in the program today we'll talk about or rather serious topic the future [laughter]\n\n[laughter] you know you're now you're in Colorado\nAnd I missed the last one emergency Colorado law known as the last one emergency [noise]\n\n\n\nIllinois [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] hey whatever other areas [laughter]\n\n[noise]\n[laughter] you got for eight hours of the house of the time\nOf my head I was the same money [laughter]\n\nI'm quite Louis [noise]\nYou're\nListening to ground zero the number to call it I triple a six seven three thirty seven hundred\nAnd thirty seven\nRetro causality has always been one of my topic favorite\nOf mine because it it it's always kind of weird to think that yes maybe something in the future could influence the\nPast or vice versa and I and I started thinking about that back during the nine eleven days seriously um it was because of the fact when nine eleven happened I just felt like time stopped\nAnd I felt like a that there were some things that happened during that that that era that reminded me of things in the past and quite possibly were affected by that very moment in time I I and I don't know why my brain went that way\nBut it just happened to go that way for some reason I mean when you're in the round the fringe analytics I like saying that it's better that conspiracy theory we should start using that right were fringe analysts [laughter] like that idea\nRather than saying you're a conspiracy theorist you're a fringe analyst and that means you analyze everything that's fringe including paranormal unfair political\nBut uh in the realm of fringe analytics and and being a fringe a analyst there's a whole lot of\nMaybe using coincidences that should never be ignored even when they sound outrageous\nAnd so when I played that audio just now the broadcast the man on the tape or the man on the radio back in Nineteen forty five he\nCould have made a lucky guess right but I'm a sucker for time travel and prophecy especially when it has that paranormal vibe to it and how would lead you down the roads that take you to what it's called the further beyond see modern conspiracy theory there is a notion of predicted programming\nAnd we talk about this all the time\nAs it seems to be a pervasive way to approximate or otherwise force structure the future in some way\n\nIt is proposed that to what is called revolution of the methods that were warned or were being prepared to accept certain ideas means er ideologies we see it in film and TV shows and many things that eventually come to pass\nBut we see like for example I don't know about you but if you if you go on the Internet a lot you see The Simpsons predicted a lot of things even\nEven the nine eleven attacks\nEven predicted the election of Donald Trump which I think it's fascinating\nSo\nWhen we see these things happen we wonder about retro causality we wonder how these people who are in the arts can somehow\nPredict the future or at least give us something to think about in future tense like science fiction I remember I was at a uh a convention one time\nAnd at the convention and we I was on a panel discussing just what science fiction writers got it right there was this one science fiction writer that I was sitting there so I didn't know who he was he was a local\nScience fiction writer he's eyes science fiction is never gotten it right and I said I beg to differ man I says you write it you write science or I read it okay I I read the comics I read the books I see the movies and there are a lot of things\nThat people like Harlan Ellison who just passed away got ... for people like Ray Bradbury or Isaac Asimov got right Philip K Dick amazing right he got allows surprise um and and so when you're when you're thinking about this revelation of a method it's a it's a very deep\nFascinating conduit to time travel and to the fantastical concepts and most people considered the stuff of science fiction and while the idea that someone can Journey Through time\nAnd change the course of history hideous terrifyingly tantalize I mean it's simply just not thought to be possible\nBut what if it is\nAnd what what what is there had been does with insight\n... what is being shaped now in the future but what is happening right now [noise] okay [noise]\nSo where do you go on a little journey now a mental journey use a little fringe analytics says and a

the [noise] in regard to that first but then he played ...\nSays that shit clean verified\nThat have to be scientifically ... verified and sister production of the future's all it is no I Am Nineteen forty five I mean it's just so it's from a pax TV they said it was made in England in Nineteen forty five post World war two and it's just somebody predict future adding team forty a Nineteen forty five a hundred years in the future twenty forty five\n... something that you found on the Internet\nIt's somebody was produced it was something that was a released by a pax TV of England that it was a prediction given ... an ounce or on the radio in Nineteen forty five\nEx TV okay\nAnd I mean I mean it was ... it was kind of attitude but not really all that accurate right well right and what ... what do you what's the problem we have with it\nJust because I mean anybody could make\nThat's right anybody could make a British show if this was made in Nineteen there was this was made in Nineteen ... sixty five and it it was still buy\nA month ago\nWell it did it they say was Nineteen forty five so I mean if it's Nineteen forty five and they say it's Nineteen forty five and the group is called the effects TV and they said they had that from Nineteen forty five I mean I I kind of a sudden the Arthur C Clark made in Nineteen sixty four they basically said the same thing with this set I I\nRed Nineteen eighty four I\nWrite well okay so Nineteen eighty four was made what in the Nineteen twenties and Orwell to much predicted the future did he not\nWrite write questioning the soundbite that you played if it was late last month right that\nWell okay let me just tell you that it was released by a company called apex TV saying that it was an unknown radio broadcast from Nineteen\nForty five a man was on the radio basically predicting the future and that's all it is I mean you can quiet and I do that of course you can\nAnybody can I don't understand what your problem is\nMy problem is I don't think that the clip you played was originally from Nineteen forty five\nOkay and when do you think it was from\nI Wonder why I think it's from\nYeah when when you think that was paid I mean I I don't understand what you don't know what the problem is with this\nI really I'm really wondering what the problem\nLike somebody made it look like this person from Nineteen forty five was saying that but it was really made last week\nOkay so how much how much of that thing that he how much of that recording was that guy accurate about\nWell I Know that's\nNo no I'm asking not very much of it was not a ...

I think that in Washington yes that will be filmed cameras at every street corner they won't be put in place in the name of a safety but our freedom is running increasingly vanish we want to create our freedom a safety weight when our our rights to remedy it because they all thought he was telling us and we'll keep our\nChildren are safe now remember these are annoyed protections and they'll say maybe someday future man we're back on a good day\nWell future man looking back on them and they are pretty interesting predictions if their predictions that come from Nineteen forty five and a some of them are accurate some are a little off ... by just a tad I think\nBut when you're dealing with something called revelation to the method we have science fiction people all the time making predictions and having them come true I mean we're warned through this type of predicted programming about how we should be prepared to accept certain ideas certain mean certain ideologies\nWe see in film and TV shows many things that eventually come to pass and what they do we wonder about the theory of retro causality and real time travel is these physicists\nBeen talking about retro causality and whether or not there are things that shape the past few shaping the path time travel is a fantastical concept and most would consider the stuff of science fiction\nAnd yet we hear more and more that the idea of dream through time he's he's he's quite possible actually ah but to change the course of history\nYeah I don't know I mean we're we're told that there are different timelines that if you go back in time uh and you kill baby Hitler that won't matter 'cause there'll be another time my little form after that that kinda thing I don't know\nBut um [noise] it is possible we're hearing more and more about time travel is becoming more and more possible plausible but um\nThere are those who before us have had insight to see the future or may say they've come from the future to let us do\nYou know through science fiction that time travel is possible in his happen from time to time or time after time or or time in an item and and that's it and yet as you\nMay know like I said I I in the last hour I I just stumbled upon a film that I saw before called tomorrow and there was a Disney film with George Clooney in it\nAnd what I found most interesting is in the film a they discuss a secret society called plus ultra\nNow according to the fictional history of the film I did some studying on this uh the story goes that good stuff Eiffel\nMet Jules Verne and Thomas Edison at his power apartment just started a secret society of optimists plus ultra was founded it'd be Eighteen eighty nine world's fair in Paris, France\nThe organizations purpose is to create moderate and expand upon new scientific advancements for humanity now key members of this group included\nPeople like H. G. wells Ray Bradbury Amelia Earhart Mark Twain Nikola Tesla and other scientific figures Walt Disney eventually became a member as well so it started\nIn Eighteen eighty nine and there were people who became members of this plus ultra group and what plus ultra was was a group that\nCreated a breakaway civilization in another dimension okay so I Know science fiction right but is there any truth to it that's the question well\nAs we do is we dig deeper into this story okay\nIt says now this is according to the movie fiction this is this is the story\nTomorrow land in Nineteen fifty nine had an expansion at Disneyland it was actually about and this is what they said in the film that tomorrow land was actually a training facility\nFor future societies future members of societies they were training them for a journey to an alternate universe\nAnd at this alternate universe was found and later developed by plus ultra now the blueprints for the expansion he'll keep technologies that enabled the journey including something called a super transport key VIPs were encouraged to join plus ultra were given special VIP audio tour tours of the world's fair\nOr the attraction there there was Ford's magic skyway there was the it's a small world world ride and for those who couldn't attend the fair there was a there was a record player or record that they could play to get information about the details now Walt Disney had the it's a small world attraction at the Pepsi Cola pavilion in the Nineteen sixty four New York world's fair\nThat believed to contain of portraits tomorrow it\nIn reality does he does have a secret place and it's near the pirates of the Caribbean it's below the pirates of the Caribbean ride it's called club thirty three it's a private club a club thirty three has not accessible to the public and it's for exclusive use of its members and is the only location at Disneyland\nThat serves alcohol now the editor clubs thirty three I guess has to press above the buzzer on an intercom it's concealed by hidden panel and the doorway\nAnd when Walt Disney was a young boy he was a member of the demo they society and they sign a quarter and so a lot of people believe that the thirty three is related to the thirty third degree a Scottish right free masonry so\nA fictional secret society that is a dimensional secret breakaway civilization called plus ultra\nI started wondering is there something like plus ultra that I can present for you tonight that would be sort of a revealing that there may be some dimensional breakaway civilization or there may be some ties to time travel\nYes I can do this and it it is ... and as I was digging through this this ... plus ultra\nIt's Latin for further beyond now I Need for you to remember those words plus ultra because those are the two words that are going to be the ones that are going to unlock the doorway\nUnlocked the key is the key to open the door where the doors of perception of your mind to maybe have you thinking about where we are right now and whether or not\nThere are people in high places that can manipulate the future changing the passes or well said he controls the future controls the past well\nThere may be a few people [noise] Mitt are these types of plus ultra people\nThey're actually [noise] using the future to correct things for the past or [noise] for using retro causality in order to do it on to the county [noise]\nAnd it'll blow your mind as to what I found and I'm sharing it with his night I'm really excited so stay to Tripoli six seven three thirty seven

G. wells we talked about how he in Jules Verne according to the movie ... and that several other people have been a wartime Walt Disney\nWas a member Ray Bradbury was a member Nikola Tesla was a member a Thomas Edison was a member\nAnd all these guys had connections the H. G. wells because Tesla Thomas Edison they all had connections in some way throughout history but Nikola Tesla he was considered one of the most innovative in mysterious band whoever lived\nIn Texas in vengeance went far beyond electricity he may groundbreaking discoveries such as wireless radio communications turbine engines and helicopters although da Vinci came up with the idea at first I'm just so it was also the inventor of fluorescent neon lights torpedoes and the X ray\nAmong other innovations but by the time of his dad's Tesla nearly well he had nearly seven hundred worldwide pat how few days after Tesla died on January eight Nineteen forty three\nHis possessions were seized by officials from the amazingly named government office of an alien property\nAbout three weeks after that all of tests listings\nAn documents were given a thorough examination by a group of FBI agents that included none other than\nJohn Gee Trump John gene Trump\nWould be uncle of president Donald J Trump Trump's uncle\nWas by all accounts are very accomplished an intelligent man and MIT professor of engineering he helped design X ray machines for cancer patients and did radar research work for the army during World War two\nJohn Gee Trump's analysis of chapters papers concluded that quote\nTesla's thoughts in efforts during at least the past Fifteen Years were primarily about speculative philosophical and somewhat promotional character but quote did not include new sound working with principals or methods for realizing such result\nA lot of people that are fans of Nikola Tesla would disagree with what John Gee Trump said about Tesla Donald Trump on the other hand what's referred to as uncle John ah as his intelligence he said uh but\nHe didn't tell just sort of a voucher for his own genetic in historical pedigree saying well you know I'm a brilliant mind just like my uncle John was a brilliant mind in fact Trump said in one interview according to New York or New Yorker magazine you said my uncle used to tell me about nuclear before nuclear\nWas even nuclear that's what Donald Trump says now this would likely be referring to hydrogen bombs rather than the first nuclear bombs because Trump was born in Nineteen forty six after the atomic age has already upon is right that would be a timeline friendly right there\nThat's P.

Know that in the journal group in a movie\nCalled tomorrow in but you look at John Jay Trump the uncle of Donald Trump and how much he praises him for his intellect and how he had all the papers of neglect tests and the possibility\nOf a time machine not only that but you see that plus ultra\nOn the tiles all over mar a Lago where President Trump is called the king\nAbout that for a moment\nSo what Donald Trump be fully aware of the fact that there were books written about a young\nMan named a barren Trump\nWho was advised by a man named John these are some very interesting synchronous these in coincidences did make me wonder about plus ultra and whatnot plus ultra is a real group it's going to Robert in Ohio Hi Robert you're on ground zero\nBelow ground how you doing you love your show what you're talking about it another as usual mind thinking situation that you always open the canals can and let the mind begin to think\nLast year eight I Love that you do that thank you so much and\nLet me get started by saying that a person who makes predictions and things like that\nYou know generally person should have a totally open mind on that because one never knows what's going to possibly happening in the future anyway right and this person has come up with the idea that they're possibly something good because you'll notice what protections a lot of times it says hey there's something good comes up\nOr something bad happened I think one of the other\nAnd ah so you know people predicting things and people who are in the past it protected thanks\nYeah I Know that the best Nineteen forty five show for instance that you're listening to uh put on there earlier was probably something that was played after World War two and England because the gentleman talking\nAs it sounds like he's anguish and he's just trying to bring hope people make them realize someday there'll be no more face to worry about right yeah so that that's that's what that in my opinion is what that's all about as far as people making protection and stuff sometimes they're good sometimes they're bad\nMouth all the the secret society now I totally believe that also too as you're saying they alter plus\nA possibility it's I don't know I don't know myself personally if ... if there is but with the way the world is today and the way society is today and the way the politicians are in the way everything is in this country is right no doubt there is probably secret side he's\nAll blew my mind is the you know here we have John Tromp who is a Donald Trump cynical who had all of Nikola Tesla's work you had all these papers and of course a Trump was\nA pretty much a a a big helping creeping X ray machines much of what tests was where was it about and Lawrence Tesla created a depth re a bit ah most\nCertainly you know is speculative there but it's like well John Trump said well nothing was found that was a very important but yet John ...\nWent along it became this bit bigger than that [noise] and then Donald Trump of course at mar a Lago he stays in mar a Lago and this is where he kinda hangs out his resort for all the dignitaries and all over the walls his he's the term plus ultra plus ultra plus ultra\nFrom beyond and it it you know it's just amazing the way that all comes together like that it makes you wonder about are also the ah the story about Baron Trump\nAnd the story about the last president it's just been amazing uh kinda coincidence that all this went down in the Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nWell one thing you'll you'll you'll ... easily find out what she criticized the tough part two is the fact that usually it's the people that have the money\nBut yeah that's right and if and if it's some sort of time travel secret society man that that explains a
