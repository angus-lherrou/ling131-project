now and there are a lot of people that don't believe that was it turns out\nThroughout the ladder third of the twenty twenty century onto the twenty first confidence in the United states government by the American public had been in decline and does remember the Kennedy assassination Vietnam Watergate the nine eleven attacks all these other scandals ...\nMay find it easier to say well you know the govern lied to us about a lot of things why wouldn't they lied about the moon landing and what's really weird is that\nYou know out of all the things you can question questioning the moon landing it's probably one of the worst things you can do okay it's it's one of the worst things that you can do for you that you know using\n... you can question nine eleven and that's that's kinda bad because people say how dare you there was the most horrible event in history and you're questioning of people died that that\nYou get that all the time you're talking about Watergate and you you do some ... they don't care about Watergate they don't care about Monica Lewinsky is dressed but yeah we spent less money on nine eleven I mean ... and that's the thing is you know you look at the embarrassment of that\nYou got all the money they put into the moon landing and we haven't gone back in fifty some odd years\nAnd the rockets so what happened to them and you know all these questions of people have it and when you start to speculate they won't even allow you to speculate that it never happened\n\nThey'll tell you you're crazy they'll tell you you you need to go back to physics class\nWell\nYou look back at a poll of it and you say to yourself well this is kind of interesting and you know with all the the deaths in the accidents before Apollo eleven we sent\nThree guys out into space and nothing really happened to them\nI Believe that when you see this film it's going to be a lot of fan fiction it's not going to be based on reality hell even the uh even the flag being planted in the lunar soil is not even gonna be depicted in this bill which has got a lot of people pissed about say this is not patriotic filmed the whole patriotic achievement with landing on the moon how dare you not put the American pie even\nBuzz Aldrin was pets but the older now and he said what the hell what no American flag in the in the end the regular what kinda crappy fish I'm an American I'm an American we put the flag and ... and I know why they didn't put the flag in the mood on a on the moon in this\nMovie because they want to they don't want to piss off the Chinese investors Hollywood's bought out by the Chinese and why and what we want to remove the American flag with the most important thing to say well there's plenty of flags on the astronauts coaches plenty of flags on the rockets there's plenty of ... okay\nSure what that moment in time where they put the American flag in the soil is you know it's I conduct gets kind of like it's the same thing is it as having the soldiers putting the flag ... it's the same thing of the fire fireman putting the flag up at nine eleven it ... the ground zero\nIt's like but you know but the big written it out and um\nI Know that just get a boost the interest again in space travel but you know when you look back at some of the movies that they made before a Hollywood is actually\nIn in a lot of cases they been Mooney mirror America I mean does anybody remembers the Nineteen Seventy one James Bond film diamonds Are Forever\nYeah in that film James Bond Sean Connery one of my favorite bonds or Sean Connery stumbled onto a moonscape set\nSo they're staging the moon landing Amish moonscape set and James Bond breaks that of the movie set in runs through the uh the whole set up\nRuining what they're trying to do if you remember that she I couldn't believe it I mean that was like what Nineteen Seventy one how bowls of them in Nineteen Seventy one you know we were just pressure on the moon and already somebody in a ... on the set of diamonds Are Forever decided they decided that they're going to put James Bond on the moon's that\nMake you looked like he broke in [laughter] but I kept recording one that was Nineteen Seventy eight right [noise]\nUh that's where NASA supposedly bake the landing on Mars be a lot of people that they\nCan do it on this that they did a pretty convincingly two thousand what a space odyssey wow some people say that even Star Trek which canceled before the moon shot because\nThey were afraid that if they were running Star Trek where a bunch of men land on a fake planet but somebody will get the idea oh yeah just\nLike they do in Star Trek that's always Star Trek cat ... had a resurrection because they could do it now without having people question whether or not they

listening to ground zero numbers called tonight AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred us AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nYou know one of the first topics on ground zero that I did\nWas the debate over whether or not we went to the moon I was able to interview ville casing one of the old timers you wrote the book about it\nIt was also referred to a bar ... several was later on today and I appeared with Ralph ... of Penn and teller show time special show where they actually make fun of conspiracy theorists I was they didn't really make\nFun of me all that much but they put me with a bunch of other guys were kind of bizarre\nAnd are they really was kind of unnerving to watch but still I mean I\nI was one of the first talk show host I mean I always be our belt would have done this because I Do and I are you to work working together at one time when I was on doing a ground zero we're broadcasting on the Internet first shows broadcast on the Internet was ground zero than our do\nArt bell show we had dreamland art bell\nAnd ah I\nDon't believe there are bell was very supportive of me doing just doing the topic and Richard Holbrooke knew I was doing the topic and he laughed he thought was funny but ah because he was telling me he\nSays well yeah you know right off the bat you know people are already thinking just a minute we landed on the moon but nobody but we didn't win it didn't go\nThere was just communist propaganda you know did you know whatever so\nI did the show and then uh\nI think it was February of two thousand one I was very surprised when Fox or did a special call conspiracy theory did we landed on the moon\nAnd uh\nThat changed the entire nature of the debate because this went mainstream and this is just a ... this was a situation where a major network presented a conspiracy scenario without any serious re bottle it was reported this fact\nOkay and that made me feel uncomfortable because at least on my show\nAt least on my show I gave a balance I said okay\nYou know I have my doubts but here's some people to try and convince you otherwise\nAnd ah I think it was still plate actually who you know got wind of all this and and ah he didn't like me [laughter] I don't think uh but if you if you see the old Penn and teller BS Showtime TV show\nWhere I'm On a talking about the moon landing or I talk about the moon landing hoax or what have you a bill place right there\nAnd I recommended him he was he's in the show you don't have recommended it because I really respect it I thought it was awesome that he responded to my show and that he responded to my uh I wrote an article called good luck Mr Gore ski another other uh\nOther lives about the moon and uh it was just\nYou know what if it was just saying what if it's not that I believed it totally I just had doubts so having doubts I decided well I have lived out back and say okay I Want to present this to people as oh man that was the ugliest thing I'd Jim old bird from NASA right be a dirty letter I had I I just thought what the hell of I'd done you know what ... what did I Do\nSee at the time I was young I didn't care I thought well or whatever you know now I'm older I care a lot about you know it was his views and [laughter] I just because I Love talking to people back then it was a man I'm just a young kid I don't care and then you know of course I had my come up it's when I had my\nYou know car blown to pieces by a pitcher and my beef but you know I grew out of bed really damn quick\nAnd decided I Would be a little bit more open a little more balanced but of course we have Fox TV doing the special conspiracy theory did reliant on the moon I started to see a pattern here thinking what's going on then came by several\nTwenty hours to complete ten moon orbits which is about two hours per orbit but yeah it took ten days where they sell cross rocket to get to the moon transferring the day to do the other missions results also a time space from the moon to\nIt [laughter] it was just\nA public twelve ... twelve for example of how twelve got to the moon in twenty six point five hours and you had a policy Seventeen took Seventy six hours it takes the space shuttle sixty six hours to reach the IOC says I don't want to ... I was going about a hundred and eighty five miles an hour\n...\nSo I'm I'm just trying I mean maybe I'm Bad at math but thing about that ten days to get to the moon with LCROSS Apollo eight to twenty hours to complete ten moon orbits which you could say about two ... two hours from orbit\n\nAnd then you see the transference of data public twelve got to the moon twenty six point five Apollo Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd a space shuttle take sixty six hours to reach the IRS that's going a hundred and eighty five miles movie or\n\n... needless to say the LCROSS mission was a failure [noise] ... after sending a a project out to the moon\n[noise] math and said oh the peasants inconclusive [noise]\nSo what ... [noise] well [noise] you know what happened after that [noise] president bronco bomb I\nSaw what happened after that and decided [noise]\nScrew the moon they're not going to go to them and [noise]\nSo he pulled funding and the whole idea of a Ryan constellation and\nYou know all the new vehicles man\nYour beliefs except for three thirty seven hundred strip believes except for three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nI'm quite Lewis you listen to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nMessaging ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more checks prepare\nTo seven nine six four or five that's P.

that was it a mission that failed I'm appalled nine billion dollars in funding gone from the constellation Leo Ryan programs no more will be thinking about going to the moon for awhile set us back a

this little girl came up and asked or a or asked him about the moon and he told her that you know it would be nice if we actually went there some sort of\nThing yeah it was really bizarre this girl asked the question and he says that's not what little girls ask because maybe maybe we didn't go he says I Know why but we won't go back as maybe we didn't and and I have a right here we want to

butt of cheating how dare you how can you sleep at night so I asked when I was all just popped him in the in the jaw\nUm so yeah I I mean people get all kind of had the big test if you tell them I doubt I doubt that we landed on the moon I mean you'd be skeptical about UFOs you'd be skeptical about everything else that many you start being skeptical about the moon landing\n\nIt's like you've kicked the pope somewhere in his body parts I think it's really a bad thing people don't like it\nWell I can tell you I still have my doubts about the moon landing and ah\nYou know I have them even more now after what I read today\nUm you remember back in when was that it was a two thousand for\nPresident George W. Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon and twenty Fifteen and he said the NASA will test the new spacecraft was called the crew expiration vehicle by two thousand eight and conduct the first manned mission no later than twenty fourteen\n\nWell here we are four years after the fact nothing we don't we don't have men men started back on the moon again we're we're just really talking about setting the first space to receive signing and land on the moon is this going to go around the moon\nBut the President Bush had a goal set of having a man on the moon living and working there by twenty twenty having a base there and it's not out of the question I mean if you're looking for Bigelow Aerospace is up to with\nMaking these inflatable moon bases yeah it could have been done even a Mars base could've been done well in two thousand nine we were told the NASA was carrying out this LCROSS experiment and they were lying to us about it about what they were using it for is that they were looking\nFor ice on the moon but there are plenty of missions prior to the moon landing and plenty of missions like the Clementine mission where they were scouting out in the moon finding ice pockets\nAnd so they didn't need the LCROSS mission but ah of\nCourse NASA had five hundred million to spend on a rocket who's going to slam into the moon\nBlow up and then a cause of created it's about six miles wide\nAnd you know people say oh my God they're going to new moon and they were going to do this two days or two days shy of the ... anniversary of first landing on the moon\nAnd there was a lot of stuff about\nThat mission that did all add up didn't make any sense\nAnd\n... eleven after the LCROSS mission failed rock Obama cut funding for the proposed constellation program and the space vehicles he he basically cancelled the five year nine billion dollar effort to build new Orion spacecraft an aries rockets\nThe new space vehicles were slated to replace NASA's three aging space shuttles and launch astronauts into orbit and onto the moon that was the thing but no Obama pulled the nine billion and they put the money towards data that climate change climate science\nSo Obama kill the space program in order to turn NASA and the climate change police and that's that's really sad I mean if there was ever a time to doubt that we went to the moon at all that was the time because it you know they just shut down you know here we have this dream we're gonna probably money forward then Obama says not\nNot that we're not going to go so here we are in twenty Eighteen\nAgain been told that the moon is the goal and later Mars\n\nTo news stories today that I Want to tell you about that really helped me excited but uh some bad news first of all a Russia seems\nTo be out of their minds a parent late may have detected what appear to me to colliding stars\nAnd I think somewhere I have the sounds of the stars I'll Try and dig it up but um yeah they they detected these stars are putting off of sound gate of weird sound and are there going wait a minute or these really colliding stars are we looking at a space armada coming our way\nAnd if they're moving is asked we think they're going to be here by twenty twenty two\nI'm\nKidding I'm not kidding Russia found these colliding stars they cycling stars and they they've warned them out there saying well if\nThese look like cutting stars the sounds are giving us she may have intelligence in them so they may not be colliding stars at all\nWhat are they well they are um are there are no mater of of huge space craft coming our way\n[noise] um [noise]\nNow that's also reporting today that Seventeen scientists often report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national mission\n\nThe breathing was offered by the national academies of Science Engineering and medicine it emphasizes the importance including astrobiology the study of our life originated on her than how it might evolve elsewhere in the University of every phase of all NASA missions destined for space from inception conceptualization to planning to development and operation\nSo once again we're Seventeen scientists saying guess what guys every mission that we do from now on is going to have the purpose of finding life out in space\n\nOnce again every mission is going to be about finding life in space that has to have a a quest of finding life in space Russia says they picked up on to quote colliding stars that may be a space armada heading our way\n\nSo I Believe that the reason why this is happening why they're saying hey every mission has to have a fact finding life giving whatever is because they have confidence that there's intelligent life out there and the recent reports of techno signatures in fast ... actually it's fast radio burst or the motivation behind the quest\n\nI don't know that it has anything to do what he's claiming stars are possible are modest coming our way but it certainly has a lot to do with the techno signatures\nAnd get this\nAstrophysicist are now saying that with all the thousands of exoplanets out there and and how they're uncovering new insights into the complexity of diversity of life on earth the authors also sit in the briefing that not only are you going to be looking for techno signatures guys we want you to look for bio signatures\n\nSo this is pretty amazing don't you think I mean I think it's cool I mean this bolsters the chance at life could exist out there\nAnd therefore all space exploration missions should incorporate technology and find traces of alien organisms bio signatures take those things I mean look I'm president of the universe is more crammed with plants than ever before\nHave two thousand three hundred confirmed exoplanets discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission and that leads to efforts to six out of every ten stars could host Earth like planet so the sheer number of known exoplanets operas exciting opportunities for finding ... signatures fighting chemical markers indicating that yeah there's live out in space\nIn the report sciences recommended that NASA accelerate the development of technologies to detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready\nCan travel to a distant world and measure the composition of its elements minerals in organic matter\nReport also suggest that direct imaging systems that suppress star like should be used outside our solar system to improve detection of ... ... signatures from planet that might or but those stars NASA could also plan more missions that the peer under the surface of exoplanets whether or not they're\nRock the icy or ocean worlds defined subterranean alien life according to the report however [noise]\nDeference to locate are extraterrestrial neighbors either in our solar system are light years away [noise] we'll take more than technology alone and all of these advancements will cost money and guess what guys [noise]\nNASA's only plan [noise] to return astronauts to the moon after nearly fifty years just got slammed by an internal auditor [noise]\nThat means [noise] we're not going to the moon anytime soon and we're not going to the railings anytime soon [noise]\nWe're using fatty and Matty [noise] an astronaut some really excited about the possibility of life out there [noise]\nBut our rockets fell last rocket who you're working on guess why [laughter] [noise]\nNot going to be built not from hell knows how long I'll tell you about that coming up once again it makes you wonder if we're really going to the moon I mean why can't we get a rockets sophisticated enough to go out and do this and why are they now slamming it with a with an audit major cost

the contractors the company is responsible for about fifty six percent of the new rockets cost but it's years behind schedule and delivering the biggest section of the rocket [noise] and\nI mean there's just puts you off I mean does that mean to give you more jobs as to whether or not we went to the moon in the first place\nCome on if we're supposed to be on the moon and twenty Fifteen

somewhere in the Russian astronaut or cause not the died\nOr what happened is they be sent my up into space and um Russia reported that uh the dog was doing okay you know dogs great out in space or

coming back from the moon that's what I meant and so you know all about the efforts of the Gemini program the Apollo program you know the the deaths that happened before or the testing to see a lot of people you know point to that disaster Gus Grissom as the beginning of the conspiracy theory that we didn't go to the moon\nAmong Americans between Eighteen and twenty four years old twenty seven percent back in the Nineteen sixties expressed outfit NASA went to the moon over the years there have been many more people\nBut also a stepped up and sit down and believing in the moon I don't believe that we went to the moon I Believe that a Hollywood has been telling us all this time that we have in the Stanley Kubrick directed the moon landings two thousand want a space odyssey took time for mayor did the moon landing stuff\nAnd of course we were ... showed in Nineteen Seventy one diamonds Are Forever James Bond film as James Bond gets on a a a moon landing set Nineteen Seventy eight Capricorn won\nA movie that talks about men faking a the Mars landing spot or two thousand and one of Fox special conspiracy theory did we landed on the moon basically saying stating a fact\nThat we never went to the moon then came barn several film titled a funny thing happened on the way to the moon he claimed he had footage\nOf the astronaut speaking the famous earth shot and uh it's\nIt's in his film if you want to look as funny thing happened on the way to the moon it shows the astronaut speaking the the the famous blue earth shot\nSo you know there are plenty of things that can cast doubt plenty of things we can cast doubt on whether or not the moon landing happen in two thousand for\nPresident George W. Bush started a conversation about putting men back on the moon to Ryan program the ... the crew exploration vehicle\nBy two thousand eight you know we're supposed to be a working towards going to the moon getting there by twenty fourteen normally no later than twenty Fifteen didn't happen why because in two thousand nine actually when the two thousand nine around two thousand nine rock Obama pulled the plug\nBut uh it it was because of a a a failed mission that we had to go to the moon within Al Cross a rocket\nWill crater an unknown to see if there was water which didn't make any sense because we already had surveyor and landers and and orbiters the map and moon Clementine actually map through in Nineteen Ninety four and a Seventeen was able to deliver more than one point eight million digital images of the moon back to the ground\nAnd um\nThere was the interest satellite they were ground tracking the stations are ... they were they had the ... of ground tracking satellite station was picking up on these images so everything is accessible to the general public via the Internet\nAnd one scientist reviewed the data from Clementine they already found the existence of ice within the moon's crater so why did they did as well you know it was a failure nonetheless the LCROSS mission was a failure bronco bomb upholds the funding from a vis a constellation Orion a project\nWhich kept us from going to the moon and a\nNine billion dollars is cut from the program and uh it slows down now here we are in twenty\nTeam we've been told that the moon is the gold again and what's really cool\nIs it today it was reported that Seventeen scientist often to report stating the searching for signs of life should be part of every future national NASA mission there the briefing was authored by National Academy of Sciences engineering and medicine it says it says in the briefing and says that ah\nThat's very important\nThat the new NASA missions include a studies at astrobiology\nStudies of how life originated on earth and how it might have evolved elsewhere in the universe in every phase of all NASA missions destined for space\nFrom inception conceptualization they have to plan on trying to find a way to discover life in space\nAnd I think ... it's obvious the reason why they're saying is is because yes they have confidence that they found these techno signatures they found the group vehicle waves are in fact Russian scientists opt to colliding starts thinking it was an armada I\nPlayed the tones of the stars coming out of Senate south alarms all over the country so I won't be doing that again\nBut um\n[noise] and in fact this off of arms of shutdown radio station so if I had that air it was because of that\nAh but in recent years we in the show has been discussing that\nThousands of exoplanets and biologists were actually uncovering new insights to the complexity and diversity of life on earth and and also a means discoveries would bolster and andme Lewis closer to the chance at life could exist on other worlds and therefore\nAll space X ray exploration missions now should incorporate technology to find traces of alien organisms\nSo you know with the number of exoplanets they've discovered with all the ideas about life on other planets scientists are recommending that NASA accelerate the development of technologies\nTo detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument meaning there isn't anything ready now nothing that can fly on the space to take care of this problem nothing that can travel to distill rose and measure the composition of its elements minerals organic matter that sort of thing\nSo the report suggests that direct imaging systems to suppress star like should be used outside our solar system to improved detection of ... ... signatures from planets that might orbit those stars NASA also uh is being told that they can plan for more missions appear under the surface of exoplanets however\nThe efforts to locate extraterrestrials either in our solar system are light years away is going to cost a lot of money and you need new advanced technology to do it\nWell here's the deal NASA space launch system the S. L. S. the new rocket they were putting together to go to the moon was supposed to be the design to go to the moon and then and then eventually go to Mars was a very powerful rocket\nApparently um it's running years behind a schedule is a lot of major cost overruns and it just got slammed by an internal audit\nTwelve point two billion dollars to develop this launch system\nOr Wednesday the auditors came in public to report highlighting problems with the work of NASA and bowling and the report like sixty four million dollars in extra fees that were given a NASA they slammed bowling for poor from a poor performance and question the long term sustainability of the super rocket program\nAnd the report even calls into question the sustainability of an entire project meaning that even with all the bright ideas and designs and the idea that we can go out and find aliens now this rocket won't even make it off the launch pad for years won't even make it to the moon\nSo this whole newly manned moon project they were supposed to have going on by twenty twenty ... may not happen and also I don't think space forces going to happen either I mean so you know once again we have this movie first man\nA big old infomercial for NASA and they can't even get a rocket off the ground sure we can sit up satellites probes robots but the man to the moon with a new rocket yeah we can't do that\nDon't have any more I mean we're going to do but we were gonna do it in twenty Fifteen\nBut Barack Obama made that go away and it was just ...\nBecause I I thought I'd be go to the moon as you said earlier yeah it\nIt was just kind of that kind of twisted me quite a bit\nYeah well it hurts me enough to have my doubts that's only going to say [noise] but they can go and thank you I mean if I found out tomorrow that we did go to the moon and they could prove to me beyond doubt I'd shut up about it but no there's no I haven't\nSeen anything yet that convinces me we went\nTo the moon only TV [noise] and believe me they can do a lot of things with TV\nAnd a lot of things they did would be fooled people do a lot of things on a movie set to that is why first ban is in theaters [noise]\nAs\nThey can

saying if if they did it was genius anyhow\nWellbeing about this a T bonds was on the show when they just couldn't be classified some ox carts project ... card with the ... project very fifty one you know he told us he said that their new in the satellites were coming overhead so they had to go out on the tarmac and they had to put\nCardboard planes on the tarmac to give the Russians the idea that they're working on some sort of an aircraft oh I remember something you know they used they used to put up fake aircraft the big car board airplanes they used to put on the on the runways there if you wanted to pull the Russian\nYeah yeah I remember that\nSo I mean it's all their money and they're putting fake cardboard planes on the tarmac a dairy fifty one that could easily uh put together some you know grace soil put it somewhere on the sound stage\nAnd uh and make it happen they they could easily do that I mean I don't\nSee why it it's beyond the pale whipping they couldn't set something up or do close ups of a of a moon modeled just like they did a you know for Star Wars I mean what Lucas did was basically what they taught him\nOr what he learned from the NASA mission when he made Star Wars he knew they were able to use miniature ... I mean you would have thought miniatures so advanced would give you the idea that you're looking at something like a death star it was it was just amazing\nWell that's very true yeah yeah and they they could possibly do it but you know and then another thing I don't think our scientists now have the engineering backgrounds as they get for NASA back then as well so that could be another thing why they're not coming up with things you know if you\nThink about it they're searching for life but they're not looking for electromagnetic signatures you know you'd have to be a moon or half of them oh well I have a magnetic signature you see what I mean\nYeah well I mean they they they just they come out with all this stuff saying well we want y'all to you know when you do your measured there's got to have some sort of a plan to fight alien life whatever you do from conceptualization to be on\nYou gotta you gotta make this happen and then they say well okay but we're kind of like a over budgeted for the ... program so what are we going to be now an ogre putting to lay\nOut right yeah we're not the way out there that I I ...\nEither way I I think it will come out in the next few years whether that it or not it'll happen\nWhile I don't think they're ever going to go back on their uh\nI think they were going to go back on their ideas already went to the moon but thing about this\nYou know before Kennedy died you know he was talking with the Russians about UFOs don't kinds of other crazy stuff I mean what if you said that the Russians\nHey we're gonna we're going to the moon and that we're trying to go to a ... go to the moon and uh you know we'll give you a little bit of money you know\nYou make this a little space race it a little more interesting and you know I I just would say that you know the space race was wasn't really a space race it was\nRussia basically having an interest in space the United states saying wait a minute they can't have an interest in space we don't want them to spy on us and then they started to say well hey we challenge you drew a race that I Am compared to like the fat kid", "city": "West Yarmouth"}
