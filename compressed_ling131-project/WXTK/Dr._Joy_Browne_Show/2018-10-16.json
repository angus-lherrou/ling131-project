God and I are ... radio station use radio Ninety five WMGK\nHere is the latest from ABC News Zion church the richest a federal\nJudge has thrown out a lawsuit Stormy Daniels filed against President Trump ABC's Alex Stone\nIt's not about a week ago I'm a ... show was about ready to draw too close and ah I I was talking about the deep state\nAnd one of the things that bothers me about the state is that it's it's the most overused term since false flag\nA because\nWell because of shows like Alex Jones but because of uh what people say and what they think they ... they think like a or they think like a false flag it's like\nI didn't really happen so it's a false flag that's not a false flag okay and I've always felt told people tell people that's a false flag but of course you know a lot of ignorance is bred when people tend to think that one thing means another thing and and they ... the people are defining their own terms\nYou know they're they're defining what is a conservative they're finding what is a liberal people don't even know anymore and they really don't and and they don't know what are you know critical analysis is objectivity anymore because if somebody says one day\nThat he can't stand you know Donald Trump being a noxious\nBecause he is he's obnoxious there's no doubt in my mind he's he's he's obnoxious he's obviously is obnoxious okay so he's not noxious president you say so it was going out and well as the Emmys liberal well come on even if you're conservative you have to admit she's help noxious if if you if you can't you're you're not being genuine you're not being disingenuous\nAnd you know if you're if you're like saying if you can't say that a Hillary Clinton is obnoxious ... your your disingenuous because she is obnoxious she's up noxious Donald Trump's obnoxious but the only difference between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is president the United states and he was voted in by the people that's the difference okay\nAnd ads you obnoxious president\nWe're supposed to ah criticized him for things that he does wrong and we do a same with ... for the same about Barack Obama people say I like Morocco bother the and I'd say look you know ... or president\nAnd um\nWe should try to give them some time given the honeymoon that he deserves but you know we didn't give Donald Trump the honeymoon for which no hey nobody gave him a honeymoon\nAnd a and one of the things that's interesting is that you know between the false flag or you know nomenclature being ... dies the other was the other was the deep state 'cause they think it's an invention of Donald Trump and it's not\nIn fact the deep state with a shadow government one time there is also the dark state there's also a what is it a dark command there there are several name so that each state is just the deep state stuck with Donald Trump and which was troubling about these accusations that certainly is a tactic being used as somehow discredit conspiracy theorists\nAnd others with the media feels are right wing extremist pushing the ever present persecution complex with the president listen uh let me just tell you that back when the Democrats were in power there's a vast right wing conspiracy\nNow uh now that\nThe debt that the Republicans are in power there's a vast left wing conspiracy so is it or or does it just there's a conspiracy and what it is is that it's it it's meddling from the deep state operatives all over the world not just here in the United states not just Russia\nIt's all over the world is these deep state players\nThey wanted to come in and undermine this country and they undermine it by by programming a weirdos to actually go into Facebook pages and start declaring that a certain person has a certain type of a leading toward a certain type of ideology in politics which isn't the case because when you are doing a conspiracy\nAnalysis of geopolitical players you can talk about anybody and say what they do is good or bad and there's always somebody there that will tell you well obviously just how you think all the time no it's not and so when you're looking at the deep state it's it's not an American\nDelusion ... if it's not you know is it is a worldwide phenomenon okay\nThe deep state on a global level right now is needed in order for the leads to salvage what they called the liberal international order which parents symbols new speak for new world for liberal conservative whatever it might be it is a new world order and it's being established now the conspiracy is definitely trying to overthrow\n... and they tried to overthrow many presidents including Brock Obama so they're overthrowing bronco bothered him you know overthrowing George Bush or in fact that they successfully a I think uh they they successfully were able to a command and also a puppet to George W. Bush when he was in power it's obviously did that\nAnd a bronco bottom of the same they were able to talk about him as well they pop it in a mall or the only difference between them and Donald Trump is Donald Trump's stubborn Donald Trump stubborn and he doesn't know how to play the game of ah you know the deep state politics which is a dangerous thing for him and he doesn't care\nBut what I\nBut as if he doesn't care how does that fair with the American people in the deep state do to try and change all this while we see what they do they they mail rice and out to a out to people to scare them\nThey uh they they go in and they they do these are classic hits you know of a of a noted officials may kill people involved with a certain insight into ideology they that's how it works sixteen states in control so whenever you say about politics however I lean left writer or upside down I don't care\nI Know that there is something above it all there is a sin arc above it all but certainly as controlling this country and is trying to control the world so all we're arguing various ah you know or are getting a over various ideologies that we don't like or that we're thinking we're leaning towards you know the conspiracy he's there\nTo metal in the affairs of nations all over the world that are struggling to keep their sovereignty and this is why there are few oligarchy were willing to buy up and support chaos in the world\nAnd this is why we're now seeing in our major cities gang violence mob takeover and radicalized factions within separate strongholds and we're also seeing is on the Internet as well where people can't help themselves but to try and be mean to one another because somebody has a different ideologies and they do\nInstead of being a little bit more open a little bit more willing to talk things out you see the warning of a major collapse the United states is not being heated and it's going on right now because there's so many of the radicalized factions and they're quick to blame each other for the problems in the country and not the bad actors on the world stage they wish to see American cities burn\nAnd that's where they want to do they want to see American cities burned the truth is there are many Americans that have been touched by the secret hyper power who wants to further the clutching covered a seizing of world controls against the wishes of the majority\nAnd they've all been victims of massive know cis brainwashing propaganda it's allowing for raw emotion to get in a way of ultimate truce\n\nIt gets in a way of friendships in family uh relationships\nIt's dividing marriages it's dividing man and woman is that if it's the biting\nPolitical allies it's dividing it all\nThe deep state has always been\nA refuge for rogue intelligence operators didn't work for many of the countries that we have said that we said that are they\nThey are our allies we said these are these we allied with these people but yet they're rogue intelligence ops that work within our allies the groups the ... say that they were friends look they've succeeded in developing ways the heightened suggest abilities subservient in the world\nWith the never ending war that is imperiled rather than advanced American ideals by becoming about dominance rather than freedom\nIt's all about dominance\nHas nothing to do with liberty or freedom as everything to do with who is bigger\nWho's bigger who's smarter who has the best ideas who could ratchet up the motions to get people to think like they do\nMean the whole future after nine eleven happened was in an open ended future of war without an and political division over the implementation of state socialism all over the world\nSo it is just summing up that way I mean it's as simple as that the minute the discussion started about state socialism the minute we started talking about who has who has it\nBeen we start talking about who's victimizing wasn't victimized the division began\n\nAnd so you have this but Trump but Hillary thing going on right now but Trump but Trump but Hillary but Hillary but George Bush who's heat\nBut ... don't don't talk about bronco by\nJust talking about but Trump by Hillary it's all it is do nothing happened before but Trump but Hillary nothing\nBecause you you talked to me well that's all that's all they want to talk about about Trump and Hillary but Trump but Hillary but Trump buddy Hillary but but but but but but but the actual about coming oh it's about Hillary do or not it's about Trump which is where we are now and it never used to be that way it's all about but\nBut but but but but it's all is well I got a buck for readers to balance coming your way to ... deep state but to really fix up at three thirty seven hundred that's truly except at three

it's really hilarious in it aggravates insults me especially when I've said many times on this program I said you know and and I I'll say it again or politics or theater for the ugly because most things\nWhen they talk when you're talking parrot political which is a difference of just being clean up political what you're showing it showing the income grew in ... he can grew into the inconsistencies of what politics are doing right now and then sometimes you'll say well what Donald Trump is doing is really kind of silly or what\nWhat's going on now is you know as I said the other night I said you know what Donald Trump spoke to a bunch of clergy and he said here's the deal if we don't get the Senate there's going to be violence okay and then Hillary couldn't go I'm not going to be civil and\nYou don't have to be civil to a government doesn't represent our values so basically what we got here is we're going to war of words where like I said no longer is terror or or or no longer are terrorists the thing we worried about\nWe have to worry about now our fellow countrymen and whether or not our fellow countrymen are gonna rise up against us and this is a product of what we're in the middle of now they just take it at least Eighteen years we're Seventeen years to foment\nAnd and it just seems to me that ah when all of this happened the open and then there's some our future with war rumors of war and all of this we're we're actually contributors to the division we're having now and the idea that people feel like well one side this way one side the other way and I'm not going to play either side nor am I going to\nHave some critical analysis of what I what each side is saying and each side basically\nDo some dirty deeds done dirt cheap that kinda thing\nBut you know it was a for a long time but a lot of semi sure I'd say you know there's a\nThere's this fear of despotism\nDespotism ... there'll be obvious in in that I I never thought it would end up like this though it'd be you know despotism\nUm fascism or whatever you want to call it\nWould start breeding in America and you know I Know that\nPeople ... near the end the very suggestion that the United states is starting to resemble\nSome sort of a dystopian a Nineteen eighty four those ts ski um position by demons type of thing um in fact I brought up to ... story\nOr when I did my show the other night uh when I was talking about uh what was happening in Portland\nOr we had over the weekend we had a the the the rival ah groups get together and fight in downtown Portland and so it was a certainly you know unnerving to things that I had to stay out again and do work\nOr because of the fact that uh they needed someone to go wall to wall and I'm not complaining because I I Want to be in on the ah I Want to be in on the secrets I Want to know about the big things that are being planned I Want to know 'em\nI Want to know who's involved and why and so I brought up this book called possess the devils it's a book was written by a ...\nAnd uh it was pre revolutionary or if it were at the details that the middle class society would be destroyed through a crackdown on dissent\nDenial is expected to revolt in a way to the time where the people would rise to the occasion and give the power structure a reason to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain\n\nThe Nile is expected some sort of revolt so they awaited the time\nWhether people would rise to the occasion and give the power structure a reason to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain basically giving the power structure heartening to resolve the power structure to literally come in and clean house\nYou know I began and does the U.S he's book and began with the silencing of the people the silencing of those people who are putting forth to the fired state\nPower that would happen you know they went and they shut down they shut down the you know the printing presses they shut down or you know journalists silencing people their free speech the freedom of the press everything taken from them and little by little information became scares and the result was a\nFerocious anger that erupted in several fires destroyed the main city\nThen came the flashpoint a will to power that ended in destruction and violence and it ended up in a huge war\nWhere young people were sacrificed in order to empower the leaders with the blood bond where the blood bond or a blood cement they would hold their grip on a frightened world the American people\nHave actually managed to solidly adapt to intolerant ideologies to dissent all these forms a of a you know groups that are are supposed to represent\nNeo Nazis and fascists and and then we have the anti fascist and the left wing umbrella of shades communism and and all these factions fighting together thinking there's one side of the other side wouldn't reality that there is no one side of the other side there are several factions within both sides\nAnd everybody's trying to identify them is one thing but you can't anymore\nI mean what are your conscious of it or not\nYou can say that doing this dividing and fighting his anti liberty it really turns out to be very difficult for the media under center except that is why they say well we have these guys over here that are out right and we have these counterprotesters the hour and they never say who they are\nI've never I mean maybe I can find someplace buy Everytime I have never heard anti far being spoken up by the media\n\nAnd you know the only ones I hear about are Proud Boys in anti ... but there's also others and you know\nWe have to learn and we have to remember that there are two main dangers to liberty right now one that comes from the left and when that comes from the right and that is this bond receive from the Warren groups of the city's literally\nAdapting this blood cement back in the time of Germany and Hitler was blue kites they called the blue kite balloons kite demeaning blood Senate meaning that the leaders would commit acts of accidents murder and violence and the others would follow suit\nAnd that's what's happening now we have a little blue type going on in in the deep state certainly is breathing this boots kites\nAnd we are\nHaving a little something called fascism and and ah and fighting a this is this is how we do terrorism American style this is how we do civil instability or instability was reduced incivility uh America saw\nI mean\nYou know the jak boots of course are coming from our own people now be enforced is their own people police show up made this kind of stand there and wait kind of a referee between the factions fighting\nBut here we are following the footsteps of or well we're following the footsteps of do CFC we're following in the footsteps of all these guys who forewarned us\nThis way I mean given all we know about what's going on and given all we know about the new world order and what it's going to do and what the new I mean this is this is the example of new world order it treats the citizens like faceless statistics\nAnd economic units we bought sold barter traded in track\n\nIt lies the system lives it cheats it steals it spies it kills breaks laws over reaches authority abuses its power almost every turn and they love to violent\nTheir empire so what they do is they create wars they they uh\nThey take over everything they they're swallowing up everything little by little\nAnd so we have is deep state that is a myth superpower ... worldwide deep state of global industrial deep state and so it might get like you know network where uh the\nMid ... he says there are no Russia's there are no countries there are no there is no west there's only one organized system of systems and that's money and that's takeover and that's dominance\n\nAnd that's that that that's become becoming true you know conspiracy theory but it's becoming a a a true thing\nFor everybody\nAnd that's what's the most terrifying as it is it's very true ideology we we were first afraid of terrorists now we're afraid of each other we were afraid of the rising up\n\nUp the middle eastern terrorists now it's us but needs to be careful because you know we have a fourth estate and its\nAll this\nAnd and what they have they have these controls in place now would you be crucial in creating a warm climate of politically motivated violence\nMay want you to speak politically correct speech politically to dismiss the talking points political fanaticism I mean we manufacture racial tension we for fifty one people that we don't like we burned the books in the same places we burn people and it's because of the global establishment\nHas risen up against the people and the people responded by radicalizing political ideology that by all intents and purposes is eating us from the inside out\n\nThere's also report that can show you may have gleaned highly sensitive inside the information on what actually happened on September eleventh two thousand one of the attacks on New York in the Pentagon even more intriguing\nAre us media reports now emerging that American intelligence had spied on and we're aware of Saudi officials making plans to capture could show ... prior to his apparent disappearance the Saudi ... last week so it'd be Americans do the journalist life was in danger why didn't they came up to the to actually do it what is that\n... you ever wonder about that see Saudi royals knew that can show you was criticizing the so called reforms the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman but are more concerned with the show he knew about darker dirtier matters not just the Saudis but he knew about deep said actors\nOn a worldwide level\nBecause show he went from interviewing Osama bin Laden in the Nineteen eighties to becoming one of the most prominent journalist in this country [noise] and then he went to self imposed exile running for the Washington Post [noise]\nBut he probably didn't know a lot about what happened on nine eleven I'll tell you why coming up Tripoli picks up at three thirty seven hundred ... six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\n[noise]\n\n... with\nThese tariffs and anxious weeks\nI Know that every American citizen wants to know what he can do for his cut for [noise]\nThree one way you can indicate your devotion to freedom\nThere is one way and which we can show how strongly believe in democracy [noise]\nNext Tuesday leading\nUp every American will turn out and vote\nHow strongly believe in freedom\nOutlier in them and\nWhen we got to get to say\nShow of us has been\nHow\nHard you know you\nPeople running man\n\n[laughter]\n\nYou are listening ground zero\nFor the call that I can relate six Seventy three thirty seven hundred\nHe's weighing on all levels around the world\nWe now look to the story of jump off the show again he was a reporter\nWho wrote for the columnist for the Washington Post\nHe went in to get a document so they could get married to his fiance went into the conflict in Turkey this tumble one fourteen\nPM said his fiance was there to wait for him she did go to a um you never came back out\nTurkish resources said the man was murdered and dismembered Donald Trump says well you know this is a very bad situation will have to look into it we can't let this happen reporters to anybody\nBut of course to show that he was about to blow the whistle on deep state players in Saudi Arabia the United states beyond and its would've probably collapsed Saudi influence around the world\nBut at the church to correct the show he was murdered by the Saudis Trump said that there would be major consequences and I wonder where those major consequences would be I mean you can only speculate that we would stop backing the Saudis you imagine what that would do to us\nAnd of course ah the report that to show he may have gotten a hold of some sensitive inside information what actually happened on nine eleven but even more intriguing us media reports say that he was spied on by the CIA and there were fully aware they were taking them killing Saudis so if\n... if if the CIA new to journalists life it was in danger to show his life was in danger why

Saudi Arabia and turkey to figure out what happened to missing journalist your mouth show he had to sell the consulate in Istanbul that according to President Trump\nTo the goings on in the world it's increasingly obvious that were already under a new world order and it's being brought to you by the global industrial deep state\nWhich is a powerful ... made up of international government agencies in corporations and I don't know how you defined I Divide that is worldwide fascism\nAnd it's something that\nUh I think we need to we need to be aware of as a country together agreeing to the enemy is out there too and that we shouldn't be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this order that wants to take over to go to Jack in California hijacked you're on ground zero\n[noise] ... yeah this is an interesting story but there's a couple of things to just didn't ring true to me about how do you feel the same ...\nLike a non ... junkie show ...\n... yeah\nSo you had the church came out ...\nShowed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in [noise] well if they knew that these guys were there to put it on somebody why didn't they stop them so I think you have a the Turkish\nGovernment also complicit but they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is have you ever heard of\nAny nation states Cindy Fifteen people to do it yet\nI mean if you're if you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill him and the more people you have in the inner price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong\nSo the story from the beginning didn't ring true but Trump has a between a rock and a hard spot now because you're coming up on the mid term elections\nAnd they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you can see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly and the price of gasoline would skyrocket would have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame them for a bad economy\nAnd the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this is a foot\nThis hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of a worldwide beads stay manipulation it is I mean\nIt's not just about it's not just about President Trump it's about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence with this ... this happening\nAnd and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go by\nWell it's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy wish it were to look at\nAn other indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil's going to start going up I think to moral can be a very bad day in the stock market is is this thing somehow\nStarts to escalate now how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when ...\nIs a Saudi citizens and he was actually in a Saudi embassy which makes him on Saudi territory we have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states as\nA consequence the president United States has really no authority to retaliate against Saudi Arabia but you know watch him get pressure to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to lead the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey and said that they know that he was taking in was killed in was dismembered and the flu is remains I Can't remember the food too but ah they move them out of the country\nFlight if the Turkish government had a video evidence of the hit team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it can\nProbably do the same reason or you say that you would in a he was in Saudi Arabia territory they can't get in there and embassy and do anything about it\nWell but you're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nThey may be arguments the CIA was facilitating operation deep laid opportune argument that he'd said operatives the IRA were facilitators to the murder of this uh uh I'm a ...\nAnd of course Saudi Arabian us to be said operators were involved here as well now turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed too but what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple\nOr our country even more because of Trump's pressure to do anything it's going to bring up gas prices and it's going to bring\nUp a inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that can happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you would want an incident is an incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia and\nThe thing that I have a feeling do need to do that while I have a feeling though that's what they want I mean big the neo cons are still in control of a lot of things around Donald Trump okay you've got both and who certainly was a signatory on the project for the new American Century and if they moved them into another George W. Bush were screwed so he's old\nEnough to remember when Saudi Arabia pulled back their oil supply in the seventies and we had an immediate gasoline shortage there was along the lines for gasoline yep and they went to the odd even license plates right so you can gas up one day if you play it was even in the next day if you play it was an even\nOn that I think they went by the last number of your plate so I mean number I was working in the motion picture business at the time and I'd have to have my we had two cars so I'd have my wife gas up the car for me you know to get the car ready for the next day\nAnd then that day she gets up the other car and because the lions horrible I didn't have time to wait in line for gas but the price of gas skyrocketed and you can only imagine\nThe leverage that Saudi Arabia still has now they've pulled back or on their oil and they're saying if we're retaliated against by sanctions or any other means a that we're going to fall back or or oil and I think they use the figure that oil could go to two hundred dollars a barrel\nSo we're looking at ten dollars at the pump a gallon\nOr easily by ... I don't know does does a Trump want to call their bluff\nNo idea that as being the bait and retaliate\nSo I'll watch and wait now right that's why I brought this up because I'm Glad somebody had asked me they said well why don't you talk about Joe ... show and I thought what am I talking about and then I realized oh I Know that said that I looked over and I figured\nWell gosh if they were all facilitating this this is one more way to destabilize the country namely United States of America destabilize this from the pump\nIt stabilizes with inflation destabilize this\nWith an economy that's going to go back\nAnd then what will we have to we'll have to be put on a war footing by by Christmas Time\nRight and and remember the key thing is though if if this goes south quickly it could really affect the mid term elections and the Democrats if Trump looks bad the Democrats would easily get control of the house\nAnd so do you think this is a well once again the deep state so what do you say the deep state intelligence ops wanting to make Trump look bad and making them by putting him in a position where he has to make these decisions\nI think he made a good point that they not only the Turkish government but the CIA is a facilitator because I've always maintain that there's elements inside a all of our main intelligence agencies including the CIA that hey Trump and they want to get rid of trumpet and it costs\nLike well it's always something like this to\nHappen it's creating the it's creating the atmosphere in the environment for a global is to Lucian meeting that he doesn't work in America anymore the guy or something\nYou might have missed there there was last night and National Geographic special about the secret service and they talked about I'm a real story about an assassination attempt on President Trump while he was in a foreign country\nAnd kinda was behind it\nInteresting well we'll we'll see what happens but like I said right now this is certainly you know that's the whole purpose of the show tonight was discovering to show\nHow the deep state is worldwide thing about bad for a moment of these states worldwide yeah BMI ... yang [noise] ah you know Christmas steal the British guy you have screw ball boys things to make about Russia look bad United States with bad with Russians during the Russian meddling terms and conditions now [noise] ah we we have ah people getting\nIn ... being sent to them we have a ... and you just go down the list of all these things that President Trump in a very very bad position [noise]\nEven as much to be a decapitation exercise in Washington DC even come down to ... whatever they need to do to abruptly killed the United states in favor of a global agenda is what they'll do anything in maybe done this way with the\nOil boom backs the inflation the economy going by and a lot of people want that just to see Donald Trump burned to the United states\nWhat do you think Tripoli picked him at three thirty seven hundred Tripoli picks every three thirty seven hundred I'm like who is using ground zero\nKen gradients that are great for your prostate it's like taking three prostate supplements in one to celebrate we're sending free bottles to men who want to cut down on bathroom trips yes your first thirty day supply is free\nAnd Trump at a very bad position especially before the election and the fact that I I've said before and I said I think that's it on the show I said that I think our next step is to destroy the economy and secure war footing and I said that's a nice days so I mean this could do it\nLooked at it I think we have to look at turkey here born in the in the shaky footing the or the wall is on with his\n... dropping like Iraq right and and I and he's got ties to the hardliners in Saudi Arabia yeah and and it's possible that this is a a a\nForm of a coup chance within Saudi Arabia that we are still interest curved to serve to help a turkey get back in August ...\nWe'll see what happens Peter we'll see what happens right now I I look don't it doesn't look too good Peter thanks I appreciate the Gulf thank you ... like Tripoli victim at three thirty seven

Louis\nYou're listening to ground zero lot of people are saying and this is something interesting to see the writing me and telling me that we're supposed to be independent now of oil we produce more oil and Saudi Arabia well the question I have been as it were that would that's\nA vision why is gas so damn high right now I don't get it I mean we've we've seen it you know low before we've seen it in the you know down to you know to maybe even up to five fifty a gallon but now we're pushing four dollars a gallon\nAnd uh I I really think though that would have an effect probably not as much of effect is maybe you know\nTen dollars at the pump by me but I always get into the sphere that some somebody will wake up to ten dollars a pop because it's something we've done or something is happening\nYeah I don't know the the just the world down anything is possible anything we speculate about the past is coming true\nIt it's just weird how you know and and it can you imagine how much division would happen if we found ourselves in a in a in a moment of scarcity when I talk about ... weeks ago with what the Henry Kissinger was talking about scarcity we must bore scarcity\nIn order to demonstrate what it would mean to\nRedistribute the wealth redistribute goods and services in and and make everything uh a happy global family see this is what they're pushing for an outside interest and outside interest that it's not\nAmerican Constitution republic not democracy it's something else they want and they they they need to make their dance and trauma that he's traumatized enough to be ready because they're ... they're due date is twenty thirty\nWhere they would say due date is twenty thirty and then from there who knows but the the beginnings of what they want to establish and what they want to put forward a in that is a a conspiracy to destabilize the United\nStates of America to go to George in Kentucky I George on ground zero\nHey I how about your scenario a little bit I think you're right about the state but what about the situation with with Trump we've never seen a president for that does rallies way Trump passed to ignite public on both directions\nGood and bad or we have and it\nSure we have George George do these are like the way the white light but\nNo you know you need to acknowledge the fact that there are other presidents have had the ability to do with Trump does\nAnd what he's doing now if we destabilize the country when these elections come up and I don't think this election is going to be\nMajor but I think the next one coming up is it will all of a sudden with these stabilized with this tape stay involved in all this Trump is going to be put himself in a situation where he's going to say we're going to hold off on the elections and we'll just carrying we truly too we staple what country\nSo this is what they thought Obama was going to do this where they thought George Bush was going to do they didn't do it so you would think that Trump would be stupid enough to suspend election so that we have right\nNow it's not stupid if you think about it well it ... you would lay that most you got most of the American public\nI can hear Hitler Hitler Hitler I give you your Hitler chanted in the streets about happened\nYet but that's what we think about what the story is between the neo Nazis planned I mean everything that's going on I think about all the ... going on and what this is set up for an Emmy ... if you look at it in the respect\nNo that's not going on it's not happening but then you go okay well that can't happen but it is happy with it all the diversity\nYeah I mean like that's happening\nWith every bite you got all these a fraction of the people that are just ... fit about everything in the country if you look at things will be stabilized\nWe are being liberalize the time all the countries all the countries that ah you don't want to hold onto their sovereignty and their freedom or being destabilize it back to the United states is a big ... that's when they want they want it done", "show_name": "Dr. Joy Browne Show", "month": "10", "state": "MA", "day": "16", "station": "WXTK",
