S. I mean again there's there's so many\nStories that need to have be getting more attention than they are getting in this ... this is one of them right here you know but they all these scams but I'm putting this out for for\nAll of my fellow white people and all of my fellow\nAsians cause I consider myself a lot of er you know you should if you want to get into Harvard just the just mentioned in your essay that you were grappling with your sexual identity when they see you tried to pick up they\nYou know when you're in the yard you're in you know what's a what's orientation is out of the way you just say well I ... I was grappling with it but\nI'm grappled with it long enough to know I'm a heterosexual after all\nJust get once you once you get into Harvard it doesn't really matter you know 'cause they got no one wants to add a harbor I've never run into people drop out like soccer burger Bill Gates but nobody ever walks out of Harvard I used to tell me if I don't I've never known anyone who walked out of Harvard worst case scenario\nThey put you on the six or seven year plan\nRight or they yeah they tell you to come back of the year to year off since everybody at Harvard is rich you know doesn't matter you know just go when ah you know\nDo something to do something fun send Flora trolley so remember\nThat's remember these words if you want to get into Harvard you happen to be white or Asian with sexual identity and those are the magic word our cars [noise]\n[noise]\nActually at the end\nUse radio Ninety five [noise]\nAnd you actually you know [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReginald Ernest all and Mr open from Oxford University right Mr Alton came in just for the press conference and they announced the result of their review or they tore no that was found and Vince fosters briefcase almost a week after he\nDied piece together twenty eight pieces and they concluded on all three of them that\nThe note was a forgery a forgery yes\nVince I'm I'm going to ask you to do something\nBecause in light of this news I Would say the content of the letter\nAnd I remember the content of the letter the content of the letter was in my opinion very very suspicious ... well I'll tell you what I said about it at the time that it could've come straight out of the White House press office now\nDo you have a copy of that letter and if you do you read it to us please\nA\nOr have I caught you by surprise that\nJust a matter of reaching across here\nOkay well I figured somewhere you'd have that uh I'm I'll tell you what I'll tell you know I mean\nLet me read it I have it right [noise] maybe I should look at the table of contents\nAnd I'll tell you what this is a good place fine I'll take a break it's that important I'll just give you a couple of minutes to find that\nI doubt it you got yeah go\nI made mistakes from ignorance inexperience\nNova work I did not knowingly violate any law or standard of conduct no one in the White House to my knowledge violated any law or standard of conduct\nIncluding any action in the travel often there was no intent to benefit any individual with specific group the FBI lied and they report to the Eighteen to practice covering up the legal benefits they receive from the travel off\nA GOP has lied and misrepresented its knowledge and its role uncovered a prior investigation the ushers office plotted to have excessive costs incurred taking advantage cocky an HR the public will never believe the innocence of the Clinton\nAnd they're loyal staff\nThe wall Street Journal editorial editors live without conflict when I was not meant for the job\nOr the spotlight public life in Washington Here ruining people is considered a sport\nAnd that's it that's it\nThe part that really grabbed me was they I just in a suicide note it I don't think you would say the public would never believed the innocence of the Clintons well\nIt was interesting missed often said you know he said any time you have a note that suddenly appears when they need to be such a duck and then it seemingly benefit some ... it's just the immediate cause for concern and of course here you have so many\nJust trying to state and federal all the experts believe\nThat the statement had been taken from other documents that he had ... maybe had written in other contact and had been put together a good word you will always try to imitate known writing\nSo they're trying to Fort well of course of course so you why\nWhy the letter doesn't mention suicide or death because Vince Foster apparently didn't right I'm going to kill myself for good by world\n\nAnd yet that sounded like kind of a summary note nevertheless I mean some are rising everything to this point and with some something in mind without having that suicide it did sound kind of final summation of the failure or however you want to look at it\nThere at the press conference there were a number of reporters the number of TV networks I don't think it ran on any of the television network\nWell there we come to a very interesting question now Reuters ran the story had been ... to me all day long there's a lot of excitement up about it out of their writers ran the story you say the networks were their\nCBS and NBC\nOh really yeah how could they possibly ignore evidence of this sort I mean I guess CBS could choose to ignore it or protecting its sixty minutes division\nBut what about the other is and what about the Associated Press and what about you know I mean especially at a\nPress the major news outlet the country and they didn't send a reporter\nAnd then they got a copy of the report and they said they were going to do a full news story or at least a dispatch I mean here Reuters did a major dispatch twice the light that they usually do on these type of story and the a\nP uh editors from Washington were telling people yeah we're going to do a story and then ends up they do what the classic bury the story\nOr they save it for two paragraph\nLiterally at the end of a long story on white water hearing but nobody's interested in in Washington a panel of experts has declared that the foster notice and notify the government can vote otherwise blah blah blah\nBut this is now the title of three international forensic experts and they are saying apparently now you tell me without qualification it's a forgery how do they come back you know OK\nWell before they even get to the issue of forgery and they're also saying that the FBI and the park police totally manhandle that that nowhere and forensic examination do you ever come here a note like that or any note to one document\nTo make it certification which is exactly what the park police and the FBI did\nSo the big question mark is why did they ban the normal procedure and I quote in my article but you have the FBI crime lab assistant director and the former head of the question document unit at the bureau thank you know he wanted a minimum of ten documents\nWell the only that was funny that you know the ... yeah\nThe crime lab as as we all know is now under close scrutiny there's going to be an international a panel put together to look into the FBI crime lab\nWell who knows they may be a lot of crime going on there\n[laughter] well sticking with the note for a second the declaration that it is a forgery he is a blockbuster I mean if that's a forgery then the whole damn thing comes apart\nThere's a couple of reasons why first of all there was a great quality for fishing because\nThe note is found in a briefcase the search the police that that they were ... the fact that that brief case searched twice and was empty enough out and looked at it\nSecond it um benefited or people at the White House than ... the owner fall up proving the suicide third ... was born and apparently the experts at any time you have a a document question document that is corn\nMutilated crumple from the old on it it is often prompted effort to make it come Parikh then difficult for sure do already\nYou have a primary ... at the English experts at\nFish and then you look at the no\nAnd the first of all the donor you look at a you know which we have a photocopy of we had a huge blow up a write in comparing you can see that it is not a match that the way he strokes structured are gone the flow the slant of the letter is not the fame\nSo then from make clear handwriting expertise point of view which is a good science it's a forgery\nWell it is a forgery and the other thing is what they were able to show in large blow up was that certain letters like when you write a letter let's say to let her be right you might only write that letter lower case B with one stroke start at the top down at the bottom\nYou round it out and then the last stroke is going over the next letter the\nEnd of the stroke but ... born here will not do it that way he'll ride the line down he'll stop the stroke it might take the boat and let her be start from the top of bringing around\nAnd you can see that from a large blow up and that's what they were able to show that the letter ... for example um was done in three stroke structured Heathrow\nUnlike off who had a very tenuous anti style of writing uh-huh which you can uh we had a dolphin documents that week or two\nOr three different fourth I'm so\nVery very clear that we ah that that that it isn't a match\nYou know uh this is starting to get very dangerous for some people Chris at this point\nLike you like me like anybody who's got anything to do is saying what we're saying right now but\nThis has got to lead it's got to lead to the next step and so you're asking a couple of things aren't you you want based on this report you want more coverage you want what what where\nPractice there were three experts here that came in and gave their opinion or one of the world's pre eminent handwriting experts came into this country\nKind of the doctor leave handwriting\nYeah mhm uh well actually uh he has a lot less baggage and Dr Lee\nOr frankly and\nHe's not and I'm ... I'm like Dr ... the um he except that he asked for no fee\nTo do this or an hour\nOh now that's interesting uh so so in other words the there could be no other uh external motivational other than trying to get to the truth well\nThe funny thing is I'm Dr all to knew very little about the case I mean he's been hearing a lot about it today these quite sure about it but he looked at it just as a matter of looking at this note and comparing it to a dozen document that\nFoster is known to have written and he said that it's not a match it it was a it was a forgery and he can see how the ...\nWrote the document because before ...\nNever know how someone exactly right how their stroke well\nAll right hold it right there where the bottom of the hour we'll be right\nWith Chris Ruddy\nAnd we'll show you how to get hold of the Associated Press\nIs premier networks that was art bell hosting coast to coast am longer [noise] somewhere in time\n\n... the Boston Red Sox are going for the night World Series title against the Los Angeles Dodgers catch all the action right here on Cape Cod sports radio Ninety six three Roger you can't go to our where him for\nThe double drag it in guaranteed fresh produce a dairy products Cape Cod ... stand talking down drywall masonry supplies and accidental auto body\nSign up for this what was the first four years we're all side of the ready to go get God's radio Ninety six three\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower was spot in trouble before it happened well now it's on us to protect our home and family\nSounds holding corps offering will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found with unqualified by the U.S securities Exchange Commission these securities are highly speculative investing and chairs and kind of stuck in thousands\nWith the original and the entire thirty for thirty\nAnd spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's my parents' trust blink blinked video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home is like having ice everywhere\nBlink cameras or wire free set up in minutes and run on to double A. batteries last up to two years brilliant technology\nAverage Joe\nThe bottom line for all of them\nIs a news and information we do morning from seven to ten ... news radio Ninety five W.

right good Chris this really is a blockbuster I mean this is ed to me as you said earlier this makes Watergate hailed by comparison there you're talking about a third rate burglary for some the various political purpose\nHere you might be talking about it the least obstruction of justice in the body was moved in the story was manufactured\nOr murder\nOr whatever it is it doesn't it even or even if justice was the bird and the FBI didn't use their proper procedures in investigating the park police used an examiner to certify the document that that never ah with certified as a handwriting expert uh\nSo obviously no one really cared to properly investigated that\nMr ... one of the experts formerly with the New York city police department was on the house committee for assassination and he was the one that ... that are found the palm prints ... on the rifle but um he is an expert in late fingerprint\nA note was torn for the audience and the reporters today it's twenty eight pieces ...\nAnd they were shown how many fingers had to come in contact with different piece of paper Mr ... said his statement that this is can ... the fact that they had no fingerprint for no late impression on these papers is consistent with the person who tore it having one gloved\n[noise] [laughter] [noise] so it's a forgery so we've got a gigantic story so the Associated Press now you give me what you can I knew this is touchy territory Chris letter\nWhile the eight paint today promise the number of people that call on the media world here in in Washington and elsewhere that they were going to do a dispatch may have been you know a short story but it would be a story\nAnd when people are calling up the ... yeah we did it we're doing it or we did it while we find out what did it meant was to paragraph three paragraphs at the end of a very long article on white water and Senate hearing\nWhy\nAbout a witness that was important Marcy on the night foster died he came in he was the first one to spot forced his car and he told the FBI and the park police that there was a Hispanic man they're sitting next to last his car watching it menacing him with very menacing looks followed him in the urine edited the park\nAnd this um witness left immediately um the park police never went and visited him to interview him they spelled his name wrong in the police report you know\nWhen the FBI visited with him the FBI civil who was this man that gave you manage thing look it's a Mexican American man and the FBI interview statement states very clearly that the witness was unable to identify would be unable to identify in a line up or a composite sketch who this man what\nWell there it is and the London telegraph this Sunday a composite sketch of the man he saw the park the FBI out and out lie in their report\nOut this would maybe be a mistake\nIt happened one when we have so many instances in this case you know there were two witnesses later in the park that sought to man in and around forced his car they set it on the record one guy was standing with long blond hair in front of false does harm to but the hood up just before the body was that\nAll right look Chris you're pushing this one to the edge and ah you're beginning to now camp you know in another words is the worst case scenario is true\nOh which seems now more likely than ever to me based on the forgery thing then you're tampering with forces that have already\nGone an awful long way here and have a ... an awful lot at stake and even though you're a big time reporter\nI'm I'm not convinced that you're safe\nUm well you know there's there's risk involved in anything you do I've taken those risks and will continue to take those risks because this is a very important story\nAnd uh uh you know the trip for half the flow where they may they fall on me that I'll just take that take that ah when it comes\nYou know um I take it you've given some amount of sun to this though I mean what what\nWell look if in fact a this was a murder I Am one of the prime people behind expose\nAgain yeah I guess that's what I was saying well look and look what you\nKnow here Mike Wallace did this teeth and I think I said this to you on the last time you know my brother called me up afterwards ... ... you know I've known you your whole life you've always been an honest person you've never won a lot of money never won at the big job on Wall street type person\nAnd I just watch this and that makes you sound like you're a ally or be or Charlotte and trying to make money yeah\nI took a pay cut to continue doing this story\nUm so what do you say I mean how do you how do you argue against that Mike Wallace knew that knew that I'd never reported the foster was left handed a first that with the Boston Globe\nI was going to be held responsible for every ... rather than a newspaper ever done in this case um eat only indicates to people out there that do look into it that\nI'm On the right track and only indicates to me I'm On the right track when they have to make such a ... a ... near one Mike Wallace seems almost eighty years old at the dean of American television journalism pass to bring down a thirty year old reporter that's how old I Am\nAnd try to destroy his reputation\nThat shows that I'm having an impact\nWell ... if we look at it from the other direction\nThe implication is that I'm not making the charge but the implication is that the administration has control\nOf very large segments of the media and I'm not making that charge but you you could almost begin to believe that could be so because of the associated ... abreast under reporting because of sick\nThe minutes going after you as they did um and because the news now is so shocking\nThat it just it has to be out there and it's not so so what does that say I mean if you look at what it says it says a large portion of the media is in bed with the government\nOr the king of the I don't know if everyone but the came many of the leaders of sixty minutes program you know Don you have gone on a record producer sixty minutes saying that he helped get when Clinton was elected\nAfter the jar for flowers thing then he edited that such a way that he made recast the candidate\nI'm very close association with the ministry of Clinton campaign advisor\nOr was that and to do for a recap of these connections that are not good at governing ah but they're very good at dealing with handling\nSoon is spinning Mm [noise] [noise] All right look I'm going to end the interview here and I'm going to give out the

all we have so watch that's how important this is\nSo I Wonder how you feel about that do you think this will put a dent in those who would go and harassed doctors that do abortions will it's slow

a straw polls and that kind of thing but I'm telling you now it will come down to Clinton Dole and I think Powell Powell is going to run\n\nHow is for all we don't know about and we know a little bit about him now\nHe is pro choice we know that\nWhat else do we know about ... he's a strong leader\nWe know that\nHe's brilliance I think we agree on that he\nTalks about some gun control or sensible gun control laws\nI Would have to hear that define before I Would uh be able to make a judgment there but in a number of areas he looks to be a fiscal conservative and a social middle of the rotor\nMoore a Republican or Democrat but it's getting hard to tell these days you know so if we get a Clinton do Powell race I guess it might begin to be appropriate because I think that's what it's going to be to ask you which way you would be inclined to go\nSo why would you be inclined to go\n[laughter]\nI really think that's where it's going to go Congress are getting ready for a historic

are killed for a lot less he says you'd better watch your back as well given the reported scenario he won't take care thank you note in Seattle\nTypical well yeah you know I've thought about it and um so what it's not exactly a cavalier attitude I mean I I have thought about it believe me or\nIf what seems to be true is true then obviously powers that would do what they are alleged to have done or now seemingly have done because where does a forgery lead you\n\nTo one of two very destructive paths for somebody\nVery powerful\nAnd there's been a lot of pressure and there's been a lot of manipulation\nAnd I'm no fool I Know what could happen\nBut uh if I don't do it then who is going to Chris Ruddy doesn't do it then who is going to if the Associated Press doesn't do it as they should then who is going to\nHave sixty minutes doesn't do it as they should then who is going to\nSomebody should and um there are um\nFar less noble things to die for is not is what it comes to then I'm exposing the truth or chasing the truth\nSo there you are\nBack to the lines west of the Rockies you're on the air hello how are mourning mourning\nA you know it's interesting the way the press is covering this thing whether that foster deal when when I was ah in service during\nAh the ah\nBreaking of the ah Watergate story uh-huh I was overseas Germany I I was reading a European newspapers get more information sure that I was getting out of the magazines that I was describing to\nThere are there are certain similarities in the way the Washington Post had to doggedly pursue under criticism um the story now that is what is happening here now how long is the ... been in this condition I don't know well is it laziness I don't are back in\nThose days I think uh you know nobody want to report on what Kennedy was doing a because it was at the right guy to the the spirit of the times in those days was that we leave the president alone the dirty things about the president long ago our way back to to uh\nNot not quite true we leave the the woman I sing or the bruising or the personal things\nYeah out but not this kind of thing\nBut over time the the scrutiny to watch a public official has been hell has has gotten more and more you know we we kept FDR's wheelchair out of out of uh many people didn't even know he was in a wheelchair and nowadays you know we know what kind of underwear present aware of my life\nWhere he care yeah like we're supposed to care as around\nBut it was interesting I used to have to give an update to my friends back in the states about what was going on with the Watergate ... out because I got it out of the London paper and I got out of the English are printed a German newspaper\nI don't know what else you do with this look you don't ignore it that's all you don't ignore it I I guess maybe according to a lot of reports on getting the Associated Press may have switched off their phones or they may be so overloaded that you know who knows I Hope it's true\nYeah the whole thing just thanked pretty badly it has for the whole time\nOr have had quite an air to quite there's too many unanswered thanks now who bumped into Princeton um there's just I guess at the age of unanswered questions like who was it that bumped on the back of ... will always be the unanswered question you know and who was it that are late that's foster out with no blood\nYou know it's almost tiresome sir and nobody wants to see another presidency falter and fail you know as Nixon did nobody wants nobody wants that for American nobody in their right mind could want that\nAnd I know ... ... feet\nI Know this is going to be seen as art bell or Chris Ruddy or both you know going after Clinton with an agenda but damn it that is not what this is about\nNow it's not about that at all I I understand it's not about that at all but but we you know we as I'm quite a fifth tasteful as it is if it is something that needs to be dealt with it is something that needs to be dealt with\nWell Americans have got to sit down and have a conversation I think after something like this with themselves and say are we still Americans really\nUm do we are we still the country we once were do we still pursue the truth\nHad flown down to LA ticket can can remove the powder that was put out by ... ... yeah so did you hear about that no that direct\nCalled toll free one eight hundred six one eight eight to five five\nAnd he's making a Disney movie\nWell I'm sure than a lot organization being very sensitive to that sort of thing I'm there will be repercussions but I I was ...\nInteresting um but I Can't let me I'll tell you what let me confirmed that story and I'll get it out All right All right okay okay I think I Can't live well I I can I I\nI Will know what their stance would be ma'am thank you let me please investigate that story before I ... a because that is a very a very very serious charge and I'm not down on your word or what should you be wrong about something like that uh there would be very serious a legal repercussions\nSo let me find out about that\n\nUh but uh even if true or is it is certainly an isolated incident I'm not significant compared to what Chris Ruddy a seems to have come up with here\n\nYou know Charlie is reaction of course I guess I you know I guess it's gonna be typical of the liberals and I guess there is going to be no way no escape from the accusation that I Am and Chris Ruddy is\nAre simply going after this president\nAnd maybe it is that the midget liberal mind the myopic mind of the average liberal like Charlie cannot reacting any other way even too serious\nOr not mid level but high level of forensic expertise that absolutely demands an explanation demands an explanation and they can talk of the way by saying that it's I'm a conservative not ball rhetoric\nIt isn't even close Charles and it really reveals a great deal about you as a person that you would approach it that way I Am quite surprised quite surprised\n[noise] first time caller line you're on the air\nI hello\nI can barely hear you there you're going to have to get into the phone and shout out us\nOh okay I mean here yes ma'am\nAnd last night or someone Carter that are um hay on a\nHilltop comment yes right and they said if the law it did yes\nUh oh I don't think you mentioned that last night the kid there are\nNo I I did I mentioned it on several successive nights\nRight that that you had that we all we get a warning I did\nWell well I mean in in sort of a general way I have yeah sure if a comet where to hit earth would we know about it yeah\nWell I'm On now I have a twenty fair on your ... playing ...\nYes and it's a topic like\nProspect for yes correct\nAnd he said yeah boy they can now why would the great accept my face and now five caught the piano and the guy that my cat rather than\nUm well All right thank you it may be man it may be and uh there was an interesting you should mention that because of course I'm assuming you heard the facts I read last night about the piece that broke off which by the way is not in the shape of across or anything like it right now there is a spiral\nUm and that has been noted by recent Hubble photographs are very strange spiral shape to the debris\nThere is a piece that has broken off that is not thirty percent of the comments or somebody worried [laughter] it is\nA piece that simply is reflecting probably because of the amount of material burning off that you know you take the dirty snowball if that's what it is near break off these you've got fresh snow\nAnd so then that begins to get bright\nThe question the good question is why is it right All right now in other words it's out beyond the orbit of Jupiter and whether you're talking about the nucleus of the comet itself or a piece that breaks off there should not be enough energy from the sun\nTo be melting and scattering debris as we are now see\nThat part of it does not make sense and again we will question or Richard ... about that when he's here friday night Saturday morning I don't want you to miss that program\nFriday night Saturday morning he's got a lot to say I'm not so much about the common but we will again asked about that because there must be energy to create the burn off that creates the reflected light that we see\nAnd where is that energy coming from east of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nGood morning are chemical from taking um\nA lady just called out too long ago yeah about a\nGuy or direct the outer yeah that's a true story I've got a copy of the store right here by an Associated Press writer uh-huh it's in a newspaper and it shows um [noise] I'm a young man picketing in front of the theater or a half the\n... the only would you do me a big favor yeah would you facts that to me\nI'm not able to because I'm\nAll right I'm then fine let me just ask that somebody fax it to me and I guarantee they will and as soon as they do\nWe'll talk about it okay how's that going All right\nSo somebody out there with a fax machine God Knows we've sold enough of them a fax me that article and I'm Glad the covered it I just want to be very careful very cautious
