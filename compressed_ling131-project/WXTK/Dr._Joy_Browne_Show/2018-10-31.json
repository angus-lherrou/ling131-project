today one week from tonight election day we've got the best election coverage we got our posters tonight John McLaughlin Doug shown\nWe are in a time of darkness and um I was I saying oh I was talking\nWith the bus driver last night they said to him I said this too shall pass I told them any kinda giggled I said well that's the only hope I have right now is that this will pass and he says well not everything passes you know sometimes it lingers for a long time if you have any idea how this is going to last he says officers going to get worse and worse\nI thought how do we how do we change all that so what do we do see the media expects you to focus on\nYou know a political matters in every crisis is it can be dreamed up by news editors who are all too willing to pump up a crisis in order to fulfill a particular agenda the agenda as obvious right you know they want us to divide they want us to take sides\nAnd there are a lot of people that are just vicious or their loose everywhere um\nI actually have I have a ground zero oj I got a Facebook page it's my own I've gotta official ground zero Facebook page and then I got well there's some guy out there impersonating me that has a Facebook at Facebook page called the grounds are with quite Lewis has another Facebook pages guy pretends to be me I don't know why he does this\nHave told him I says hey it's a real me and then he removed my post so some guy out there is in first baby me with a\nThere are no official logos already had these like you know new wage type of ah you know things on the site and you always talks on behalf of me so I'm so grateful for all my listeners maybe maybe he just you know wants to live through me I don't know if that's catfish hunter where they call that stuff\nAnd I've got this ground zero group site\nIt's a ... oh there's friends of ground zero that's ... that's a Facebook page and then of course of course I got a ground zero group site and the group site was established because and it was done around the time that Facebook was starting to\n[noise] you know become a\nSensor project you know and uh so I thought well I think what I'll do is they'll set up this ground zero group age\nKind of like a backup and so I did and um [noise]\nSo uh I said this group backup and now it's turned into nothing but political yelling and screaming and fighting and\nAnd you know all kinds of stuff and it's out of control and and I can see why you know some people should we take our Facebook Facebook I think I load more than anything else it it's a necessity it's a necessary evil for promotion\nBut he just some of the cross section most ugliest fighting people I I and I just you know I don't engage anybody really I don't try to um but there's certainly you know a lot of people out there that I really worry about 'em I mean people can't get enough\nOf this political hate it's as if they're driving on it and the anger is such a powerful energy but if it were pumped into the electric grid we do not have to worry about an energy crisis I don't think\nI mean we bottled up it'd be it'd be amazing\n[laughter] he gets hit a scaled up our allies you know when I was young I was often sell lead\nBy older generations that would say you know you guys are a ... group of kids either rent you ever get that from the old ones you know one of your kids you guys are all God Bless you know what do you do it you and your rock and roll your\nYou know you're a you're a C. D. C. and your Led Zeppelin and I'm thinking well yeah OK we'll just let us know is that my parents my parents were\nI mean what I was a Laurence welk survivor and uh you know I was one of those guys that had to translate he hide in the English because it was just so difficult to watch both the shows it was both Laurence welk and he ... on the weekends\nEverybody had to go in we all got our showers we all got our bass we all got cleaned up and then there was TV Time on the weekends and it was always listening to Laurence welk Myron Florence Norma Zimmer\nAnd ... you know that will lead insist her psychotic out let's all the horrible things that I had to listen to a on the Lawrence Welk show\n[laughter] and ah and then of course he haw we watched that junior samples and grandpa and in many\nPearl the reason why is because we were related to many Pearl so but he ... I guess we had a ... we were related to her somehow she was a cousin she showed up one of our family reunions and she's really nice really nice lady right I'm In my aunt my aunt Margaret\nBut I'm so we watch the hall and but you know whatever you know it was time for everybody to go to bed I stay up late watch Saturday Night live\nUm which you know that was that was evil in my house we shouldn't watch that and of course it was the eagle rock and roll music with a black Sabbath and by Alice Cooper kiss albums and all that and so you know my parents and even my grandmother and my and my other grandmother on my mom's side\nWill just say you know you guys are God to us I mean how can you listen to music what the onion and here I Am older I'm old and I'm I'm not like I don't think I'm the age my grandmother\nWhen I started saying that to me I I Am getting up there though I mean I'm I'm\nFifty four I think she was like maybe fifty six fifty seven she started saying your kids are God was but man I was still ... back there but that was said to me and now here we are\nHere I Am I'm older and I'm Wondering if the future could become anymore God Bless [laughter] how safe anymore God lets it it can't see the older generations\nNow you know\nDon't know if I can say that I'm older generation I'm I'm a chore I mean that's the older generation went past sixty five I'd say yeah there I Am um when they say they were ... every month or a year after fifties God's Gift that I certainly am grateful that after what I've been through but I mean the older generations are forced to move forward into a world of future shock well ...\nIn fondly but we hold onto and cling onto\nMemories of when times were perceived to be simple I I I read that on Facebook today somebody put out this thing\nGo remember when the number one you used to have that stage greens dams remember when I remember when you can leave\nThe keys in the car and no one would steal the car remember\nWhen and I'm going yeah that's what they still do in Canada you know [laughter]\nAh but no uh yeah ... ... I'm not wanting to go back and say hey look with regular good times back when your kids\nBut in the last Thirty years\nMaybe going another has probably forty years now times become less spiritual religious more secular your that pull they took it as more secular I mean we're hearing about\nRaven images of say China you know ... I cannot graffiti in in in the public square in bathrooms did you hear the story about how ... the uh uh the the temple of ... or is it the temple is set or seatings temple temple is Satan or one of these ... groups seat in the sample say panic temple yeah\nThey're suing\nA net flicks because really the teenage which the TV show there we told you about how it's going to be like full of satanic imagery well apparently this this this temple is Satan see tanning temple\nNot too happy with the breed of the teenage what'd you still there is suing Netflix for using what they say is a carbon copy of their bathroom that statue\nIn what they're seeing saying oh you can't use that but I'm thinking wait a minute the bathroom it was created by that group but maybe if their design of a bathroom that they put in the in the town square but you know it can you believe that you're\nReading the news and you see\nIs Sabrina the teenage which standing with a boyfriend or something I mean I only got half way into the first episode so don't quote me on what's going on any more but [noise]\nUm because I've been watching it just gets homework done but uh you know they're standing in front of a bathroom at and I'm thinking of it for crying out loud just horn dabble\nBut they say they have a copy right on the design of the statue and now they're getting all stinking mad is you know because you know we've got that statues\nCameras Alabama I think in the in the town in in the square there near the ten commandments they put bathroom at the demonic you know character with the horns well there is by the ten commandments I mean here\nRight about the right also the movie the right was based upon the Gary Thomas we've had ... father Gary on the show before yeah you know and I don't think people understand\nHow I guess actually said just one of those like atom bombs or spirituality right the right of exercises um\nWas first published in sixteen fourteen by pope Paul the fifth and the reason why they published it is because he was hoping to quell a trend of laypeople in priest\nOr hastily performing extra systems on people they presumed repossessed and those included people who had the bubonic plague\nIn fact there's a line in the right that said The Exorcist you should be careful to distinguish between demon possession melancholy which was a catchall for mental illness so I mean from the beginning there was always that\nFine line that most priests had to walk with regard to ... mental illness so the church do back then that they were mental problems\n... and it said that the extra ... should not have anything to do with medicine daily medicine to the doctors\nThey should handle all of a spiritual stuff so you know father Gary is holding an actress has endured off witchcraft\nThen you know this is this is not some physical situation this is something that is very spiritual the spiritual warfare which do you know spiritual warfare I was told once that things like Armageddon things like you know the apocalypse\nThey all begin on a spiritual level the caskets on begins on his spiritual level and then it happens to manifest itself in the physical material world\nAnd so once his manifest in the physical material world and all demons are unleashed all hell breaks loose\nAnd every extra shift is worth their weight becomes the army of God and they and they fight not just Catholic exercises but there are plenty of others to from very trace their Jewish\nAnd Muslim extra sister born again evangelical crew Hispanic religions that are due deliverance which of course bringing people from the throes of satanism or from the throes of demonic possession into the arms of Jesus or into the arms of\nGod and that seems to be what people are looking for they're looking for some sort of I don't know they're looking for some sort of refuge they feel that they've lost their way they've lost their souls their soldiers have been given up some guy caught my show last night and said that he gave us each shoulder to shoulder the devil\nI asked him why he and he\nTold me and then he said when he gave his life back to Jesus I don't know if that can happen but I mean you know it's not up for me to decide that you know is that it prevented decide whether this guy your shoulders sort of the devil given so back to Jesus it's just crazy that ah you know people when they're down like instead of melancholy people who have melancholy\nA as opposed to people who are truly possessed and believe it or not here's the thing that I learned I learned that you know not only is The Exorcist and right you know\nGoing back to sixteen fourteen for that there is also down psychiatry psychiatry is being recognized a [noise]\nA possession they're not going to call David possession of becoming a number of things I'm Talking about that coming up on ground zero [noise] a lot of psychiatric terms for what is happening to the world the winter happening to people and how the devil seems to be calling in people responding to release except for three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six Seventy three thirty seven hundred and\nI'm like Louis you listen to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nWord source seeds so you know\nIt means I exercise you I Am sure I Am a map I tell you you must do acts it's a very very strong word grief [noise]\n[noise]\nOh yeah [laughter]\n\nHang on there [noise]\n\nAre you making all the noise [laughter]\n\n\nOoh\n\nDo you are listening to ground zero ... calls in a shovel age six seven three thirty seven hundred shovel eight six seven three thirty seven hundred\nYeah a lot of conversations with people people feeling as though something's wrong people feeling as though\nAmerica is possessed by something\nWell I don't know if we want to go as far as demons but you know last night of course you know dig Redfern was other programs I don't know if they're demons\nI don't believe they're ... and I think it's because he just doesn't like the idea of any kind of expressed that he just didn't like the idea of people actually giving these pressure or at least talk to you about a cartoon asks type of devil\nAnd I think that's the problem with a lot of atheist I think that's a problem with a lot of people who say they're ... they don't believe in the cartoon version of any of it\nIs a lot of the time when you hear people speak they make it sound like a cartoon is the devil is got horns and he's got the tail and I think a lot of people you know tend to think of the images that are they ... take the image and they think of God in such a way that people find it to be\nA little bit more like like I said I joke that like you know very good or something\n\nAnd and I and I'm not meaning that to be glib but not me not to be I mean what I'm saying is is that sometimes we need to\nUnderstand that not everyone shares the same vision as we do no matter how simple it may be about what God and the devil are because they are very complex things\nWith somebody and they posted on Facebook or he takes pride and talking about said and I really don't take pride in talking about ... what I Do take pride in though they they I I take pride and give you information that he's not being watered over by some sermon it's not big wide open by some dogma see that's the problem I have right now\nBut my habits is too much ... even even when you're talking about which is in ... and all that uses a lot of dogma that blocks it we immediately assumed\nIt all begins worship the devil we we immediately assumed all which is worse than the devil which they do not but the thing is that we've got to know\nJust how dangerous it is to\nBe just kind of saying okay well we're gonna we're gonna catch that or a hexagon someone who do strategically we're going to use words and we're going to weaponize them because that's a form of magic is what what ... you know that's a form of magic we're going to force people into believing in\nHaving the bathroom at the public square and we're going to bring it forward and say no there is no problem I don't think is a problem putting a Baptist bitten a park\nAs long as we explain what a park is\nI I think having having an extra Ten Commandments on anything that would be considered a government I think is is wrong\nThe ten commandments should not be on a government or be on the on the government lawn\nI Know the arguments all the the country is founded on the ten commandments and the you know it was not\nIn fact a lot of the ... like I said last night and most of the nation's [laughter] you know they created the churches is nothing been friends for them to going to practice their their their loose period in a you know little ceremonies\nIt was the reformers that have changed everything\nFor good or bad I'm not going to say but I'm just saying it was reformers have changed every everything has its roots\nAnd a lot of the dark guards everything has its roots\nIn pre eastern magic in philosophies and it's from the Christian reformers in the end and the Christian Church that is stabbed lists some of the other values and sometimes they embrace some of the pagan values and so that's why sneaking up from behind this is the devil\n\nBut it's not necessarily the devil it's real it's the devil we make out to be a hallmark card 'em horns sharp tail and a little beer needs is basically riding his hands waiting for the next person that you can buy a soul from\nSo you've done spiritual battle with which is\nSo yeah and also see I also have known\nVery wise once they've done on magic myself and about Ninety nine percent of all kinds of practices along those lines deals with self knowledge and protection against aspects of yourself\nNinety nine percent of it has to do with that it doesn't have anything to do with a at doing things apart others because you have to take care of yourself\nFirst okay yeah\nSo it makes your your your well would you sell your right within yourself ... drug where he started taking on which is I got it\nThat way and actually that's what I learned from which it\nAll day so you learn from the which is what you turned it on them you know they I learned from also learn from the wife which is okay well I didn't date so the wise which is are the ones that explained to me\nBecause I've done all the time to add advance magic and everything but the first thing they tell me what Ninety nine\nPercent of it has to be for self improvement and self in motion of cleansing hangs of that nature thank you for the call

and watch their ...\nAnd some of your talks and everything about some of the more obscure religious texts\nSomething they need to pick up a copy of say five I'll Bible by Mr Bush started reading it and I actually was to punch it myself finding things out about myself I didn't know existed I was like oh my God some of these things that he talks about\nI understand that wow I share a couple of therapy ... ...\nBut in my family I Would bring something like the house or even a solo with it I'm automatically condemned to hell you know and it's one of the biggest and I'm just like I'm not going to jail just by reading a book it's not what I Am who I Am this\nBook that's supposedly what everyone thinks so equal it actually helps me on a path of self discovery\nSee I read I read a little babies are books and uh I was very surprised at how many people actually ah I've heard said things that are Christian\nThat actually uh uh I guess you could say or could ruin with what ... said in his book so easy it's basically the idea that uh you know some people who say that they are Christian or their Christian minded have leaned it to themselves into areas where I don't know if\nI ... the speaker on behalf of all fitness around the world maybe we can find out for sure\nBut certainly what he's written in the past I think resonates with a lot of people even if they were to pick it up and read it it would scare them how much they resonate with it [noise]\nLike in that really spark some new sodomy so I wanted to ask you what other ex you said I Can't read that would keep this self discovery pat on\nWell I I wouldn't I wouldn't continue reading a book because I Know like they live with like a carnival Barker nothing really any big spiritual by that got\nA view if you want to find out more information about why things are believed the way they are you can read the power Mitt\nBy Campbell I think that book is very good Jane and my wife did you read chaos theory you should read um guys are just so many other books you should really should start picking up some of the non Canaan or non canonize Bible of chapters and a lot of them are available\nWe read a lot of pages from Munich and a lot of pages from a you know the book of ah [noise] the maccabees there are plenty of books that you can read gospel that are not part of the Bible that should be\nA ... there's a lot of things to keep yourself well rounded in in not really uh I I think it's not really a cult literature but it certainly would have to give you a better understanding of what is going on you may want to if you want to down a little bit getting\nSome ... books and also a review crazy rambling ... and then maybe you'd be rounding up but you still don't get that information\nAnd still doesn't make you some sort of a spiritual ... master that's all part of you know wanting to be a joiner no one wants to be a joiner we'll be back [noise]\n\nI needed new blind I knew I could save a ton of money if I put them in myself but I was nervous about measuring right\nPeople started talking about actresses\n... became a work lots of calories intent was meant to be an exploration of fate at least that's what William Peter bloody said a Stephen King\nAh there was this um\nThose are the only Rob I don't know if you've noticed that like Rob has this horror special on AMC and are they just did it the whole thing about possession which I thought was interesting that um the timing uh\nPerfect because they were talking about uh The Exorcist movingly rose or talk to you about to get out which is kind of a possession film and they were talking about The Exorcist and everybody was influenced by The Exorcist and Stephen King said\nThat\nHe felt that The Exorcist was a film about social change basically a finely honed\nFocusing point for that entire youth explosion that took place in the late sixties early seventies he said it was a movie for all those parents who felt in a kind of agony and terror that they were losing their children and could not understand why or how it was happening and today we can all agree\nThat perhaps were not only losing our children to the devil but we may also you know we might also be losing ourselves to the devil it's also been argued\nThat the movie The Exorcist addresses anxieties about changes in the structure of the family and how evil and trauma can be handed down from generation to generation only to be eventually manifest for all the see in some explosive demonstration of mental and physical breakdown\nNow I think a lot of people don't realize maybe some people do realize that the movie and Peter ... novel these based on a true story\nIt's based on a month long ... Ninety day exercises and by just would prefer a fourteen year old boy who prefer to sign a pseudonym\nDo the extra system happened in Nineteen forty nine rolling does boy who had homes in Prince George's County Maryland where this reporting to possession began and uh it went for Ninety Days three months\nUh it started in the winter and then in the spring of Nineteen forty nine ah ruins parents relocated from Maryland to a relative someone Saint Louis wherever the course of two weeks there in St Louis there was there were nine just would brief the ... participated in the boys' actresses ...\nOne of them was father even bishop a he kept a diary of encounters there were a number of others that were involved that uh uh certainly uh you know they're all getting up and have some of them are passed away I think and of course uh we were approached by a a number of people\nTo discuss ah this case because apparently one of the nurses that uh was there a witnessing the situation was actually told they took a sixty year vow of silence that we're going to talk about the case\nAnd now those who were survivors are are now talking about the case and one man in particular a Mark Perry\nIs an RN with forty two years in the medical field including over Thirty years and I use in the yards US Army veteran and a medic during the Nineteen seventies he was a Catholic brother of or or monk ah with the election brothers for four years working on a working with the sisters of a\nCrime to him and he sat down\nWith John Grinder who was one of the nurses that was there during the night of the exercises him and he uh recorded a a a video that we have a and this is interesting we have exclusive rights as video and it's basically John Grinder giving up his sixty about sounds about what happened that night\nUh in Nineteen forty nine with ruin do a mark welcome to ground zero\nAll oh welcome to the show it's good to have you here\nBut um yeah I called you a few months back or talking about I'm a\n... ... and I think you saw you know the you're seeing the uh the little video that I talk with John I'm you see what I was talking about where you know that that stuff just scares the heck out of the\nOil [laughter] oh he he was a I I was ... I watch the video tape I took out some extra Seventy two so we play them on the air with your fantastic interview with this man or how did you finally get a John to come forward a especially with all the ... those involved to you about silent\nBy the way the way it was a the election brothers have a hospital where they there are a congregation that started the in the eleventh century and then it became an uh an official a congregation in the thirteenth fifties\nThese days with a group of nursing a group of men who are where they lived on the outside of\n... in the walls of cities in Europe and have\nBasically a where nurses to the people the court that were not allowed in the city so after the after the black Plague The you know they they were allowed in well in in the late Eighteen hundreds I'm\nA group of these and actually a mid eighties has came from Europe\nTo America and settled in Chicago [noise] um they sit in the late Eighteen hundreds early Nineteen hundreds at at a hospital they they started in I'm In\nSt Louis and this is a hospital where in in Nineteen forty nine Nineteen fifty the actress place so a brother John Grider at the time was he was a a Nineteen year old nurse I'm twenty year old nurse\nAnd a um a we also a month at the time and he was involved with the the actress and so in two thousand eight\nUm I was just sharing weather to be a a month but whether it'd be an election brother and a during that time I met brother John Grider and I were given permission since he was the\nUh I was a nurse and and so is he so he you know talk very comfortable with me and um because he was the last brother that was alive\nUm who is at the actresses and I was given permission 'em by the you know\nPowers that be to to interview him so I did I um I just had this little camera I kinda had to put it to the side because he was very nervous she just say sixty is about ... you know fifty fifty eight year about silence as Tom English and he was eighty nine and Ninety cents\nThan he is he died and really now there's nobody left alive\nThat was um there at the extra so so what you see is the only first hand experience\nUm and you know I I've I've tried when I was working in Las Vegas about a mile off the strip believe that I met a amateur if they do share who've tried it come out and and do a little stuffed in all that waste is um [noise] with this this video that I had and\nUh the day before he came out some very strange things happened to kill it buddy I ended up with ... and we just did that [laughter] so I have heard of other stories like this stuff starts happening\nThere was actually a there was a priest who was supposed to go on the show tonight or his name was father long ago and uh he had confirmed being a part of the show and then he said that he decided to back out because he was worried about the strange things you're talking you're speaking of\nWell I yeah I uh that brother he was a monkey in the market is brother Warren long ago um and he has basically\nUm he's the keeper of all of the books and everything and they were carrying down the hospital and I'm In the early Nineteen seventies um they they found the I'm up to a lot of papers that that were put in the arts highest\nAh for the elections others which is different archives and then what they had for the Jesuits at the time and a brother or a long ago as a keeper of that and um\nYeah I called him today to head if see if he if he would come on and he said he just he doesn't watch he didn't want to get involved with that at all\nIt and I mean I'm sure you know and and like with the interview did was brother Grider ah you know noticing him and his ah mannerisms he was talking about it at first you could see him shaking a heated appeared that he was terrified that he had to you know he's reiterated his driving you handled it quite well in the interview actually because you know for\nSo but the the interesting thing where he could several of the brothers were so affected by that that\nThey left um being a they went into a ploy to community but I didn't speak we'll we'll get we'll talk\nAbout this a march or recovery ever or where'd you go
