spearheading the effort to have the Seventy five stone steps where the where are the priest threw himself down the steps and killed himself in The Exorcist kind of a creepy a landmark they want to having George to I think it should be a landmark it's kind of an interesting in fact while I was in Washington DC I plum forgot\nAbout seeing the steps when I was in Washington DC I mean now we have enough time I mean we were walking most of Washington DC is walking at the ... part it's like um\nYou know I was seeing you could drive the White House you drive to Washington minute we parked at the Washington Monument we walked all the way over\nTo the south side of the White House\n\nAnd we were there when the angle of Merkel just happened to be in town and so ah we were kind of I'm dealing with security at the time\nAnd so it slowed down our process than is getting around and do things and so I didn't get a chance to see those steps but um they certainly are creepy and they want to make him a landmark so certainly um you know we were on it [laughter] I mean Halloween and all we do we try to give you the best we can I mean it's time of ... it's basically the time of year\nWhere we find another excuse to party although I've got all my partying out on the twenty seven kids done costumes of course ah\nI was really excited when gene sent me a picture of Liam he is a he addressed as tomato head from Fort Night he's got the mask and everything's got pizza suit it's it's just really cool I saw his picture\nAnd uh yeah tomato head from Port night and um for those of you that um have makers that come to your door for candy that's another thing that a Halloween is all about it's certainly a tradition that has a\nI don't know Halloween is sending some mixed messages this year and what I mean by that is is I don't know if you've heard of this petition\nBut parents want to petition that Halloween be the the last Saturday of every October\nInstead of the thirty first asked me last Saturday in October and what's interesting about that is is that I I think people that do that people are saying that\nYou know don't know that Halloween has traditions that are well Steve better you know the data all the way back to you know the sixteen hundreds\nAnd Halloween the course of the day before all saints day or the deal is one of those the day of the saints day of the dead and so it's kinda like a tradition that the night before uh we pay respects to the dead the dead walked the earth and we pay attention to\nNot only the spirit world but also some of the darker Dennis ... of the spirit world we we um we make jacko letters to ward off evil spirits but ah the evil spirits\nYou know they pass over our houses if we do it we're supposed to that's what trick or treaters it's supposed to be it's supposed to be the evil spirits if you don't give them treats they do tricks and that's why it's called trick or treating\nThis year I just think that there were a lot of mixed messages being sent and it it seemed to you know\nWe're living in times were where there's this\nDevil does your hiding in every discussion dealing with politics and religion\nMiniature in particular I I had a well I really late heavy on the devil is aspects of the holiday because from a social studies perspective\nI think we've reached their time in history where we are definitely in the shadow what can we label be gotten anti Christ\nMeaning that you know even though people may not be able to identify the anti Christ or\nThe bits that will bear humans in heat right now let's just put it this way I mean I I don't mean to mince words but it just seems to me the dog that birth the anti Christ and certainly in heat right now and and people are just waiting for this to having\nA legend of the darkest one at all which is the anti Christ that came out of a desire\nTo better understand the last judgment and the science specifically those that Harold the arrival of loose tyrannical figure this this anti ... we're told that to be vigilant we watching the science we're told in the Bible watched the signs\nAnd they may warned of a coming of the end days watch the science they may be the warning the coming of the anti Christ the coming of the of\nThe apostrophe\nOr many men fall to to the ills of evil and scripture and like ... commentary and never fully addresses a exactly who\n[noise] who is figure is who who would proceed the coming of Jesus I mean it's really an anomaly and everyone who has a particular celebrity or politician they hate will often choose them to be the anti Christ especially the Irish have there\nBeen rolling the dice and say my bets on this guy by bets on this got my bets on Trump my bets on you know and you just go down the list I remember when bronco bottom was president many people thought that he was the anti Christ\nBut\nI I Would say that this study or\nRevelation of a modern anti Christ is a truly hard sell for most people mainly because in a secular world and we're we are and and you know them the anti Christ is simply a marketing term it's a it's a buzz word for\nFor Christians who see that they are being persecuted in their faith is being destroyed by any number of groups and therefore\nWe can say the devil is in them the devil's in them any meaning mighty mow the devil's in you the devil is this group the devil is back group the devil is the right the devils the lab the devils everywhere\nDon't you know this the devil is everywhere and this leads to not conspiracy theory but the idea that a conspiracy exist a darker conspiracy exist but is here to bring down mankind\n\nAnd so when you look and conspiracy history you have to take into account biblical history has well this is something I mean I I think this gets confused sometimes when people say well when you're thinking of America you gotta figure the Christian values as America stands on well what it is is you need to look at the Christian conspiracy\nOr the conspiracy against Christianity because here we have this this you know this all out in the battle against people\nIn America we're fighting against the I mean and when you're looking conspiracy history\nIt all has its roots in biblical over ... ritual as world events are not simply circumstantial\n\nBut they are the result of an organized campaign by an elite group of unseen in widely unknown world leaders\nAnd of course we pointed out that they have beliefs and agents symbolism\nSecret suicidal a cold is a mineral magic and that affects us any it's not about what I Believe it's about what they believe they're the ones in power and so if you say to me well you talked about his all time you must believe it it's not about how how I Believe it or what I Believe\nI just don't which there\nAnd I know that causal engineering and ritual magic effects everyone regardless of religious believes regardless of what you practice or what you say you're ... I mean these groups\nI mean these groups they um [noise]\nThey ah they answered other philosophy secretly and [noise]\nOutwardly they're using you know new wage that use biblical symbolism and they use it to exercise the absolute dictatorial control [noise]\nOver the world and they're trying to establish this new world order [noise]\nA little terrifying on the surface but as you read through it you begin to get a sense that technologists are beginning to question whether or not electronics are now to the devil\nWhile the devil is not named it well you know straight and has not occurred they don't say Satan or come out and said some devil or evil but technologists\nAre implying that they do not want their kids anywhere near this new technology\nThis article is called the dark consensus about screens in kids begins to emerge in Silicon valley Christian teacher a former social computing research you're married to a Facebook engineer has been secretly confessing that the devil seems to be doing is handy work with technology and the targets are your children\nSome of the people who built video programs without horrified by how many places the child can now ... video or watch a video I ...\nWorked as an executive assistant at Facebook in his ...

[noise]\nYou're losing the ground zero on this Halloween Night\n[noise]\nAnd I spend my intention lately for people to try and listen to their hearts to tell you about what's happening in the world there's so many people\nWere writers the wailing forget that everything we see is not always what appears to be [noise] people see [noise] certain\nThings that they do is they say well it's just it's isolated it's a false flag but see there's no telling\nYour telling how the numbers that there's no telling\nHow the days of the week at a what's happening with domino effects and copycat effects are going to be happening how this all affects our subconscious and when people see a tragedy\n\nMay see a tragedy veil interpreted in in many ways and when they hear about\nYou know somebody like Whitey Bolger being killed\nYou know they interpret that in many ways when they hear about 'em\nYou know when when we cheer on the deaths of a you know others you know and then we don't think George show that there's a real story within the story the media gives us the very thought of even I'm saying that you know being careless or at least having no\n[laughter] no reason to continue to be nice I mean this is something that I think is is it violates\nWhat we believe deep down to our core yet we do things that you know are hard to tell us or wrong we do I mean if people could see how their reactions behaviors and ... and they begin to see how they change like hatched depending on the guy and they'd be embarrassed that how gullible\nWe can be I mean when he was reactor crisis in fear more than any other emotion that's the truth angers destructive sadness slows down the character fear that works a lot of cases\nI always see the fear is a good motivator to graveyard if you were to be we're in a

the exercises [noise] above you or minutes ago about how that's the number one\nHorror film and the reason why it's the number one horror films because what he\nDoes is it\nExploits what it's called the invisible indefinable enemy it's an enemy that\nComes from a place that we wouldn't expect it and it winds up attaching itself to the innocent oh it comes from either hell or comes from a dimension that we're not aware of it arrives because of temple shifts or disturbances and we started seeing that there is a war\nWhether it be psychological or a true spiritual war\nWhere he ... with the war is is is between mankind and possibly lead you to demons that are hell bent on establishing called the followers were being fed movies that appear to impart\nThis fact rather than fantasy\nAnd so now we start seeing that non fiction or the or the fiction becomes non fiction and you know this is where I become a born again dispensation or is this\nIs where I become a you know a man who focuses on his guitar allergy because it's thrown into literature movies so much\nI mean many believe these movies have been a a a detriment to the faith because well much of what he's shown a written in these books or are these movies put these movies are not based on any scripture Kennedy's doctrine and that\nYou know that that that the scene and and uh it's actually absorb so much of the stuff that was it's been written about the end of the world as much as ... has been written about the anti Christ performed or shown\nCan be considered heresy\nI mean many movies and many uh stories around Halloween take liberties with\nPassages of scripture and with interpretations of apocalyptic themes I mean you can take a look at Nostradamus for example know Saddam's has been bastard die so much who knows what\nYou know does do damage to teach it gets any more I remember back in the seventies they can you remember people would always say look what know Saddam is out to say look what no and I don't I barely hear a beep about Nostradamus now people are now back to the book of Daniel people are now back to the book of the apocalypse the revelation\nPeople want to read apocryphal books but try to determine what the future hold some guy called me last night said that he started reading uh Anton the basic kinda books his Bible ... and that's what I mean look what ever the future is\nThe echo which thunder is rumbling now into the president it's on it's it's an ominous future and it's causing this it it just causing us to think that the end times are approaching into some you know we hear those trumpet in this guys you know the the ones that make the trumping noises\nAnd we hear those were wondering ... I Wonder if that's something we should be paying attention to our does the trumpet\nDinner blue and by the angels and we just kind of ride them off of something else science tries to explain the in reality the are the trumpets being blown [noise] I mean [noise]\nWhen you're looking at the blurring of events in our reality and the exploitation of science and religion and everything else it's always making us wonder [noise]\nIf we're really now in the midst\nOf in times reality or in a sense of hyper awareness because of how we been\nDesensitized or maybe even brainwashed with Hollywood and\nThen maybe you know people speaking of his stuff I mean when you're reading about how the Vatican has a you know they\nThey focus their attention on extraterrestrial research and then he hired a group of a whole squad or a whole army of exercise is [noise] you know and and when they're telescope looking at the sky is called Lou supper and you hear all of these you know the these references to\nLose supper and the devil and the anti Christ you tend to wonder just who's in charge you tend to wonder if you are are not paying attention you should pay attention to what's happening [noise]\nThis Halloween Night we focus on the future we focus on what we're feeling now when the president and how we are hearing the rumble of a future that his arm and his waiting for us\nAnd we may see changes in a very short time from now\nWho should pay attention to the signs and the wonders [noise]\nAn open up the phones were discussion and I\nBelieve six seven three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis using ground zero and moving back\n\nMethod ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were a business degree that further your career and gave you access to world renowned faculty\nLeaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text prepare to seven nine six four or five\nThat's P. R. E. P. A. R. E.\nOr something to say that was social media and the lack of a faithful to keep the trust of the youth the devil looks like it inviting dark father\nAnd speaking of the devil tonight we have the albums rex with us he um this is probably is a I don't know maybe his third or fourth Halloween with us sometimes we bring them in on Halloween the albums rex work on the ground zero place cry for having me on it now I use\nTo introduce you is the what do you call the magic or a bad just drove the church of Satan I was a magistrate in the church\nSo you're a manager of the church said now you've created the carrier the chaos in period yeah I have my own my own order now ... now what kind of order is it as they see a six eight and a shorter is it a witch order wizard order what kind of magic quarter is\nThe case I'm hearing is the most advanced black magical order in the world and essentially we see the prince of darkness as a a ... and being at a doesn't exist inside of physical space time is outside of that is not involved\nUm and does not center around the idea of worship but that to this being can actually be contacted through a actions involving um the highest forms of black magic\nAnd uh we see this being something that we can learn from directly because we can become like it it's the our position is to become God like beans\nOr in a\nIn the elation of this first foreign principle which is responsible for all things in life in the cosmos\nSo we're talking about a dark figure that you have this contract with well it's on it's dark as it's ... it's not too late and right it's not safe to\nSay and then in of itself is a\nIs a a a kind of a dumbed down I'm a\nIdea of this super consciousness inside of physical space time it's a and this guy stiff 'em rebellion and\nA a decadence and I'm a hedonism but uh the ultimate elevated form of this is a stoic looser furry and form\nWhich is where we are\nAre actively involved in so\nI'm forever action as an opposite and equal reaction so as you see manifestations of ah forms going to a a higher spiritual forum or as a decision to to forcefully moved the intellect and the psych through some physical space toward a higher\nUh form you're going to the replica ripples in in its back wash that are going to manifest themselves as decadence and degenerate but we're also living inside of the cyclic nature of the Kelly yoga\nWhich is a an understanding of cyclic time in this position that's happening right now is the degenerate\nI'm a self oriented\nUm cosmological construct within the human physical ... of action and form that is at its lowest uh a continuum it's it's the worst possible position we can actually live in so you're going to see this like all across the board politics\nPhilosophy art music\nUm you know a cultures et cetera\nIs this something that the the chaos cast some very him do they relish this or were they like to see a higher form of been lightened meant there would be more refined satanism\nRunny absolutely ... absolutely no interest in what happens to the rest of the world\nNo interest at all no we're we're we're we're Paul bearers of western civilization were just watching it happened the rest of us are just moving toward something that's a continually outside of that\nSo you're waiting for all of us to destroy each other than you guys moving and basically we'd be you\nKnow we're not even interested in in in the earth we're interested in transcending me on even that position singer and sending one of them are really unhappy about is the fact that there are so much a destruction of the beauty of this planet and a lot of that manifested in things such as an animal abused child abuse is I think we think this kind of thing is really a\nA really horrific actually animal is even worse as far as working or because of the true\nI'm a a\nHolders of the of the planet you know they were here before we were and we've come a long we've like eradicated or\nTheir land um\nOr their position in the world you know they're they're sent their civil rights to live so well actually I don't really like to live well it is is that the you know we've we've completely overrun all of that and I just think that there should be some kind of vengeful action against that type of\nThing but it will actually give animals using child ... oh yeah absolutely um you know it's interesting because I said that statement earlier I said satanism now it's harder to find black magically well yeah I mean you will for more you are you talking about ... black magic\nBut I'm Talking about how now what the definition of what satanism is it's not easy I remember when I first met you and I talked over a back when you were part of the C O s I uh I I was trying to put a a handle on what's Satan is believed or at least the way in St Louis believed\nAnd uh before it wasn't easy to find satanism it's getting even more difficult to divide said that the doctor said that the one seat business anymore because\nWe go for like a like I said we go for the most ridiculous definitions to the more psychotic definitions of what it is and I was just curious if this why you left the church is safe\nYou know I'm ... satanism which is the ... a a fairly universally and philosophically recognized as the first manifestation of a true a church and devoted to satanism too I'm an acknowledgement of the devil\nI'm as a a as a symbol for um a form of personal internal evolution and that each and every man and woman is their own satanic deity moving to try and become something greater than what they are\nUm there's within the like the last Twenty years there has been literature that has flooded a literal a cottage industry of books that have come out claiming to have been some type of\nOf former age old undiscovered\nUm clandestine form of a of the satanic worship that um that you can tap into and that's just not true I'm a scholar of black magic in satanism and I've researched it and it's\nIt's either a I'm highly embellished\nIdeas around a satanic Didi or be blatantly meal\nOr manifestations created by\nPeople who are who are betting that you don't know anything more about it than they do well\nMost people and I remember when I first uh was interviewing you there are a lot of people by then I thought what you say they were saying well we identify with what rex who say we we we'd been and are either of them and saying well I find uncomfortable is I find it uncover all that I'm agreeing with what he said because of\nYour position in the church has said now you have your own group of like magic magicians and\nI mean your message really hasn't changed all that much only that you seem to be more or less like you said Paul bearers to the fall of western civilization meaning you're standing there watching it all the collapse around you and then you'll be cleaning up and basically we won't be\nCleaning up are escaping it altogether I when I say Paul bears I'm just saying\nThat you know I I Am I'm looking at what's happening and I'm I'm recording it but I'm not part of it\nUm the the chaos and pyramids a transcendent order when we say transcend that we're talking about the ultimate most ah virile form of spiritual um\nA a a destiny and a descent so\nI'm the only way that's going to actually happen is to be able to remove oneself from the human equation altogether right so um because we see that this this ultimate deity form which actually cannot in any way be defined because she doesn't exist inside of physical space I so if\nWe can talk about or tried to use language you weren't trying to use formula mathematics whatever try described you can't really do that was difficult\nIt's difficult to actually quantify and I've said this before when I have arguments or aliens and beam and they said we'll demons are mainly a spiritual entity to not be quantified it's not touch with some tangible\nIt's something that enters in and wants to have you [noise] well even if he's not ... if even if not physical it's got a a an energy sickness or it can be measured and therefore it's a it's a physical made sure that what has existing inside of physical space jobless rex with us tonight on ground zero [noise]\nChaos him period is the group that he represents\n[laughter]\n[noise] you after twelve chapters a day every
