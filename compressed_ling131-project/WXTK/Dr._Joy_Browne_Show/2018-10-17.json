D. C. reported that a child died\nFrom this disorder and since officials have been able to or they haven't been able to determine how the disease spreads\nThey're starting to count suspected cases as well as confirmed to better anticipate increases over the coming months so uh I can tell you know it's too early\nTo know whether the total of twenty people surpass those the previous years but the data is showing a substantially larger number than in previous months this year\nSo\nAnd and the bad thing is there's no treatment for it\nLong term outcomes or a crap shoot\nAnd what happens is whatever this is you know and we were talking about things like equal and several lightest we're talking about all these other disorders that are certainly affect the brain and the nervous system this affects the nervous system\nEspecially with a specifically the spinal cord\nNeurological conditions like you'd have a variety of causes such as viruses environmental toxins or genetic disorders among the case is under investigation\n\nAre basically there are five reported to the Maryland health officials in recent weeks a health department spokesman said that Maryland's first case was reported September twenty first known cases have been reporting Virginia or the district this year\nBut there were three confirmed cases in Virginia and twenty sixteen and that's what health department officials upset now we know that medical science is continually making rapid advances we've got new medications red treatments all these things are developed\nAnd they're introducing a rapid pace our water supply and demand I often come to play the possibility\n\nThat pharmaceutical companies can cut corners and they get very sloppy\n\nNow we're always assured that the ... the FDA or buy health organizations that our system for screening\nUh is superior than most are are drug screening as superior than most are vaccine screenings are superior than most but now could be argued that I after Jay consequences are not necessarily the problem with a doctor but it may just be the the manufacture of these medications or\nWhatever it is re introduced into the system we're looking at a toxic environment of drugs are toxic environment vaccines kids are reactor them in various ways I don't think\nThe CDC or the FDR anyone would come forward and say that perhaps a vaccine caused this\nOr some other drug I mean we know our biological systems are constantly evolving\nAnd we go by scientific hypothesis we also surmise that disease causing organisms are evolving too\n\nAnd so this raises a lot of questions and a lot of eyebrows about whether or not treatments in pills they kill the ills are killing the patient or in this case\nCourting and Tara viruses that cannot be altered\nAnd like I you know we look at biological systems all biological systems ... disease causing organisms and\nAnd of course the victims of people they all the way they evolve and they adapt sometimes they evolve and adapt or certain diseases don't bother them anymore they run its course it's kind of like a virus that runs its course that doesn't tell you it it goes dormant for a while and that comes back with a vengeance but right now\nWe need to start understanding the evolution of what is happening and how can make a big difference\nIn how we treat disease I mean\nThe evolution of disease causing organisms they outpaced our ability to invent new treatments and it may even al ... or ability to ease pain and suffering\n\nAnd I can tell you that it it appears\n\nThe failures of the passive given wait for the most unexpected successes and some of those unexpected rises or rate\nHim disease and biologically altered diseases as well\n\nNew problems of course and ribs in and out of this new paralyzing disease is harming our children and we know the accidents related to Karen medication in particular multiplied\n\nAnd we begin to worry about health care and health care professional we we hear about drug induced I after Jenike artifacts\n\nWe hear about adverse effects or even adverse drug events we hear about adverse effects from vaccines and the minute you bring this up somebody says I didn't know you were to anti bacterial they start ridiculing you\n\nBut just think about all the accidents at all the mistakes that have been made\nWhen the pharmaceutical companies don't evolved with people and don't have all with the ... would be a diseases that are coming of or now either we can say that this is all being plan\n\nWe can say that it's all being done for the call Ian aspects and for the for the eliminating the flock but\n\nYou're not helpless to fight it you're not helpless to stop it you're not helpless to uh do do do things to make yourself better\n\nAnd and so we have available many things\nThat they can put us uh in in a situation where we can build our immune systems we can build we can build all sorts of things that we just know\nThe right things to eat the right things to do is writes supplements to take the right drugs\nI mean I I worry now because uh I heard before\nWe were hearing about the the biological weapons we're hearing about the biological attacks we were hearing about\nMosquitoes actually infecting people and giving them you know equine except for white is or giving them some sort of a eastern equine suffer why it is for some other a disease that affects the spinal cord with a brain or hemorrhaging or what have you and I don't think anybody is is pushing the pandemic button yet\nThat it's going to surpass the previous years\nSo\nKeep in mind this ... this is a rare condition it's affecting less than one in you know one in a million people okay so I mean it's as a parent myself I worry for much my child or I worked for my step son it's dramatic disease and health\nOfficials want to raise awareness about the symptoms to ensure parents seek medical care immediately of their children's ... sudden onset of weakness in their arms and legs\nA\nBit ashamed that polio is not the cause of it because of the CDC has tested every single stool specimens from patients and none of tested positive for polio\nUm\nWest Nile virus is not causing this way of a rule that ruled out west Nile\nUm\nBut the ... some virus that starts out as a respiratory illness so we have this respiratory illnesses sets in so it's like having the flu and then suddenly you start noticing that your children cannot control their arms and legs\n\nAnd so they don't have a pathogen identified yet it's consistently being detected in patients spinal fluid with regard to FM\n\nSo it all goes back to the same old same old idea of washing the hands staying up\nTo a you know you just basically wash their hands using insect repellent is this is the thing that's interesting they were saying you must in order to prevent this we we suggest that you use mosquito repellent\nSo what does that tell you [laughter] where where does that tell you it tells you that this is this is probably being spread by mosquitoes but everything that we said we'd be responsible for a biological attack on the country or one of the very few things will be used for a again a function exercise would be mosquitoes a bill\nGates released mosquitoes one time in a in a meeting that he had a Ted Talk to demonstrate how mosquitoes are more dangerous than sharks\nAnd so once again it's the idea that\nYou know we're we're in the middle of it evolving if it's the\nBalding package it into the balding diseases have all being a evolving drugs and and having to having to prevent things but we have to have well I called prophylactic for protection\nWhat you mean to protect us from the beginning of protect your children from the beginning from what it is it's coming and it's just something that most certainly wouldn't want your children to go through [noise]\nTripoli fix every three thirty seven hundred that trouble eat six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nAre we watching the evolution of diseases\nAnd is the pharmaceutical companies are are the pharmaceutical companies evolving with those diseases\nI don't believe they are\nI think that they are at a loss for a lot of things eighty thousand people dead from the flu last year I think is proof of bad trouble eat six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\n\nGoing according to the u._s. public helps us public drew a CD or your physician about a flu vaccine for ... years some\n\n[laughter]\n... Frank record for hospitalization [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nWhy why\nWhy why I laughed\nShot here for\n\nAnd to drink plenty of like we are in\nI'm quite Lewis your let's say the ground zero that it was called an actual belief six seven three thirty seven hundred the pharmaceutical companies are not keeping up with the evolution of diseases and they're not keeping up\nWith pain and how pain is evolving as well and so what they've done is teaming up with advertising agencies they're courting public service announcements and they're and they're basically pushing certain\nAttitudes ideas about vaccines and drugs now selling that you you know eat it's trying to outsell trying to sell your ability to heal yourself and the reason why is because I think it's weird speculated last year\n... bio labs have created these new super blocked superbug super diseases evolve into something else we have a respiratory viruses out turning adjoining Terrell virus we have a flu virus that turns into a pneumonia that kills people\n\n\nAnd so everyone working in the pharmaceutical industry cannot help but notice that it's undergoing a vigorous\nEvolution we're going through an evolutionary period that only for health but for the pharmaceutical companies\nAnd much has been written about how you do pharmaceutical companies will need to change in how they are offering the public or ineffective drugs ineffective vaccines in effect the ineffective\nI after Jenike artifacts basically with a cure kills you know CBO affects instead of placebo which do see but what's no benefit at all\nAnd show which is why I I think it's important we should talk about this\nWe should bring this up because I I think that the word of warning should go out\n\nAnd if you I mean if you have a if you have a compromised immune system\nI Would say use your judgment and and and perhaps use your better judgment maybe get a flu vaccine I I'm not sure I don't think a flu vaccine is for everyone but after what I've read about what happened last year and how people who got the flu vaccine eventually had a flu that evolved into something else\nI'd be really really really suspicious of this because you can't sue the pharmaceutical\nCompany rock Obama put that into law does Baxter International course was one of his major contributors and back to international courts makes the flu vaccine several other vaccines that of course we're being pimped and pushed on the American people for the longest time\n\nNow here we are with everything they tell us get your vaccine get just get ... get busy and nothing's working you none of our children are now getting ... viruses non polio internal viruses where they first start out as a respiratory illness and then they're paralyzed\nSame thing with the ... as you start getting assuming of sickness and your paralyzed who to gain a function exercises where people are getting rice in sent to them\nWhere they ended up getting sick and and they ended up uh you know it's like\nWe're in the middle of this right now we don't even realize it's happening but the CDC says well this is ...\nWe don't know what to do but will tell you about to watch your kids to make sure they don't take up the symptoms and get them an owned by the way the way to prevent it put on something put on some sort of a mosquito repellent so they don't get bitten by mosquitoes\nThat just speak volumes to everybody shouldn't it especially when we talked about this before and how it's being done\n\nThe mainstream it's not going to report this to you they're just not\nI mean they'll report it probably eventually but then I can report or like we're reporting it and they haven't been following it since we've been following the Kleenex exercise from the beginning to what has been happening slowly but surely the game to function exercise viewed everybody's sick or to get in a certain group of people sick\nAnd the idea that using DNA from these twenty three Indian ancestry is to sell to places like GlaxoSmithKline Pfizer\nSo they can use DNA to basically zero in on certain DNA types of diseases\nAnd treatments they have to do this because the evolutionary process of pain and suffering is evolving out of their hand and the and the CDC and all these other groups they can't keep up\nBy like last year's flu eighty thousand people dead and we were discussing how he just seemed to me this is a flu that was going around was evolving mutating into something a lot worse than respiratory illness that it was hard to recover from hard to breathe that was it was pneumonia literally\nWill take a look at the mercy of the most of the book is called\nThe super bug it is the super bug that there are no antibiotics that will will a deterrent my sister got worse at a VA hospital she works for a Pfizer pharmaceuticals she's worked for Thirty years\nShe was at a um a a VA hospital in Alabama of course it's hot it's moist it's humid it's is screaming or\nShe is the bathroom and a VA hospital in on the back of a little way she got ... so she's had three operations she's had horrible oils of antibiotics\nYou can't get rid of mercy mercy as a super bugs if there is zero antibiotics it will kill it\nIt's it's in your system it can go into remission but you'll always have it it's there\nAnd I tell you there was a book that everybody out there ought to go and look look up\nAnd it was um Marion McKinney Marion mechanic and uh she was the author was called uh the Fatal Menace of MRSA the super bug but that book people need to be looking at it because that Mercer you'll get when you go to\nThe hospital if you're not careful [noise] I don't care how clean you are it will attack you and it is in the hospital is\nYes it is in a uncle dog I thank you and hope you get better and my prayers go out to everybody up they're affected by the hurricane\nYou know we love you on the east coast everybody by\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred ... fix every three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis do is to be ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\n[laughter] online banks for closing on how they even have documents and I signed for

R. E. P. A. R. E. to seven nine six four or five\nSlowly but surely she was like all biological systems oh disease causing organisms victims evolved it happens that's how it is and we noticed is with the ah the change in the flue last year or the flu mutated into something you know like I'm a pneumonia some guy\nOff\nLook back at some of the medications that have been used by the public that have led to a lot of bad effects that from what am I a situation in the Nineteen sixties I Believe was one of the perfect example of a sedative\nIt was anti ... medication medication pregnant women were taking in pregnant women who use the drug cause serious congenital Mao formations and their babies\nNow today they're still drugs that are on the shelves right now than when misused or when they're taken responsibly can cause accidents and you can get anything from the justice intolerance to dying and that's why they call it I have to ... artifacts\nAnd physical dependence can happen with the chronic use of any drug including many prescription drugs he would have taken his instructed physical dependence in of itself is not constitute addiction but often accompanies addiction\nAnd it stinks in many people cannot or discern the distinction it's difficult to discern\nParticularly prescribe pain medication switch the need for increasing do just dosages actually represents tolerance or worst thing underlying problem as opposed to the beginning of abuse or addiction I've always learned\nAs a general rule that if you're taking a pill to kill the pain you're dependent if you're taking a pill after the pain is gone you're addicted\nBut if you're taking your bills was directed in the paper says your body has gotten used to them overtime or the worst case scenario would be that the drug companies are doing the equivalent of watering down the alcohol and I've always talked about that as well be advocacy\nOf of a pain medications I Believe the yo yo wing of the doping mean is what is causing the opioid crisis and so what we're getting is adverse effects for getting opposite expectations outcomes it becomes a no CBO effect\nSo called pandemic of opiate overuse may be seen as a as a no see the ... no CBO effect itself tonight and I'm going to be the spoiler 'cause I don't really give a damn about the TV show it's called ah the Connors\nAre used to be Roseanne on ABC Roseanne it said that in the show they were going to kill her off\nThere were to kill her off the program I'm with an opioid overdose they did it they actually killed or off\nFrom an opioid overdose everybody's that how does how do they know how do they know they're trying to cover up the fact that she's spoiled at for everybody weeks ago and I basically had said well if you're following the Roseanne program she was actually are in need of a knee surgery and the show\nAnd then she'd been taking pain pills from friends and others and having a stash around the house so it was a given\nThat they would kill her off by giving her an opioid overdose\nAnd see this is the thing that bothers me about the opioid the opioid problem in the opioid overdose in and out the opioid overdose scares that are giving everybody you and that is if you are addicted or if you overdose on pain medications it's a moral failing\nPeople will have you believe it's a moral failing the propaganda will have you believe that you're ... you're an addict\nWhen you're not\nAnd so the killing off of Roseanne with an opioid overdose in my opinion is exactly what they were expecting is exactly what was going to happen\nAnd uh and that's why it was done so tonight I wanted to bring on a friend of mine who I've I'm I'm not sure we haven't had him on a long time\nBeen Fuchs and he's a registered pharmacist because you're nutritionist and cosmetic chemist and has been\nCompounding custom medication formulating nutritional and skin care products and consulting with doctors and patients who graduated from UC University of Colorado School of pharmacy in Nineteen eighty six distributions recognizes nationally for his work\nThe on air pharmacist nutritious hosted the bright side radio program Ben few talking to ground zero\nHey try and talk to you yeah I Love that doing this show because you are so darn intelligent Klein thanks you [laughter] I ...\nI really appreciate it and so so bad and I mean what is it with a propaganda but when the world today making people who are using pills for paying give it get making them a treating them like moral a pariah I that's what they did when Roseanne denied they actually killed her off the TV show\nA said she had opioid addiction and she died of an opioid overdose boy what why are they doing off\nHer twenty six for you I answer a fool according to his father\nYou know people are so silly ... it's just ridiculous how we had this idea\nThat uh we're okay to judge people or whatever their behaviors are OK to captains versions on others or whatever their behavior is acting human body is hardwired to be addicted to substances as hard wired specially it'd be addicted to substances that are already inherent in it and that's what opiates are\nThey are analogs of bio chemicals that are already in your brain so when you take an opiate say that you have you have a pain probably and you take opiates an opiate tell what all immediately happen is your ... your brain will down regulate\nThe production of its own in dodging opiates and you'll in Athens become efficient by taking artificial opiates you'll end up into the mission which we'll put you in an deficits date and if there's a there's a pill that are right in front of you and be almost impossible to reason\nNow I Know that I Know that we have a a sort of a psycho social context surrounding the patient Dr relationship the patient farm Mr pharmacist relationship\nBut yeah I I think people that tend to ignore the fact that you know right now if you're using opiates you you become pretty much a ... you become a dark and NPR why we're what's that or\nYour award you're awarded the state yeah you belong to say you belong to the medical model and that and they love that yeah well now what you're ... you're hooked on August ... you have to go to the doctor you have to go to the pharmacist even if it even if it means Dr pharmacist shopping\nYou ... your compels me to be a part of the model of the paradigm once you get on a city that once you get on the drug ... shut illegal drugs then by the way that people get that's how dealers and and a drug drug dealers gets you hooked on heroin\nWell and that's the truth out you know one of the thing I did a show one time about crocodile and it was interesting because ah I was talking about he was cheap heroin and that many people that look very attractive to use this cheap heroin\nAnd uh I was saying you know be aware of crooked deal because your kids may be using it and blah blah blah blah blah and boy did I have an education I had people calling me all over the country in their sixties and seventies\nSaying to me that they were addicted to heroin and that they are they're the ones that ... that the they worry about that the that uh they said you should be worried about grandma and grandpa\nWho have gotten their pain pills taken away from them\nAnd they have to resort to using heroin or they have to get heroin and they get like a really low dose of heroin but if they can make cheap crooked deal in their kitchen it'd be more than happy to do that get rid of their pain and the stories I heard were heartbreaking stories of like a guy called me and said I was in a motorcycle crash\nAnd I was in a lot of pain and the doctors gave me my medication and then one day they just decided we weren't gonna give it to me anymore\nAnd so I had to use heroin\nAnd I'm going wow you know and and I never thought because I always thought you know be where the kids taking drugs but no be where grandma and grandpa who aren't getting their pain medications because the doctors don't know how to treat the pain\nIt's a terrible situation it's absolutely terrible situation they as you our talking before a lot of it is based on the fact that we've created a society and we've created a culture that is conducive not not the physical damage the psychic pain to to X. essential pain and guess what opiates work on that too\nYou know it's not just work on physical pain they work on a spiritual pain on [laughter] and I said I Believe as a pharmacist that this is a really big part of her or\nAn addiction problem is we are in pain we are such a ... a culture that role for its its citizens for being alive or just citizens for participating in society we live in ... and just ... culture and our ... our nation's or just a symptom of it\nSo it it is is that there's something missing doesn't that doesn't give us a I I like to use this raid the doping means squirt if you will\nI caught reward Dylan e square is what when you get hit in the opening your brain does yes he like you won the lottery it activates the reward center in the brain and we are inherently designed by a chemically by our nature she had this this yet the feeling whatever we want in fact\nWe get the hippie healing when we reach for the door knob and open the door\nDo you call yourself a compound in a compounding\nYeah Tom hounding pharmacist is fine with that you actually makes medicine\nRight your typical part is you know that you are going to Kmart and Walmart or wherever you doing what we call in and farcical wasted you rightly refer to it counts poorer Lincoln stay and that's what really pharmacy and devolved to the\nPharmacy is really the art of making medicine is traditionally that's what the army yeah how how far I hate that restoring the art of

Spanish civil war maybe\nAfter the stash American War of ... are they a lot of Mexican started to come over here in the early part of the twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana in identified with Mexican immigrants than a this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nUh the government got his great idea to uh to uh to prohibit marijuana wall with alcohol and we really complain about marijuana nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made up they\nCreated the ... campaign around reefer madness this idea that you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now with a ... a call from ... to talk about all stop\nA car but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so that it was ... when they called the marijuana tax act which I don't know if you heard of that a\nTax act a ... put people for not declaring their marijuana\nAnd they put a tax on marijuana and if that didn't declare tried marijuana and taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... or what nations war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana legal and it's been a legal ever say but the fact of the matter is is that\nPeople have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our draw our jail are ill with people who are they are simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing\nAnd like you said earlier we created at least there's a police state around are around people\nAre just around people who simply want to get high whether it's through a marijuana our psychedelic or even with opiates why don't why is that we don't have a prohibition against alcohol we didn't get marijuana well I'll tell you\nThis is the thing that uh you know and and for me I guess it fits be apart from a lot of talk show hosts are most young conservative radio stations because\nI live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager a and of course one of the rights of passages that in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd uh when I did and it was a teenager I smoke it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times they never touched it again it was funny\nIs that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I don't think it's good for my body to do this\nThen I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer it became a so difficult\nTo actually a deal with a lot at

completely out of character for him to suggest to me\nThat I should try candidates and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know so the idea ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about uh things like a candidate is that they ah let them use CBD Oil Somalian does it as an ointment on their joints\nAnd ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given a two and brownies form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a ... a a a a ... an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that
