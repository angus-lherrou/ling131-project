China down without giving them a chance I mean this was normal America All right and we were living in the normal ... America without a conspiracy in the background trying to bring it down we would be just coming out of the honeymoon with President Trump\nYou know there's ... there is a honeymoon right there was a honeymoon for Obama the honeymoon for Bush\nAnd usually I talk about the honeymoon so yeah the honeymoon will be great you know we have a great time of president you know everything's cool everything's great\nAnd then of course we started hating them after a few years so this way it's supposed to be but no we hate him now we've have it even from the beginning we hate him or you know maybe it'll turn maybe eventually you'll do something oh loving everybody in the country of Donald Trump as a savior he's ... he's got he's wonderful\n[noise] who knows I I just don't see how this is going to go anywhere but bad because like I said\nI'm I mean last night I think it was pretty evident that I really needed to escape the reality of discord not only in my country but in my state here in Portland, Oregon where I live It's MORNING I woke up thinking about the speech the President Nixon gave it is not a member a he it was back in sixty nine\nI'm Nixon was speaking and he said mankind how'd he said he said some\nMankind I was reaching what magnificent provision for the moon but falling into Iraq is just court on our small a shocking to me um\nHe he he basically said that it was really unfortunate that we're living in times where are we reached the magnificent precision of going to the moon reaching out to what is above us but we fall into discord here on earth we tend to fight\nHere on earth but we're trying to go out and dismay and I I thought about that for a minute I thought that you know here we are\nGetting all kinds of messages from the sky mean technological\nNotes tech you know these these these things are looking for the ... there were Nineteen more fast radio burst last night the gym at Nineteen\nFast radio burst\nBut they collected in Australia that I mean that it just going up and up and up and up and up and these things are like flashing and they're going what they came right out and said and the guardian I was reading the guardian read another newspaper besides the guardian says something like alien fast radio ... now they're calling them alien fast radio birds are we talking about them in the United states\nNo no no no no it's other I'd rather read\nNews organizations outside the United states yes they're talking about it are we talking about yes we did last night we talked about it\n\nWe're getting all kinds of messages from the sky techno signatures beeps are getting all kinds of lights signals from what can be alien life alien civilizations and yet\nWe are now in the throes of civility crisis that could lead to a war footing between dividing factions across ideological lines in this country\nWe're not even taking the time to look up we're too busy looking down we're too busy looking right in front of our feet and thinking\nThat I hate that I hate it I hate you know I hate everything you're saying I hate it I hate it so we got going on right now it's all about hate all the anger you know\nWe all know what they're against but do we know what they're for no we don't because that's how we are note America we know what we don't like but we're not talking enough about what we do\nLike I like aliens I liked the fact that they're fighting these wonderful things in space right now but what I Do like when I hate is they're not talking about it enough on the news no they're not\n\nIn fact the truth about what is out there and the seriousness ... what is coming sounds even more outrageous\nBecause the corporate media will not touch the stories of shore experiencing a sort of self imposed cover up based on political interest in division\n\nYou want to know what's hard I'll tell you what's artsy for the past week gang each and every once in a while this happens in it but it's happening a lot more now for the past week\nI subscribe to a lot of coping services and I also you know but all of a fourteen Web sites they go to websites with a lot of paranormal stuff and what the things that request you know for my clippings sites you know for a living do send me ...\nThe things that request had been overtaken by that that I've got about\nPolitics it sucks okay\nMost clippings services news outlets to provide inspiration for many of the topics on my program have now been brought to the forefront and the topic of conspiracy\nOkay not a theory not conspiracy theory not a theory of conspiracy or a hypothesis but conspiracy\n\nOkay now I Hope I'm not confusing because conspiracy theory is a theory about\nA conspiracy meaning there is a there are groups that are conspiring to make something happen to the conspiring to cover up something\nOkay that's the theory you have no proof\nYou have circumstantial evidence of the theory but you don't have proof but see this is a conspiracy theory I'm Talking about it's the bonnet fide proven conspiracy being put forward by the world's leaders and of course our leaders\nWho have now decided that a lack of civility is the option for getting what they want\nAnd that is control\nOf the country\nWe are witnessing the collaborative process organized by conspirators to solidify a coordinated active insurrection in order to meet\nA political goal\nAmerica's politicians of both parties want to use the power of government to silence their enemies the sounds to folks\nSome of the university community seek to drive it from their campuses and an entire generation of Americans are being taught to free speech should be curtailed issues that make someone else feel\nUncomfortable\nOn the current trajectory our nation's dynamic marketplace of ideas will soon be replaced by either disengaged intellectual silos\nOr even a stagnant ideological conformity ... says the goal\nOr modulate the masses take away all that's uncomfortable all of it's inconvenient nothing\nNothing to make the mind reach out keep ...\nRigid thinking coming because the rigid thinking is what they want\nThey want us all to be ignorant they wanted to be\n[noise]\nThings are we so disastrous for our nation in the well being of our citizens [noise]\nThose are the votes so Donald Trump says there will be by there will be violence if the Republicans lose Hillary Clinton says no stability until we we're\nNot that doesn't\nSound like called the war I don't know what does okay\nI I I mean the New York post agreed with me yesterday and was most disconcerting is while the media will say that Trump's words are to be expected\nThey failed to expound upon the comment that Hillary Clinton made no one not even an interviewer stopped and asked her what she was saying could be considered reckless or fueling the fire there was already started consequences be damned\nA civil war has to happen in order to take over the Senate\nThat's what that's what I got from both of them\nFrom says violence if we lose Hillary Clinton says violence until we win\nNow what should we do what should we do how are we supposed to vote either way we're screwed right he this is a quagmire\nThis this this is a quagmire this\nWe are we have two leaders okay\nAnd and the other quite as a leader I don't care what you say she's the leader of a group of people ... she's the leader of the resistance\nOK she says we will not be civil\nUntil we when Trump says if you when they are the the the Republicans won't be so\n... we're at war with ourselves and the mob namely those who have been attacking politicians namely those who wouldn't you know creating the robe roadblocks okay at\nThose who have been pounding on the doors of Congress during the cabin on hearing\nAll of this mob mentality is is right now being contained but one day it won't be contained okay and one day the mob will rule if the ... ruling ... a ... already you have two people that should know better\nBecause what they're doing now is they're meddling in our own\nElection meddling OK Hillary Clinton is meddling Donald Trump is meddling they're both meddling and they're giving threats of violence if it doesn't go their way\nThis is what is terrifying okay this is why I say civil war\nYou can convince me otherwise I been in the middle of if I see it I feel it and it's not going to the people aren't going to die yet there's no charging for your guns none of that [noise]\nThese are the words that start War Within countries which are believed fix every three thirty seven hundred that's AAA except for three thirty seven hundred [noise] I'm like Louis you're listening to ground zero we'll be back [noise]\n\n\n\nI'm\nFaster than ever before making a difference in the way we live our lives\nAnd then we got off of getting when the\nBrain lane at the front line up the way we think of my own way and we\nHaven't\n\n[laughter]\n\nWe [laughter]\n\nGetting where it all over the United states my show is being blocked in strategic moment\n\nGoing\n\nWant to [laughter]\nQuite Louis you're listening to ground zero of getting word is suffering really bizarre happening right now my show\nIs being jammed in places all over the country right now I'm someone who's trying to jam the message valid\n... if you're getting that you're getting a lot of people sending me a message to say they're getting jammed the shows being jammed all over the country so if you're in the market I got one from Santa Rosa another one from New York\nUh let's see somebody else\nIs saying that the streaming undefeated just gone nuts something's going on guys so race yourself are you gonna do Ronnie you're getting reports people calling yeah runs getting reports to were being jammed

I'm touching a nerve OK guys so I'm gonna try and get through the show tonight and uh oh okay we're okay in Rhode Island at least we know are okay in Rhode Island or we can't Peoria\nI don't know I just saying that yeah [laughter]\nSo we're going to get your didn't keep doing the show until they shut us down okay so uh this is a lot of fun to that I had a feeling that if\nI were to go here and I was going to say this is not a conspiracy that there would be a little bit of a response\nThe response okay okay\nSo we're getting word that does somebody absolute gouging right now and also talks reminds coaching right now so if you're getting the coaches and you're getting the problems you're not alone uh it's happening and we got word that we don't know where it's coming from\n... [noise] so I'm going to try in a you know\nI used to get really mad when this happens but now I'm beginning to laugh because I'm beginning to see\nYou know just how this is done and you know if you try to be neutral somebody is is suspecting that you're either one way or the other way and they don't like it\nThey don't like you making the arguments and and and saying look guys the arguments cut deep both ways and we can cut our throats as Americans we don't pay attention of it\nI mean the media says and they've been they've been harping on Donald Trump saying that\nIf the Republicans lose in November there will be violence all I've been hearing violence violence violence now\nSo Hillary Clinton sits down to ... ... and and uh\nAnd this is this is what she said that now I Want to point out that this is the question and the answer and Christiana when she says to Hillary she mentions a few things that really crack me up one I talk about history rhyming okay remember I talked about that first dark history rhyming she says\nWe are seeing a dark mirror of a vast\nRight wing conspiracy or a bath left wing conspiracy she says she said the Kellyanne Conway she said she said that there is a vast\nWing conspiracy mirroring Hillary what you said about a vast right wing conspiracy\nSo she's talking about history mirroring a rhyming like I said\nAnd then what you get is Hillary's response to listen to this\nCan Conway that that actually by the talks about this process and she said it ... left wing conspiracy it echoes what you said about when your husband was in the Senate by investigations back in the nineteenth of a white right wing conspiracy\nSocial your comment on that merit language and secondly\nAnyway even a ... thing 'cause I was speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America is try to get back to some civility and just try to make it even if we have pinnacle disagreements we're not going to war with each other we're not trying to destroy each other\nWell certainly I Would love to see a return to civility lessening Tijuana now there are working out our differences that is not the Republican Party that exist today and that is certainly not the administration that we have in power right now [noise] when the Republican Senate\nTo fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word not okay\nAgain dial pound to five zero and say the key word NATO\nMany vehicles today have oil life monitors that tell you when to change the oil my advice is don't wait hey folks um ten fellows the owner of the loop and mashed me I Would say the majority of our customers probably do exceed their intervals\n[laughter] sometimes a lot of it but you could be doing damage for preventive maintenance purposes oil changed much cheaper than having to make a costly right there should be living mashed be sixty ... twenty eight on the ... town line match dot ... dot com not just oil pens oil ...\nPutting money into your residence makes dollars and cents and with Frazier construction that dream home is only a phone call or email away from voting in a bay window or skyline to enlarging the kitchen to wedding and then last week\nThe possibilities are almost endless racers team is there from ... to a conclusion but it all begins with an appointment to Google Frasier construction mashed being and get started on your remodeled Frasier construction because how\nMatters at my ... twenty five thousand dollars to the IRS\nLisa was in a fight against an opponent that has no remorse\nUp to get a letter from the IRS ... I was actually making payments\nFor a hundred and fifty dollars a month [noise]\n... never getting up down up and talking a lot of employees\nThen she contacted heater Arnold that the officers have Cape and islands tax relief\nI Am so glad I actually called him to reach out\nAnd now the IRS has accepted a payment of\nLooks promising dollars [noise]\nThis is Peter Arnold Cape and islands tax relief you deal with me [noise]\nLocal professionals delivering peace of mind and tremendous results it's Cape and islands tax really\nIs I Walk up and do our ... I felt it was a new beginning for me\nFor a free consultation click Cape and islands tax relief dot com or phone by ... by three for nine nine five to news radio Ninety five WICK [noise]\n\n\nOr the response the Hillary Clinton talking about no civility was a number of flights for example the New York post newspapers saying civil war civil war civil war [noise]\nThe number of people going to the Internet saying oh it it feels like words civil war even or you know there were a lot of people\n[noise] James Woods a matter of fact the actor James Woods was tweeting actually got shadow banned for tweeting that if if if Hillary Clinton wants civil war will give him a civil war\nSo out whatever was shed you know and I talked about how I felt like we were in the middle of one number of them were threatening and Hillary Clinton said well you know we're not going to be civil unless you know we take back what we have and Donald Trump says well if we lose there will be violence\nSo\nWhat is that going to do for America I mean what are you going to do about this that's the question I have is that you know and so you go to the Internet\nAnd you try to you know state where you want to stay on Facebook what is Facebook do well they go after eight hundred Web pages shut them down but you gotta do Facebook pages especially some that have\nA lot of power like a nation in distress it was the first online publication George ... President Trump um three point two million likes three million followers gone\nGone because of a what they were where they were saying back then of course ah reimburse ... seven hundred thousand followers attacked Trump referred to Republicans is cheating scum bags so a political rhetoric\nThey were saying it was done because they were ... I think what was going on is probably both of them had something to say about the civil war or the idea of a civil war and that they were taking down\nBecause it just seems to be they were going pretty good but they only mentioned these I think these ... these are the ones to make them look like they did this uh you know fairly you take away a conservative you take away a liberal you know what they're saying is we're taking away extremists\nOr removing the extremists on the Internet then in eighty five page briefing comes out called the good censor\nLeaks to the press\nFrom Google would you advise is all of the tech companies to police tone instead of content and not to take sides when censoring users ah you know this is their rushed to say wow we got to do something because if if we if we show our hand and say that we can remove all the conservative viewpoints then there's going to be held to pay with the\nConservative so watch these moves these movies are very important to watch\nBecause\nWe see this in journalism at Google and we realize\nThat of course well this okay this is what they were saying and they're in their memory to some of the fact that they they they believe in change they they say we will change with the times if necessary meaning that if they just so happened to wipe out if you search entries based on tone then they can make that dragon apply deal with China and no one will feel that this is some sort of people move\nThis is what the briefing says if I can get a quick says Google might continue to shift with the times changing its stance on how much or how little it censors due to public governmental or commercial purposes or pressures if it does\nTake knowledge of what this shift in position means for users in for Google is essential shifting blindly are silently in one direction or another rightly insights users fury\nAnd I think about that\nOkay so both sides say violence gay November you don't vote Republican violets ... says we will not be civil until we take over here you have two leaders threatening violence hoping\nTheir their their zealous followers\nWe'll start a civil war [noise] but then you see the Internet now going after Web sites that are radically inclined both liberal and conservative [noise]\nAnd then Google issues a statement saying that we certainly don't want to eliminate certain viewpoint\nYou start dating site users fury [noise]\n\nJumping scaring the guy jumping just scared them and I think what scared them you are the statement [noise] but you heard from both Hillary Clinton\nAnd Donald Trump\nYou don't want to be responsible for civil war they don't want to be liable for civil war and now the media's gotta winds up to be very encouraging it more so than anybody else not dribble a fix every three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis juicy to ground zero and we'll be back\nThis life is you know it is life is you know and now live it and have lived it you will have to live once more and a numeral times more and there'll be nothing new in it but every pain and every every joy\nIn every thought inside and everything and honorably small or great in your life will have to return to you all in the same succession and sequence even if this spider and its moonlight between the trees and even this moment and my and I myself the eternal hourglass existence is turned upside down\nAgain and again and again and you with it speck of dust so when you look at me just concept\nYou know and you say to yourself you know things are happening over and over again you've seen this mirroring process this darker mirrors that were looking in and whether or not we have a demonic power that is there to steal your government away from you or to take over your government when it's most vulnerable I mean what if this power\nWere were were brought back and you didn't recognize what his power was and the power was there as a directive\nOkay and some ... or whatever it is a directive to control a populous is confused and frightened and what this would do if we look through history which we see that a frightened populist and invited populace\nA welt tried and true results come from that all the same succession sequences as other moments in history like the times of Hitler's why mar\nSoviet Russia Mao's China and as I've talked about many times we argued time dirty war\nSo what if something happened that would create a small uprising or a big surprise me and that uprising turned into full on civil war\nI keep in mind that insurrection combative and revolutionary events history had small skirmishes before the big ones are up to ... and this is why now we\nShould take a page from history and understand that we're about to witness the return\nOf what would be called the mob or the ... or the vigilante justice or perhaps even something a lot worse and the reason why I said this is because of the fact that a couple of nights ago I did a show called new in New justice no peace\nAnd ah I attempted to point out that ... the traditional way we think of civil war in this country is crowding the fact\nThat we're already in one end while no one will attribute school shootings to beat the gate shootings Las Vegas attacks the symptoms of civil war in progress our leaders both left and right acknowledged that violence will be an inevitability in this country after the after the November election\nPresident Trump has warned that there will be violence if the Republican Party loses the November's midterm elections and he stated that the rights of the American people were under threat from violent people and I'm sure he mentioned he did mention that they were on the on the left\nAnd many people have told me the left or violent quiet you gotta start talking about how the left or violent yes they are violent\nI've seen that myself here in my own home town I seen it all over the country now this type of rhetoric do the Donald Trump talked about the violence if we don't when\nHe's now being foot noted and being pointed out by the news that the you know they basically saying we'll see you see you see he wants to violence\nYou see the arguments are such that they cut the both ways and extremism\nBecame even more intense after CNN's Christian I'm In for\nSat down with the interview with Hillary Clinton I'll listen to what Christian ... says she talks about the mirror and the black nearing or the dark nearing and the idea of a vast left wing conspiracy against Donald Trump and listen to what Hillary Clinton's response was\nKenny on Conway's ad that said by the talks about this process and she said it ... left wing conspiracy it echoes what you said about when your husband was being pursued by investigations back in the Nineteen Abbas white right wing conspiracy\nFirst of all your comment on that merit language and secondly\nThese anyway even ... speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America is try to get back to some civility and to try to make it even if we have to include disagreements we're not going to war with each other we're not trying to destroy each other\nWell certainly I Would love to see a return to civility listening to want to now there are working out our differences that is not the Republican Party that exist today and that is certainly not the administration that we have in power right now when the Republican Senate denied\nThe right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland a Kurd\nI think anything that they stole a justice from the ...\nI think they did I mean to keeping the court said open for a year\nOr to deny distinguishing jurists they could have voted down they could have said well for ideological reasons philosophical reason that we're not going to vote for him but no they don't ...\nAnd that was such a breach a horn of Africa and the constitutional responsibility of a requirement to advise on ...\n... you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house band or the ... that's when the lady can start again [noise]\nSo she says when we get the Senate back\nThat's what it's ability will start again but until then civility or instability if you will will not continue you cannot\nBe civil with the political party that wants to destroy you stand for and what you care about and that's why she said I Believe if we're fortunate enough to win back the White House and or the Senate that's when civility can started getting there you have a declaration of civil war and a license for violence\nDonald Trump's that violence if the Republicans don't get the vote Hillary Clinton says violence until we get the boat or we we haven't since really until we get the votes so\nThe motive of course is getting what you want by any means necessary not not the vote matters just how much trouble intimidation and instability you can create\nIn order to change the direction of the vote and that's that's very disconcerting\nAnd ... it's on president

because he\nIs not holding together the rule of law in this in this city not at all uh\n... it's it's like it you know the same as it live has a right without the violence but we still have the same kind of their employees you know I don't know is saying that you know a solar before last they shut a major bridge going across the river to live as\nWell when we when we have okay well we have groups

came on the ice or when there would be a ice takeover\nHere the icy takeover in ah Oregon [noise]\nSame thing happened in fact they were saying that what he did was unconstitutional in and would be a [noise] and I think there is somebody actually suing him for what happened there but we also have a governor here and there was very corrupt she's actually a there are a lot of things that she's doing right now\nBut in my opinion uh would would probably weren't arrest as well for some reason we have two very corrupt leaders\nA mere Portland is a corrupt leader and the mayor in a in a new governor of Oregon and super corrupt\nAnd both of them are in power right now and so either going to wait it out to the election but in my opinion [noise] somebody's got to be done sooner than later [noise]

maybe there'll be more violence\n\nAnd of course the media says about Trump when he said about the geo ... violence to Georgia wow that three expected you know he's a he's a fear mongering narcissistic blah blah blah blah blah blah you do that anyway but then Hillary Clinton says\nConsequences be damned we need to have incivility until we get what we want and they're claiming civility could return when Democrats have power is as Mr the ends justify the means\n\nMeanwhile she said this one we've had Republicans are being shot stabbed docks be mailed\nA a rice in powder run out of

okay\nThere's one thing you haven't touched on now [noise] I'm going to preface this by saying that red as it stands nothing Hillary Clinton said actually suggested violence\nAll really really be\nOpposite of civil is not violent it is rude now I Know that they're being very push ally and dangerously rude but they are being rude nonetheless not violent not yet ... does not have a party ...\nA lot I don't think anybody realized that they don't have a party they don't even have a left right there a black bloc okay that I think all this talk about any phone [noise] what has been done\nBy Hillary in the service of whoever's\nPutting out lots and all the other thing is a lot more insidious than simply saying we cannot be violent anymore we have to be violent now that's not what she said [noise] remember that most you you prove this the other night\nWhen you did your show that most Americans have no idea what the word civil war means\nIt does not mean\nA civil war no not necessarily all means no not necessarily not at all civil means states Sable civil means within the state or city or something else it it means it means within state\nInstead of with other states that is what civil war means and that's the idea was civility nothing however\nHillary said the exact opposite of go go up the pilots said the civil what she did no one is realizing is they use of the worst civil\nSuggesting exactly the opposite of what she is saying\nShe's calling on all the people who don't understand what civil war means and using that word as I\nSaid it's a dog whistle it's so subtle that you didn't pick up on it wow she all she had it was dropped\nThat word because it confuses too many people and that way she's not saying anything bad she's nine citing any violence she's just saying I'm don't be nice but she's using that word because we don't understand it and it has a lot of connotations that we don't even understand\nWhat in that case then she's going to have it backfire on her when you agree what do you mean well I mean if she was you know if it was a dog whistle and and you've seen or how you know people have acted towards the conservatives you've seen you know like Ted Cruz being harassed I'm not ... you know\nI'm I'm not sure she knows what she did I'm not sure she goes and she said I think somebody encouraged her to say that\nWell but it is obviously you've got the New York post printing out newspapers said a dealer Clinton just declared civil war\nThat's right that Hillary doesn't doesn't that controlled post no control as Hillary done me controls Hillary and media controls Trump because the media is controlled by those who want the civil war and the media doesn't know it\n... doesn't know it would be to help doesn't know it to the ... they basically are you using the media to manipulate civil war and they're using both Trump and Hillary\nAs pawns in in in the whole matrix definitely no I yeah it's interesting you know I hate the word hate the word ape state but yes what you're saying well say he's real I mean come on what you want to call it I got out and buying what they what are the other term for you\nYou may be a dark
