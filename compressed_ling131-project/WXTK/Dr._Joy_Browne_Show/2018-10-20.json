to speak the truth takes a lot of courage to like break out from this normalcy and reach I mean there's no challenging opinion or challenging thought from those who have rigid thinking and so\nThere are a lot of things that they miss out on with their negative and uncomfortable way of somehow believing that they are the reality police and always needing to explain that those who believe in what they feel is nonsense purely delusional its embassy and like it's more on it\nAnd so the Halloween season we're almost there but what they are now I'm I'm getting at Halloween feeling\nUh the reason why I'm getting the Halloween feelings today for the first time\nI actually felt a chill why because when I got up this morning there was so foggy everywhere and it was cooler than it usually is\nAnd you know I got a sub wearing my sandals means I got to start putting out she was all summer long and I were the sandals I worried about just wherever 'cause it's comfortable wear sandals you're not used to be the cool guy on the street just wear slippers\nI got the idea from watching Bing Crosby and David Bowie singing Christmas [laughter] together that I wanted his\nWord slippers to slip on these slip on slippers and I wear them everywhere he looks so\nCasual and your slippers I don't know I don't want to take 'em off\nMy feet to be nice and warm and my slippers\nBut today I actually started thinking ... you don't have to wear my heated socks and shoes and I saw pumpkins at the store that where I went and got copy of this morning out of a cup of coffee or pumpkins or they're perfect shape pumpkins\nOr the guy who got started carving the pumpkins get out the candles put out the the skeletons it's time for Halloween\nBut see what you're doing Halloween and you're thinking about all of a scary Halloween stuff you know you get those emails while you're talking about that stopped far it's scary it's called Jesus doesn't like it well I you know what yeah it's a challenge to me it's a challenge to your mind it's a challenge to everything because\nThis is a time Halloween Halloween is the time\nThat we open our minds to the cult\nOf what I mean is literally all things that are hidden you know that's what he called me is they all the cold I don't want to join in a cult that's no no no it's not what it called means well you're part of an calls aren't you know that's not what it called means a cult actually means\nThat which is hidden\nMysteries the mysteries of the world or the cold so\nDiving into mysteries diving into the hidden diving into those things that are taboo a cold is one of those magical words\nThat can scare people enough to have them hide in their closets or under their beds or provokes reaction of intriguing certainly something\nWhere most people want to get in on the secrets and find out what big things are being planned in the shadows what we're talking about as we're talking about real honest to goodness magic\nNow you can spell magic and aid G. I. C. right that's the regular was about or you can ... like the cult is due M. A. G. I. K.\nYeah and if you felt that way than you know that's pretty evil [laughter] that's as evil as you get right restart magic with a K.\nSo um it's uh it's pretty amazing some of the things that ah you know when you're in conspiracy circles there's those thoughts that\nYou need to connect and when you do you start digging deeper and you know\nHalloween covers a lot of things but digging deep all the time see for me every day is April Fool's day and every night is Halloween so and so I'm connecting those dots\nAnd I get into the great\nCan spiritual the conspiratorial orders the dark orders that have all their secrets it's about who's in charge of the planet and\nWho are the magicians that run the ... or the center you know there are theories about dark Brotherhood's received their information about channeling the power of demons and there are other investigators that have shown that for millennia mankind has been directed by over towards that can only be compared to I don't know divine or perhaps profane beings\nSome even believe are being controlled by extraterrestrial I mean we're not a point in time\nWhere so many weird things are going on that\nYou have to in good conscience weighing possibilities inevitability is get it seems to be a never ending paradox the world is the moment seems unreal as we now understand that uncertainty\nIs a certain day and the change can cause great upheavals that can affect us\nFor years or even lifetimes\nYou've heard the old saying in magic as above so below something we should be remembered that even if our\nWorld is ... is decided to adhere to all kinds of crazy stuff there's a lot of crazy stuff signs and wonders in the sky and they continue to be here to the average Joe and there's always a number of it as secrets that are being revealed by religious orders and others that are being put on the back burner and of course\nAll we hear about is how there is a world order and that world order is going to be led by anointed elders\nAnointed magicians and anointed successor loaded sharman right I mean this is what a monarchy is true the monarchies are run by kings and queens\nAnd kings and queens or annoyed ones they think that their bloodline goes all the way back to Jesus Christ\nOr you can go all the way back to God and we all know that's blasphemy right but yet we still give honor to kings and queens the 'cause like I think you know you go to the queen of England and you'll get all the families that in the bloodlines and what the bloodlines mean and it's just so strange that were so fascinated with\nBlood and blood line makes you wonder if vampires or or you know if there's some sort of a a ... type order\nAnd it certainly uses all kinds of powers the power in the magic in the blood the power of the magic of conscience the consciousness and the so\nThis is why it's so important to realize that now is the time where the consciousness is being analyzed because they know that there is a spark a divine sparked founding the consciousness and they can use the consciousness as a way to perform\nActs of alchemy seriously\nIt's all about being magical it's all about the magic you can call it whatever you want drawing from the dark powers some people drop from the lighter powers some people claim they have a priesthood our priesthood it's similar to magic except they officiate saying that they have the power through oh I don't know\nGod maybe or Jesus Christ or some people call them the power of the angels but then there are other darker powers Darger priesthood and

hypothesize that histories and rules\nAre being rewritten in order to accommodate what is unfolding in this unpredictable world last night we tried to demonstrate to you that the game is changing and human consciousness is being prepped and ready\nFor a new sphere of influence that seems to be a bit more chaotic from a darker realm of existence the frightening thing is\nIs as the darkness gathers we may find ourselves believing that we're in some strange situation horror situation I mean some plot of a devil or so I mean reality we're actually seeing a more intimate view\nA darker view\nOf the true inner core of the human psyche made it can be argued but the devils and all of us that sometimes we are responsible for country in our own demons and building our own beast\nSometimes we're the ones that magicians and we're the ones casting spells and developing curses and we have to be careful what we say because words are very powerful and ideas and thoughts are being weaponized\nWelcome

what I'm Sorry we're going we're running out of time [noise] stay listening to the program tonight I think we're going to cover what you need to hear [noise] okay I promise me but I mean if you lose me to listen to ground zero dot com\nThe pact him they send your letters Salem witches the covenant under one heaven and then as the attempt to solidify a victim providing a solid\n... medical backdrop for a solid religious or spiritual back drop that is all encompassing and strong and so the agenda\nIs to bring about a global spirituality one that has the same familiar feelings the same familiar spiritual trappings but what he does is it ... what is known as the loose a ferry and he may not as concepts the idea of illumination\nSay the old time conception that is still held today university among Christians is that the Bible is the very word of God verbally dictated by the lord himself and\nInfallible and every statement therefore with consistency I Want to propose exit is twenty two Eighteen that says thou shalt not suffer a which to live and that was made the basis\nOf the persecution of which is with all of its horrors and burning a mistake and things like this scripture was the chief authority for the execution of which is everywhere\nAround the times the Puritans and round the times the pilgrims and it is only a modified conception of the Bible that can release the church from the obligation of which ... the day the ... the Catholics had the ... and eat it could change the meeting over time to the word\nI mean they changed which it was replaced by source wrist in hopes that it would affect the authority of the commandment and to some it's not changed and the meeting\nAt all is just some\nIt just partly why witchcraft I think has become a sin and the eyes of most Christians however today we're seeing a mix of both religion and witchcraft being practiced openly by women and men and a few hints that perhaps some of the old pagan imagery\nHave not left some of the major churches\nAnd and so tonight I thought it'd be interesting to explore\nA some of these themes and and the reason why is because well I mean last night I think kind of tip the hat to it when we were discussing the ... of the un PC and how means in vigils means something in how they're being used to it kind of a ... a form of I guess rich ... kind of form of witchcraft or new form\nOf witchcraft which I think a is most certainly a prevalent today so\nA new book\nThat I have in my possession a fantastic book called sorcery the invocation of strange this\nIs written by Thomas shirt and now we've had Thomas shirt and on the on the show before he lives in Ireland he's amazing we've had him on the show to comment on all things called all things bizarre and I think it's really a pleasure in our ... ... it's an awesome opportunity\nFor us to kick off this season to talk with Thomas about his new book about some of the things that are changing uh within the scope of spirituality mainly leaning towards the cold spirituality Thomas shirt as an author artist and filmmaker from Dublin\nA dumb in Ireland you came to international a recognition twenty eleven with the book\nPuzzling people the labyrinth of a psychopath years since he's written several more books that has made films on topics such as social engineering political and corporate pathology and undo called ... surrounding the emerging years of the third Reich in recent times his work\nIn the ancient mysteries and sacred of locations has been featured in some of the world's largest media outlets and he's a highly sought after public speaker around the world we have him tonight Thomas shirt and welcome to ground zero\n\nHigh tide delighted to be here again\nIt's good to have you and like I said it it's it's just amazing to be able to have you in such a time I mean\nAs I was explaining there seems to be like this shift in attitudes towards I guess you could call it conjuring attitudes towards what would be considered darker magic or some of the darker arts why do you think that this is starting up now why do you think there's a newfound interest in this\nI think people will they brought these ideas for for all kinds\nOf reasons I think you'll have people who will be drawn to choose things like social stairs there's a sense that there's an insecurity within society you see that happening in\nBrooklyn tomorrow at these these wages are going to bind cabinet is other people look at things like you know\nQuantum physics and these ideas that reality is malleable to a certain extent and that\nThey won't let you want to test these ideas and they want to say well you know is it you know is the five cents reality is it malleable is it\nKind of change it cannot alter towards my will and still the only effective mechanism out there to do this as things like magic and so people are drawn to him for that reason as well I think also there's that kind of the maturing going out the mall and that its oil is living in the age where\nYou know people that look the especially in recent years and it seemed like the behavior of the major religions in the crimes of\nThe Catholic Church and other organizations have been exposed quite readily and people have set themselves with these guys have don't appalling things and here they are telling us that you know which ... evil so\nIt is evil really considering the source that's coming from and then I I think that's got a lot to do it I think a lot of people have a kind of a hunger now to see if they can test the boundaries of reality using their will\nAnd it's becoming more apparent that they can uh I was just talking last night\nWith Chris geo injury geo we were talking about this new medium that is on the Internet right now that certainly is causing the the left wing of the United states to be disturbed because they say it's the humanizing it it's certainly\nA it's called the NBC or the non playing character meaning that it's a symbol of those who sound like they are repetitive Lee speaking from a script and it's very effective and I was saying to ah Chris last night I said isn't it interesting that this character\nKind of resembles the ... of alchemy and it seems to be very powerful it's just a simple silk like looking character grand color very simple way drawn but it's supposed to be there is some sort of a a I guess you could call it a toll ... or some sort of mean that that is spreading and certainly going viral and this is a form of magic\n\nI'd been taken a great interest in this as soon as it came to fruition on the electromagnetic spectrum last weekend I knew this was going to be something special\nThe like I I've been watching this whole thing around for ... and the way these people have been using them ethics for a few years now and we are in a different world there's a basically a a generation of\nInstinctual chaos magicians who are using things like me is to actually mold reality in terms of the political structure medicine at this ... is that is quite fascinating and not so much in its was putting out there but the reaction to it\nIt's it's it's tapped into something very visceral and frightening in deep within that people it's been it's been aimed act it's almost like the you know that that the judgment is the mirror and the mirror has been held up to these ... these kind of like a\nCultural relaxes repeaters or whether you want to call them and gather not happy they're not happy because they wanted to believe they were special and certainly they're realizing that the only thing ... they're probably just like androids\nAnd that's the thing is that they're saying oh it's dehumanizing it hurts us but you're right it's like putting a mirror up to them and saying look at what you're saying look at what you're doing look at what you're acting upon\nAnd it just reminded me when I saw that as a you know a several characters that have just been ... characters\nThat have been effective in the past like the ... that was discovered a that was actually created that are probably a a created the among kill us that he had a uh the uh the one uh that was called the way that uh he had that looked like a a huge balding kind of ...\n... the fight happening in the TV show is between witches and war locks and whether or not a character by the name of Michael he's the Supreme which or the anti Christ said it's amazing fight because the witches are fighting amongst each other as to who was about to lead and we have the same problem now with\nThe which is they want to curse Kavanaugh and we have the Catholic Church coming forward and say well we're going to reverse this person it's like\nA a huge a Cold War or or cyber war going

are listening to ground zero that ever called in I Believe six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six Seventy three thirty seven hundred like Thomas shared it is with us we're so glad to have him [noise] I used to be with us today from Ireland as we talk\nAbout what's going on of course a what we were talking about earlier where the pope apparently a was at a Senate and ah he pulled out the staff it was a very familiar staff to those who are pagan to those who are which is a staff it's\nCalled the staying and a conservative Catholics were appalled\nCan't use the post choices staff as evidence is something scary something diabolical something which she was going on at the Vatican and so you know while most folks do use\nA what is called the ... a pastoral staff that uh has across the top um\nThis one was different this one uh looked then it's Thomas commented it uh it it it seems to be the staff that represents a the the nail support staff was there to the pope had a nail going through it and when you look at me iron nail in staying it symbolizes\nA lot of things uh\nCollege was saying that uh that includes the ballots and that it it basically unites the part of the womb is the triple motif of a threefold serpent teen to lurk Cannick a and we were hearing earlier about this ban a book called the first hour saying that his wife\nWas involved with some sort of a a serpent teen or women rising up against against the men or ... were rising up against avenue serpent Jean represents the devil the garden\nThe gifting Adam and Eve were deliberating it'd be eliminating words no you shall not die the death for God's ... know that in what they saw wherever you go eat and the forbidding fruit your eyes shall be open\nAnd you should be as God's doing good and evil so you look at the ... which refers to earthly power who sourcing symbol is the serpent but it's deep in the earth when you're talking about Canucks power that comes from Cain\nAnd so um we have a Thomas sharing back you know it seems to me that and this was said uh this has been said I Can't remember where I heard\nThat when Donald Trump was elected president\nAnd Hillary Clinton was not elected president United States this basically jarred or at least\nA peak the rage of the feminine power and so the feminine power had to regain a a place and so now they're fighting for that power again is this why you think or is this could be why a witchcraft now is is being a actually is having a renaissance\n\nThomas that's a good point I never thought about that one and you hear me okay I can hear you fine thank you yeah go ahead can you hear me uh-huh yeah\nYeah I never yeah that's an interesting point I never thought about that the thing is that this witchcraft that we're seeing like in Brooklyn tomorrow so on it's not\nIt doesn't come from a healthy place that doesn't come from a desire to restore power if there was a recall from that it was the same way that Hillary\nClinton wasn't particularly email press the ... are in terms of how she operated herself and her political life she was very much you know more like a mom so I I decided to just being ... I think this is more desperation than any actual\nIt's going to win every time but but the race around the tray sickle and the eleven year old winds every time you see it's not the driver it's the vehicle when it comes to generating revenue it's exactly the same if you have a job or a small business you are writing a trace it all you can only go so fast\nIf you need to make up ... it's not going to happen on a tray sickle no matter how fast you pedal it's simply not going to win the race\nWhy do many people with no schooling and no advanced degree often become very wealthy simple they

these little source reviews of pages phrases of when you get that both the bill because it has\nHis own philosophical inside as a shot and giving you a an introduction into magic in the calls and how it all is applying to\nThe time today I mean a lot of what you hear about is all like this ... this is some stuff that's applicable today and what we're talking about it's also possible you know I learned a term the other day a a a Thomas it was called security theater\n[noise] and what that term means is that really\nYou know we have to put trust in one another because the reality is is that our lives are fragile that we have fragile lived with Jodie of lived majority of the system collapsing all these things are are a possible their ...\nAnd the truth is is that everybody a gives us a sense of security and they create the security theater by you know having child proof tops TSA at the airports that sort of thing\nI think the church uh especially the Catholic Church now I think they provide this provide us with a little spiritual security theater thinking that everything is in control\nBut then we have a pope who steps into the sitting odd holding a Stang\nTrying to tell people about uh how he's going to eliminate the pedophilia eliminate the robbing a virtue it's almost as if\nThe vampires now are not afraid of the sunlight nor they afraid of the crop they'll just walk right into the church walk away with the child and Robert of virtue what do you say about that what is that what kind of a sex magic is that that it's going to destroy what we have here on this on this planet\nI think yeah\nI think the Catholic Church I looked at the fly on the wall\nRight now there is that you have this Pope Francis making a lot of strange statements about\nThough you know global is kind of ideas things that that show a tradition they were against any ... is promoting them it's almost like desperation tactics not quite recently here the the ... visited Ireland and it was a disaster and ... he was basically going around in his pope will be able to empty streets\nAnd that's because of all the clerical sex abuse is in some horrific things of that whole delight in our in the ... very much if they're not they're not black magic that pretty much close to it conducted by members of the Catholic Church\nAnd often I'm just wondering if this was this whole thing with the dying it's some kind of like ... ... ... does is it a is symbolic\nOf a nervous breakdown within the Vatican but they're they're losing control you know after two thousand or Eighteen hundred years or whatever\nAnd I I don't I think that that the Vatican is you know they're a very strange place right now\nThey're they're kind of\nYou know their little they've lost a lot of the countries where they used to be powerful other desperately trying to make them around and it's a it's almost like a really bad and hockey PR thing and every every so many things seem to be going wrong for them lately [noise] do you almost wonder if they're losing it\nDisappears I mean why would they even come forward with something so obviously pagan so obviously witchy and uh and preventing it at a seminar that it's a talking about this very thing talking about the abuse of the children virtue in that sort of thing it's almost like\nThat it's either a tell us for the protection or it's a challenge for them saying we're fully aware of what's going on we're fully aware of the darkness but then again there are other factions with the church that are planning on doing a counter fight against the which is tomorrow and we're going to talk about that too coming up Thomas shared in my guest Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred\nThat's AAA fix him at three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis

Ninety five ...\nAnd I hardly a radio station news radio Ninety five WICK [noise]\nHere's the way it is from ABC News I'm Dave Schreiber President Trump friday evening oldie around in Mesa, Arizona Mr Trump urging supporters to vote in the upcoming elections\nThe Democrats have become an angry unhinged mob determined to get power by any means necessary\nAnd judgments were had against the have the have nots and it's the same type of atmosphere that triggered the pogroms or the Nazis mean Nazi\nGermany you had this romantic belief in the area and cultural superiority based on nature's laws all dressed up in political pseudo scientific biology and it was often encouraged\nWould ecological apocalyptic ideas that certain people were a burden on resources and the environment and some argue that many people believe that in order to bring balanced nature\nWe had to eliminate certain people we had to kill off some of the population\nSo people were rounded up and killed\nMeans centuries prior we at European columnist who took the lead for the natives because they were believed to be a strain on the resources their beliefs were for the pure and beliefs\nSo on and then down and kill them see there's always this affect the\nProcess for creating an agreed upon way of hunting down and kill other human beings in order to boost to some sort of agenda in order to make you feel better about your belief system because these are believed that you don't necessarily agree with it so when you have like for example the times I'm assuming which\nTrials there are governors there were complicit in carrying out a lot of the atrocities in the public trust is always exploited in situations like bees\nAnd it would be your opinion of the political elite that the day but these changes the b._b._c. that we're seeing we're actually happening\nBecause there was this work going on this working out of the devil ... like today that there was a polarization of the people on on one side we have the devil and the other side we are God and in between there was something else and it was black magic being used in other ways of trying to\nI guess take care of the governors take care of the leaders go against the bankers it's just a never ending process in fact Thomas sharing it on our show today we're talking about the attack that's being planned tomorrow on justice cabinet\nAnd I mean a lot of these actions have not been you know a lot of the uh uh different people have very views on what this is going to bed what's going to take place where there's a guy by the name of father Gary Thomas\nAnd he's the exercises for the diocese of San jose California He's offering a mass for cabinet or tomorrow\nAnd basically he's the guy that was the subject to the ... or the twenty ten book to write the making of a modern extras this and that was a movie in twenty eleven twelve years is becoming an extra ... father Thomas who said that he is terrified of what is going on just like Thomas in fact father and Gary\nAppeared on ground zero and you know when we were talking earlier about the staffing and how it represents the serpent and the serpent teen and be\nAnd be empowering them the female in the mail and the and the fruit and all that fathered Gary said that in some of his ... he has been known to you know put his hands are annoying or lay his hands on people during the actresses ...\nHad they been known to turn into or at least appear to be Seventeen or appear to be reptilian he appeared on the show when the right was popular let's play that segment from father Gary Thomas listen to this there's more\nOf an increase of reports of shape shift as have you heard of that before father when you say a shape shift or what you mean\nPeople who are able to and I've seen one I've seen a person change their their their confidence where they're able to change their look or the eyes dark and they get large and yet you've seen this\nYes I have and I've also seen when you said as soon as you I I wanted to make sure that I understood the gym that\nI mean I've had people with whom I prayed over whether the as you say that the counting and I mean there's not a physical\nLike somebody putting a bag over somebody and all of a sudden there there's a different had right I have seen the contours of a person's face change in may and and appear to be reptilian and and and and have the head of a cobra\nA and I and I when I said is to people they have a very difficult time believing I oh I Do not I've I've I've seen this\nPhenomenon is below this very day I Am going to be speaking I Am actually being called as a person to be on television program in a network TV show to talk about the shape shift or shoot shape shift into\nThese reptiles and ... and like I say ... you're right you don't put a bag or they had they changed but their their eyes jet out black there there are four had kind of a curves differently their their face kinda titans and they look very very reptilian\nWell and they began moving there Tom yes\nAnd it very reptilian way and I I've had several people literally flop off the couch and coil and and the body language passion\nAnd says surfing oh yeah and he had like a serpent yeah uh what are what are the things I uh I don't know if you've been to my Web site at all but I actually did a video where I was showing Aileen Warren knows who was the woman who is the uh the the first female serial killer\nWho was a prostitute and uh she had said that she felt like some sonic a\nA tension was in her head and then she was possessed by something when she gets worked up into where er into Iran's because she's angry and and and literally crazy her eyes get bigger and you start seeing her teeth change in our mouth changing her nose change yeah it's an amazing thing to watch\nI've had that happened ... times on the other thing is um demons enter through the census the eyes the IRS the mouth of the nose\nAnd when I'm performing either an extra says I'm older I'm doing the sermon and I'm using simple parents have deliverance I'm always looking at the eyes because they're the best description and it goes back to when I worked on the march right business as an ally system bomber\nAnd when you look into the eyes of a ... there's an absence that's pressing right\nWhen you look into the eyes of someone who who has something demonic the eyes look like\nA set of 'em they looked like they have coke bottle like contact lenses that are beyond um that are just very thick looking\nYes and they are very dark\nAnd saw the Gary Thomas appeared on ground zero talk about what happens during an exercise with him he's mounting a counterattack to the which is\nUh in New York or Thomas shared with us tonight on ground zero his book sorcery the invocation strange as it does sound like a battle of good versus evil or at least power against power do you think this is going to end well\nTomorrow or in general I think tomorrow molting probably will happen although I Would love to be there in Brooklyn just to see the faces they just see\nHow they react to the emotional psychic intensity I imagine just some remarkable individual behaviors that ... that will be miserable ... how it will end on the greater\nThing I don't know but you know you just brought up the Nazi Germany Nazi Germany was eight and a red and let people read my book while per night you'll know that it was\nBasically a Coltrane all uphold forces\nAs social and economic failure at inter ethnic and older issues and that led to these that the third Reich that the\nNational socialist a boiling old as ... and and the cold cold and they generally and the same thing with the Puritans day where a result of the the English civil war and the ones that\nCame here kind of the restoration period of England or or to American handle the restoration period a thing of these things generally do known and well\nIf they're not into real quickly right and they can like I was saying that like a nuclear bomb you captain of the rest of the deaf or they\nCan affect lots of people is amazing because this ... this is can unleash all kinds of darkness and that we won't be if we don't know how to be prepared for it in fact I Want to talk about that coming up Thomas about what to do to prepare for what is coming because it seems there are a lot of people out there\nThat are using a magic and the paranormal as a weapon and I think that a weapon I think of this type of a magic if you will this type of of practice is dangerous because a lot of people don't know exactly what they're dealing with Thomas sharing with us and on and ground zero in and take some calls coming up as well ... thanks every three thirty seven hundred\nA strip believes except
