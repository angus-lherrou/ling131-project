not good\nI don't know if that's true or not but that's what I heard another thing right here in Portland somebody has come up with the idea because of the drugs and the young folks they ought to\nA drug test the young folks when they go in for a driver's life Mm and that's okay that's that's fine but why not test everybody if they're going to test the young folks\nWell I I I I'll tell you why I I think why I'm\nIt's probably because of the Fourth Amendment in other words they probably figure constitutionally they can get away with it when it's a minor but constitutionally they'd probably a cannot get away with it when it's a ah somebody who's a ... or you know become Twenty one age of consent\nIs that so that's just a guess\nOkay well it just seemed unfair to me or that they would do it to the young folks and not others because there's a lot of young adults that\nWell I got All right let me try this out on you if they were to test everybody everybody went to get a driver's license

that there was a mental involved one type of another and I just wonder what this did not make national news\nWell probably because the investigation is not complete but you're right it's gonna be interesting to see what they come up with\nMy having to help finance or\nTake care a subtle why I Hope for all our sakes that we eventually get an answer to what did happen and uh I Would not pretend to know nor guess what happened\nOh I've got what purports to be a photograph of a missile that was up on the website for a long long time uh people uh had a very mixed reaction to it a photograph taken at a party on Long Island and uh they think it might have been a missile\nOr um it could have been a bomb or it could have been mechanical trouble they're presently leaning toward mechanical trouble there has been no absolute determination made yet I repeat no determination\nMade yeah we'll be right but I remember that was hard Dell who goes to the coast on somewhere\nA song\nThe land saw

you're on the air high\nAs our bell it is hello hello I'm calling from Evansville, Indiana Hi Ed ah yeah I Want to talk about the guy that talking about earlier about the Bible drinking water\nOh yes I'm mobile drinking water just what\nA no such thing in this town but that was good\nUh we got the best during drinking water probably in the whole county and the whole country\nAnd I'm sure you'd like to keep it that way uh well we will keep it that way there you go this is a good clean town\nA boy and a lot on herbal idea of putting a match to your drinking water and seeing a flame\nUh uh the guy I think I think he's blaming himself could be a also the main reason I wanted to call I Want to talk about Bob Dole aren't a man you know the man is voted his whole life for this country\nYes the house and you know I mean what else can you say what what what what else does the president Meg okay uh\nWhat else excuse me what else does a president make yeah you mean ... ...\nOn that that that what okay um I mean what else is the ... that does make a president or\nUm you know the man or I mean you know you don't hear anything about any kind of scandals via ham or even lawyer or a man fought for his country spent three years in hospital it came out voters whole lot of the country are\nOn why do you think why do you think he has so far behind in the polls\nWhy do I think Yes sir I I I think uh\nToo many people don't really rely on there and think and don't look\nGood enough and to the candidate to really figure out who the man is and they rely on TV and network\nTV ... ABC CBS and ... and ah NBC mhm\nI I think they have a very big biased I don't know of there's there's all kinds of newspapers and they're all ... all kinds of different media and all that but uh\nMost people I mean there's all kinds of polls that also say that most people do get their news from TV and they believe what they see on TV that is true and I I think it's a shame\nWell I appreciate your culture and we'll see what others have to say\nI'm so you think that people are taking their cue from the media it is true that more people than not get their news from the media from the major media\nAh what do you think what are the rest of you think the uh ... taken by the ... campaign of late has been to attack the president with regard to the donations made by the Indonesian company\nHe's a good old boy he's the vet on time that boy but uh you're this in franchise with him now you're not too crazy about him I take it\nWell I don't think that he is electable this year if that answers your question and he is not going to be elected\nAnd you think he's going to run again\nUm I don't know uh it's a good question he may allow another candidates or to have the reform party\nNext time and I I really think it's it comes down to that that he will allow because if he runs he will be the candidate yeah in my opinion so uh if you set the reform party lose we may get a ... another candidate next time\nOK and just one thing when you had a the two candidates from the the other parties like uh the libertarian yes thing that I'm scared about that this guy gets in there and see if they have their way you can imagine\nThat the sweatshops Thirteen year old girls are working twelve hour shifts a lot of safety features will go out the window let alone or legalizing drugs which I think it's crazy\nI uh we have to have some government yeah\nI I Do agree sir I Believe me I Do agree\nI Am very much in the middle and I do agree I Am not able to embrace libertarian philosophy and I really really really like Harry brown use the real thing he believes in what he says I just happen not to agree with all of it\nAre two important non trivial points one is legalized drugs very bad idea in my opinion and the other is open borders\nOr we have every right to control our borders and we should be doing so that is my view east of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nHi art Steve from South Dakota Hey Steve a got a couple of quick things on the lighter side for you tonight not talking science All right um I received the uh twenty of tapes show of your show or two days ago you did yes and I'm you know cataloguing them all for reference and ah got quite a little library here [laughter]\nOkay and second of all if you can give the artist of this song a photo of a prophetic song about what's going on on the east and west coast right now with the fire on one coast in the rain on the other right can you get the artist know James Taylor firing range\nFiring rain yeah okay well I got that certainly would fit thank you very much younger firing rain\nThe east coast are absolutely flooding I think quite a number of deaths on the east coast due to the flooding and of course I'm On the west coast the fires even at this hour continue and I hope they're getting under control wildcard line or on the air Hi\nWell good morning about good morning to you ah my name is John I'm located in Portland Hi Dante you all the time on ... Yes sir let me turn my radio for a moment\nAll by all means trap actually turn it on the whales yeah there you go\nUp and I got the phone okay um yeah I I wanted to know if he can answer a question for me that's been kind of bugging me for the last couple of weeks um I was reading an article about a high school student\nSuspended from school because she gave a classmate might all\nUh I don't think it was mine all but it was an aspirin yes\nUm that's just kind of um you know kind of throws me in a in why in the devil did they under for just given enough\nWell they're rule was a no student will give any other students any drug over the counter or otherwise that was the rule\nOh okay yeah it's just that they did it that strange at all [noise] yes yeah\nBecause I thought I read something that a Kurt to another student in a different school though but uh either Tylenol or at bill or something like that and\nExactly defended that\nStudents who they are well I think they found it in a locker ... and I thought well I can imagine you know doing it if they found pot or heroin or something like that and there but uh\nI Know aspirin seems radical yeah I went on the other hand uh there there's a reason for the rules thank you for the call [noise]\nUm it it does sound a little rough but suppose the other student had had some sort of allergy to that medicine than there would have been a real problem\nThere would have been a real problem and I suppose that's why they have the rule or a little bit strict yes but probably proper and they want the school nurse to dispense any medicine west of the Rockies you're on the air high\nAbout yes I've been doing Albuquerque New Mexico yeah later on fine\nGood I Do a couple of factors off and on the past month or two I don't know if we have done a vet at any rate greetings from Albuquerque um this thing with a cat in Australia um my question is do they know for sure it's safe for human\nUm well it did not cover that it's always something to worry about you know I I what worries me is even if they've got it right and they've come up with a virus that will kill cats how can they be sure they're going to keep it in Australia\nYeah that's another concern to get very easily I Would think they transmit it\nAh [noise] well the question is to um on it to tell you thank you very much for show and all of this stuff is getting very very scary you put together a thing says Richard ... says Malik I've art what's it called the first hour or it's frightening stuff\nWell it is in the sense that so many people from so many disciplines are all saying the same thing any one of them you could probably ignore a chicken together a I think you ignore at your own peril\nTrue my question is maybe next time you have a guess of that ilk on if you can ask them um [noise] what we can do for a little hope that's frightening I have a Thirteen year old son now and it's a scary you know it'd be interesting to say is there any hope for the future at all\nWell look uh I'll tell you how I deal with it and the way I deal with it is\nOne day at a time and no matter what anybody predicts for the future I Am going to continue living my life and enjoying my life ah as fully as I can for every day that I have left\nAnd really in the answer when you thought it through and you listen to everybody that's all you can do that you know life goes on right\nThrough All right ah one other quick thing I Will send you a picture of my baby who's going to be a baby to recover for Halloween talk we're going fangs and a long time on his pacifier send me the photo I Will already ... take a pacifier [laughter]\nAll right we'll be right back but it's worth asking times interview with art\nWho's the coast to coast a a more from where time\nNoise you listen lawyers\nMe than\nIt sounds very\nInto that know me I can say you know my\nBeing too much time\nIs fun playing with cars to\nShow me involved\nIs called the cat in\nOwn way to live in\nTime scales so as you said\nNine nine nine my chicken coups\nIn and you know John I'm\nIn me than lawyers who lives in lawyers you\nAnd we\nDon't watch the J West Germany Cape Cod and I hardly a radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK\n\nHere's the latest from ABC News\nGuys have the only smart way of doing things you don't change times twice a year\nRight at that one of the only place in my country\nWell there are there may be one other thing I Would very much like to join you I Am so sick of changing clocks I could scream\nI was just talking to my wife earlier obviously out of state she's up in Idaho ... and uh yeah I've kind of frustrating for she like as well especially if coal is that is that right now but\nShe's up their skin is ending our family style um that I said well why don't we are on I drive a fairly driving down and\nThat's a tough call right now around [laughter]\nNo no no no no that's the wrong place\nAll of that but yeah I've been a really really enjoying your show it's\nIt's a godsend I mean that someone would take the time to read some of these issues or to the air with I mean it's like I Know you can I act with impunity I I'm sure that there's\nAll kinds of science that may LA many of the issues that could be dealt with\nNot really no actually the truth is I can talk about anything I Want\nI I can you do and I do and you certainly do I\n... I I'm Amazed and especially listening to some of the yeah the ... I mean the variety of things that you are playing the fact that we're talking about that when Jeff\nMissouri man does not live by politics alone at least I don't and\nTalk radio across America right now is almost in you know unless you're a doctor so and so I'm hoping people out with their emotional problems otherwise a talk radio is all politics all the time it's either going to have to change or as the leading format in America it's going to die oh\nWell I you know I think you've made a really good point there as well and uh I'm I've been\nHoping that you know I've I've been kinda apathetic about it because it's like a a best friend she just got through saying what what do we have ... what do we have from\nAnd\nIt is not a good choice is yours there there's\nNo choice and I was thinking about Nicaragua little Nicaragua I've I've been all through Latin America it used to live in Central America and uh you know that qualifies banana republic but they're really quite advanced high literacy rate very politically minded\nGet twenty three presidential candidates in Nicaragua right\nAnd a very close election monitored all computerized yup very well done very very well done I was there and\nLet's see I was in Nineteen Seventy\nNine July when the Sandinistas took over the government and I was in the capital and then I was there\n... or or that are right out of high school oh man that must be really done something\nYeah doing my buddies taking a trip down to South America in our uh graduation getaway trip kind of thing you know\nThen you went to Nicaragua one or two ago [laughter] yeah well when I didn't know that was going on and I understand all ethically aware no I understand Nicaragua just looked like a nice place to visit\nAll of us part of the tenor and down to why not friday so why aren't destination\nTo their benefit they did not return Mr or did I get a power goodness that\nYou know it was really amazing was we were airlifted back by the American embassy they sure how to people they took us back out too I'm sure ...\nWe we had an airbase there are ... or something going on there with before we started helping the country's later but uh\nAnyway they um I noticed in a photo that I saw in a\nIn a plant in a ... I'm pretty article ah what do you call it a newspaper down there they had um the ... who became the president um she wrote in town and the victory procession alongside of Daniel Ortega\nYou go that's right I recall that thank you very much for the call I recall that and the elections or in Nicaragua are definitely a bright spot if we can just do something about the Cuba or the world will indeed in many ways to be a better place east of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nGood morning good morning how are you there I Am fine uh my name's Kevin I'm calling from la fountain Indiana gives her about the cats in Australia yes I'm\n...\nI Believe about a year ago um did they not try to get rid of the rabbits and Australia correct okay I have a second they they they were trying to do that\nYeah they like designer viruses down there\nI see [noise] um there's one thing that a person has to remember amount to voting for a for a do or Clinton this year wasn't um Clinton or as approving judges\nFor um you know he's already appointed more judges and has a first term than Reagan ever did in those terms that he was elected and he's got a lot more judges to a point\nWhere you know I Would say that what you're raising is a good and valid point except for the fact that if you look at the appointments that require congressional approval ones that were made by Clinton and required approval of the Senate almost inevitably a\nJust like rubber stamps or they were approved\nYes I I realize that I I I Would just uh for some reason with things that don't would I have a little bit more conservative uh uh thinking on when when he goes to a point the judges then went to\nWell I Would certainly like to think so but the record would be that he helped confirm those that were sent to him by President Clinton so why would you think that he has women's would have a a ... would necessarily uh be\nYou know I think both of them are going to be forced if there is a Republican House as there is now or no matter who would get in to force people in excuse me to appoint people pretty much in the middle no matter who gets in\nMhm maybe I'm wrong I don't think so well I just thought I'd throw that out at the hands of people out there no I I appreciate it one other thing or you know I understand that you've been looking for a which to an interview Oh yes\nUm there's a lady that I seen on on the seven hundred club about a year ago and she was she's no longer which today but she was a heavily involved in it uh\nYeah but you probably preaches the exact opposite today right yeah well\nI I Want a real uh I Know I'm going to catch a lot of flak for this every time I said I Want a real wicked room ride in a house crunched serious which\nWill see this this lady here she was a the queen of all the the the the\nWhich is involved in black witchcraft or in Europe for for several years there so she was heavily involved in several years ago and I I just thought I'd mention that\nTo All right well I'm Glad you did thank you very much\nAnd I will now immediately get ... saying there is no such thing there is Wicca but were nice which is and I I Know\nI I Am convinced nevertheless that if I keep looking you eventually I Will find a real broom riding wicked witch of the north and I'm going to interview one if it kills me\nJust my first time caller lined

particular a treaty on the right to the child and the other one is on biodiversity\nY'all actually treaties are not something that Clinton or any other president can just entered into right about ... require ratification by two thirds of the Senate if they are highly treaties\nExactly and probably the reason they haven't been ratified is because we've had Republicans in there that have been you know keeping a check and balance on the\nUs and if we're smart we will keep Republicans in their\nAbsolutely that that's the thing I'm hoping for that at least to Clinton is reelected I'm\nI'm a realist and I I Do believe he is going to be reelected I'm I'm not here to be a cheerleader I'm reading the tea leaves the way I think they're dropping and so I my feeling now is to concentrate on

I I Wonder if you would get a guest on who would be opposed to it and you said you're gonna have their priests on friday noon to the health program at never came up the subject of reincarnation\nOh I see well I Would I Would have been obvious so I mean he was a Catholic priest\nOut while I Wonder yeah but I think there are pros and cons to the subject and I went back to hear somebody um has the argument against it\nI don't want to excuse me and why why don't you go to make some now what do you think okay\nThe people who believe in it they say that we keep reincarnate ... am and coming back because they said that the way we learn yes\nIf you remember they always say that they say that's how we learn\nYes and yet on the program friday night you and the priest both agreed that that we are a lot I don't know if you remember that but\nMy point I remember it clearly\nYeah well if if we keep reincarnate and to come back at to learn at issue I think we would find a way by now we would not be alive\nAnd well in other words we would become wiser in wiser in ... which\nIs that it actually getting dumber and dumber and dumber ...\nAnd now there's another problem with the reincarnation and that is that there are constantly more\nPeople on the earth in other words yeah more souls yeah right so maybe um those who are learning and becoming wise or because of reincarnation if it does exist are being in effect outmoded by the ... coming along who don't know a damn thing\nI'd out now that I I like that now when\nYou first came on this radio station when you left the station I remember hearing you say that you intend to to have a master's is I guess and I don't know maybe you changed your mind but I Would like to hear him talk about it\nFor no I haven't changed my mind at all I have to run several times as you know\nOh and then I must admit I hear you I I doubt I'm Michelle program that I I never heard him on your program\nOh my oh no\nUh well then you must not catch 'em all well I can say 'cause I've had ... on I Would say over the years\nProbably at least a half dozen times I think you've been on this station [noise] well I don't know what station you're listening to the one year I now I'm On every hundred stations man well I Know I mean oh I'm In Las Vegas\nOkay that helps you mean it'd be easy or maybe not since we've been on cable you gee that's right well that's\nWhat I mean you know and uh I I Know you had him before that yeah\n... ... would you consider having him of course\nI think he's very very interesting and uh or him or any any I guess I Would give the argument the guest reincarnation\nDo you think he does not believe in it\nI I'm not sure but I think he does not ...\nWhat did surprise you if you are found out he did\nA yeah yeah I think what I\nI think I heard him out a lot I've that I've listened to him for Thirty years in a long time ago I heard him say something about that that this would be something that never would want\nBecause people could keep messing up their lives and each time and they say well I got another chance I'll reincarnate an opt out do better than the next time and they never did one with an argument I heard him give a long time ago\nI see All right uh well uh maybe I'll have them\nOn how 'bout that ah I I'm going to make sure I never miss your power than because I won't know ahead of time [laughter] and I have to announce it well I usually do announce guess ahead of time I thank you very much are\nYou welcome to share a glad you called and that was Las Vegas I'm indeed used to the Rockies or on the air hello\nHello art Mike in Nashville Hi Mike how you doing fine listen I tried to get through friday when you had father Martin Oh yes sir I was unable to and I'll uh\nHad a couple of questions I wanted to ask can but I Know this had to be popping through your mind did you catch all of the ...
