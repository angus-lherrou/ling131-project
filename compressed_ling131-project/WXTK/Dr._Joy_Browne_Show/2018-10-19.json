K. K. or they're they're racist that's an NBC\n\nMeaning these people have a limited they have a limited fountain to draw from an hour's drive from the same things and they always say the same things to people who are trying to express themselves and it and even if you sound just a little bit on the right\nThe un PC lap will come in and they'll say well they'll do that so that's why they're called NBC's may have caused a lot of anger\nBecause those you see them feel that they're the humanizing well this is a humanizing us that's the point I mean yeah if you don't like the main create your own\nUh yeah it is there to the human eye and basically saying you're robots your robots they're following a program and you're listening to the program\nAnd it goes on the other side too I have heard so many programs responses whenever you say anything that he was in this bit of criticism to Donald Trump people go how Jared you he's a man of God and you like what\nHe's the president of the United states he's not a man of God he's not the messiah he's not going to turn water into wine\nAlthough we can't turn wine into something else but he can't [laughter]\nI'm just saying you can't do that for some reason in this country so there's NBC name mocks the left basically making them out to be expression listed appearance by like in behavior\nI mean that's one of eight causal observers right they just stand there occasionally say oh this is the door make all up here it's like it's like being one of those talking maps make a left three hundred feet ... that's kind of a an NBC it's kind of given

Facebook Twitter and Facebook are responding my saying well this is sort of an election day but not what it is it is the philosophical mean where they're saying\nHey we're tired of the we're tired of the lines and you know in in in those who fetus and whine about it we're smart they pre one and say well we're tired of this\nYou know what the person who is far more liberal and conservative I have

car moving you looked like a Whitey you're you're all white aren't ya euro Whitey and of course the guy saying that was white [noise] now now why is that this guy or a programmed response saying something about Whitey to a guy who's white the January Kanye West\nA Don Lemon was on CNN and Kanye West of course one to talk to Trump\nAnd then some other guy on there that was black and he'd say you use the N word describing Conway ... as an N. word that can read or this is what happens when an inward can read\nAnd I'm thinking are you oh man well yeah I mean this is business how the the response or oh yeah this is not the responses are silly NBC me and I think explained it a lot that\nThe programming is taking over and people are seeing the stupidest things\nHave you don't even realize that they do it skews a bowl it's inexcusable certain amount of time it into its excuse me what people are saying to each other\nAnd I think this example by that at least it is aimed towards

Trump at a rally in Montana denouncing the caravan of Honduran migrants making its way through Central America\nThis reality redo we're going through a retro causality creating conspiracy theories that really are more than theories but attempts to somehow put reality into perspective without letting anyone know but secretly tucked away and all of our utility drawers he's a kitten foil hat it will probably where it because we know that no one truly lives in the universe is fully object\n\nI mean what we're seeing limited concepts time\nWe're hearing about how they're different dimensions we're hearing about there are different ways of thinking we're hearing that you know we're hearing in the quantum immortality I mean science is basically going all\nParanormal\nAnd they want to quantify all the paranormal in a scientific way scientific way like ah they want to be halfway with their religion they want to be half way with the conscious that they want to do parents like is this is where I've spoken to pour about how\nHere we are gonna ship this ... this is a major paradigm shift and we have a temporal blind spot in some regard because events happened or we perceive they do\nAnd then later we're schooled on the idea that everything we perceived\nAs wrong\nIs that what we think we know it's not exactly what is that somehow we reach a point where we are satisfied with their opinion\nAnd and all that it's based on his bowl nebulous stimuli we all agree to this and it's like this is my opinion and this is\nMy truth and you say well it's not true if it's just what you think it is the it's all about your selective perception and we know the selective perception is necessary because we didn't have selective perception\nWe wouldn't be transfixed by the hyper reality and sensory overload we're now getting today our brains are being filled with all sorts of sensory overload thing about it we have simple perceptions of light\nLight like love survival spirituality God you know and then we're exposed to media print television Internet videogames cell phones many other things that you know that are pushing the brain\nFurther and further\nAnd all that stimulus his place in a limited area known right there in a compartmentalized area called the brain we don't know if the brain is limitless and we have we've learned that in old age ... whose memory\nAnd we lose perception of time I mean the brain can be objective if it chooses to however it's emotion that is driving his eye guy since so there's this war going on between the brain and subjective experience so this is what they call explanatory gap where we've had\nThe bridge the brain causes cystic springs emotion critical announces we're struggling with primary consciousness right now where we wonder if the experiences were feeling it all we get this shoveled in this disenchanted experiences and feelings we get now are both natural and organic\n\nAnd of course now we experienced the virtual meeting hyper reality from electronic allusion it's unfortunate that we're seeing more and more people\nResponding to the electronic illusion they're becoming a non player they're becoming a person who just sits there and watch it watch things or you know go in front of them they they they decide that you know it's better to read the script that it is to follow the follow their own hearts follow their own minds\nSo there are a lot of people that are getting fatigue right now\nOver what George Orwell called double speak double speak actually disguises the nature of the truth giving new meaning to words with what appeared to be scripted dialogue and provided by the party and it's never ending\nPropaganda they keep pushing and pushing and pushing see many people but then they have not had the the time nor the guest desire to read the book Nineteen eighty four\nOr by George Orwell usually you know they say things like a big brother's watching you ride ha ha ha you know or you know ignorance is strength or you know that kind of stuff they they know a few lines right\nBut big brother was not only watching in Orwell's dystopian he was capable of brainwashing and skipping the drones are groomed to follow the which is the ministry of love\nThe George Orwell was a British Intelligence officer and with his ability to see the possible future he predicted a totalitarian world where the government had corrupted the language forced the citizenry to believe lies as if there were truth and they were being tracked with a ubiquitous cello screen\nIt was basically extent in every home place of business and public facility today we are still the screens there attached to our hands\nThere are virtually every communication device so you're the first thing we look at it in the morning there the last thing we see at night\nThey are\nProgramming the masses with emails music can beams and with every algorithm we're slowly being coerced into following anything that seems\nTo be calling her confirmation by so this process we're not only beginning to wonder if someone is watching us we're also noticing that somebody is scripted nuts or at least ... some people and acting like\nWhat are now being called non player characters the non player characters are NBC's or the newest means that have appeared on Twitter and Facebook and they seem to be a form of kind of propaganda against the liberal left\nNow\nNBC is a mean there are there are NBC's in games gamers do it in the seas are\nOkay a\nActual NBC's or computer controlled characters had video games with limited scripted responses\nI'm given the parameters of the games which they appear for example NBC's may assigned missions to a player like in skyrim\nOr they joined the players a companion like in fall out but they create is NBC mean\nAnd what it is is that it's basically there to um to attack or a mock what it's called left wing propaganda and I think\n... cleverly I I think it's being used cleverly to exploit what we usually hear his program responses regarding things like\nFascism\nWhere it's like not being overused outright connections to the KKK and the NBC me mocks left us and they make it it's basically an expression let's\nFace it is kind of like I'm a statement face in it and and you can see these things on Twitter read it in fortune and over the weekend twin responded by suspending more than Fifteen hundred accounts associated with the NBC means they claim it violated the terms of service namely intentionally misleading election related content\nSeveral months ago unfortunate and read it the online you know where you go to look at messages on fortune read it they started using the term and PC\nTo refer to liberals and these people said well they said that you know they joined the anti Trump crowd because they're sheep\nThey're brainwashed she that's what they believe in and they'd been conditioned apparent left wing orthodoxy in the matter of scripted characters so you look at one of these em PCs they're basically\nThis crudely drawn great cartoon avatar has a pointy noses in a blank face and it's just like a stick figure face in fact if you remember back in Nineteen eighty four when apple had their little commercial about ah the computer\nAnd all these people were sitting the masses we're seeing that they're all bald and kinda like staring like zombies that's exactly what they fit\n\nSexual symbol of at that sort of big brother drone image if you will [noise] so uh [noise] this is a program in a counter programming left and uh it's certainly a\nIs working [noise] it was really irritating view it what does this what's really interesting it got me thinking a lot\nExactly exactly and the point is that people are waking up from the programming and starting to ask questions about the nature of reality itself\nThis ... that ... has just taken off for the last couple of weeks and it's something that we've been talking about seriously for the last two to three years I'm through these ... journey so we've been on um we started to realize there was a light and some people and no lights and others and we were asking ourselves why is this\nAnd as we started to really break down the nature of reality and start to\nRealize that what we're seeing in the ... is is not necessarily energy I mean it is on one sense but on the other sense it is a computer code that we're looking at the computer code of the matrix that started to open up more and more doors and then we have people like Iran must coming out and saying\nThat there's a one in a billion chance that we're not\nWanting to billion chance that we're not\nLiving in a holographic simulated universe and um his reasoning behind that is it's a matrix can be designed it will be designed and beans will eventually be put in there\nAnd if the universe is as old as we believe it to be there has to be a dance beans with the capability to do is I mean we're doing this right now with virtual reality technology we're still at the MTA at the baby stages but one or two more generations and we're going to have totally subversive experiences now what happens if\nWe plug ourselves into one of these machines and we simply can't wake up from it right now what really what really sealed the deal for me\nIt's I'm a professor and a professor gates and um he's a physicist who actually was looking at string theory and discovered a computer code within string theory and this just sealed it for me\nNow it wasn't just any computer code but it was a computer code written by a computer scientist by the name of Claude Shannon in the Nineteen forties now\nI'm sure a lot of people have delved into computer code in one form or another everybody has a website these days so you know how complex computer code is right it's not just finding different symbols and things like that and he's finding a complex computer code within string theory written by a guy in the Nineteen forties\nNoticed you know this reminds me of ... remember the did you ever see the movie pie\nI remember pi yeah the higher\nThe number two sixteen was\nThe number of God and that there was two

she's been coughing and they've been getting it on on on\nOn TV lately\nAnd the thing is is that this all goes back to Pepe the frog\nWhich was a character that they were using to a ... that was I

this up you could miss all out of existence [laughter] Christian do I I mean is this a form of\nBlack magic I mean I thought about that you know I never did talk about Pepe the frog\nAnd the reason why is because I looked at me the frog represented a lot of people have mixed\nMixed feelings about Pepe ... was another one of these meetings where they used Pepe to represent a lot of things from\nRacism to what have you and it was kind of a ... he was just a stupid frog but it was a menacing of the medicine type of me now they have the monkey with this balding it looks like a actually one of the characters that I was too crowded it kinda dreamed up\n\nWell you know what's interesting is um it's central magic as you mentioned before and essential is when an outcome Mr Black magician will take a series of letters or symbols\nAnd you may not necessarily recognize them but I noticed that this Pepe the frog guy he was he was drawn very strangely just like these NBC's The anti seeming trunk very strangely now I'm not that familiar with the cold symbolism but I'm pretty sure that if you look at ... work\nFor something like that you can find something similar with a similar type of symbol that's being blasted on the human consciousness over and over and over again as a matter of fact I'm Crowley how to spell that used to do and it's just something they it was very famous for [noise]\nHe used to be able to take control of the body of one of these and PCs and he was why there's a story of him walking down the street with a sub prime minister or something like that and he says watching this and he points to the guy in front of them any needles down and the guy in front of upstarts kneeling down almost as he is controlling them like a puppet\nNow if one person can do this and matching what's going on through the Internet through the mainstream media so on and so forth and people have lost their ability to think I mean if I can take a political here for just a moment I'm coming into this\nSelection I've just been so jaded by the oligarchy that we've had that I thought that you know it's just going to be the same BS coming through the pike and then with

six six\nThere are plenty of other numbers that are can ruin the Bible the hundred and forty four thousand uh there's always the third like the third of the angels rebelled against God remaining two thirds remained with God and then there was a one third the rebuilding and they remained with state and it's all these magical numbers so if you do the math you got a hundred and forty for thousands of by the by two\nSixteen and get your six six six thick thick thick thick thick thick fat and tonight I'm too divided by three two thirds point six six six number two thirds remained with God eventually became man one third of rebelled against God what was Satan\nSix cube decor six I'm six times fixes to sixteen you divide one hundred forty four thousand by six six six you get to sixteen to sixteen to succeed just added that that\nThat is the workload God that is the key okay and numbers and images and cheese and\nCodes are all part\nOf the matrix system wherein so even God who is the probably the most intelligent program or we have no it was the power of means symbols numbers and coats\nAnd this is white tonight the argument that we're making Chris Jewish Riggio her on the program today the argument the argument that we're making is that we live in a matrix\nAnd the reason why is because in PCs non playing characters are easily program to put the organics the ones that are that they use a good I'd say critical analysis of the ones that will not be programmed and they are the ones\nThat are going to try and pull us out of whatever it is rent otherwise we'll be mesmerized by this online magic Kristy oh I'll go back to ground zero it's good to have a year\n[noise] um let me finish up this point I was making real quick about the politics because here we have the mainstream media I'm putting out a program and the program has been racist racist racist racist thrown at the White House right and then all of a sudden Kanye West shows up\nAnd he has this meeting at the er at the White House and what I saw was the dissolve meant of the left's agenda 'em to divide on race and then the mainstream media turns around and uses a derogatory term against ... that I Will not repeat on this broad to have the N. word but it\nIt go ... and ... to show how the script all of sudden changed what\nHave you ... did you see the the the there was a traffic it was being blocked in Portland the anti five members were blocking and directing traffic well guy pulls up at a car and some guy who's holding a plate of tacos I don't know why but he was with the group and he started yelling at the guy goes you look like a Whitey I bet you're a Whitey aren't you and he says to\nI'm looking at going this guy's a white guy calling another guy Whitey say when I was ... we have a a a black faceless and PC on CNN calling Kanye n n word that can read is what he said\nExactly and so all of a sudden what happens is that the script just changed on the PCs and they don't know how to handle this and it just goes to show they're just running a script\nOr that they've been pre programmed with so um you were talking about numbers and numbers so symbolism and a numbers play a big big role in this you were talking about the ... and PC means the way the means or ... and so on and so forth I mean there are so many different levels that we can take this to mom\nFrom what direction do we break this down in because well I just it's huge I just want to\nPoint out that parents and they can actually called me and this was before this is like not in Nineteen Ninety this is ten Twenty years before this time that we're in right now he's he called the mean\nThe smallest unit of an idea that still has coherent see and what a genius to biology I mean it's to ideology and so you need a lawn chair mean boldly and see if that will replicate just like jeans replicate and in fact and move into the organism that society and believing his idea that society operates on a kind of\nBiological economy and I believe these names are the key to societal evolution\nAnd you see with within PCs I I\nJust have to say it's almost like they they don't understand how to even make means\nIt's that it doesn't make any sense to in order to send them in some way whereas the organics are full of them in and constantly creating these means and they really do change our society and drastic wage very quickly\nWell maybe I could use some other magical terms of people are more familiar with like ... ah there's a ... a mind form that is that when you manifested becomes an ... which is of course another recalled concept which is a thought form or a collective group mind making a thought form that becomes a ton of it's kind of like slender man okay\nI I wouldn't say that ... kind of an egg regards Letterman really\nThe sentiment is is fictional he was made on the Internet okay but he becomes real\nWhen two little girls lure another girl into a playground and ... and stab

a a mean you have a toll but you have an ... and those things are are set out to grow into become either monsters or or to serve in and once again ... the ... says the same thing and what is\nThe un PC me it is the bald\nThe you know ... that basically does the will of its master\nRight exactly and it really it's it's one of the stock changing devices that that is a result it's the backlash against this these autonomy and that mean auto autonomous I guess you could say\nOr anti autonomy thinking process that just totally dissolves any boundaries that that that whenever the media or whatever the the whoever's in control of all this is putting out it dissolves all of that in a in a\nSplit second and it and if that's what makes him so angry about this when ever people do come up with means that really do change people's minds up really quick way well this is ...\nIt was you how to manifest of reality around you so by realizing that we are in a matrix realizing that you have the power inside of you to manifest your own reality what I always tell people as we look at the the huge mountain it's in front of us\nYou know in the church or community and the media community you know all of that and we want to change the world but that's impossible we can't change the world all we can do\nIs just change ourselves but when we can do also is we can pick up a rock and move single rock and then we can show somebody else how to move another rock and pretty soon that entire mountain starts to change that strong\nLittle by little you know I always used to say I used to be a slogan a you know getting the truth about one mind to the time\nAnd it it just seemed to me that that was you know that was spinning back then but now it's the idea of breaking through this\nExcept that emotional bias and getting that out of the ways that we can get down to the bottom of what really is true that the dirty ugly truth but it's supposed to set us free but I say hey you know what what you find out it'll pick you up in the in the process so you got to be careful of what used to do what you think truth is\nAnd get rid of the confirmation bias\nIt's all part of the program and

I come across book after book after book that's basically saying the exact same thing in a very different language\nHum but we're putting it all in modern terms it's\nIt's amazing I never would've thought that we would be breaking these levels of consciousness or that we would even be waking up to the holographic nature of\nReality but when science is backing it up ancient books are backing it up a now we have these means that are floating around in you know these and PC mean sure they're being targeted to the left but it's rooted in some kind of truth I mean it comes from somewhere\nAnd that's the reason why it spreads so so so heavily and the programming is breaking the them at the matrix is breaking and if I can get one more example of how the matrix is breaking\nAnd the glitches um we have all of these Mandela affects where people legitimately believe that Luke IM your father existed in Star Wars I remember Lou ... her father mirror mirror on the wall um in Snow White doesn't exist in this timeline people look at it from timeline shifts and so on and so forth\nI Would say that it's updates coming from this artificial intelligence within the matrix that's hitting our brains and the uptake simply are not sticking anymore and so you have a big portion of the population that remembers ... things the way they were before the matrix was updated\nWell at the same time you had the MPs sees that are being updated almost on a daily basis especially through\nThe data way states that they put themselves in when they're glued to the television are glued to the phone I mean it's getting so bad that they have baby bottles that you put your phone and so you don't have to look at your baby while you're feeding it you can just sit there and be in that data wave state while you're while\nYou're feeding your baby so um it's it's splitting the Vail has split\nSplit right down the middle and consciousness is it's as bad as being revealed for what it is organic and non player character\nI Want to recommend a book and it's a book that uh if you were paying attention is in the matrix in fact that the book where\nI remember those guys come to the door the one girl has the rabbit tattooed on her arm and he's looking for I think med school in some sort of drug and eat and a meal has hidden in the book in his book ... the the drug and the book is called ... civil acreage simulation it's a book by John ... yard\nAnd basically he's talking about this he said you know their relationships between reality symbols numbers", "station": "WXTK", "city": "West Yarmouth"}
