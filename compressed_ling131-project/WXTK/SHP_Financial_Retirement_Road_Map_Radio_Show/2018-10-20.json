national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as a true competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military\nIt's economic it's

any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things um uses the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that ah they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see

every year we go up to celebrate you know ... instead of doing birthday parties right but we do as we get our kids together with my brother his wife and their kids and we go up to New Hampshire and do a lot of different things ... for the weekend so last year to you know this it's kind of tradition now that\nYou know we went up to the polar case I don't know if anyone if you guys were been there but it's on right you know you go down into the caves and come back up and stuff like that and all the ... yeah my ... my ... my five year old actually had a little bit a tough time with that he's not the most ... person but you know kept hitting his head and you know whatever ... up buddy\nYou know he was he was out there you know when one has all of a sudden we went down to ah actually Kennedy like park as well during the day on Saturday\nIt was a good time because they have the screen fest which we don't go to because of the night thing so during the day it's kind of wide open it's nice to be able to\nGo for like three or four hours you know take the kids through to some Halloween stuff so you get the feel there and it was cool see at the fall last Sunday\nWe went to a farm and my wife and I are baby and the two kids were stuck in a cornfield for about an hour and a half a lot of corn Israel last forever and they were like hey Texas number to this if you're lost no service [laughter]\nSo how much less attacks if I don't uh service but there was just the farm though that we went to his endeavors I don't know the name of it off the top of my head but it was unbelievable like how much stuff they have for your kids and stuff for adults is just so much fun\nSo a great weekend overall my you know all the kids enjoyed as part of their birthday for the year\nBecause we I Will last week and we had the I'm doing a lot with football this year my two boys playing you know\nIt was really neat because their conference with breast cancer awareness month ... everyone had pain gone and represented some one kid on our team at a picture of like a friend of his that was going through chemo on his Hillman embedded in so it was really I Try to teach my kids and it's not it and I forget this myself all law but\nJust like driving around or interact with people every day it's like you have no idea\nWhat someone on the other side is even going through right while you're driving down the road and beeping your horn and you know what I mean like\nIt and think of it this way I mean not not to bring business into it but like you think about the market volatility and we'll be touching on that later on today but you know it's obviously it's extremely important a lot of money that that's that's a that's built into that but you know that's what's really important why don't you know down to things like cancer and people that are fighting it\nRight I teach my kids are you guys don't know how would you have it and maybe it's not always going to do this easy in they're going to be obstacles and just remember when you're talking to someone you know before you judge or say anything I mean you have no idea what's going on behind the scenes and I thought you meant the patriots did a good job of having the\nPeople come on the field and gone through are ... are going through cancer everyone knows someone who is touched by that so that's something we don't want to keep keep going and\nUnfortunately I had to have lost my hearing of the year award so no my ... my way [laughter] but my son last week and he's been begging me for his birthday he's ten he wanted to go to a hundred ... house yeah anyone knows for her house probably something you don't bring us too\nBut I was like fine he he kept on all his friends wanted to do on like if I were going to go yet paid for all these tickets fifty dollars apiece browse friends waited in line for a ton of time and they start scaring you in the line yeah we've gotten a little here I had to go towards a haunted house there was I think eight kids one already left\nWith his father was already bailed the round many tears rest every single kid except for one yeah we're crime\nHousing I only had to exit out like this two minutes and we had to exit out maybe\nThat you just have it out for every one of the earth or was he was trying to kill my wife as shy as I can I go with them too I really did and so ... it's so funny on the way to there they were all jumping around to keep their yet or on our cars ... energy yeah on the way home\nThey were the most somber like did not say a word\nThe whole time so if you want to do is go boo hoo yeah right I guess for the kids from a kid's standpoint if you want to relate it to business as this is my ...\nIs like if you're if you're in if you're an entire

H. P. workshops dot com sets either Thursday October twenty fifth\nOr Thursday November first then if you're down in the south shore\nWe have another event near Plymouth office at all then park another nice restaurant near us and we're going to be doing the same event and you have to nice to choose from there as well even November eighth which is a Thursday or Thursday November fifteenth\nSo the register for either of those events you can choose one I go to S. H. P. workshops dot com again that's S. H. P. workshops dot com [noise]\nAll right we know chief everyone stories different everyone situation's different\nBut given the recent market volatility I thought it was important we were talking off line about you know situation that not only stories work out with happy endings unfortunately and this one we did the best end up being happy but it was a little bit of time to get there yeah so if you want to bring everyone back to two thousand eight I think it was the summer of\nTwo thousand two thousand and they you know a couple that I started to have conversations with about working together marking Gina come into the office they come to\nWorship exactly what we were talking you know you were just talking about and they came in to visit with us after that workshop every member mark you know he came in you know and his work clothes you know you just finished up work just kinda dirty because he's a he's a contract he's out there moving things and building things and doing things like that so he had come in\nAnd he was trying to retire in the next three to four months I was his goal\nAnd when we started to talk about I had an advisor to it I did have an advisor that he did he was working with we sat down in the conference room I could just see in mark size and even in jeans eyes because mark has had a lot of stress you know in his career trying to balance he owns his own business he was a sole proprietor\nTrying to balance all these different jobs and he was actually being hands on and some of these jobs as well because he needed to do that I couldn't find help and things like that and you know gene\nWho's getting the kind of the brunt of a lot of the you know the ... the late nights and things like that so there's a lot of stress on both of them therefore you know as a sole proprietor you said you know what I I've had enough I think I've saved enough\nMoney that I could step away from this business\nIn either salad or dissolve it depending on the value and I said okay for his\nMain goals Keith Woods where the where the mark and Jean say they want like what would be a certain amount of income to David amount of money\nSo the main goal was you know she needed to generate about a hundred thousand dollars a year and all we had was Social Security so really he just needed a hundred thousand dollars a year so probably about Seventy thousand sixty Seventy thousand off of his ... portfolio at that point however you know we started to talk and said look you know a hundred thousand dollars\nIn two thousand me a lot different than a hundred thousand dollars and two thousand and Eighteen sure so when we do need to account for inflation and Jean definitely had some concerns\nWhen it came to health care because they were going to be retiring early they needed maybe a little bit even more income up front to supplement and to get them in you know ... to get the health care paid for four in the early years before they get on to Medicare and how much that they face head of a one point of this round up to about one and a half\nMillion in assets that they put away a lot of it was pre tax that he'd been putting away through his company and things like that so we sat down\nAgain they they were about a month to month and a half two months away from retiring so what we did is you know took into account the goals that they were trying to accomplish and you know I said look there's a couple of different things that we that we can do for you to limit limit let's take a step back was set up another time for you guys to come in\nAnd let us do what we do for for the families that we work with which is\nWe want to take a deep dive into the holdings that they had in the account to give them the potential upside that they can make it a good year in the market and the potential downside\nDid they could lose we also want to assess and take a look at any underlying costs beyond what the advisor was charging them and then when we wanted to do is say hey look you know\nYou have about Ninety five percent of your assets directly in the market in about five percent down to local bank and cash or cash like alternative we need to develop a strategy that when mark does retire and his wife said to mark and Jean we need to know where your your money or your paycheck is going to be coming from\nIn the short term or even ... throughout retirement what we did we set up another time for them to come down is really nice to kind of take us to step in and take a look at that because they're advisor they they had been working with and never talk to them about building a plant\nWill keep a two thousand seven and eight ... we were coming off a few good years in the market so at the time was that a concern of there's where they can certainly care I don't want to lose part of this one point five million\nI brought that up to them I had to you know you have to yeah 'cause ... like just like we're seeing now you know ten years into a bull market run the market doesn't go up every year forever\nRight that's where we have a very old bull right now I mean literally it's the oldest bull market in recorded history it's not the strongest but it is the oldest friend a long time so I mean it's you're naive to think it's just going to keep going and that's what I I didn't say that to them but in my mind I said look\nIt's my responsibility as advisor to show them the upside and the downside so when they came back with the results so when they came back you know do good news is they weren't paying a ton of fees that wasn't a big deal to them and that wasn't a big deal to me all however we did address that and did take a look at I did want to educate them on the the fees that they were paying\nHowever what was a little alarming to me was the amount of risk that they were taking in their portfolio you know in a good year they stood to make about thirty two percent\nIn a negative year they stood to lose about thirty so I was like whoa you know that that's you know that's a big downturn to think about that used to give blood sweat and tears one and a half million dollars if you lose diamond without yeah if you lose five hundred thousand dollars that that's a big what they did is they actually\nYou know showing the plan children the income strategy exactly how we would build out their plan reduced some reduced some risk give them some upside but also get what we call that paycheck or that mailbox money whether it's through the market or other avenues and they had enough to go through it had it in all their goals perfect you know their retirement would've been a clear nice concise picture\nWe've been able to manage it for them they took a step back\nWent to visit with their advisor and their bodies are kind of talk them off the ledge cast for lack of better way of putting\n... and left and said let's leave it where it is sort of member\nHim saying or her I forget what the advisor but they said it was too conservative right correct taking too you know you're gonna miss these big years in the market if you go this route\nRight and I would I turn around and said hey look when you retire to vote singles doubles not home runs the\nEspecially when they ... ... not enough they had enough they won the retirement gay and they saved up enough where Keith was able to build a plane with our team here at S. H. P. and two thousand eight\nFor them to get through the rest of their lives hundred thousand dollars a year with inflation unfortunately as key to saying they're advisor of course everybody's is not going to say yeah go ahead leave us and go to this other from they stay put they didn't make the move\nThey didn't make the move and obviously we know what happened in two thousand and eight so we kept in communication over the next few years finally\nTwo thousand Thirteen you know we'd been sitting down year after year kind of saying okay where are you where are you is this a good time is this a good time because once that happened he knew he wasn't getting the right advice\nFrom his advisors he wasn't getting you know the right advice from his advisor to put him in the best position so around two thousand Thirteen is when they felt comfortable and we felt comfortable that you are taking another look at this with inflationary costs and things like that they were able to retire so really by\nBy not executing the planet costs him a lot more you're more than you know assets it costs them time\nYou know how much I guess by the time they when they came many years about two thousand nine to one point five million what was it down to at that point\nIt was about a little under a little little under a million dollars she's and then basically we let it we ... we let it grow and then you know like I said what's not only that they lose money they last time in retirement because that's the one thing we don't get back to go back to work he had to go he had to keep working just had to keep working keep keep the business going", "show_name": "SHP Financial Retirement Road Map Radio Show", "year": "2018", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "20"}
