own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody how did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional\nEnergy drugs or something\nI practice something called modern actresses and\nAnd that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them and it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative\nSpirits and so they are uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people\nThis emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that and they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nBoth kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is sick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed by somebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit\nOr that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first sometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a free is I Would say that I'm an independent freeze say Sharmeen freeze exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who\nAre agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal feelings I wasn't touching anybody anyway it's really\nIt's not necessary there's no such thing as as a distance on a non physical level it doesn't matter\nAs long as you have focused each one of us is the complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it and it it's it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates\nAnd spirits need to be\nDealt with you know some times are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of\nFamily that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional but have it where it all at once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply cleaner own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist in every religion and not the only one\nOr that are qualified extra system just about every religion\nBut they all but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are\nThis universe I said before on on one of my appearances this universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you\nKnow do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which haunt me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians

listening to this show\nNeeds five different areas that went to dress properly can lead to really high end chance of success in retirement in those areas are one an income plan to an investment plan\nThree attacks plan for health care plan and five a legacy an estate plan because let's face it as you're listening right now I'm sure whether you have this or not you probably want to make sure you have an income that lasts as long as you do\nYou probably want to make sure in in that income plan their Social Security maximus Asian their spousal strategies there's inflation built into your income stream\nWith your investment plan you want to reduce your volatility and make sure it's your portfolio matches your risk tolerance with taxes you want to make sure you're saving both now and in the future you're saving legally and ethically the taxes that maybe you over paying are right now when it comes to health care people are so concerned about addressing healthcare as they retire and\nThen like a scene estate planning maximizing what's left to the next generation as efficiently as possible and ... as we know it's not the differences\nEveryone that you hear on the radio I we were the best to Social Security plan and we do investments we do legacy here what we do is our five step process is all at one spot\nOftentimes people ask me why we went into business so why did we go independent in ... we found there's multiple reasons for that but we found that there was just a lack of comprehensive planning out there that you know is that about certain people on the radio that they would focus or specialize on this or specialize on that I mean\nWhen you study the industry you find out that the people that have ten million dollars or more they're getting all of this detail they're getting all this focus\nWell everyone deserves that everyone is listening to the show deserves the attention to detail to make sure they have mapped out income plan and investment all those things that you were just mentioning and that's why when independent why we formed us age ...\nAnd she says you know what I mean and this the three of us a few years ago and we've been lucky enough and blessed and we thank God every day that we have this company and his team in place in the clients are so great that we deal with every day that we can sit here and coasts and not take on one more client and be okay\nBut we decided this is what you know when we do different trainings across the country in different areas that we work with\nWe see that we do have some that's different and we do have something that can actually help people and help you listening get too into retirement it's not just fluff that we're here talking on the radio it's a real proven process that can help folks build a plan and give them confidence as into retirement Keith\nWas funny 'cause one of the biggest questions we asked when folks come in and visit with us is when I retire what is my retirement could look like and just sit down and go through their whole plan comprehensively and below the national income strategy and investment strategy and then take a look at everything from attacks standpoint [noise]\nMake sure that the health care is taking care of and then the final piece as make sure that you know when that time comes many many years down the road and there are no longer with us is that money's transition to the next generation empowers them and it gives them the big C word as they enter retirement confidence\nWell it's it's amazing chief in in the best way I can tell the listeners or or just explain to you what the power of this retirement road map process can do um I had a couple that I met with literally two years ago\nAnd it was ... billion Angela and they had about five hundred thousand dollars saved to retirement and they're both sixty four at the time\nAnd one of the first questions I asked them which is one of the most common concerns that we see is\nWhen do you want to retire when is your target retirement date\nAnd you know what their answer was keep them out\nTo will never be able to retire I Am or what they said look me in the eyes so we're never going to be able to retire it you know I'm almost embarrassed to be here because we haven't saved enough money for our situation\nAnd said well let me just crunch the numbers for let me take some time and see we can do ever angel said listen we only have five hundred thousand dollars I Know it's I Know we're not going to be able to make it\nCan just tell you man keys that they were able to make it in\nThis is what I Love about this industry is ... being the bearer of actually good news as opposed to being the bearer of bad news and I saw in their idea was to retire by ... sixty eight which they knew they couldn't and they said we may still work you know until sixty eight but we saw that said you know we can actually build a plan where you can retire in two\nYears at age sixty six and guess what happened a few months ago to the they retired or ... them\nAnd now they do things like the the neat part about it I was just talking to her the other day and now they're setting up trips a family trip they've always wanted to take their doing things they never imagined possible just by because we took the time and they took their time to do what they picked up the phone and called her and called us\nAnd so that's all that's all that it took and I love working with awesome families and I love working with people that initially think\nThey have no chance are retiring and being the bearer of good news and saying hey guess what\nLet's look at your information you actually can retire and here's when you can do it that's the best part of our job so as you are

plan that can help you get you into retirement in his help so many clients that we work with\nGet two and three retirements since we open the doors to S H P financial way back in two thousand three myself Keith ... started this and like we mentioned earlier folks\nWe can we say a few years ago we said you know we can sit back and coast and just keep the clients happy and maintain our client base but we want it to help more people that are passionate about and we have a process and planting tool that can help you\nGet to and through retirement so why not continue to utilize it so what is the first segment we talked about number one ... one of our five step planning process which is building an income plan you can't have a retirement unless you have an income plan that delivers that monthly mailbox money each and every month to last as long as you do\nStep two of our five step process is an investment plan she might be thinking\nEveryone has an investment plan everyone has investments that ... you know you have mutual funds stocks bonds annuities alternative investments\nAll these other areas but the most concern anything that I see when it comes to investment planning\nIs controlling volatility\nWith in your portfolio let me see it again the most important part of investment planning when you're getting close to her in retirement is to control the amount of volatility or you know huge potential down swing potential in your portfolio in I mean that could be the difference between success and failure for many people listening to\nThe show no ... absolutely and and the other great way of summarizing that is that when you when you enter retirement it's all about Hank hidden singles you know what I'm trying to hit homeruns anymore we're just trying to be consistent\nYou know and made me think of a you know a couple of clients that came in recently Brian I'm Michelle you know Brian was a carpenter Michelle was still working and she was at a commute that she hated I mean she was literally go into the south shore\nUp to the north shore on a daily basis and was just as unhappy as as can be and so they they were nervous too when they came in because Michael just recently been laid off from his job and it's kind of doing a job and doing carpentry work\nAnd he was just saying All right well I you know all she has four one K.\nAnd it was all in the market at that point and so we\nOught to see you know we did step one which is to set up their income plan and talk about okay if he if he collect Social Security now okay and if you continue to work and and what it is that we set it up so that you know in anywhere from six months to a year's time if the commute was just too much for her then she would retire at that time\nBy cutting that four one K. out of ... not just the growth bucket now from cutting that for one case into some into a big chunk of the income you know fixed income fixed annuities things like that and the other chunk we let grow\nWe just said look you know Michelle it no matter what happens if there is a market correction there were any time that's going to happen to the next year you will not be impacted by\nIn other words the market is not going to dictate when that commute is too much for you if you just don't want that commute we've set it up so that we used to have your portfolio so the minute that you are done working\nThen we know exactly what bucket when we're going to withdraw money from and exactly what money were no let grow so that winning that volatility kicks in and then that correction happened it does not affect Michelle and Brian's life\nAnd that we're having when when she left the office after telling her that and then you know good doing reviews you know after plans establish it's just it's it's so nice to reminder\nLike oh no no in in that she retired ... ... that's what's funny so then literally about a couple of weeks ago I spoke to a recently and she ended up getting transferred in in ... ah on to the south shore so now she's now she's like I'm at I'm gonna work for a couple more years\nFrom now imagine her feeling knowing that she's going to work every day knowing that she can stop when she wants exaggerating that is a much better way to go to work then to wonder like a lot of people are wondering right now of hey how long it might have to do this for\n... absolutely and also to just to be able to when I was talking to her about how she just got transferred to a shorter commute just saying but look you know Michelle don't worry about it if the ... it just so we felt so good for me to tell her to remind her that hey if the market falls don't worry about it we have a plant\nYeah so I was able to tell her what happens you know so when all this market stuff's happening all his news hitting and everything else I can say here here's what it means to you and it doesn't mean much because we were able to set up the portfolio to set up the investment planned the right way\nCorrect and a lot of people that come into our office you know we still use the market as a tool for many of the folks every work with it's a good long term investment strategy\nBut if all of your money is subject to full risk keys\nThat's I mean think about if you're fully in the market you basically wake up every single year knowing you might make forty percent\nOr you might lose forty percent so if you're a million dollars yeah might make four hundred this year or I might end up next year six hundred thousand which is almost half of all the money I've said to my entire life and so to me that's the first thing when it comes to a what we call the volatility control I mean you worked your entire life to get to this point\nWhy you're taking chances and do you know did you even know that there are strategies available right now where you are we utilize all the time where you can take advantage of the upside of the market\nAnd but you're not going to take the same downside risk in a lot of clients we tell them every single day I said listen I'd much rather and hope that this is listening right now take take take us into consideration because maybe we're not the right from because here's a conversation I have some times\nHey Mr Mrs Jones I'd much rather you'd be mad at me because the market's up twenty and you're only up fourteen percent\nTend to be mad at me because the markets down forty percent and so are you in your retirement is over and you have to go back to work peace I mean that's that's the whole the Iraqis\nAre a hundred percent it's controlling the volatility it's setting up the plane correctly\nIn our philosophy since we started building these retirement a road map says you need money for safety\nMoney for income and once you have those two buckets built which to me I kind of draw a line in the sand there and say look safety and income what did he protected you protected your lifestyle that's awesome that's a that's a that's the biggest thing\nWe're trying to do for the folks that we work with us look like Matt said earlier with his clients\nAnd he gave them the ability to say look I don't want to drive to the north shore anymore if I don't want to I can walk away if I Want to it's a liberating experience you know\nWe're helping them protect their lifestyle now once that's done\nYou have that third bucket which is growth\nThen what goes into a bucket for growth is determined you know in a conversation between us because we have some current clients that are a little bit more maybe on the aggressive side in that growth bucket but then we have those clients that are still more conservative but we don't want that growth bucket to affect\nYou know whether you can take a trip that year or whether you can go visit your grandkids or whether you can buy a new car or whatever it is you're trying to do on a month to month year to year basis\nWill simple symbol that will keep saying right there is unique time in the market if you're going to be in the market you need time\nSo our clients were only advise and the only a portion of their money that we have invested for them stays in the market and we use other alternatives when it comes to getting their safety getting the income they need you know you don't want that to be marketing generated because if it's all in the market and you're a million dollars and you retire and the next year you're six hundred thousand\nWhat is that going to duty or retirement so an example uh now I'm not a you know we had a recent climbed that came in as well and Mike was a veterinarian and his wife Joanne is retired a few years back and they had about a million five\nAnd I the first question they asked them as\nWhat's the most you could lose in this portfolio without really for lack of a better word freaking out getting super nervous\nWell you know 'cause you're dispersed she was sixty in his early sixties he was going to retire and two or three years and he said if I lost by one point five million is if I lost more than two hundred thousand dollars or ten Fifteen per se you know you know ten Fifteen Percent I'd be super super nervous\nWell I'm Glad he came in because we were we ran scandals portfolio to see what ... to see how much risk he was taking and in reality if we had another downturn like two thousand eight he would lose about forty or fifty percent of its portfolio is seven hundred thousand dollars if that happened\nHe was walking but I called mentioned having two tall buildings in a tight rope in between them\nAnd the only way to get from one side of the ... the other is to take a tight rope if you have one slip\nIt's over your retirements over if you have all that risking your portfolio and we have one mess up in the market corrects like does every bunch of years\nThat's it you're going back to work and that's I hate to say it but I'm just being honest what we try to do\nIs okay we don't want to get you from one building to the other but we'll build a bridge\nAnd then we'll put a safety net underneath that say you can comfortably walk across so seeing things that come when it comes to you planning the retirement taking volatility reducing volatility in your portfolio is so important and that's what we can do again when I talked about Michael enjoying it took them a phone call so take the time\nPick up the phone right now we can call right now we have five appointment set aside for you over the next two weeks the number is eight hundred to two seven Seventy seven Seventy seven and when you come in\nWe're going to run a risk analysis to see how much risk you're taking your portfolio and if it's appropriate you might be have sitting on a million dollars with a potential lose four hundred thousand next year", "year": "2018", "show_name": "SHP Financial Retirement Road Map Radio Show", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "13"}
