restaurants against the backdrop of sale mode and the vineyards down register now at Ninety five nobody went to see gay dot com okay\n\nHaving a great day you know it's funny just to kind of go back to why we won that sort of retail to the Stephen Lynch story it just\nYou know just the importance of diversification ... you know talk that theme all the way through and I think kind of pop into our minds mainly because you know it's like All right well you know just to talk of specifically it's like All right you know over the past weekend you know mosque is almost out and then the Tesla stock dropped you know twenty percent\nAnd then over the weekend a deal is made and jumps backup sixteen percent on Monday or whatever it was and so\nI pointed out you know in similar to the uh the trade deal all these things are happening and no one can predict any of that however if you have a nice well diversified unorganized portfolio and I'm saying that that are completely protects you from all this stuff but at least you're just sort of you have a foot ... all the camps and so you just ready to go when the time comes so\nI think that's what I just wanted to share that because you know just to\nThat though I wanted to bring that story is Steven lives by one to bring that back up because I think it's I think it's the added right now\nAnd I even talk we had a client come in or someone not clients someone I came from the radio and they want to take advantage of a no obligation consultation some people they'll come in in in their goal is to have a million dollars I Want to try to get the two million in the next five to seven years\nAnd it's like um you don't want to be rude but that's that is not someone that would be a good fit for us right Keith in terms of what our goals are because we're not trying to double someone's money in three to five years she's not ...\nRight and not only that you talk to them and say you know why do you want to do that and they are and that's what they in you know in their minds that's what they think they need to be able to retire successfully but then when you kind of pull back and start to ask them questions around their situation\nYou could say hey look you know you don't need two million dollars to retire ... based upon\nYou know what it is that you need on a day to day month to month basis so they're really focusing on the wrong number one of the things I think that we do well is dive in and build in what's called the goal based plant every family is different every one situation is different everyone's goals are different\nSo it's up to us as independent financial planners to be able to work with each family to discover their goals what it is they want to do and help them achieve from ... to interrupt but but it it is also just going to pick up on what keeps saying about the gold based plan I mean you know just to combine that with the idea of diversification\nIs that everything should be diversified you know you should have an income plan a legacy planned to health care plan and you should have a diverse and you know diversity within your planning\nBut also specifically just putting my mind is the tax planning you should have diversification within ... in your tax absolutely you know do you have IRA money ... money and after tax money you know ... you know do you have different areas because we love that so\nSo the whole idea diversification in applies to planning to making sure you have all five areas it applies to investments it ... it applies to specifically within your taxes themselves\nI mean these are just all areas that need to be focusing on for a true and comprehensive plan\nAnd most people that I say I'm going to continue to say this until everyone gets the plan and they deserve it a lot of people come in and they have a bunch of investments and or like you said ... maybe they have like a million to in IRAs and like thirty thousand and raw and ... and checking in savings\nAnd there's there's not really a lot of balance there from attack standpoint so we try to create tax the risk vacation we try to keep ... acid diversification\nAnd we try to create planning diversification meaning\nEveryone if you're thinking about retirement when you're younger and you're working you're just putting money away you don't really in in in essence obviously I think everyone should have some sort of an estate plan but a lot of what you're doing is ... it's just investment planning you're not worried about income because you have an income from your job\nYou're not really too worried as you know health care situations could come up most likely as you're older you're not worried about that\nWhen you're getting close to retire if you if all you have is investments thinking about what your plan is right now you just have a bunch of investments or do you have a fully written plan that looks at income meaning where is your income going to come from when you retire not just from one portfolio but how is it going to come out\nAnd they'd be going to be all pre taxes are going to be tax free what's a combination do you know how to plan your income so last as long as you do and make sure your accounts are set up properly to give you the income you need to retire and\nThen we look at investments that is what as you get close to retirement we'll talk about this later in the show but I think you need to look at investments maybe giving some up off the upside it's okay if you don't hit thirty percent in a good year maybe you only get twenty two\nBut that's okay 'cause you know maybe if you get twenty two when it's a thirty maybe you'll only lose Fifteen when it's down thirty if that makes sense so really you want to have some balance from an investment standpoint in diversification then we talked about taxes how do you create the tax efficient plan\nAs you get close to retirement in ... in retirement as well as leaving money to the next generation\nWe talk about health care and we talk about state planning and legacy planning leaving assets to those who you care most about and so that's what it all comes down to is having a plan that covers each and every area not just a pile of investments and so we think think about in your lifetime\nWhat you've done to get to where you are now and what does that mean to you and do you think you just want to have a bunch of investments and hope it goes right or do you want to have a plan that make you know looks at every single area to make sure it's uncovered so you can retire with a little bit more confidence you know going into your these years can be twenty Thirty years of retirement\nThat sort of thing and so that's an order short on time but like\nThe whole idea of making sure that people are aware of how much work this is ... there's so much to it and so I that's why I just want to really emphasize I cut you off that that that's the whole you know that's why you know 'cause I appreciate when people are like oh you know what to do it myself it's like a appreciate that 'cause I Love doing this too\nBut it's a fulltime job yeah so do you really want to do that in your retirement\nYeah I mean if you and some people do if you don't want if you don't want to travel as much and do as much and and be able to run everything that's fine we completely respect that\nBut if you're not sure or maybe you say hey maybe I Want to get a second opinion maybe you're someone who does nothing and doesn't want to do some retirement and wants to rely on to a professional you'd want to come and obviously and sit down or maybe you're someone who's not sure and say maybe I Want to run some of this myself\nMaybe I Need a second set of eyes again that might be a reason to come down

I still come into that we do encounter people that are that close to retirement and still don't have something written exactly what they're taking money from\nMentioned the patriots show up to a Super Bowl and like Braves about take the field okay what's the game plans like what you're talking about we don't have a game plan well matched that see that's just a football game this is your whole life is is retirement and so he and he also said you know not only that we don't have a plan but we also haven't talked about taxes inflation\nHealth care all that stuff as well I said All right and I said what are your main concerns what do you have and they were lucky enough they worked hard and they saved up a little over one point five million dollars between IRAs a little bit and Ross in some some after tax accounts\nAnd I said what are your main concerns he goes well two things I Need sixty thousand dollars per year off my portfolio and I said why of course I said why why didn't you that\nYou think will that be between that sixty thousand my Social Security and a small pension I'll have a good chunk of income coming in every year and I said well why do you want that income he's equal number wants to pay the bills number two I Want to buy a motor home and travel the country for a few years and number three I Want to take a big trip every year with my family\nAnd so now we're getting to the heart of really wire here and I said what else are you concerned about he's like I'm really concerned about leading money behind to list or making sure she's taking care of\nIf something happens to me\nThat's that's on honorable and and I said you know the reason I Know he really meant that is because if someone says at once I write it down if someone says it twice I Know on it and if someone says it three times I circled it and I was that that paper was circled on the line and everything was dies yeah everything on it was a lot of damage that's part of the paper [laughter]\nAnd so I said since you're retiring in in four weeks I'm assuming you advise is already set yourself up for this and he goes yeah I'm sure you already did and I said well you are you sure you're here for a second opinion you you really open to a second opinion because if we're going to really dig deep into your situation\nAs the number one do you mind if you ask how much you're paying and sees he said oh he takes care of me you know because we were good friends she only charges me point eight five percent per year he's like I Know most people are one one and a half I'm only paying point eight five like that's not bad I'm like the Hubble these mutual funds and other things you own he said well\nNo there's no fee and that's just paint pointing five and I said All right do you mind I Know you're paying twenty five but you mind if I just run the analysis for you\nAnd just see what you're paying and total he said I Know it's going to be twenty five but go ahead sorry I'm going to do that because if you're open to if you really open to it I'm going to run the real mouse and secondly I said how much risk in your portfolio do you have in my question was you one point five million what's the most and this is something if you if you're if you've nodded off during my initials talk you hear\nThis is one thing you want to remember 'cause I asked him what's the most you be willing to lose\nIn a given year without totally losing air being super nervous he saw that one was anything I said Steve come on you got to pay to play this is the market here you have all your money in the market he said find ten percent\nIt and just I mean that's a great question for all of our listeners should ask themselves how much at this stage in your life how much are you willing to lose before you start hitting the panic button and just take your time and just ask yourself that question how much willing to lose at this point in my life and then do you know the answer\nWell he said ten percent finding out which is a hundred fifty thousand dollars he goes I get nervous when are you saying that but I guess I Am at one point five million if I lost a hundred and fifty I'd be okay\nI said All right well let's we're going to run your portfolio from arrest standpoint from a fee standpoint we're gonna run an income analysis to see if you have enough income in cash flow coming in to cover your needs and achieve their goals and finally a roadmap which outlines of five areas of of our planning process income investments taxes healthcare\nSee he said fine he's leaving we ... we scheduled a second meeting and as I'm walking you know I said you might have next meeting you bring your wife back you mind if you bring Liz back\nHe's got she's not going to want to calm she doesn't she thinks he's meetings a super boring I kind of got a chuckle out of that and I said well just to our favorite tell her Derek said it I think it's important for her to come back and be involved in this process and he said fine that's ... we'll see I'll do it I can see what I can do fast forward I'm not going to I don't want to make a story longer than it has to be but when they came back in\n... in between the meanings actually we were running the analysis\nAnd it's like it was a different person he said he didn't want to lose a certain amount of money he said he had he was only paying a certain amount of fees and I was looking at the analysis my team ran it was like you sure this is Steve and Liz is not what he thinks he has\nSo we came back in and I walk into the conference room and there Steve next to him is his wife list and she was he was right she was not happy to be they're\nNot really involved but I started talking and going through the situation nonetheless and I said you know you're right Steve you guys both have enough income to cover their selves and he felt he was a good I knew my advice did a good job I said if you both at the age Ninety\nAny kind of looked at me and I said if you happen to pass away at Seventy five list is going to run out of money at eighty so just make sure you have to be Ninety and he didn't like that too much as it also your fees you several point eight five percent at one point five million\nIranian ... with your ... advisory fees and mutual funds you're paying one point for six percent per year for Twenty one thousand nine hundred ... and lives finally started paying attention looking at the Pew serious the why are we paying this much money you might pay twenty thousand dollars you know we could do that in terms of travel each year\nAnd then finally I said listen I remember the memories of the most you could lose off of you at one point five million dollar portfolio\nWas ten percent or you would not be able to you'd be really nervous and he said yeah\nI said I ran the analysis if we had another down market you would lose over four hundred and fifty thousand dollars and that kind of pause and and and I knew lives was fully ... paying attention she was not born anymore and she was like listen she looked at her she'll go to Steve and she's like", "year": "2018", "show_name": "SHP Financial Retirement Road
