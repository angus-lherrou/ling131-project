{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "Never got around to doing it I got busy doing other stories but what they had done as they they had carved out an entire woolly mammoth a carcass if you will but pretty well preserved because it was the ice and they were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryers and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of\nUh trying to get their hands on some DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now are including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade and\nWe're gonna traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were to find the natural order of things and he kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yet none nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for us but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits in suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're\nYou're fighting against you know a billion a cart into science you know billions of years of evolution right are we to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not hosting the debt smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the song but he\nRecently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt ... it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they can control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating\nWill run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go you\nKnow ... you\nWrite an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's pretty that writing is on the wall in I mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become ... they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about or we want supposed about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... it just ended up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day when all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and it\nI think the interesting these are the two is it that the equation is was used in a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nSo ... are like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a\nYeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers yes raising with that the right now I fully believe that completely senator and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour because I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships [noise]\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile\nAnd people would like to think cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the future we'll get back to the thought with Michael Guillen loss of shooting the numbers coming up and about thirty minutes for you to join the conversation and then it's open lines for the rest of the night coast to coast am\nIn for George ...

ordinary people because that's what they are they are the ones like two million members him for men and women who superpowers happy and the desire to well\nThan the next time you need to have\nThem look in the sky look in the ...\nLearn at rotary Donilon rotary humanity in motion [noise]\nBelieve in savings are gone\nYesterday I was just show us in a T shirt\nAnd like boom all the ... yeah I really do have to bundle of it's kinda it's crazy man it's it's unbelievable how fast you know the the weather changes in time goes and you know we're almost here in November\nFor we know and we celebrate the holidays and boom new here well I mean that's the thing to another state went about retirement planning today but I mean it's just that that that's why we feel\nThat's why we kind of hit that hit that drama that bill every week is because I mean you need to have a plan because time flies it's ridiculous it's like ... your retirement no matter what age you are but this way 'cause I Know a couple of us celebrated a birthday a recently so it's like\nIt's a it's a you know that even if you're just starting out retirement comes pretty quickly much less if you're five years away from it three years one year whatever it is I mean that that a time flies you need to be ready for that\nYeah it's amazing just like we last uh last Sunday after the patriots game we ... my\nWife and I have two boys is not going up on the couch watching a it was considered a scary movie it was little monsters member that was spread Savage [laughter]\nAnd how a man do good in the course of course ... my ... like this is basically the whole idea is that the ... like there's a secret pathway into every kid's bed okay us to like this like monster world whatever yeah of course I go upstairs and I'm like I'm going to go into your bed to my kids ... and then\nI pay the price can it's like oh you know Nikki lay down me until I fall or just laying them and I look at him like I don't have many years to do this yeah I mean and just where they'll even want to hug me are right next to me and watch a movie it just it's it's sad and you think about a lot of people when it comes to retire and playing the same thing they don't\nThey don't you don't expect like you don't think the kids going to be Fifteen Twenty years old right until it happens and then you start regretting what you didn't do with them or time you didn't spend with them and same with a retirement planning\nI mean we'll think of it this way I mean like we're all running around doing a thousand things a day you know we were just real busy whether it's on our phones or our email a driving here driving they're caught in traffic or whatever it is so he just moving a million miles an hour\nAnd to see sort of hit the pause button you know whether whether it's with family or whether it's with retirement planning I mean\nIt's sort of falls into the same category of like yeah I'll I'll I'm going to think about that but I don't have time right now you know and and really just you know it's I think it's dates like that or or you know moments like that where you just try to push it\nPush it to the front burner and say no we need to deal with that thinking about how quickly time flies family wise\nOr just about you know planning on getting all of your you know ducks in a row because now that a clock strikes midnight\nWas ... you know a lot of people listening in their late fifties early sixties\nTen Fifteen Years ago wasn't that long ago like right two thousand eight when the I think when the patriots went undefeated know seven eleven years ago you know what I write off you're forty five that now you're fifty six and I get really starting to get closer to that retirement day and so I Would I Want to mention here is like\nIf you think of I I'd say ... but a lot of clients ask us in in ... we have different events for our clients and whatnot now so you know it's\nYou know I really appreciate you know how you guys have grown over the years and you know what's the biggest thing what's the main difference of why if you grow so much and I know my answer is obviously number one\nWe've ever we've always told our staff and in each other put decline if you put the client's first everything will work out in the end which is should be a role for every company does some and then secondly I think\nThat having a place especially with the time constraints now of people that are listening and in in a lot of our clients they don't have time to spend sixty have sixteen meetings to have their\nTo go to this person to do their Social Security analysis and in person to do their a decent tax analysis on their portfolio this person to manage your money so are most companies right now\nHave they manage your money so you pay them at the end in return they manage your portfolio they pick stocks mutual funds bonds index funds ATF they put a portfolio together meat you once a year to you if you're doing good or bad\nAnd then what's the last ten years had been really good and then you move on and so we said that's that's good and that's good planning but if you're paying one percent a year to just do that\nTo me that's not a ton of value and so that's HP financial we build our clients an investment plan that's managed in the market according to their risk tolerance which is a big that's what everyone does in our in our industry\nBut then we also take it one step further as part of our retirement road map planning a trademarked plan that we do for our clients\nAfter we build the investment plan we build I'm also an income plans for our clients have an income plan they know where their money's coming from in retirement\nSoon have to worry about it whereas my paycheck going to come from when I retire because retirement could be Thirty years of unemployment so you have an income plan that lasts as long as you do with inflation you have an investment plan next step you look at is taxes year in in Europe are there ways we can save on taxes for you and the next generation\nMaybe we can save you ten twenty thousand this year maybe nothing next year maybe more afterwards\nBut each year you have to make sure that someone's taking a look at taxing goes in your portfolio ongoing next to health care I mean the study of cost of health care goes up and up and up and so if we neglect that if we don't look at health care as a retirement expense\nAgain we're missing the boat final piece estate planning and legacy how do you take all the assets that you've worked so hard to save up and pass them to the next generation so again that's when I asked when I'm going back to the question how we grown so much over the last ten Fifteen Years since we started in two thousand three\nIs taking care of our clients putting them ahead of ourselves obviously which is anyone can say it sounds like you know normal\n[laughter] you know talk that ... million you will but it's true\nAnd the second thing is obviously having a plan our clients have a full retirement road map to get to and through retirement it's not just hey here's a bunch of money invested for me and tell me if I made money or lost money it's a plant it's a road map and that's and it looks at income investments taxes health care and legacy\nNot only in the beginning but ongoing it's not et cetera and forget it so if you're listening\nTo the not sure maybe you think you have a plan but maybe you just have a bunch of statements\nMaybe you have an advisor and you're not sure if they're doing all these things for you or maybe you've been like not talked about so busy working so busy with family and lifestyle and just you haven't had time like many people that come in to see us like you know I've been wanting to do

obviously every story is different and not everyone situation it's the same\nBut I figured you could relate to the story because we ended last segment\nTalking about the major the major golden rules have retirement planning in the final rule that we gave which is real number five was to make sure you have a plan in place before retiring and don't don't just be reactive and retire and say oh wait I Need a plan\nBecause everyone knows it's a lot better to have a plan in place before you retire than waiting to retire and then trying to scramble at the last minute so\nMark and Karen had hurt our radio show for about four or five years they we've been on we've been on the station to think about ... close to ten years on the radio and they had heard us for the last four or five years and they were in their fifties when they started listening to us and after a while they they they said they wanted to come in three or four years ago but\nLike a lot of other folks they'd been procrastinating\nSo as we go through the story I Want you to think about whether or not it makes sense to come in\nFor a review see if some of these areas that we're talking about makes sense to you as they did to mark and Karen\nSome marketing Karen really they had a few concerns that came in from the radio show and when they first met I could tell they were a little apprehensive you know the it's not something you do every day to go through\nYou know open up your finances and share your life story and what your goals are and family goals and you know income goals and just a it's a big deal and they so they were a little apprehensive just nervous just warming up a little bit at once but once we\nGot to know each other and got to know their situation it became apparent we were going to be able to help them out quite a bit and so I was talking to mark and Karen in that first meeting and they had really a few major goals\nNumber one remember their sixty two years old and they came in a few months ago so this isn't an old case they really wanted to make sure they retire between age sixty five and sixty six they've saved up bought a million thirty thousand dollars so they had about nine hundred and Seventy thousand dollars in the market\nIn about fifty to sixty thousand dollars in bank account so little over a million dollars\nMajor things they were concerned about is when I retire\nWhere's my income going to come from how am I going to have the income I Need to cover all my bills and not worry about running out of money because they're only going to have Social Security there was no pension there was no rental income there were only going to have Social Security income secondly\nThey were concerned about volatility they said you know what dark I've heard your show I Know the market's been up for ten years in a row\nDo what you know I'm concerned that if the bottom dropped so how is that going to affect our retirement and I remember Karen than like you know Mark's worked really hard and and and I've worked really hard and we want to retire in the last thing we want to do is not to plan properly and have to go back to work [noise]\nThe other thing they were concerned about is a state planning they were concerned about just having a solid state planned for their like a trust will that it that they had never set up for their children and then finally they were concerned about fees\nThey had an advisor they had they had worked with for many many years and they didn't really know the total fee they were paying they knew there are paying a management fee of around one point two five percent\nBut they didn't know how much the underlying assets cost them on top of that like the mutual fund cos so again major concerns were how much they're paying fees estate planning\nHow much risk or volatility within their portfolio and how much income they could draw from when they retired or do they have enough they needed about eighty thousand dollars per year\nBut that was after taxes key they needed really over a hundred thousand dollars close to run around a hundred thousand dollars gross\nSo after taxes they could have ... eighty thousand dollars now than it needs to go up every year great point and that has to go for inflation so the first thing easy solution based on their situation\nThey were able to use the violence suspend technique with Social Security which some people can't use but basically when mark triggers his Social Security is sixty six\n... then at that point Karen can take half of his and delay hers even longer set by the time she's Seventy she can now get hers and it goes up so that was a cook strategy that made him a good chunk of money very quickly\nSecondly we looked at from an income scenario and an investment scenario they had we we looked at their ... their portfolio to see how much risk they were taking and so this is if you forget everything else about the show to me having volatility control in your plan when you're close to\nOr in retirement might be the most important thing you do for your retirement plan because too much volatility\nEarly on in their retirement can literally wipe out a retirement and we've seen numerous examples unfortunately of of people that have come to us in ... or a potential clients that have come to us too late where it was too late to do anything [noise] fortunately marking Karen had saved up this money in but when I ran an analysis think of like\nAs a a risk score zero to a hundred so if all your money is under your mattress well I guess that's in all your money in a fireproof safe in a place that no one can touch it and that would be a risk we're looking at zero and if all your money is an Enron stock well\nThat would be like a hundred and Ninety nine and so they came in and they had a risk score of uh Seventy so you're probably wondering what does that mean to them what to Seventy\nSo when I ran the analysis on their current portfolio they told me there ... were concerned are advisor we've told him we want to take on less risk as we get older we're concerned that this is not being done when I looked at their portfolio and they came in for the second meeting I\nSaid hey mark herring you're you're absolutely right you know if the way it stands at a Seventy\nIf the market where to go up if we had like a two thousand Thirteen tight market where we consider that a bull market like a really good strong upward market you'd ... you'd probably earn about thirty percent at your current risk or which is what should a quaint two uh two hundred and Ninety thousand dollar game\nHowever if we had a a really bad year like two thousand eight at your current risk level that would be a loss of three hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars\nAnd ... and at that point it remember mark looking at Karen and he's like that's like that's the thing about that the most that's over a third\nOf our entire life savings and they looked like we can't afford to take this risk and I was like why you know why do you think that you're visor did not do this is you know why did how come that you know they just they're going to do the ... where you're telling people you're telling me must be telling you advisor that you want to reduce your volatility\nAnd so [noise] so think about it at risk or of a Seventy you could make thirty percent and loose thirty five percent basically in a good down here and so for them they can make two hundred Ninety thousand in a good year but they lose three hundred thirty seven thousand in a bad year I\nSaid why don't we change what if we bring you to a thirty four on the rescue so again scales zero to a hundred and thirty four you can make ... you know fourteen percent in a really good year which isn't as good as thirty percent\nButton and it really down and you're like two thousand eight you'd probably lose about Thirteen percent\nWhich is a lot better than losing thirty five percent Mm So if we had a ... is the way we set them up if they had a two thousand eight type scenario in this general terms but if if they lost a hundred and thirty thousand dollars on a million they're not going to be high fiving me but if they can deal with it\nAnd then it's ... where they were and now they lost money at the same thing happened in their portfolio they've lost three hundred and forty thousand dollars and so I so I told them you know the way we set up their plan is we had some money in principle protected type accounts that don't participate in the downside of the market but they can still get some mark it up side\nAnd then the rest of their money that is in the market they don't need even though they're retiring in four years to retire at sixty six they don't need for many years so they can they can afford to take that risk for the portion of their money only\nThen finally we talked about fees so I had the the report right in front of me on nine hundred and sixty seven thousand dollars they were paying one point seven percent or just under Seventeen thousand dollars a year and fees\nTo me that was very high especially for the value that they were getting ... and so what I didn't I didn't talk about here so initially think about this kind of think about where they were before before they had a ton of risking their portfolio\nThey had NO PLAN on how they're going to draw their income they had no state plan or for the next generation and no one was telling them how to how to save taxes in for that for all those for all that lack of planning they're being charged about Seventeen thousand dollars a year ... so far fees were ended up being a lot lower than that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "SHP Financial Retirement Road Map
