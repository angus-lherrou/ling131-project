the lines of just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean someone doesn't really following you around it's sort of the the the inspiration for this new book or yours top secret alien abduction piles\nYou talk about uh the world in which we live where mass surveillance is sort of a given now right\n[noise] well unfortunately in of course you know subsequent generations of growing world wherever I've never known any different in\nFavor of the night before the Internet age will remember it was sort of well why should I Am and so we have now\nYou know I think that's where I Am fortunate things for future generations it's gonna be helping normal thing for probably accept it as well\nYou know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea of the fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a computer chip stuck under our skin and then they can follow us and it'll be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and\nAll kinds of ways but in fact they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance device that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government that the u._k. government other governments around the world would put time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs thinks that that's the word alien abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what ... alien abductions are all about that that idea which seemed preposterous to many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\n[noise] yes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually the official publication guy to November people can\nYou got it [noise] but um the the reason I wrote top secret I mean abduction falls is because over the years I've collected a number of official documents on abductions which again the classified through the faith in the information act in the u._k. um the u._s. and finally I was in a position where\nI could actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the rate that we've yes it's another book on Eileen abductions but instead of going just overall ground you know\nWhy not present people with the guy to showing how falls would be put together now I'll start the book actually with the contact a movement\nOf the Nineteen fifties which preceded the abduction phenomena by just over about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak\nBut um government agencies do ah put together falls on paper who claimed to have had in Kansas for example just about all of the ... of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George Burns hassle\nTrue and bathroom ...\nAll of them how to FBI falls out putting on them one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and see Israel eons but\nThey told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or governments very different two hours and bordering on communism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file\nUm he's extremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm ... was about four to and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he's a defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and a hill that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail writes the you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft would they be strange creatures\nAnd being subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments now what's particularly intriguing\nIs that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the size of England and it was like the early hours of the morning about to I Am an essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomenon where they knew follow Jake what's intriguing\nIs that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused pulled a a promise to security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond if you like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the they ... they promised them security services interviewed Ronald Wildman of ... to with the with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most challenging and intriguing aspect is that he told the police and this is a direct quotes\nThat he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction low in today's world but Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch\nAnd there was something about it's it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject than thinking sort of amused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around it takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts men or that the CIA scientists study the UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers have landed published in the early fifties that that sold in huge figures of gigantic numbers of books with salt\nUm and I have a ... went on the lecture circuits are all around the country\nAnd he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly had this sort of a communist type of governments that communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file on a damn ... um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ... bucks the FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the\nCommunist angle and I'm\nA number of the the contact chase I'd sort of similar approaches for example again in the u._k. a you have the theory of society ... by George king that was closely watched\nPossible by me you really want to get rid of every

bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book\nWell I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and I'm clearly a real one\nThey just seem to be tied to both and I'm the abduction phenomena and one of those things notation I think there's probably some truth to the issue these flying

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're gonna catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] it gives me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people\nAnd cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences what whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of the privilege to be could be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interest and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this on the move here in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it's sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to it and at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still an America seem to have a lot of\nI guess would be called spiritual beliefs they ... him pretty high numbers in America I'm believing and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about is how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real sense of belief and\nOther world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so if I tried to think about and\nTry to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and\nI think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi first with thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and embrace with ... with offensive on mystery and I wonder\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look out of the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists would die hard time to normally Georgia\nThrough that [laughter] yeah a pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you've sort of reached out look kind of look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it's it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um that one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is um\nI Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I can I ask the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about a talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for\nThem for the listeners tonight yes you know I'm going to\nThe ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and not linked with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions if there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um Sinn fein fire in that time so we live in uh\nOr dimensional space time a world an on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw the line on a piece of paper or a line as one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flask where on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and wet\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and height and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with\nHeight and something else and that there's something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nYou know may maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine um but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through trials in turmoil so in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment we're talking with Christopher white about\nOther world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the

Robbie Williams the song is called time on Earth I'm pretty song which is uh basically has a message it's not how much time you have on earth it's what you do with it and it's a there's some themes like that in this\nBook by Christopher white other worlds spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions there's a character who's a explain named Jay be precisely\nI wanted to share a quote with you because it's sort of flows from what the Robby was singing about in that song there are men have got to feel at home in the universe again and I I Believe a great deal of the despair of our time is due to the fact that men meeting people\nOf a false picture of the universe and our destiny having lost religion and gained nothing at his place too many people have come to believe that life doesn't amount to much there are several people who are profiled in the book who struggle with is the\nUh apparent contradiction between spirituality and science I'm ready to get into a couple of

Christopher white Christopher I at one of the great things about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own hands around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah he was his wife is is quite a story um but you're right there there's Hinton and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like a habit being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimensions has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual love levels are worlds to reality I Am hinted anthems an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right in the situation is he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a and he kind of hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him\nBut I think his his stories a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nSee I'm into the future and he writes these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know sometimes I give talks about this and different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happen or does that happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or deja vu a worthy to be in some other reality\nAnd then they come back to this one sided audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of those experiences as well also in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on C. S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made of that\nOf that book but she talks about time slips um and and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time is just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense at time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that\nEinstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe\nI'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past in in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our descendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions to discuss if anyone wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and all of his own laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of the questions that you as a professor religious studies back all the time\nYou're right you're right at least it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices um and so on\nHum so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already ...\nIt out somehow in the block universe makes it more possible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self it somehow lift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should the ornamental world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension the dream itself you said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment\nAnd Don believe that um you know you're in a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space law for their um that's what he believed to happen and some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and we could talk about that as an additional visual dimension or we could talk about that is\nNow maybe consciousness somehow can move with the national degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he got everybody everybody sleeping so had this degree of freedom and he also believe that every one of the cabin kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and and they follow you had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nYou believe that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contained bits and pieces of future events and after that I'm sort of mixed up together\nWell I guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there are people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that ah those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about science is a sharman remote yours\nHow some of those ideas that we have a discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away takes us into the break [noise]\nNo you can get show updates and connect with other coast fans would you joined the coast to coast am Facebook page just go to Facebook dot com slash coast to coast am including the like button [noise] they allow\n[noise]\nWas never that good at gave up by the time we go to college but he also learn how to get to see them a lot of money on ... so he switched to say this your story has a happy ending after all [noise]\n\n\nA crisp white so tell me this in the example of bought land where this uh summer hire dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to de world pulled them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached out and grab us and pull it up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as being that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that and and the un Abbott's bucket flat land so\nYeah people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher realms or or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional um and as as kind of the higher dimensional objects that certain thoughts entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal leaps good coexist with a scientific yeah ... is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have you know people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience\nLike an ... um and I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and from skeptics I have different voices in the book\nUm you know talking about what the meaning of\nThese events are ... and you\nKnow there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret what's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences\nMoments of and fighter and tuition or near death experiences or buy experiences um and so on and and that they are ... than using scientific concept to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book what like all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set up this courses that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right you have these dreams for him to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he\nDidn't actually go to the Bible that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went through he went to sort of like popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I Try to making the books I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by a man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nUh well I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example of reaching out some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know a remote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right I'm reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity um and we talked about dreams earlier I think\nUh your dreams and you know in the sixties and at other times you know Americans he's psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into another realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the chance to\nTo reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely they're all different\nAll different different methods\nAre so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get it\nGo to my heart Purple Heart dot org like donating
