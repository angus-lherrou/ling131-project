[noise]\n[noise]\n\nWelcome\nBack to the coast to coast am I going to church or guessing I my new save Saturday and we're talking about his paper that was published last week and again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is a ... pyramid dot com the links are at coast to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you tried three hundred ... a a scrawled on the page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers and with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up or what you were talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this\nBut these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing bowl and you're right I'm I'm I'm listing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a or specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractious of twenty fifth so you know six twenty fifty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractious tend to run\nA over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen\nA chamber and\nOn this ... this observation that there seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know courses that have a surface area that is around ... number facts of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid what we don't know of any spaces and were but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that ... ... exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right well then you have to have some basis for this and clearly\nWe have a I I'm just looking at one two three four five six seven eight absolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example correspond a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth from Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... that ah that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the ...\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier with a feeling than than than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round ... twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nUh and that goes across a feeling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers inside the tower\nUm and and then the final point I Want to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here\nUm that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be row eighty four\n... four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be um you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the ... the big boys\nI got it yes yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly which is it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give a rough guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion at go back ... tabby and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic events the end of the ice age the construction of go back ... tabby the erosion on the banks all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand\nHundred BC yet which makes go Beckley tabby not an accident no with his references of course wouldn't lines to as low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a um I'm gonna get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls

the paramount thanks\nHave there been any\nIntention to reconstruct the original boring a key supply town and I know that sounds radical but for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties a\nRemote viewing into an intuition and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples have spent discussed\nYes and as such a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the\nMinister of antiquities is trying to partially restored monuments so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern reconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do a section\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched\nSo that's the first part of your question but there's something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard uh it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter I'm a new alien um\nThey are basically recreating gives a a a ... in the in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to uh descend into a virtual world and it will be exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think look then you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and I they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid I where did you come up with a number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know the simple rules at the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\n... one more phone call before the break let's go to let's go out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about I'm a son he awash or I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or\nOr to the pyramids and for research and just general public access and I had heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned what is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better\nAccess for research in the general public can take my answer on the air\nGreen question Daniel my new what's it like there are now that I saw you regarding\nTalked about so first of all I have a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a hermit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are\nUm and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so I'm the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they've won research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and there's nothing you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... research would be ongoing like it is is bizarre yeah how was it was a job of director there\nHe I think he is actually involved or Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors\nThat reviews the data so he is involved a ... at these not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he's involved they asking for is at by a is input\nUm you know I think there's sort of mixed back here you know there is the public's eye of us who you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientists the archaeologist who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of saw it at all out but\nI think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research done and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects\nThat ah you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nYou're being you're being said some political right now and I I understand that I knew it and I respect that you know there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stand and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that's why are they gonna have to open ... are they going to have to back down yeah\nA question that you know I think right yes so it's changed a sort of\nField though one plus one equals boom affect the superb each call

of been on hold for quite a while now let's go to the first time caller line Skoda Isaac in Toronto Isaac you're up next time cos ad amount of\nTime on you know ... like Thanks This is a great show I've always just trying to ... to ... to one show were which is the looming or\nIs it any other language or languages you kind of ... or you can get a looming of\nA of a\nWhich is a believe a lot of the show a you know do this for quite a while so uh [noise] [noise] oh sorry about it a low\nOkay so I said well let me let me jump in I guess what you're asking my new is uh the origin of the word pharaoh and where did it come from from a which which people\nTo read this or that little ... to ... ... ... but the ... the meaning of the ... it's it's ... for the push language\n... Kush language which is of course ... ... to ... years ago or ... or ... the you know we're talking about a quite of three ... for ... years ago\nIt's been ... older than any other language you can put it in the fall of ... so ... which was\nOf people who is just speak well it's a cush people still you know which is that going on which are from the push which is do you think like\nWho does have a little late it was people well the pilot or\nThey should be you know heighten ... or ... or ... well\nI'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thank you for the phone call a minute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't quite some thanks for interpret I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so so he chipped colleges are saying that uh in the old kingdom or that term was not use\nSo the term pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the kings of the old king them I think the first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it's middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh end up probably means that's when it first appeared\nAnd that's all I Know about it offhand I said what I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here a bomb we're ... we're going back to um meant as a um and the first and now I'm going to say the word they\nWere referred to as kings\nYeah right right\nLike ... and men is uh the first ah kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same\nA menace unarm are may be the same or they could be two different teams they weren't called pharaohs back then\nRight and now there's another ah\nI have research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and the the ... that are there now I'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\nYeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what the king was called I can tell you that a\nFire that fifth dynasty the king had five different title um and then the very beginning um you know the kings were called horse came so it was horse in the armor\nAnd hors ... so uh so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after I came you know the designation a national vet which is basically referring to operate or Egypt\nAnd then came the two lady's name a you know and then came to cartridge name later um but uh as you just set yourself so Farrow came later I I just looked it up if I was like four or five ... the is the first time it was used\nThere you go let's go east of the Rockies let's go to Jay out here in Los Angeles and Jay you're up next on coast [noise]\nHello hello Jay Jay\nHow're you guys doing I don't know how high is there a ...\nThis time caller long time long time listener\nI'm I Am actually um Egypt and dissent on mom's side and I'm growing up as a kid I Would always hear my grandmother to sit at least they tell me a lot of stories that there was always passages from here there there's always secrets to the\nUm the great pyramid has secrets to this to tunnels here so they're you know there's always stories that Graham you know grandkids hear their grandparents say the\nOne that always stuck with me that I really want it to get clarification on I've seen stuff like online but\nI Try to take it with a grain of salt um I really am glad that you're on the show a ... I really wanted to ask you for your um [noise] uh expertise on this if you guys ever heard is there an opening or any access\nBehind the ... year old on top of their head or anywhere along in that area or maybe the bottom of the paw in the back\nSomewhere like that that has access to an insight chamber of this of the things that um [noise] holds or something very dear to humanity that we are uh [noise]\nWe are not being told 'em all the details of have you have you guys heard any anything like that\nWell gee you're in luck because [laughter] man who's been researching the ... paper about it so I I'm a ... now my new before we get to what's underneath the the ball on the left or from the left from palm\nUh there has been photographs of the top of this being tried in the ground up or what appears to be I have to roll but and I have also read a lot of\nResearch about uh the right here uh an entrance behind the right ear that Jay is referencing year so let's talk about uh the head of this thing's first and possible entrances\nYes so there is a there is a space or in inside the head of the things and it's been a basically locked up there's a there's a little hatch and I'm I'm I think Roberts ah ... was telling me about this\nI think uh you can there's you can't stand in there it's maybe six foot deep I'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but\nUm but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the world's a crucial um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another line pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves or into the things that are looking for a chambers\nLooking at the idea of a Greek scare the architect from all a tremendous job turns super big John talking but tempers are forming old knowledge building the golfers structures\nOr who's to say I mean it'd be good to you know I guess people in the ... the ... the ah periods are solid but could they not maybe just say it's structured spaces be absolutely thrilled with Ford\nRajiv or the rocks and everything you know arches inside big cavities like\nTemple yeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's a jak lead the conclusions are that my new is presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and boy could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been I have to mention shop here will do so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this these on logistics basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and this cat from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that the scanner was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm seeing that could be theological and chop you're dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know your review to paper uh but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know beat out of it may so we agree there are probably space is up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh because\nThe pyramid of course who it's it's it's hot spaces inside researches in his sixties ... pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know ... all we have is built on each chamber\nWell let me jump in I've got to take a break right there but it's just something we need to talk about when we come back our gas my new stateside eight this is all the great pyramid on coast to coast I'll be right back stay with us Mm\nYou have to sell ...

Southern California my new uh the bones have been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it that Stewart let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to let's go to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique welcome\nYou can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website\nAnd one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino and do you know says are there any other pyramid in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTrade meaning that's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things that do you knows referencing here one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched a documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea when we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes\nThat the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is and what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber\nOr something and the have the upper levels\nYet as well I think so I think that could be that there could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off ... as opposed to some of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would have been a you know as sphere and it's interesting that the diameter of that fear is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory or and others have proposed similar things there's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it's not up to your media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in a a and one is clearly defined ad row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so how big would it be way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be\nMaybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by eight and hide I'm saying right you\nKnow maybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... and especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh\nThe or the chamber of that's off limits right\nYeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will move on scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not maybe not but they might not be stuck 'em\nThey could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that a lot of gotcha brink are suspecting that will be a chamber of it that's it that's part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do what you mean by putting the place that notch that we talked about you know the one that uh withdrawn and fire investigated it's on the south it's on the north\nThe north east corner right\nEast corner it's fairly sizable space you know I mean I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern different chambers they might be possible\nHow expensive is it [noise] ... perform use ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just seeing the the lights throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any ads excavations or right right it's not that expensive but yeah\nThey have already appetite was already spent basically uh you know making the place\nAnd then you know you have to pay the people ... experiment I'm guessing multiple million dollars like maybe ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money that's maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies [noise]\nUm but I think you do any kind of invasive a project to project like this spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and\nThe kind of money that will need for a project like\nThis is coast to coast

Egypt and our guest tonight my new safe side they published a paper that you can read all of his papers over on his website Chiapas pyramids\nA dot com and the links to that are over at coast to coast am now my new before we get back to the calls I have talked to before and I mentioned this in my opening little rant here tonight on coast to coast which is amnesia we seem to have amnesia\n... and it's all over the place but\nIt's it's ... it's not represented any more plainly than what happened in Egypt after Cleopatra\nAnd we had that uh example of it but it was going on ... for a you know she was the last pharaoh in Egypt before she committed suicide\nThe amnesia had already set in and what we need to and you mentioned this uh last week on my other show fade to black which is this that Cleopatra\nIs nearer to us\nThan she is to ancient Egypt there's three thousand years there there's only two thousand years I'm On this side of of Cleopatra and that's an insane amount of time we don't really understand how old the Egypt is until you look at it in those terms right\nRight and then going back to go back to tip the and the time when we think the original thinks was built in you double that entire time period one more time\nMore\nWhy is it that we we are so quickly to forget the past\nWell I think because it's a ... a crime and cook a Robert shock I'm Robert Duvall and other office um you know have proposed that there was a catastrophe on earth and it wiped out the evidence of\nThis uh these earlier people and the only thing that survive or if I'm about these monuments\nUm and so uh I think that's probably why we've forgotten I I always remember this great movie planet of the apes the original one with ... um you know when he lands on the planet that you think is another planet but it's actually earth\nAnd then you know at the end of the movie he finds out the hard way that ah that this earth has an Asia and that you see the statue of liberty bird in the sand and I just had such a profound impact on me that movie\nUm and I think that's sort of maybe that's the story that we're living in in reality\nLet's let's head back to the phones it's been an incredible night here with a with the audience and\nThey they are just as interested in finding the answers to these questions as you are I and let's go wild card school to Dorothy in Carmichael,
