the uh the book that I think you will love hear the story of the men from the train\nAs scary as that story is um it's still not as scary in some respects as some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael Guillen will join this just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd if you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunted

the carousel\nOn the top of the website it goes to ... am dot com and that's this string of play a little bit of it here give me a heads up on it 'cause I'd love to get back to this coming up later on

the thing with the pencils I I don't know your ... believe me there\nThere's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel the no prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spend a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day as good as they said oh my son was born involved here and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked ... uh\nUh later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in elite group of science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know and I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing a terrific come in\nAnd you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she she loves to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and was she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she is just very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... and\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or for somebody like Larry King to hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as like and you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America corny corny Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that as far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up\nAnd I've covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head a frozen and uh with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in the sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... ... it's more likely that um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicks the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robots man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sanctions in I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the ... there's not a big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about preserving their actions and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real uh in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's\nAbout what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much in eight years in the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started at myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an expert in the wisdom and Buddhism and a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism\nAnd finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I was like a pie or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my face very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist phase system there are some innovations in this book\nThat I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should\nWe then that's where we go with the next ditch the classic study so much so that the pope rodents fetus at ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael ... list next on coast to coast am ...\nIs free

Halloween weekend and you don't want to miss ed coming up tomorrow night but what's um what's giving me goose bumps tonight is the lift up for Michael Guillen what are the things that science is on

the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should add on to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about about the idea of preserving of physical life uh on this planet\nIs like ... whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're the drama of traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were defined the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice to nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for like\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're\nYou're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we need to do that if we take it on or who who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant you know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or a beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not hosting the debt smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um I tell this story about this guy I think his name as a Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but\nHe recently applied to the artist and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing that he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on it ... it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because\nWe want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating well run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but you know it's not that far because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it pass off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can be a chance that you know Texas hold of poker and the uh the games go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around\nGo yeah yeah I probably won't smoke yeah right and artificial it tell us now can be pets off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall e is\nI mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no they're no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post or we want spoke about being very good at ... well you know like they're ... button that up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general IQ is for seem to be even greater than ours that day of the singularity that but they all get Larry in one day we'll have the equipment IQ or you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so yeah\nI think the interesting these are that too is that the equation is what you said a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five [noise]\nBut at the smarter machine get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know like using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get mushy and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo ... or like the ... the ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose you lose a\nYeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that said you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquer [noise] uh yes raising with that you know I Know I fully believe that completely and ... and let's pick this up coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like marriages like democracy like friendships\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile then people would like to think it cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the future and we'll get back to that thought with Michael Guillen loss of

I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but [laughter] and I never believed the new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to [noise] and uh you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are\nEqually realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we spare\nCould possibly go run there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I quote him in the book in Russia is\nVery upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes do you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words to give them complete\nAutonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that's basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race right yeah ... ... in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know\nAll this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we can't are just still the same you know all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses\nAnd are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose\nTo you maybe the biggest problem we would face in the love you know unintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor ...\nNot the Terminator conundrum but to Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the euro opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism and you know\nYou know I mean that's that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending ... Terminator but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nOr at his weaknesses\nBut but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old head on a new body\nRight yeah yeah okay well we had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's put that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one\nOf those Halloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now there is this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] [noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the\nThe the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden or by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and\nThere's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic a you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police look into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing these woman wearing a ... which one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the ... and they found out that the they could actually get this\nCalculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the hospital and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at the top and he ended up being charged with murder\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make them they will have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like you know like do they work so I mean I think some of it as an education piece and and I think that's where great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a ... million right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book maybe totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um playing God is kind of baked into like the F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense ... now into my\nQuestion before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be on the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will yeah but yeah I don't give it a little plug for an up [laughter] they're I think you you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a finance high and it says that they will pray that they would die\nAnd they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this period that you're talking where we've achieved get more\nOut of this is this is an interesting premise again is whether it's immortality would be a blessing or a curse a ... you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible\nThat might give us some glimpse are some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe\nWith what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nAh and and so I I'd I'd love to think for about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a ... of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it we\nDon't want to reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's in the form of a big computer server\nOr it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex and soul yawn ... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like that guy net running it's like running on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I mean that's\nThe word from saying or from the crush souls of the people in stumps\nOn on you know getting getting some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know the ... a piece of machinery is going great\nStop stop stop in a plug it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so I knew that after those exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody\nWith a I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them\nSo keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast saying David\nGoing hey my question for me I'm ... and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good question [laughter]\nYeah and if they do we just lose him and we just lost [laughter] oh\nNo Well James is in a in the Washington Let's try him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh I enjoy your show but uh I've been on and kicking machine going on forty five years yes er\nHere and I was a banker do generation I'd like to know from your guest or would you feel that the shoe will be overcome through CRISPR or a maybe a ... either by pigs I'll take my answer off the air hang\nHang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nThe on he's on dialysis is on kidney stones and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful um they they are making enormous strides now uh with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman\nOr who had the operation and you know even though her fight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but\nWe're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are is already working on a second\nGeneration ah that will help actually restore sight to people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these same era\nA there's a lot of great research and I've reported on on for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cells or ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left ended with Michael deal in the book picks up the rest no thank you so much for your time and uh through your joyful spirit and looking forward to carrying on a with open lines next on coast to coast am this is Ian wanted\nUs to fill the tank every week what a grand more hand made\nPossible by me of course you know a really want to give credit where credit's due to listen at five after the hour every morning at six AM we want to know the second Obama forgiving is nowhere else to go but thank you for that or

shop and the moving jar if you didn't here's the story on coast to coast am wrote down\nDowntown Oregon City here are very much at least that's the theory behind paranormal activity\nWitness that fine zero trees a can of his dispensary what's going to happen now\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy Gomez next to it\nI see what's happening and I felt like somebody was standing next to somebody with like right here\nSuddenly the jar falls off the level surface that just happens then Andy remembered the surveillance hand like we saw this I\nNot long after that this happened watch the Penn it's completely still and no one's around when suddenly depends begin to move\nAnd if you think the videos been dumped her as a candidate shop that would be against the law ... certified many as GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with\nYou as a form of ... to ... so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there is no real explanation for why there are gone there\nBut that video ... especially in the fact that we were really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it and you want to jump in on open lines of loved to have you let me go to Mike in Charlotte North Carolina coast to coast to get us started Mike\nGood morning hours y'all\n[laughter] we're good thank you\nYeah Halloween all out of the night the hills run the road with the blood animal and children\nYes well anyway I Am right now not enough runs in the Los Angeles because it's not going to be a good to be in the Eighteenth inning for those games world series you know the question of being whether this show ends before that game and where do you want to take off\nA about George Bush just oh\nDear\nWell everything was fine and the trailer talked about a floating this not the super bitter or Anglo forever ... blah blah and one problem download memory and download or is it download mannerisms can download actions\nMatch by robots now but it won't be Larry King because you\nCan't show this layer folks on the feelings and the personality of the uh I I'm with you here it I mean we're the in ... in a\nRow the Bible says that there are where nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I I it's impossible because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's growing up I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated\nSo a lot of people would say that and it [noise] if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were why wouldn't it have a soul if other people out there have you know\nUh other meant if there are other people who have uh the problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease you know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology on soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about\nTest to babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I don't want to apologize first of all for not listening for five years I don't want to get too much into it but\nUm after ... ... and I I have a couple of things to say on this whole in March ... her saying I'm a revival manner awarded a habit of the things he ... that were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and the Senate firemen now and furthermore\nIn our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first survival situations and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know highly compiling surprise for\nFor years to come for for them is\nFamilies with multiple wives with multiple shoulder with multiple multiple and um and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not fees are usable and we don't know even with\nTraining we don't know if\nThe supplies what's done some you know in a cave or in a whole or in a sketch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt for the oil like to um volunteer myself\nNot to an suing somebody supplies but just to ... myself and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer a myself to give her trial\nLike for a year on when you supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just hear somebody could even\nHis hands on a cell and interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know it's going to survive that could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid\nWho hasn't had any training on how to year the supplies that are stored up in code or or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I ... I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are a latter day saints and so I just would be a clear\nFor people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do but to her point I was watching on Netflix or there's this series called uh like the men with three wives zero three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade a Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife\nAnd their the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab and um and that they they've already talked about saving up than having enough food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and what it even work Kennedy even work I don't know\nA ... but uh yeah so Aaron's willing to be a volunteer but um I think the only thing I ever get to bring your kid\nA John is in a in Kent, Ohio I knew well on coast to coast am done\nRather a I'm happy to have\nA you know I got a kick out of
