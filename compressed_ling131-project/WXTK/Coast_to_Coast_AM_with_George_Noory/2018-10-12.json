you know we've been warning you know for years but especially in recent months that were coming into a top either right now and now we've seen signs of that in the last few days or a week in the whole truth just like a ten to Fifteen Percent correction here which are pretty close to that\nUm we may make it you know in the next year but but this is the greatest bubble\nIn modern history and it's been extended by six ten trillion dollars are free money printed since two thousand nine and now a trillion and a half tax cuts from Trump two trillion repatriated from overseas this stuff just keeps piling in the stock market it's the most overvalued it's ever been even now more than\nEarly two thousand the greatest bought what we've seen in our lifetime which of course crashed a\nYou know it was Seventy eight percent for the tech stocks and stuff\nAnd and this could be the beginning I've got some signs I can talk about stuff but but this could be the beginning of it and\nAnd this is not something you want to sit through ... you know most of the times stocks go up and then they correct in or twenty percent that's fine most people should sit through that\nNot I call this a great reset this only happens once in a generation and even more so every Ninety years like a clock and we're coming right on that clock in stocks can be down Seventy eighty Ninety percent and take twenty to twenty five years to get back there you\nDo not hold through this and you do not listen to your stockbroker at this time do you buy back in when things at the bottom\n... you know that's the secret to George a lot of people say well what do I do it might well first of all you can be a high quality bonds and make money which did all through the Nineteen thirties the great depression when everything else was down but the biggest bonuses it'd be\nServed your money or in high quality bonds making some money or or if you're really daring and you're short the market a little bit you got money to buy things when they're down I mean imagine if you could buy the best companies in the world like Amazon or apple or whatever or Coca Cola for eighty percent off or Ninety\nOff because they're gonna they're gonna hundred dollars\nYeah oh yeah they will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world and which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollars in next time it goes to four thousand instead of two thousand so\nNo that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much as it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beach that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're well what did the indicators market the last two days is really taking it what's the cause is it just panic or ... what's happening\nIn countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more on top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion financial asset bubbles around the world\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela hyperinflation and runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest that Bob ... of anybody in any time in history when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so my view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand I'm recession and stock crash\nBecause they stopped with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just filled the top backup with money that was draining\nThis time more debt\nEverything's more stretch the emerging world is now in that and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worst crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be war so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a fifty four per se

get hit when everybody else gets hit and they go down but it doesn't mean that companies going to go out of business right\nRight again any time you get a major downturn recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure that's a good thing recessions are necessary the federal\nThere have been governments the recessions is bad things\nThey're good things um\nBut and then you want to buy the companies that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half\nUp six to seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies will not have well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you'd upon Amazon there oh my God I was\nIs the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off the far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this\nI'm much more difficult if the social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are poll right this Kavanaugh thing it was just pure partisan\nYou know the Republicans believed him and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women believe I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just political partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans\nFor defending him and in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really I think that the social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republicans going to say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff\nIn the end the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war on the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue\nThe south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be facts I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd it's hard to argue mid hatred bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and then the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kind of like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nBack to 'cause we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price [laughter]\nAnd and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about the ... the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her I suppose it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover in zero our\nIn our news letters than Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened\nEvery Ninety years since the industrial revolution cause the greatest boom and global\nHis lawn you know here we had a couple of guests on who was very similar things what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September ... won the fellow who was talking to my Jewish prophecy and he called the leash me\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and you didn't happen it didn't happen then but you could happen now you're\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position and we were coming into a two thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally Tom and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turn boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred ... apple loving hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a reversal\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that um and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that's\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just going to even\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or best polls on and\nNo disaster we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble lasting pass next to the end of next year but there is there's a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that\nForty pursue we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what happened when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes uh China went down a little bit and China made the biggest ... was the only stock market that violated a critical point\nIt looked like a two

area within the can you predict outside years from now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know the trouble in the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation when they were predictably spent and when they would stop spending\nSo yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight\nWill be over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics in the United states has kind of the best house in a bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bobble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more of their money\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three\nIs going to be way more on the downside of after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only ... on George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boomer so large because older people\nWhen they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan and places like\nGermany there's more old people dying and selling homes that young people that the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just go into Harry Dent dot com and that's\nGoing to be really fun to be in the next year that that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be the next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to to the economy\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farming commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression\nWas followed by World War two the disruption a around the world and makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and then when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we this trade war and we said as soon as they're all our book\nYou know came out a year ago this trade war with China and it is a global thing is well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\n... they need us on our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to give him too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nNot tourists on let's go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona to get things started with us I'm Peter Hi hey\nYou can for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk of two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia and it's a big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the\nMore affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're gonna take your deposits and worked in a kind of ... them into equity and are dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills shouldn't be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that\nHave have it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens in in in in the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nNext up we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nA Mr ... I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars in for the hurricanes grow up in because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why the recovery has been slow\nThe former New York governor George Pataki is having to head a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in ... here where a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower skilled workers who are not finding work enough tax payer for having to pay for their relief\nAnd the you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people laugh not happening up here uh in New York the former Empire State and secondly California which is not friendly to business when people leave the state they insist on taking their\nShort sighted left wing politics with them they go to places like Texas formerly all red state which is now only purple a to sum this up uh these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nUh anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are ...\nAnti run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing prove civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats\nAnd a starting with that Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives that chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas\nHave been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies uh we're having now I'm going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote you know heard instinct Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan\nI'm there but but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge into World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty percent\nBetween World War one and World War two with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising tariffs just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happening this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole every body loses or at least most countries loose\nAnd and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea that could definitely be stopped there there's no question\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody is big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have it is there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one somebody hit us they would be dead long before we went so I think that's\nKind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing power that's how you could have World War two but we're going to definitely have\nA political huge political views this trade war we sat in zero hour before this became out it this is going to last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical or but they're certainly\nGoing to be huge a political and trade wars and\nThings like Harry ... with us we're coming back for final phone

E. R.\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured um except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than health care\nThere on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it the leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes a changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nSounds in one way to bail out everything would be people like a hundred thousand dollars you know voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell well he has a I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression\nBut to put it on a permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad\nBut the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and and the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place\nJust sin if you know send it to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say that but\nIf if they just said everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people\nInstead of the banking system this whole bailout his whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefit of corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited mainstream\nAll the reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to a check he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend it red wine and ... you\nDon't write if they don't spend it or you're you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and bags and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to Harry in Port Huron hello Harry Good to have you\nWell hello there George an area that question for you mentioned earlier about the bank and you're making it again just now but uh the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is banned it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems with farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do it bang if governments have ticks procreate money Paul ... they're going to do for the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money in a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nOr tell yeah okay thank you\nAnd I think yeah I just answered that part of one of my question I asked\nA direct and like I got one can I can write a part in my account flying um I did not act oh I'm In my head and hey humiliate I'm all on the line\nRob yup they put all about timing [laughter]\nIt's all of that tiny what am I guardian angel moments I call it I'm hearing a third of that you just answered a question like\nA about the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much um I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm at a larger account holder is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure so security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of off the larger\nAccounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major club but the smaller accounts it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable that and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting for those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course\nWhen when things go bad people gonna hit foreign deposit there's more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans\nIn business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it they can't\nPay they can't pledge doses reserves\nAnd well that's a good thing Harry thank you were at a time Harry's website it goes to goes damn dot com up next a psychiatrist looks at the paranoia\n\n\nIs a big idea around he can be thinking\nWe're trying to figure out\nWho he crossed my mind [noise] my name is like you just take her place\nOnly mean [noise] you can help on life saving to conduct science

[laughter]\nWhen used breaks out we break in and when you went to DJ West Germany Cape Cod and I hardly radio station news radio Ninety five [noise] W. H. D. J. [noise]\n\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm Todd and slowly moving up the coast of Virginia tropical storm Margot still dumping tons of rain overnight the former hurricane still packing some punch according to a meteorologist Bette Davis and NBC affiliate W. P. O. G. T. V. in Miami\n\nLet me tell you a bit about Dr many may she has forty years of experience working in the mental health field a medical degree from the University of Manitoba is a diploma in psychiatry from McGill University you know throughout his entire life\nHad many close brushes with death as well starting in the\nNumber of paranormal or a novelist experiences visions for cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with message Purina operations as well welcome to the program Dr man he made his on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to the\nThanks\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal ... how did that\nAnd for you was in the near death experiences that started up\nWell I think it was because I almost died so many times you know when my book the borders of normal first came out many people asked me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nA doctor's bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he's told by his patience and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nPlus stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from my own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had so many close calls with that so many Russians that death [noise] um you know\nThere's been a lot of literature written about near death experience\nBut the um term near death experience you know it's going by Dr ... moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right\nNow I think he estimated that something like one in thirty Americans is either had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were pronounce clinically dead never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I looked at how my close brushes with staff affected me I see that I have some of this seems after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls this death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism spirituality and then he an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say it was gradual the first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of brush them off you know\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because\nDidn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why do they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous stem cells donor it's called in how Jeanette transplant ... was more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nOr this worldwide um donor bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOr super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body\nWas was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that's why I eventually they gave me the transplant huh [noise] now is the person who gave me the transplant he lives in an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them and I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was a member of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow\nSo he was flown back into the don't you send for Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThat if you still in touch with him did that happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and it is here altruism you know\nHe said the way it came about was um they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is that she could swab that's it yeah just to ... to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor bank\nAnd then um years later by name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow who produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live ... yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nIn Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic role has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice [noise]\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see a psychiatrist\n[noise] however since I had that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's a psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person see something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post deaf contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say you're a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his touch on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common\nIn fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death contact with a loved one even if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of\nThem don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife um and in fact you know atheist agnostic have these experiences well as religious people\nYou see that everyone is like you and I I tend to believe you don't agree with you\nOK but when you say that what's the basis for what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or Pete cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of visions voices and so on\nDeathbed visions near death experiences so certain types of psychic experiences such as ESP\nAnd collapse of the earth extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you were thinking about that person then you say\nOh you must be ... I was just thinking about you write was that's very common\nUm and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of\nThem was really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic realm out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the president is interested in it and whether or not they're paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise]\nAt my monitor his medical center in New York\nWhere they were getting into the sea\nThe ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had Sanders and receivers and the receivers were in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to the chief for um the AG could measure what we call REM sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the average rent Jim state the Centers for giving random images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on the images I Try to send them any secrets and they found that people were more susceptible to let the when the asleep\nAnd it's also true that people are more susceptible to see when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with more Dr ... is with

bit about the deathbed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh this phone so you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWas dying patients and they found\nA lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors and as they got closer to death these visitors became more frequent\nAnd who's giving them the mess\nThat's the question right where's this message coming from you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say is coming from something they've added or we could say it's coming from the spirit world\nYou know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could've been her fear\nYou know um\nAnd maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nNews there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other governmental leaders to to assassinate them\nAnd you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and there were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the dream telepathy studies that they mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know a lousy dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I didn't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really\nKnow and that and how how could we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm [noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um it wasn't a pre cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up this is the message I thought\nI I just saw these where it said this is a world of illusion and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition knew about the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she'd done that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate he ignored who plays also with ... told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he northern ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong permission premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their promotions maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the ... after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know\nThat said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregard things which could be dismissed that superstition there's always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard dry shows was about horse racing boat yes one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse that on something else some loss\nAnd Dr seuss in movies screaming at you knew you knew you knew that's a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think people are they don't believe\nThey don't believe that and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\n\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery and then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up to be able to tell the doctors and nurses\nAre what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who was blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the pattern on his doctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded\nThere was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures and he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered they couldn't find where she put his dentures\nAnd he wanted his teeth right\nYou have you back but then then they said I don't\nKnow I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were well yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual components life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them psychics some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous\nOr Mr polar mysterious Israel different words are being used to describe the same event so I think paranormal\nAnd I'm On it yeah I'm not saying every how they want to do what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job in ... the things\nThat I feel like something that we don't have to live
