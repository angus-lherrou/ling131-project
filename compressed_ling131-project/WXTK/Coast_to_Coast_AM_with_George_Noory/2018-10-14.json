Institute in Virginia\nAnd William cells they set aside he therapist and he guide you through these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that they exist from my experience in love to hear more from\nWilliam welcome to the show thanks for joining me William\nHi how are you feeling good aid\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such a system such that I had out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer in the ... be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was methods to self initiate and out of body experience so I explored um and for\nIt took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily exercise um I initiated my first fully conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer\nBut I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your family who had actually the your entire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience was self induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise uh that I that\nI learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help to negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your oh B. E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but\nThe first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room a going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side not our when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached the arm out\nOh no I was not ... I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this and my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment with a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about the what I had first stepped into here\nAnd ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience them in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the sort of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional what I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA ... than at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yeah yes\nAnd but you can experience at first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nI always think you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible globe that we're in\nA given topic couldn't have stopped here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all of the pistons informations as a human being why would the universe just create one type of human being\nThat doesn't make any [laughter] absolutely\nNot and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human and has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you you have these experiences and you know their meal because history they ill meal you\nAnd he was playing because usually not language to really clearly defined what an entertaining chin is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to it passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words\nLanguage is no longer a barrier we we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here\nThat are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits or this or that you have an opportunity\nTo experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself there\nWas no um when I teach my classes are there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow your conscience you teach them and really tell us what to look like when you have people come and I called in after all tourism many [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body [noise]\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from how great invasion him only twenty four\nPeople can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop\nI'm generally what I each person is in check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron as ... and um what is that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in

certain prayed alludes to them vibrations a sleep paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react uh I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis well\nThat's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWill keep you safe than than you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience or as science has been part of that so many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and they're\nNon mall over or their vibrating or they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness\nThat we call an out of body experience now it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people are going to be travels the exchange he mapped the brain argue make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth that has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states there was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh\nUh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research and matter of fact there was one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery were twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror\nAnd every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night at on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say\nI'm skills that are taught any more interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings in these what is a mind near twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nThe online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device I'm In uh in our class we will have a four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain waves which it\nLiterally monitor 'em multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program so you can track it and then we can print out it resolved\nAnd again that's you can tell what is what are your most responding to [noise]\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of among roe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it or control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking\nAnd walking through a talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with their ... self with are multi dimensional so\nBright and have the kind of experiences that\nThat a Buddhist speaks of in the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages that we're no we're there we have the ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional man it's just a matter of\nBeginning to open up to our own potential\nI found some great information on your website and let's say by the way it's ... in some extra incentive dot org and there are great resources on there\nAnd I I I've found is typically ways that you can take yourself into and it will be in there and you want to go see that there are\nLots of great things really are you talking about and the second senator your survey results the on\nBased on your sixteen thousand one hundred and eighty five sons that are really came out with the um common reporting and nominate associated with out of my experience is very interesting so\nThe average of what people go through which is fantastic in August is free on the site what's your name I think great you really help and give the information freely so people can\nPractice especially if you have something going on in your life a problem or illness\nYou can connect to your own answer can you connect with people\nThat their loved ones that um can you help them with the answers\n... party a dot com K. A. R. D. I. A. dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back because because I Am my guest is William ... and he's talking\nAbout ... Bonnie travel and he's been doing twenty five years of research at the mineral Institute sedative or sixteen thousand participants who have\nGone through the ... e training at and then we'll Institute Virginia and he's come up with a commonly reported ... associated with the the ease Cleveland was wondering if you could explain this to our audience [noise]\n[noise] yes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years oh okay but I've been studying\nNursing practice in it for forty or just to go on my website ... dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a\nA number of surveys and our receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture wise for instance um [noise] a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring fountains as a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet\nBut there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset of Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone and that is seen through colors dial it if you're seeing through your clothes diluted\nNight and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body because\nYou're having it doesn't mean you've actually did your body but it means you're in the process but most people don't notice because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at\nA for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your\nBody right is\nI find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nSo that that's I see the ... on it because that happened if I'm a retired I Will switch and I think his muscles and nurse you're saying that's an out of body aches say\nNo I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this\nWhat I have found and what many other um experience or have seen unexplored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving out of face from our body such with sleep is mhm we take it for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with our body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the feeling they're just like two inches\nOut a phase with her body at night as a slate and you can observe this actually during it out\nBody experience what does it look like the image\nYou're looking at it's amazing\nThe same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream began or\nThey may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences are is natural was breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... bc temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nDidn't have any biological machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay\nAnd most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how would you know the difference between that and imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies and are we still learning what was going and I'm Still learning by the way\nYou know one semester\nWe're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification ahead multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two\nAnd I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just a download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOh what's going on and I think\nThis is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated ... anyone other than yourself\nRight I and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and\n[noise] you know I always have somebody that's an avid believer and anything like a specialty of religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India ah [noise]\nWere had been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this ... and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience a menu sudden oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report that you had you talked about the common name he put it in ... and also\nThe average age first out of body experience for ... years old that people recruited recount cancer and it's often heated experience it happens over and over again but it declines during the early teenage years why do you think that is so they sent you forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to shut down I think it as an interest just a sec says something to do with it\nAnd you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance the political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff because you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game at foot here the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer a pawn of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's and that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his inner circle news that we\n... ridiculous payments and\nYou realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves\nThe greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self\n... that's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it suddenly awoke one day and knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars there'll be no no ... none of that would occur\n... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connect it but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the ones that do connect [laughter]\nWell we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we don't I mean we're going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to take your\nCalls 'cause he'll give us a call and I only think I Need to stand\nWith ... ... email newsletters

San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you do see experience\nIf you're a fear based and you take your fears\nAre mindset is going with this into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs and see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative energy if you are going to\nCreate it when your\nMind is going to mold the reality around you if you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that is well\nWell your creative powerful beings\nAnd when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into it incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I don't remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got the motorcycle and took off your helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that um\nRide their owns a motorcycle and\nIt was as it woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a projection of anything and it was when I was no there isn't a a premonition of anything that happened it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nLooks pretty bleak the honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because we are scared to each other yeah I'd I don't know if that's an adult well out of body travel most likely\nMhm well it could have banned but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there is no consensus realities there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist and in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to start them learn these what is essentially the rules of non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here we're used to linear time\nRight it's the gravity we're used to air yeah when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity all the things we're used to you have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm\nIn my workshops but it's also in my books but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our\nContinuing existence yes here that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they want to thank you so much ... has been great if you go to his website which is astral info dot org you'll find out about all of his book and his courses in classes and there's lots of free information there as well and when we come back we're going to talk about those since Colorado and some of the great history\nWas forgotten town that's Colorado Sylvie\nBack I only see that you're listening to ... an [noise]\nIs arguably the biggest ... who contests this November state Senate race the incumbent democratic senator Gillian ... his Republican opponent John florists Thursday night October twenty ...

I see it and I actually feel it\nI really like humans examples that\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things\nI'm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes\nAnd I saw where it was that and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nIn managed to Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists\nAnd I open my big huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nDid you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted that I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like\nOh this will be fun and kids get this we\nAre oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight is a hundred percent true we were living in Southern California is a time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and your she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email\nUm and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I feel bad a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just smell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of\nThe house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old a craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts style I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter]\nExtremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house in five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house with what ... well\nAfter us and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated\nAnd an artist you know and it's very severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter] so I actually\nCalled the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this is before she died and then he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude\nSong about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much so I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest estate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like that\nWhile I hired twenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was\nEthic my goodness you know things will allow literally everything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait\nTill the ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nReally is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing Springs Colorado and we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I Am with the guardian listening to coast to coast am\n\n\nWhere\nAnd\n\n\nClassical music this week in Nineteen eighty one during a North American tour of the Rolling Stones was the first two nights at the Los Angeles memorial coliseum in Los Angeles the opening act was prince addressing the controversial bikini breached the trench coat ran off the stage after Fifteen minutes do the crowd booming and throwing beer cans at him\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety three Nirvana entered the U.S album charted number one with ... third and\nFinal studio album Kurt Cobain had originally wanted to name the album I have my ...\n\nRoom\nBurn them learn to\nThe\nA long\n\nIs going to go there you know your guest Lisa gar\nWelcome back to ... to ... to ... am I just want to give you a quick reminder that I also have a great show on the guy a network along\nWith George ... who's got beyond belief myself called inspiration on guy and you can check it out at information on guy at ...

is Stephanie waters and she is not only a professional storage other as we can tell that he's also the owner of the blue moon hunted histories tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about the ... we were just talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there where ... in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nUm I think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage it springs or spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had to pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe out their war paint and put down their weapons and and there was peace here forever until Victorian came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nAnd the ghost is gone it worked\nShe'll be manager confirmed that\nThey know that all of this worked out beautifully [laughter] and eating\nNow had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was amazing\nDuring the time before the book\nYes oh yes she knew it was hot it but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand sixteen\nBecause the theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball\n... this was reaching out that's partly trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their stories\nThat yes but you seem to be the you like the public is for the east coast\nOf the main thing is it's meant to be one you have a wave really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live go go under\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's hard to buy the goes but like other little girl that bounces a ball isn't she do I'm like no\nLeave in ... that listen friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere was no devious funds spirited no\nNo absolutely not if they are they're just kicking you you've tricks aren't here they are in prison\nHere by their own their own their own mind that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during nighttime so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the ... and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely a big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes that come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning\nBut I find the best time to actually look for those if you want to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night ... ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time why it's\nThe if the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hidden lends itself\nTo the shadows does that make sense\nYes that does it make strapped when you see the shadows people\nAnd the light changes very fast right now and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks and that led to the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you're living in now haunted him did you ... non ...\nAnd the gas I the ghost follow you\nWrite that they do on like two words it's very funny the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten\n[laughter] just kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and manage who were on a timer because whenever I Would walk on her name's bites they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know the certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says well why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter] yeah that's true [laughter]\nSo they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights flash this this town is very haunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the ... if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah it does to you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping of life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd the did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause they'll think you're psychotic they're like oh well\nHave you tried to say it's happening it won't so yeah\nThey're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do all kinds of magic tricks I'm really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that are there\nAre there other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and managed to springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and absolutely\nAs this part rain there oh yeah that you know this family hotel right there on that a native them it's very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a a there's a\nI have heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managed to springs and bolder and even as to part with S. with the infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see it light up light up with the red energy\nI find that very interesting you need all the natives used to call this the spine of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountains this very sacred land it's very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine as you're right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of the world the pikes peak they believe was the naval\nOf the universe I find that fascinating because maybe it's a portal\n[noise] you know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this this is very low fat Ernie I Love this stuff [laughter] pikes peak it's very popular\nAnd it has a lot of um a lot of stories around it and hopefully I Know that you've written a lot about this and you can tell us about it and um we're going to take a break in just a minute and maybe you can tell us a little bit about it after the break okay now the name of your book again is called the ... latest one you have four\nOr five five minutes all came about after cancer was on my bucket list I'm a big believer in manifestation [laughter] and you're fine now I Am fine and it's wonderful and I'm so grateful to God thank you for asking\n[laughter] All right we're going to come back and find out about it from you [laughter] All right my guess is definitely waters and we will be right back I'm ... and you're listening to decode these\nDum\n\nDum dum\nUs know just as we were friends more possible by me\nOf course You're welcome really wanted to read and listen to every morning and we want to do the dollars a year old barber for newer usually nowhere to go but thank you for that no\nYou know regardless [noise] bring a child I

the website again home advisor dot com or just do little to bring home in Missouri\n[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am my guest is Stephanie waters and we're talking about Colorado legends and lower and when we were talking a little bit before the break about pikes peak now there's many places in the world that have lots of legends and lower but this particular one pikes peak has\nA lot it's considered one of the\nMore usual places in the world as well as um because of its kind of rich waters and mineral rich area in that particular region of the u._s. can you tell us a little bit about your experience as many ... you know about the beach\n[noise] well um pikes peak I think it was called T. T. V. A.\nT. that are have a I think that's what the native youths used to call it but they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe\nI just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nWhy why are we going to call that connected to the mother okay yeah\nIt's connected to the mother and think about the native is the way that they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get\nUm father sky Mother Earth ... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThat and the natives knew that it that of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold fresh\nUh produced more goals than any place in the whole world I Hope I have that right but I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well\nYeah and if you ... I Love the show ancient aliens and they talk about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on ancient aliens they talk about how\nPerhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camp\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers the flight over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHearing cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw UFO when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon it was clear daylight\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships\nAnd they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards it other than it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hollering they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating because today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brushed it off as being an airplane but this was before we had\nOr a governor ... experiment gone\nExactly exactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the the ... mhm\nErratic flight plan exactly up and down sideways hovering you know like a helicopter ... a fascinating and they didn't know what to look they there was no explanation\nNow so what I did was I followed it I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not\nThere weren't a lot of people out yet but a lot of people for this I mean just outrageously crazy and he followed his story in\nKansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing and the story was consistent\nVery much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's there was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the world Wide Web could possibly know\nWith farmers in Colorado where thing that I mean this was amazing back then you know um what we you know we've had the telegraph\nOf them do you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there it's a conduit for a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as the director of the paranormal convention and one of my friends is named Dan messiah us and he lives in green mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak\nAnd um he saw a big foot at home to his back door opened his door actually um [noise]\nHe um the big foot actually rubbed at the high neon his screen door and he actually had some big hair\n[laughter] and\nUm then has really committed his entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal and he does live above green mountain falls back in these rock formations and there's Patrick lessen the rocks and I've been back there with him and so all of this myself\nAnd I believe it's possible you know a lot of you might not\nHave you seen in the writings\nHe leaves my friend he only if it's um they you know it's like stick figures I find this fascinating because they are elongated\nJust a straight line a stick you know with too little like a triangle at the bottom and then a triangle on the top and then these\nLong arms with try and goes on the bottom of it it's very geometric cooking it's it's fascinating and my friend actually believe that his property is a poor hole\nWhere big foot is traveling ... and I know it might sound outrageous but why not consider the possibility that\nMaybe big foot is a missing link maybe\nAnd maybe ... maybe he's coming in and out or maybe we're seeing I'm mainly seen something that happened and another time a
