... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but it just it that good so if you're looking for something\nTo be a little bit spooky more in the area of terror than horror\nVery suspenseful the hunting of he'll how so Netflix um is is just one of the rare a Netflix series that lives up to all of its building where everybody I've talked to watch is loved it I'll just say that much and I think what's even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with\nWith the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie is that they they make a point to do a lot of stuff off just slightly off camera was a little bit out of frame\nSo it there's there's plenty to you know give you a ... and ... but I mean there were some moments there where\nSome of the coolest stuff you can't see and that's what it was like in the first one I remember that as a kid when I went to go see it it was like I couldn't see it but it was it would almost scared me more than I could see and I I don't know if I go to handle it if I had seen it so they look for that and you're going to join up for Halloween you are going to enjoy the show to

I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... eventually let out of jail that it's kind of you if you can test and said yeah I was really sorry about that then you let go but it's the only people said no I'm not going to get past that I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying well for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them than anyone\nI didn't write ... avenue on the tragedy of the people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their beliefs are things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's critical such a great work of a literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or in the population you said under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween or ... festivity the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see a kind of bumped like that or is it just is it like it is it I mean I realize that they always kind of getting a steady stream of tourists but as this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\n[noise] oh ...

up a booth at a state fair and they can make their entire year in the weeks that the state fair is open so I I I Would never have got their shops that are just open for one month in a in Salem\nYeah but it but I think what the realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on all over the course of a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum so ... so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round us down the road than becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are their rules a leg or curbs that they that are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want to risk just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that it seems to be around if you're on the other time of year there's not that many curbs but in October for instance they are the burial ground to the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had that I put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\n'cause it was just getting over Iran and people were like using the grave as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of [laughter] you

combs has\nAnd one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder\nAnd the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\n[noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the census right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses\nEmotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way this is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press or there was a time in us history\nNot even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public\nInformed but at the same time call and letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part\nIn the injustices regarding the story of the men from the tree\nUp but this is the same reason I Love true crime and bear with me another minute or two\nWhere true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is ... allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to to crime\nBefore death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing\nAn ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or a fetish size the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these\nTrue crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn right they're really into all of the

I had told my daughter\nThat ... if you walk the crimes back when you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes and he would cover is track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston is first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York\nAnd because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points that first murder matches up with\nAgainst the uh with uh with with uh the last last murders and the series\nSo are we is just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a\nEvidence about this man and argued that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it\nBecause it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype Chris Rock and he modeled ... he he perfected that crime then ... excessively after that um is is the years went forward and yet\nThere was kind of a mixed media right I mean there's sometimes there were sometimes over guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five [noise] the ah\nI think that he while he use\nAn ax to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stock in his pocket or in his belt or something\nThat he would use if somebody was awake and confronted him but um it was not what he was trying to do but it is why he would do if you had to do\n[noise] to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... ... what did you hope to learn\nAbout the human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... lead all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general answered the question is a crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our\nOf our ourselves that we don't like to talk about\nA all crime stories are about lost\nAnd greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are a part of you and me I don't know you but they\nAre part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves\nThat we are ashamed of the uh uh that's that's\nThe general answer to why I'm

avid reader of crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens was going to have them at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding what it's it's very common among writers to be avid readers Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from\nSports I mean uh I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try and do positive things\nI hang on hang on to that thought on crime stories in this world picking up the men from the

they were saying that crime stories are very good because they they come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about you don't normally talk about the man a crime\nI didn't make a however I thought oh entry into the subject I got her like\nA I was I was a documentary about the murders and a guy called ... it's an extremely well done documentary him far above normal levels of crime\nIn retrospect I was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing which is that it's relatively ...\n... ... murders are a part of a series so I started I was just going to put an hour and to\nAnd to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a weak the weak eventually became five or six years or so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a a true crime book sure yes it is yeah you know and that's the interesting piece too is that true crime [noise]\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit riding preachers diminished or is that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution\nAnd they would do a sermon just before the execution that we tried to provide the context for why this person was being executed in wide the community overall would benefit from his or her desk\nAnd became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their executions sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early

in some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of I'm kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved\nBut for these communities maybe this just lingering sent some some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On my own exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just they pay that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who uh was\nA a a ... his great great aunt had been was one of the victims of the crime that he had always believed that uh uh the man who uh was\nAccused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released always believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book bag and our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief to have\nThat was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that but it was it was a shy who said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was the other fellow at I don't know why it was important to him too\nWell I understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it on ... I've I've I don't know a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think I could go ahead go ahead no please no a lot of the book and a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all books all good books are search for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago and uh\nI grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these that these murders occurred to him and I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was a watery or what how people lived that they they lived rich meaningful live\nA ... people in urban areas today\nThank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night\nAll of the things that that happened ... who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture unfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they died terrible Beth\nAnd also I was trying to create a picture of how they live and and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town\nOr a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact\nThink that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling a story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the town or\nThe um the things that people age or the way that houses were constructed in their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St story telling and a journalism contacts I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThey ... they want it to that that always sticks with me that illustrate the party or just banking and that has to do with the the taco and the cases taco invented that it\nUh one of them I think it was soccer do we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime what are the crime was committed on December twenty four\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors\nAnd tallying community um a\nPickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflict in testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nSee a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right now or never survive I mean if you would never know that that was true of Italian or the way that the Taliban American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important to them a crime story that's what kinds of stories are they're these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us very effectively ... Iowa and did the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to\nTo to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a ... a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nOn on the night of a gym nine Nineteen twelve oh the lights were out in Alaska due to a um\nYou mentioned the economic speech that explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um one of his personal traits crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder to families and whatnot and then joining out\nThe ah ah but if you if you go to that community where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell yeah oh that's a house right there um it still has not forgotten or many places\nMany places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally I'm absolutely forgotten but it's ... it's still quite well remembered [noise]\nSo I Want to ... you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because [noise]\nIt was really hoping to finish the book before the interview but I really want to get to the part about how you think you would have narrowed down this suspect so let's let's go through that let's go through that process Ninety victims [noise]\nStarting in the late Nineteen century going up to the early twentieth century of one men the men on the train [noise] does he have a name [noise]\nNext coast to coast am this is the opponent [noise]\n\nFrom their debut album Evan essence founder Ben Moody abruptly quit the band [noise]\n\nThere's you're back\nAnd now the hard way to go we can sport time capsule\nHey so sports fans are dandy west and I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history\nThat started way back in Eighteen fifty seven where the world's first soccer club or football club Sheffield ... founded ending McKay\nIf it's important to you it's important to watch on air I Ninety five point one or on our hearts radiolab use radio Ninety five W.

specificity as he got went along\nSo that you know the ... the early patterns or not that type but the the later patterns get closer and closer to the first crime\nThat's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that that's who he was a that's a Italian new himself I I don't doubt that Mr bell or had been the victim of terrible abuse has young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced teeth\nOr he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look at that he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd that the terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that it in any sense of justification for what he did it but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] you know the the pedophilia peace or ... especially abusing the corps if that's what happened\nUm speaks to the age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally\nWhich makes me wonder whether and I'm sure you've done and this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know just some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation\nIn the book because a lot of things we don't know about you how are you you're going to have no after you're gonna have a speculative after it's up to you I wouldn't speculate that he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and in Eighteen Ninety eight I I ... I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because\nThere's an obvious lack of planning and I'm preparation for the event ... I don't doubt that he had committed pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I\nJust very much would suspect that he had been adding inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a while he had it had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and then he says he ... his the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried\nIt carried a tanker pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents through in about his life the um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\n[noise] but it still isn't that's that's a great point what year had he gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which she grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year\nThere have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who is the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they they just you know they it it's a ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not a ... he didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... an artist is generally as a charming\nRight loaded often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that maybe he was he was a true psychopath\nA psychopath have no fear of over ... know norm at do not have normal fear and one thing the apparent about this the ... demands on the train is that from his crime is it ... it was not it was not acting and fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that\nAre horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with his for so long I this is probably not that I should have made this this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller on the map to the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten years or Fifteen\nGoing to say well here's what the James's miss they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed this whole story about\nAh this this crime and it when that guy Illinois and [laughter] and uh the I don't we don't have any doubt that they are going to do that and and there'll be ride\nBut we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacities so we moved on and part of the book but there is still more story to be discovered there\nYeah very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions as sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers you're coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer or you can ask them about the Boston Red Sox would you also since Clinton minimum to [noise]\nUh and I may throw in a street question about the Boston spring learn that\nTo order Amazon dot com and type ... famous on dot com and type cardio ... hardy mobile fits in your pocket and so you can take it EKG anytime anywhere right when you\nDeal with them cardio mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your smartphone and just thirty seconds you know your heart rate than normal for in a trio the relation is detecting water cardio mobile today for Ninety nine dollars [noise] there's an Amazon dot com anti party in local\nTake unlimited ... morning noon and night you can always know how your heart is doing\nCardio mobile put peace of mind in your pocket for only Ninety nine dollars [noise] what are your ...

author and it's a it's just a terrific read very good writer a and a and yet you know until bill\nThere was not a lot in the ... he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was like ten or ... longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know I mean just like even today we don't think about this we will just drive Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are they get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through and a couple of weeks it oh yeah you know I\nFeel I got a couple of questions first of all I Need you to answer for me it again ever seen any evidence ... like one of the actor\nYeah about ... what any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe ah I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the Alaska murders were committed they ah it it's still\nIt's still around and and or has been definitively guide to the to the murders and the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAll right you know what the palm ... by any chance\nWay down it disappeared and I was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be but he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured out that he might have worked for the oil rode out he got to every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but thank you for being on the air and I appreciate your story\nThey give you that hey you know actually that's a really good question too about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\nWhether what out in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal could make the murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed or if a ... and if it happens a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers who will\nWho committed murders on weekends or the or\nBecause they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to the um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working himself into the trap stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that it's a lotta stocking\nBut uh the uh just working solving that frame of mind that he could get where I needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or what do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country you\nKnow he was he was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen a ... and ... and he came into town may no contact with anyone spoke to no one and this here that was part of his\nCriminal Jane is they ah they ah but ah so ... if his crime in the ... crime and Eighteen Ninety eight eight did buy a ticket to leave the town and this this led to a trail forming behind him and place followed his\nWhere he had gone on the trains are for quite a while but later he was just it was just job as white used to railroad he always\nTells you that the intersection of two railroad so they were trained came by the middle of night it could just hop on and they wouldn't be caught waiting you know if you have to hell rode your last chance the year you'll be you'll be stranded waiting for trying to come here\nYeah that's an interesting question forgot what it was you\nKnow that's an interesting point then it by the way when I told you about the the people that were murdered\nNext to the railroad line in the town where I grew up they um that was the shoe sure the shoreline it was it the the train no longer existed um after like Thirty years or so but he used to be the major commuter rail road between\nMilwaukee and a Chicago I think or maybe even went further up north up to to like Green Bay or something or\nThe other point the other question I was raised in there up until Nineteen oh eight or thereabouts a a settled in an area for a period of time and committed crimes there that area after night in a way he started just morally more or less trapping\nBecame a Nineteen Nineteen awake at night and have a transition to just running loose across the country ... bought an interesting thing is that he never stole money at one of the ways you know with him is that why this line well up here in the newspaper story about\nMoney and other valuables were found in the room that and that happens all the time that that that there's a hit if he does not steal anything from the crime scene\nYeah that definitely is was a ... you know there's the accusation about the first crime that uh that that guy little was accused of than it was uh\nWhen you meet a veteran you're
