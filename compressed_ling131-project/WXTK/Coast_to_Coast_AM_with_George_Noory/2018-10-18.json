used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans uh today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all lending program [noise]\nAh so the federal tax payer puts the money out\nA and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education a ended sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that\nEssentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] ah but um so yeah this is a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit [noise]\nUh and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans\nAre exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fared ... practice laws federal um a fruit than lending laws uh\nAnd these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cabal of\nBankers a which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise] uh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits\nYes served on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise to a holy private for profit enterprise and\nShe can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert lowered a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system so you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nUh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices truth than lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow\nGo to a private bank any private line of credit [noise] ah and do it that way because we then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding et cetera\nCan keep up with their budget um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars\nA year well I can guarantee ... per year that's tuition room OR Books um for for your course for a four year college and by the way it no longer tapes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the cat per seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raised their prices but also really straining to students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt\n... there was a story just recently were Lindsey a guy walked out of dental school with a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder if that's all uh the belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and that's really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um [noise] have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond a J.

who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got the student loan situations and one of the worst icy are these are\nSecondary car market a lender you will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them what's just what you've said\nOn the ... so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know this car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know uh and this in fact is really what's going on with\nStudent loans in particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to\nUm you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education's just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shots and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans\nAnd it's about I mean let's be honest about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the lending system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq greasy once once the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse earliest probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even\nMore schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I should have pushed my kids' sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\n... crazy so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job in a part time job during college will\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen good thank you\nGeorge I got good news for you too man a throw rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a big signs they drop support the seal day there he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of a trade school to\nA ... a quarter cup there used to work or I got on egg wildly and when a company went under the under the conflict and I'm a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know it it was a sad time but ah pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I looked at her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there with all due\nOh and I think also for a couple of years you know\nYou probably more and more experience than most people\nThere and I looked at the local school there and they were voting for thousands of dollars just to go for oh I think it was a two month course just don't take well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going out and spend thousands dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi trucks and then I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that I could have done it for about half the price now they've been\nLet's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think of trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sort of hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em out to publicly think Allen he the one that pointed out to me that the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew\nThat the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on the hook on an aircraft a dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college dead\nOK I already knew to do when it happened but now there's one thing that I wanted to mention and that is the ...

associates I'm you know trying to work on my bachelors\nBaquet well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the lists or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen are these scammers\nYes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this UPS company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that or or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger alone a and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHow they're George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I Love your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell tell\nA job thank you and I'm hoping to hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold the same week this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nI Hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular or what their information is a hundred percent correct the principal was\nSixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the uh the costs that I've ever heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the the oh he tried to negotiate with these people every there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think right\nI mean first of all I Would I Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is non to give other than\nHelping us fight for H. are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy rates back\nSo that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies I'm the owner of your loan is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them about a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the get alone he'll take it fall dude you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a very close you know like like what you describe how did they get\nThe information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good\nUm but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are zombie loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and ...\nMy leaders down the line least expect it\nThat's right yeah ... they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having such limitations of these things can follow you literally to the grave [noise]\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have a ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent particularly for older loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original sign\nPromise [laughter] not at all Allen once again

the desert we were there when you\nAnd I'm now was that before off to your life event in Salt Lake City which we did\nA that was right around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you great job indeed\nAliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's a essentially it is my new documentary that I put out to tell the story all off certainly the Pentagon's\nUFO program a tip but she can text you alliance that story and and really to to try in one don't humane tree to tell as as best as I can the entire story of the U.S government for ... relationship with this\nPhenomenon or watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of that\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single revelation in in the UFO community for I I think decades I the only story that I think comes\nClose and I would say this wouldn't I is the kind of suffocation and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off to decades have to know the U.S government did have a new effort program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm from an agency of the day and and you know like I say for years they said no no since project to close down and we haven't been doing this the snowy ... or no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tangle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment polls there all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this the robot big yellow a Senator Harry Reid told the long I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff 'cause it's coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer that one is is very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story in one sense for years\nPeople have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's going on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about a case for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mess if you if you think back to when the New York times when their their landmark story on this on\nDecember sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to for than a than a third one\nBut now the public have been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this rock stone guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman\nAnd and the struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this from my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nTold me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot into it of course I denied it leans at the Pentagon but tell us specifically about your rule\nWell I took a long on on on that one and it was quite a a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and and you've done this of course civilian time yourself you know you sit in the ... said a direct to kind of talks to you and\nYou spend a couple of hours and and also the questions I when you see the final product sometimes you think well well you know I've got edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put that but in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon ... did they fight teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would ... this thing so I scripted the entire movie that the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and and fall in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio ... you know you had it often headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all a together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can well I Can't say gosh this is somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure\nFrom me it's a completely\nNew role to me I mean there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy ... just made a a a great movie but um you know I I it was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nAre you hoping to accomplish would they will use at the Pentagon\n[noise] firstly\nI as I say really to try to talk through some of the the confusion about what's\nBeen going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has is it we know young people are interested in in the subject\nBut they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them so by putting this out as video on demand we go ahead on to the platforms that the young people\nNeed to watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days so it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but to young people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since ... had his press conference where\nHe\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nRan a story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization now like you said I I'm beginning to see the momentum is waning what do you\n... when when you say the organization um he right yes\nUm well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has had voted always says in these sorts of\nSituations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know where the eight tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and\nStill has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nNow other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nAnd in the the the individual who wrote that they got to fight intelligence assessment\nOn on you at first in the ministry of defense her name project ... ... we don't want to go here to fall down that road he had some slight the old beliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the book keeping fisheries I think it is where it refers to say as being the print some power of the air and I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople did the idea that you might be demonic\nAnd there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\n[noise] yeah and\nIt's frustrating you know than the cause and and it's almost I mean clearly ironic in another way that\nYou know you have a bunch of people in the ... the the the IRA elsewhere and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it researching it in a proper scientific manner and we come up again skepticism you might think well that's fine that's what you'd expect um\nSkepticism is the soil to\nNicole or intellectual\nA human it kept us this but I think most people I associate with that concept it's actually it's a ... probably trying to do the trick skepticism itself I mean it could have effectively the so called us skeptics in the ...\nUm say that they don't\nThey don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things for the call it's just in one sense it's swapping one on your plea fringe belief\nFor another these by these people were skeptical told they were believe but they would you believe in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more right here on the coast to coast or you\nKnow you can show up dates with other coast rooms would you do in the ... just go to

that the alien presidents appears to have any kind of threat to us as a human species\nWell are you exactly but what do you think about the late president Ronald Reagan's jumped to give the star wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of alien or intervention yes\nAnd he certainly made of course the those remarks are\nVery famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally thing how quickly we we would set aside our differences down here on uh if if we faced some alien threat and and of course people read\nAn awful lot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read read a law into that to my own personal view is that that was much more about just trying to ... when the Cold War and find crop the Soviet Union which to be fair is exactly the way it pretty much\nPlayed out I'll Try and there's been there's still talk of disclosure are you you know I I'm arguing Steven bass and all the time I

think it's never going to happen as I\nYeah I I agree with you I don't think that kind of Steve pass it um disclosure with the big the my fellow Americans people the world we are not alone I don't think that\nIn in here they are bringing them yeah\nI'm ... and we've discussed this before one of the big problems of course is is not saying that there extraterrestrial spot if it turns out that
