know during the\nAirline I truly frightening [laughter]\nBasically said he turned to the Democrats and he said you you better not get power because he can't handle it\nSo I you know it's pretty scary and I I Will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population is increasingly allowed themselves to be weaponized so you know the reality is this is you know these people are not native forest they're individuals and you have to judge them according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where does this come out I think the capital is going to be confirmed\nAnd ... if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderates filled out it's because if you you know if you do a deep dive into his record\nWhat it says he he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment in the constitution so I think he's apt to bend the law to help the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go\nAnd that's what's going to give some of the moderates you know problems and so but my guess he he's going to be confirmed probably this weekend and what's interesting about this is the impact that will have on the election\nUm and I think one of the things it's done is it's really galvanized the Republican base because there\nAre you know two weeks ago they were concerned about Trump's personality now you know in his tweeting now they're not they're concerned about what would happen if the um you know if the Democrats had the leadership position\nDo we do we all loses people because of all of this\nAny any time any one of the things talks act supports the violation if due process\nUm we we put our whole culture and our whole system in jeopardy and the whole our whole financial markets in jeopardy\nSo you know I think this is we each have a responsibility under the constitution the law\nTo to protect the law and I'll tell you something you know I went through an eleven year highly lawless process where I was targeted and and you know efforts by government people to frame me mhm and we would have me George was that I literally you know I went to the process and safe\nAnd what happened was there were so many people inside the FBI or the department of justice or the different agencies involved or\nMy attorneys or the general population who really believed in the law and it was their belief in the law that ultimately saved me\nSo we need to believe in it it's every one of us and um you know I think I think that a lot of people uh you know who is allowed themselves to be weaponized oh oh ah\nOh an apology to

wanted to direct a Rosemary's Baby but he has such a reputation gimmicky movie that they didn't let him do\nThat but yet when I was a I was terrified of the I mean I I I was like\nIn my Spiderman pajamas a you know you're sweating under a copy\n\n\n\n\nThink I think women spend the money so I think that a lot of horror film but I think one has kind of been made and even with this new car or a with this new Halloween movie Jamie Lee Curtis is the hero she's she's going to kill a Michael Meyers when she gets a hold of them she ... she was praying for him to escape that as being asylum so she could blow it brings out\nAnd I think that having heroic women in these movies that you don't Star Wars you know and now a doctor who was a woman I think that you know it's a it's a it's a these are women are still spending their money on media physical media on movies and they're they're controlling that dollar and I think we're going to see a lot of wind\nFive five films with strong female will\nThrow throw out some percentages I'm going to give you some age brackets here among those who are Fifteen Years old to twenty what percent of them do you think go to movies\n[noise] probably none [laughter] no I'm not really [laughter] Fifteen to twenty\nFifteen to Twenty years old yeah I I Know I I Would I Would say forty percent about ... twenty to thirty\nTwenty to thirty I Would say uh I Would maybe I maybe I skew that little higher maybe maybe fifty percent thirty to forty per se is usually [noise]\nThirty to forty I Would say I would say larger I Would I Would guess maybe sixty five\nReally okay now I think it's such coming down forty to fifty years old\nForty to fifty years old I think it yeah I think it would really come down I Would think that maybe maybe twenty percent\nFifty to sixty and I would have probably even less\nAnd I don't know maybe the fifth year old might be hanging in there but I think maybe the six year olds and ... and beyond are probably a much much more likely to enjoy a film in their home and the trouble with going to a theater\nOne of the things we'll do just for fun next hour when we take calls for you is we'll ask the callers if they want to share their age it's up to them and bone only willing whether they go to movies or not I can't remember the last movie I went to\nI mean I I look at a lot at home on video I ... when you know they come out as a news new release or something I'll watch it um but I Can't remember the last time I was in an actual really I\nDo enjoy I Do enjoy seeing a film in the theater with an audience by a lot of\nTime on that you ... and that's your ... your business so I I I'm\nI'm biased because I'm watching the audience ... ...\nThat's what you do so that's one of the things we'll do phone to

once you were wrong I guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raise their luster when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember until now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then my first places I was to lure Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven and then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved\nTo to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis\nA Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference\nThere family still there I have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my modus motorcycle accident uh-huh you're born heights really yeah well he\nTold me where cars you must remember this the the

are you know functioning in a in a normal way and they get triggered by some reminder of their mortality it can lead to very pathological types of behaviors but if you can bolster their sense of\nUm personal worth their their value in the world and you you enhanced their self esteem\nYou'll see that when you trigger them they actually become more optimistic they care about other people so I think if we can approach this idea of death and the great mystery of it with an open heart and that kind of skepticism that is productive\nI think can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no did you did you know gr Mitchell before he passed on\nYeah very well regarded worked with them for years wonderful person Edgar\nSaid in the interview I did with him for death mix like possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because he was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find\n'em but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt it was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving inclined toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nUsed their descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death

courtroom\nLet's do it [laughter] so you have a judge and jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWith witnesses that come and go\nExactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences\n... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what what shift people's mind about that question\nAnd is it that data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what is going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch blitz were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please and its role but employees with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that Shapes Our experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectations\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them\nAnd I think that that is a remarkable uh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of the functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation and to expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness Lou ... outside of the brain\nI knew I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting it is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because\nEvery ... is filled with life and with that intention\nTo manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain\nI don't think it's an ... phenomenon of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness\nOr the signal or the signal exact\nKeeps coming ... exactly will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual ...\nI think so I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with Sophia the Android she's a robot\nNew Hartford was her yeah she'd be great for you to interview 'em and see if they

people believe there's something there I think people have had experiences that\nGive them a sense that I think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know beyond the survival of consciousness or identity you know people ... reporting of like pre cognition knowledge of the future\nUh people you know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location whole remote viewing paradigm they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that\nThe majority of our population in including people with\nHigher levels of education report so this isn't just something that people experience and they have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is it's something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their life\n[noise] and you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and fuller and less filled with stress and anxiety and\nHow can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspectives and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know begin to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences can lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious then we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation send and that in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHow'd the younger people react to these things now what do you think\nWell I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of\nAh there's certainly a lot of fascination with I you know horror movies I think you were talking about that last program\nYou know I think our imaginations are very fertile I think popular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see so what's that about you know is that about\nJust something that is idle curiosity or is it something that helps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the ladder maybe what's happening\nWell let's take some calls will pick it up I'm going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card line\nEither Giovanni hey how's it going your great me it's been a war\nAnd I've been a while and I'm always listening I Love the show as always and a doctor Marilyn thank you so much for the work that you're doing on consciousness absolutely that's very your pioneer and I hope you continue doing your work and I hope that this uh this this birth\nMore uh wander in and and and after you off into this world\nBut uh I just wanted to share that experience of mine that I just really springs to mind when I heard you talk about the about the forests are about the jungle it ended up being a form of consciousness or out of a of kind of a a pure consciousness\nWell my parents are from Nicaragua and uh our our indigenous people are very very uh very rich culture of um of missed the system and and also ah you know being able to travel and to you know in three dimensional and and uh and explore the potential of the mind\nThrough um
