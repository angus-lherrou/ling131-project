be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there were there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is\nAll of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody how did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nWork on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of\nNegative emotional energy drugs or something I practice something called modern actresses and and that that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there they generate both positive and negative emotional\nEnergies which are unseen but we feel them and\nIt accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they uh uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them you wash the windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything\nBut we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments and generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so\nI get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and it doesn't feel right I don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or\nWe're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest is Adam ... would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a free so I Would say that I'm an independent priest say Sean and freeze exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clearing so I wasn't touching anybody anyway it's really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes they're already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of\nEmotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it cleared out ones and I then I teach people how to maintain the clarity of their bodies\nEnergy fields or and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one or that are qualified extra system just about every religion but they all but they don't\nWork for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past\nLives um I had deep contacts with higher spirits are also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are\nThis universe I said before on on one of my appearances the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question\nYou know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix\nYou don't do that\n\nEverybody needs help hold a job for the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website stark clear dot com his book is called power protection will come back and take your calls as

com\nEight hundred six eight three forty five forty six eight hundred sixty three forty five forty six\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back Jeffrey Schumann once we get to calls as well as we talk about demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with us\nOr both or just a few years ago um I did a three nights a\nStand essentially at a legitimate haunted mansions and very famous I won't mention the name but um it's something I was\nAgainst for years and years and years for a few is all invitation I finally uh they talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just beautiful you know\nUh so\nUh it was essentially set up for ... to go in and uh with real quick and then in and take a look around and\nEverybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in ghost had you know on a couple of said their hair dryer went flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of hall they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nUh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cars of people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and there was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy gold she was called the gold room\nAnd it went up to get my business cards and this sheet started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just would not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention I said you know\nThis place has really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't\nBite need yeah it was all follow people home negative spirit's just they will get\nYou know that gets you later so I was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and him\nOut four feet above me was the miss shape the spirit just terrible looking now I'm used to ... spears can assume any shape they want so I don't react to this you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately or what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song but I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's strange possible\nTo describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil lullaby\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song slowly and I just I you know ...\nShot up immediately got up out of my bed it's kind of went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I was to change me a from being very happy and we've been very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just felt a looming\nAn extra shift is not safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople face so I I go completely beyond the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the\nCalls come pretty quickly and not only times immediately you know it's like you know we feel\nBetter right away especially when I Do a personal clearly not do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone uh you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drain because I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always noted subconscious and so people don't know they're getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them or a negative spirit\nAnd felt you know people call me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's immediate but I always get a caller an email thanks a lot\nYou're really really helped you know very very seldom out\nAll sorts of clients that I've helped or the last almost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already five different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client and may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common\nUh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on a\nBusiness or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has an effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred

sometimes not and and negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness\nA overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line and being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people\nWhen the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across in damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of the media does but actually been working on them for\nA long time and they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up one morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work or doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some light medication for it is it the\nDemonic spirit had pulled muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark romas that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and an essentially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side to being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\nWill hold on my question is\nIs it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know the trip pan sort of like I\nGo to the other side gets off\nDrugs so many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help spirits and I said what I say now I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to see or steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for the spirits\nOut there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things\nAnd trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their body is energy field I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore to a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy or in a person's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's disaster anything they just have negative energy issues and\nAlso getting if there's some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or ... whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual the safe this is my main concern not are dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom for that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kinda stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past life\nHelping people that to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be giving is the ability to help people it's dangerous work\nBut the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so drained\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is Val I'm feeling better

I didn't I didn't know when I was dream that it was a dream and was on the loose a tree but afterwards I woke up right after and\nSo sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is somebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has and consuming use drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream\nSoon she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on any mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ...
