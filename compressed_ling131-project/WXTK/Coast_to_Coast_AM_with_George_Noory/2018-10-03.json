A. dot com call now\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether the global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box telling me about the titles personable\n[noise] sure well that's a this is a book or that tells you what's your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase years over and over and think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green box because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxer sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and are populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nIn in my presentations and I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man's since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody come up with a right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nA and they actually built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying this huge sheets of ice falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have a big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about the city's not want renewable energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional a nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind a you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries so this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure\nOr some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the cost of a wholesale electricity\nAnd that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about in my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a ...\nYes or no they uh all modern landfills and in Europe in the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide ... sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe or the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is making a comeback as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so ... or as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to a climate discussion I'm so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted no I've\nNever had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so so a natural factors dominate\nUm and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and\nClimate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of which cycles which are of\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they cause the ice ages then we have medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are the the fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in their regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what

signed up to this ah the ah ah most of them signed the Kyoto Protocol and Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd um it was I was at a conference at the University of Chicago today and they mentioned it all the

to call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that\nUm manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down in the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean currents\nOr which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian and the Pacific the the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so um there was there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nThere was a good movie though\n[noise] yeah okay this whole thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll egg and they'll make it\nStill doing its thing whoa okay go ahead John\nYeah ah my dad who ah who quiet down I just want to stay you we're\nWe're talking about wind bills when I when I was\nLiving in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind meals that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and there was plenty more boy\nBlue flame you know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas while we're asking now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know electricity\nNow come back and they said no no no and it's going to cost too much I can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Wonder why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment or three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having stepmom You're welcome to smoke into several times I heard him on many shows\nAnd he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that accuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends she\nNot to make the same mistake that these are climate change hopes are\nAre are using a bag lady I Believe you said\nA one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion Peebles it's quite a few of those are those are United Nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day or we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to know\nThey are two dollars a day just four hours a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or a ... a a young child than a\nHere's the point is you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo watch frosty has told us is that your section thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massively improved airlines they're doing All right with out as a boss she will ridge a lot of them are are counting illegally into this country because they had been tricked and deceived into thinking\nThey're going to get a better quality of life and they had down there because you're having a lot more money in their pockets but that you know I didn't I didn't want to suggest\nThis week in Nineteen fifty five Baltimore

good but yeah we're not going to go back to the days when most of the world was uninhabited we at all for us and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to to NASA\nOr their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age no scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nWould obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey a if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm uh there are some some um\nIndications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast with historical accounts peas are used to be a big court or a big uh port on in in a northwest\nItaly an excuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what they what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call Hi Steve odd routes you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a mention I perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and gum and what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of\nSo anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this a lot of cameras assemble\nHarp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it first of all\nAny time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite maps that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon but there's a fight a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that\nThis guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps anonymous name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting you can see storm friends hurricanes tropical storms low pressure zone coming directly in the California\nThey're being blocked and is being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power\nAnd can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricanes they can stall hurricanes\nThey can blast thunder heads they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act of the military industrial complex what's have our with our weather\n... ones don't hear about it and the new let's can Steve's reaction to the Bruce IQ\nBruce uh some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some cloud seeding attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that's something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he did go ahead [laughter]\nOh well just go oh yeah man just said is exactly right I Want to these conservative it happens to believe\nThat the way to add on is being gay or engineered the Kim trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently a gentleman on his show\nTalking about Kim drill team put out a video call Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the earth blotting out son well people are so much hit your head\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said that are going to back off the campaign trail well now the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's it's to the point now you can go to Wall Street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want hurricanes that they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd on top of that then you got the geoengineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct\nAnd if they ... you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea didn't may never come up with man is not smart enough to harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing\nWith Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham meant that what they were doing a stripping the wealth of industrial nations away\nDistributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China sits over there with their skies completely on with pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America but it going to play the oh I Know that now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to wear out of time Steve and ed thank you for your comments Steve thank you good luck with the work outside the green box smokes

in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee\nSo he's watching this thing going up and down and think keep to themselves what on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here now he couldn't cross the river and when the thing came down on the tree\nIt went into the the trees the surrounding it all in other words there were like low growth ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it\nAnd want to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and one position and staring at him\nSo now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later he sees them less willing in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank\nAnd going out of sight in front of him into the woods so we had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with your kid in the park you know\nThose right now you mentioned earlier about a

down more credit card you usually hear from them so warm during the boom you're free\n[noise]\n\nOkay\nWell come back when she was William the abominable snowman the lady from the humility is is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting uh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor\nWho was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time nickel\nAnd they form this unlikely friendship and turned that into a hiking partnership\nAnd they had run across a couple of big for its\nMessing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor said that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was on familiar with now this is a Russian speaking immigrant\nSaying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with so when you talk about the the Eddie in ah the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was one step above the Bering Sea\nAnd did these things or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they parked on a\nPulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while and they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the uh the uh uh yesterday and the abominable below snowman I have no idea uh I have a Sanders since book the abominable a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature\nA and yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about Bigfoot or a hoax the\nFilm is a hoax all of the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of uh what the majority of the people out there I think about it so that's one of the things I Love about coached\nYou know a a we all tune in because we're hearing things that we can't get\nIn ... nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos in big encounters where's the ...\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the dead falls incident but one day they'll share with you a was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys all working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and then the second day uh the focus was on that of ah getting attention being have so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words help than SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green vows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike to see what it was like a navigating around in the dark ...\nAre now during the day they had climbed up the side of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area or at night for the hike\nWell when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own monarch yellow\nOr that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail\nOne or the kid says hey what's that and they noticed in the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a you know a battery operated lantern but then they realized that this things started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even close to their butt trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it\nFinally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it they could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees around\nIt right so now they're passing a\nWas that bright yeah I mean it's it it it's
