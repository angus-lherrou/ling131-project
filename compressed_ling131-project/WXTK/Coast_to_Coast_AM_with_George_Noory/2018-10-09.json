people do hold crypto currency inside their IRAs well\nAre you suggesting people have a bitcoin i._r._a. instead of a gold or silver IRA\nNot at all we given investors the option don't both in their IRA now explain that force when I first heard about it pointed treated for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy by two pizzas with ten thousand bitcoins that were worth about twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker today those\nTen thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars and we stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWow that's quite pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a little tricky to buying holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin is bitcoin or currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people on on it\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that\nWe do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell

age\nIf I were on the lawn mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nI I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about was what we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a supposition and that is that people are machines\nIf if you are a machine and your brain as a machine and your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred the two thousand two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my probably cost about it I I I find that the one person in twenty ... doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nBit there may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good if it's ... it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the\n... and opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um you could have an airline\nPilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink when you got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer fly all the airplanes in it quote\nHas a heart attack look that yeah that\nMay that may propagate through a systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the growth in the ... and just really the incredible growth of this kind of technology\nYou mean is it the human being\nThe main thing that fuel for technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that very interesting reason which was\nNewt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we didn't\nThat being said people get excited about a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it it can it if you out of business you can make probably any department in your business and ten percent faster ... better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things he couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some really cool things if there were no more advances and I ah we probably had twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is\nUh they they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nA it's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response to its environment so land mine is a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary very rudimentary\nUh yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said um and it's a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a peaks or carrying a gun\nMhm and then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also stiffer gunpowder and\nYou know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's that's better I guess it's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that\nFights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we are going to make a ton of mass killings systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budget sitter spending good money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nUm could could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person\nTo approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and show or it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions you can always disabled them\nSo I think it's inevitable that we're gonna for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a a weapon systems it's\nGoing to have well for for three very easy reasons you can argue that ah\nThey're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage in wherever they are\nYou then argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ... a ... and ... and whatever country you are and and and third you know they will they will work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost of going to war which\nUh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nAh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapons systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if one has no cost\nA then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the day in my room that you know we're coming up to the top of the hour we'll finishes up when we come back next hour but you know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial like cars with driverless cars do you see the day that uh you know\nAll the entire post office system will be done because they'll deliver and with\nArtificial male people for example let's think about that will be back\nTo find out where you are ... speaking ... down to the bottom including your calendar\n[noise] us to this day every week possible by me or if you really want to give credit for it if I Lived\nOr call one eight five five nine for nine radio that's one eight five five nine for nine seven two three four\n[noise]\n\n\nI'll come back by Ron ... with the survivor and do you think technology will ever replace pulse still people who deliver the mail to our houses\nYou know um I I had a I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really want machines to do it I mean 'cause if if the machine can do a job to make a human do that job there's a word for that that's called B humanizing mhm\nBecause if if you just use a person for stand in\nFor a machine then you're saying nothing about you that makes us human I'll be interested in we only need you to be a machine that there'll be invented\nA is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine washers windows I can imagine machine that automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies\nThis country for two hundred and fifty years just as high unemployment between five and ten percent all the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of the job is fifty years I think every fifty years half of the jobs vanish\nAnd so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years right and we had rising wages and because so why are\nWe able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out and everybody sees it and says I'm going to use is to increase my own productivity so what ever if you get self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city if you are I mean like\nIt it's hard it's hard necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if if it went back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's ... billion people are gonna use it what do you think it was going to do the jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were going to vanish she would say well that's gotta be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise]\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you when you see at sea air B. and B. Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs are going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEvery body Everytime technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do\nA what a waiter can do you know they you you still a drink\nYou know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThat you have a special order and you want you want to send your food back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can they can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult\nYeah so well\nCorrect correct but it's proved very difficult\nLike right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long\nSo right now hands down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of moving there are going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just\nWay beyond you know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets that right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kind of wherever that I'm not like you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer can\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it and let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines and which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons\nBut people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project to try to take this little worm you got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model out of the computer just pick a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we we are so\nSpectacularly amazing\nUh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things\nWorrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of ours but it's like that far out [noise] so\nYou call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages we already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do and\nAnd we've used it to overcome scarcity because for law human history there's just never been enough for the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor and the division of labor says you know you specialize on I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave his prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened uh you invented a nation state and that's why five thousand years ago you can kind of shut your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge ... Mesopotamia missile America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that\nUm that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both of you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or you're ...\nYou're right that is already Fishell intelligent ... it is to be\nFrightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and said that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are filling up bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment long that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it\nI used to say only ones left and then it was just ... GE and so none of the companies that were on the dollar originally the big powerhouses or they're\nYou know sometimes a new technology comes along and they just don't adopt a blockbuster you know a streaming video came along and they were like yeah we'll we'll just wait and see and Kodak you mentioned them and I'm\nA Polaroid the same story which uh which digital photography\nAnd they didn't they didn't catch on right blockbuster on another one\nExactly with regard to drones I agree with you we're we're going to have to work that out and you know where where in search early days but uh but yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs there's going to have to be laws is going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't have because uh that's a very real\nWorking

think he was still in a world where there's a a billion people who are are hungry or you've got a lot of people who need to feed you still have illness that\nKills everybody you start poverty which I think's a technical problem you've all these problems technology can solve why do I say that because\nThey don't have to be there there are there are lots of problems that aren't technical like there's hatred bigotry and all of that but there are certain things we just haven't figured out how old are you in disease how do you\nSlow down aging how do you do all of these things and so\nThey're suffering people around the world that just are waiting for technology to come through and\nAnd finally deliver on all the utopias people used to dream I wouldn't it be great if and now finally we've learned district and we can now make enough with all the good stuff for everybody and we just we're almost there and and so I don't think we I Would speed it up if I could there's there's still too much suffering\nIn the world Richie ... also known as the last thing\nYou know we live in a world a universe\nThat looks looks vaguely looks very in the uh it looks like it's waiting for us to pay a

this this universe and so we we got to get there are right now we're we're we curiously balanced on this you know pale blue dot\nIt's going to Ritchie in West Virginia now Ritchie taken away go ahead sir\nThe morning and thanks for having me on the shelves and say ... interesting topic I just wanted to ask your guest there or if you think that the way technology is progressing that we may get to that your to your age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings as\nWorking alongside with technology\nI oh I Love that question you know you know Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did go up ... fold just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education do they can grow your own food make your own clothes you can work Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty or ... people decided they wanted more and so there's no limit to human once it turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has\nA so we're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home but not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies\nBut it turns out we've always worked forty hours and we've if if if our productivity goes off we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\n[noise] where do you see this fifty years from now whenever this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine the machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing your just\nLooking around you and say you know who the machine a\nFix by rote probably couldn't machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\n... style than than what fan now can pay for it and come home they can't take care\nOf him and called him an M ... and ... it gets have to say and I'll listen off the air\nTalking about automatic guns\nWell okay I Know you're you're in the guests bart is entirely right [noise]\nUm we are using a economists weapons were killed decision of course we've done that\nSince landmines we drop drop dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is rebuilding machines that the kill a so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we built machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nYou know make more of that systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decide that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but bart I agree with you\nBefore the age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books are sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just does it by ... dot com and there'll be a lot of lakes\nSo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's gonna how jump\nTo very simple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide average income per capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ seventeenth fifty nothing happened a lot if you look studying Seventeen fifty\nShot up like a rocket um\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we date to scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go some vast amounts of well created a eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger\nYou will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming it's all kinds of people said it would be possible but um\nYou know this country the United states already Throws Away in a food to feed all the hungry people\nNot world no question isn't that the that the world strains to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that wouldn't be traumatic more to come on coast to coast as we talk about the ghost photographer next\nNow you can

and then made my way to San Francisco\nAnd Los Angeles\nAnd here you are writing\nStories about ghosts interesting thing is\nThe title of your book for\nWhat some of your peers say about the fact that I mean here you are you were corporate executives doing some great work and now you're writing a story about the ghost photographer [noise]\nIt it's it's a great question I\nThink and data\nAnd I'm and I'm you know any organization thing Iraq honest person when I started telling stories um they\nBelieve even if they were kind of on the way you make a\nNerd [laughter]\nAnd I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people have kind of gone with me on a journey um I I you know fight one percent they just they can't make their way over\nRight are nice that's right\nBut if not more than half the people that when I started telling stories to interrupt me fast\nI mean there's [noise] and I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell the stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their you know talk about their experiences because\nSo many people have had him and I also wanted them\nTo you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that people are all into this and like you said not a lot of ... minutes but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners and because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them\nBecause I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit about medium ship just you know some of the things in a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans leave and\nGo so we're almost majority\nAttorneys were barely a minority\nAnd that's grown up\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over sixty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is Googling the word ghost\nNot all sing yes every two seconds\nSo none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening um but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey I had a way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nHas nothing to hide and you have nothing to hide\n... journey started for you because personal situation\nYes she did did you know just\nThis started from me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey Adderall transformational Journey Through grief [noise]\nUm I lost my mother to all timers a and you know I I you you'd only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghost and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd open a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes world holder guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started this aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand\nPhotographs have\nYou been doing Shannon me these what kind of camera [laughter]\nAnd I found\nI use and what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was an iPhone I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sam son Kamron out of phone but like a regular camera\nAnd it was interesting because all I captured on that um or or it's not that ... you know are unimportant and special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else\nInteresting now\nWhen this was going on for the entire jury looks looks good into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through this year I mean how did I start to heal from that you started to get the strange thing\nYeah I Am you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how make me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets the Sherman Oaks screaming you know hide your kids had your wife got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so ... so I had some guides\nI ... you know that that we're helping me understand it and an album investigated and um I I started you know and then after I saw the first coast and a photograph I um\nYou know I kind of panic was intrigued because I I got to be\nHonest with you George I was a little bit of a skeptic before skeptic as then it's not true\nSkeptic that you want to know about you\nRight right I it it was in a this can't possibly be true kind of person but\nYou know I was like really really take pictures of goes\nUm so I you know I I read a lot I investigated I talked I I I mean I I think I did what any but he would do is just trying to understand what was happening and you know I I think\nLooking at the underlying aspect of it is I I I think when people are in grief and people are experiencing grief I'm wearing chaos and when you're in\nChaos um you're able to open up and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it whatever skepticism you may have and and I think you fall into things like this\nI'm with a lot of eased because you're looking\nYou're looking for something right you become a seeker and I think for me I became so incredibly interested in it\nAnd I would spend hours taking pictures and I would spend hours um you know putting them through a photo lab on like negative mode or add some color because you different things would come out I became\nSure she said you know and get depressed and stay in bed I said yes and she goes I was in bed when you called this morning I had the phone in the bed with me I saw you calling I went to go reach for the phone but I was paralyzed\nCouldn't move she said imagine what would have happened if I Would have picked up the phone and I said I'd be dead today she's like yeah you would\nAnd so yes it completely changed me because I firmly and fully believe that I'm going to but I Am on a bonus round\nSure and the big lesson is about paying attention people say what's your book about and I said I can tell you a lot of things but the number one thing I'm going to tell you to pay attention and trust yourself\nWhen you take your pictures mhm are you aiming at something or does it just\nIt's both I learned early when I started staging everything one day I set the stage pot down and I started taking pictures of the smoke because it wasn't hadn't all burned out yet [noise] and um what I learned was\nThat smoke as like a canvas for goes\nI was able to see them so clearly in the smoke and they would like kind of pulled a

interesting ... were you talk about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of make believe it's coming true isn't it\nThere was a he was a man who was a experience they ... actually spoke to the ... man ... man like\nDoesn't really have facial features he where it's like a foot door and sometimes a coat but what people get the feeling they have is just out of fear right because they'll see this kinda shadowy figure while they are their bodies paralyzed but they're awake and\nAnd one man asked you know who are you and he said they called me scratch and scratches another name for the devil\nBack in the day when he tried to Adam and Eve away from God to really get scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's

our spirit spirit goes off and parties and the actual face I'm sure many people have talked about that show planes and you know what our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and\nI think that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line on is when this can happen\nAgain it's just a theory which were pretty good\nIt's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have it are bad because you know what\nThe light doesn't need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark but dark needs a lot you know the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't\nReally want to spoil for folks 'cause I I I Hope people read the book I'm a at what happened that last time that Alex ... man because\nOf that is probably the most profound event that have happened in my entire life\nWould you want to duplicated duplicate that experience yeah yeah I can handle it now you would really yeah I could put you couldn't\n[noise] um it was um oh let me just tell them so I just\nTell your audience what happened what happened I'll do it if you want me to George uses like All right I'll tell them All right we have a couple of minutes yeah oh\nIs it something about the blackout oh I'm Sorry\nI mean is when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes Oh yes so I so how how about you just tell everybody incentive is the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called me and one night and said I saw that man again\nAnd and he spoke to me and what he said to me was how her my name is Ron and I went he he said what he said\nHow her my name is wrong because I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of I accept that\nIt was not very nice jeeze and I said and he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him\nI don't think it was my extent that but I think it was that man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare you they're going to find that thing that triggers you right there I find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that\nAnd and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening to you [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which is now I mean do you feel as if you're in control of what's happening\nI I Am I Am I Am I Am now because I now understand\nThat I Am in charge\nI completely understand I Am also I've become fearless\nUses the photography ... facet of that it's almost like that's the hobby will you do the ...\nYou know that goes with ... feet and um and ah and storytelling it would be considered um the inciting event\nIt's it's that event is what triggered all this other stuff to happen and photography with you know a little scary at first because I\nIt's weird it's it's it's weird there's no data\nDo you know who the subject matter is or you are these random ghost [noise]\nUm [noise] I Do have a picture of my mother has passed um I didn't include it in the book because it felt a little too sacred to include that in the ... are doing um but other than that I don't recognize a single one I've had a couple that have come back twice\nSome of them look like they're in Eighteen hundred garb\nThey do\nThey do yeah no I I don't know who is all of them are there some of them um you know I feel like I've gotten a few that looked like they had a rough time the last time\nThey come and their bodies like a guy looks like he's been beat up a woman who looks like she's very sad\nMaybe that's how he died\nIt could very well be could very well do they talk to you\n[noise] you know I'm after a while and after I got past the I Can't believe this is happening to me face um when I Would be able to see them I Would I Would start to ask 'em I I was better\nWeirdly by communication is better when I talked to love what people's loved ones go faster than they are\nStrange guess\nJulie
