longtime friend the coast to coast am of courts and Mitch is a very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here\nI'll always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and ah it's a big bridge that I've crossed with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\nYou know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group\nOr their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members of that club\n[laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group outside of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five why or experimenting\nWith San says and medium ship and talking to the dead and table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had this sort of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with this sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of the original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan Doubleday uh we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written and I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are cause it if I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this\nAnd I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on math is\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can define miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book in which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long\nInterval sometimes there is a long gestation period between ... and the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives they will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some lives is this similar things that the positive people do but that something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly and honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities\nThat responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in advance\nMentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect so my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives of\nOther ... before you came on and he uses that he was in Israel in of course great mental list\nAnd it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland and over the stadium they put him in a helicopter in he was supposed to influence\nThe ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved in and the guy missed it or something like\nThat and now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law items when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor I've and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I haven't went in his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely what he true\n[laughter] I Know Edgar Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program\nWas talking about a tie class episode he had a NASA tie class and the ... or or type pin and he lost that he couldn't find it\nAnd he was telling or you bought into and out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping and it was the tight class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the\nOther part of it the part that class into the the pointed at the end of it yeah was in ... ice cream [laughter] yellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing these are the ... in there for that [laughter] just amazing but\nBack to these miracles and when we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but\nBack to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but you know that'd be too but you know people dabble in the dark side the curse of other people they put ... on other people\nAnd then a lot of cases those things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum and\nMy contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you're using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect\nHowever one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind our tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project\nNegatives spell or thought on to another person\nIs if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else\nIf he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection against evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we are apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook simple things\nIf you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there is an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences from cyclical research to quantify the arising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nAnd lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated and clinical experiments today I think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't\nMean that we don't live under many laws enforces but if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments but the thoughts change the brain\nYour sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter so if fought changes the brain and fought has to be something that's extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nWoodward's human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't that Iraq if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method it works they're thrilled they try to get it doesn't work and then they feel dejected one of the things that I read about on the book is that we live within\nA cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces the law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind is the same way circumstances\nAre going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're ...\nWe experiment very clearly and very carefully\n... gonna come back and talk more about your work\nNext hour we'll

of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or

passionate intensity is the one the hidden key behind every health health program with it\nOr something will work without it nothing happens now one of my contention is that we really need to have one absolutely definite chief aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all end\nIn one direction and my challenge the listener is whether you can come up with one overarching goal that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim\nYou have arrived at mental focus and mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\nInteresting work Mitch or what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put this together or did you do this all on your own\nDo all of my own you know this is really my
