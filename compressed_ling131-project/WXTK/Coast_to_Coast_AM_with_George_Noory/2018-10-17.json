see with us a rod Serling his life working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nHundred and ... and I know three of 'em for example it's a good life in praise of pit long distance call were with a guy Billy ... who was a kid that scared everybody into the cornfields [laughter] yeah they sure yep and as a matter of fact I have a little surprised for you Nicholas\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately\nYeah what was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called my gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even ... he's the one who probably pitched it to the network will I bring all the\n... after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or\nYou know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell he never a novel he did write your collections of short stories\n... sure but I mean the\nClosest the ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary um ... but he never\nHad the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be removed to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out or is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it\nAnd from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I Am cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be reenter reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wandering around surely one of the co writers a planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written\nBy Michael Wilson and rod Serling a so he did get co credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHeat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer to give she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know we only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own universe or a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of instruments\nThe race which led to the series in search of and during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a a true believer or anything like\nThat now the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials that's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story and a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story and twenty four minutes and then he went out and get it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed it\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it ... and and the show was so yeah I just said if so they're so different it was very hard to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know it's hard science fiction fantasy too westernized comedy is to you know went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as it's walking distance wrote songs for season\nA episode about his kind of archetype all you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know religious youth and go back to a easier less stressful\nLife was that the Willoughby or it's just like well yeah it's kind of a stop but will it be a kind of a companion piece to its well distance\nYeah so they're both very similar and they're both among among my favorites and that was that was a big theme visceral English this idea of going back to his innocent youth in in bringing to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric or to serve man that was a classic a\nMan is absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still now to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that stuff\n[laughter] ever [laughter] and uh they're just so many good the uh what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with ah [noise] ah you hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and starve to ever at Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started that and you start in the fever and yet exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of direct Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that they think just taunting him\nA drove him crazy after a while the ... exactly right yeah\nAll right Nick stay with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk

about the current state of TV\nWell I I think in a way to learn regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nOr during a time that restaurant was writing obviously we talked about some of the censorship but\nNot on the issues but also the language and and just the just the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there's so many shows that are are are so adults in school or you know if I go to map the name of a madman and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think it would be thrilled with how how uh the what the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and there's certainly a whole lot of you know jump too but um but I think\nIn general you'd be happy with the one thing I can tell you I'm sure he he would hate reality television I on the um he and I don't\nSay that just you know that's not just like me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television for its time a rod has a very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life [noise]\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody ought to the show with the normal you know regular everyday person that we often you know shot as family members out there and they would go through his scrapbook and look at you know it's kind of reality television for the time and he just\nDespise the show or you know he thought it was just flipping invasion of privacy and everything else so the reality TV he would have but I think there are so many shows now that you would absolutely love\nAn old time television tuned to a really did not understand the racial mix up demographics when you look at some of these shows were you gone back or even the comedians are the game show\nThey were all white guys you know and and I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm Talking to a white guy [laughter] where the television\nYou know it would be difficult to get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you use thinking him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you can you're right I mean well listen to the larger the field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be good it's kind of like talking about now major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know yeah you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know I'd be in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS CBS didn't want to hear it that was it\nNowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I have some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nAnd it's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you're talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of this sets which to me was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer and the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was watering from Nick if he knew how many cameras used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that that's one of the striking things about the series is is that you know of course the production level in terms of budget you know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the\nTime but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the\nBrilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest a set and uh so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make\nYoung actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like ... of the beholder or you know nightmare twenty thousand feet or something and then he went to one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back on the control\nHe jumps started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to\nBe Robert Redford start yeah yeah has learned Redford\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was a very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to say what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders\nAnd and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series is it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spin offs person you know ha says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery or because everybody thought she was ugly in she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else looked like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there is a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above the fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what that is what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into it and they can all get into it and they turn on each other and it was yeah that was a terrifically a well known episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi I you know I'm an episode that's a very rare episode that it was finally or at least ... years later I was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas dealer\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great and you know a great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to the half hour I'll\nRarely yeah okay yeah and miniature was one of the hour long episodes and it it was involved in a in a lawsuit\nAt the time that uh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nIn so that was long long settled and um there was a special on called the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has a horrible horrible incident yeah helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA it was yeah yeah cats they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead yeah Hi\nMake a couple of questions or\nOne would be the first one would be a vaccine like\nIt was very a scape is more than maybe someone stay back in the sexism just speculating if you had a job and it came home and watch the twilight zone that would be almost like an escape from your daily reality\nAnd I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really like that my second question would be a doubt the mysterious endings which\nThat means he'll be fourteen months not so from what I understand he has to serve at least three years into the ten year sentence let's head over to the cell phone good morning colonel is I where are you this morning\nThe morning and in reference to a Bill Cosby I'm curious what the state prison it's going to do with him because he's gone in with a block almost type blindness\nSituation so what's the taxpayers of Pennsylvania are going to spend

gradually backwards at the beginning [laughter] um but no that that's that I couldn't tell from that from that description of may have written it\nDidn't one step beyond pop up after twilight zone\nYes uh yes how the outer limits came after the twilight zone as well but no actually one step beyond I Believe actually perceive the twilight zone by year I'm Out on this came after we but I Believe a one step beyond which started in fifty eight I think\nNext up we're going to end in Tulsa, Oklahoma Edward taken away I appreciated\nGeorgia neck you know I was strolling man he was he he had the ability to be able to understand human nature 'cause if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know everyone wanted his shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of his experiences at a combat soldier during World War two which I you know it was all about uh the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd everything had been through one of my favorite episodes it's hard to say which is my favorite but I think it has to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber\nComing home from Italy crashes in the desert the capital of that airplane didn't go on that mission for whatever reason which was Robert coming Bob comings I'm Sorry ... and up Bob comments just having me walking by a scene is newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd he went back in time where you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd we live the experience even though he didn't fly that mission you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room\nAnd having psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him to have a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock\nOf seeing an airplane on the newspaper just recently you know and when they when the show in the closer the ending of it the nurse bodies clothing out there and she said well there's sand in his shoes\nAnd so somehow or another he really transport himself back in time and be twenty five it crashed you know struggle do shows that ... did\nHe had a time machine you know one of 'em this guy you know went back in time three different times and he thought he would try to after events that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that while he failed\nIt one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that so I went back and he ended up and Nazi Germany that already thought he could alter that of\nCourse\nBut a man I don't know we it it'd be hard to say which be my favorite episodes is the the Christmas Story the guy that played art Carney played the ah Santa Claus in a department store I end the call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all times the guy was all a\nShrine hand\nWhen he got a break from the department store he went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was through grown man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down and he went in the back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bag just all of a sudden became full of gifts instead of a you know empty cans\nMan he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story\nYou know and the guy who ran a department store they found car well given these gifts out at this a place like a John three sixteen mission type place you know policeman comes in here and goes where did you get all these gifts if you get a receipt for all these gift blah blah blah and he goes no I just I found the bag and the gift rent it and I'm just giving them out\nPicking the PlayStation and the department store owner came a nurse yeah there it is there is the merchandise call well you're the blah blah blah you know\nAnd the guy's name was Mr done department store owner right and\nAnd they need to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but if you can do it right and they're so they had to let him go of course the store owners sent your scratching your head the policemen scratches it couldn't figure out where all those gifts recover from it they were coming out of that bag\nSo just before they released a coal oil Santa Claus he reached into the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three and handed it to Mr\nGandhi you know say merry Christmas and\nBoth of them got pretty pretty toasted on wine and they walked outside and they seemed Santa Claus flying overhead and a slave with reindeer\nAnd ... and that right there just catches my heart Everytime\nI live in you as you mentioned something about cans and remember kick the can Nicholas\nOh sure sure yeah kick the can and that was actually re made in this well its own future film as well about a a old old folks home where a ... one of the old one of the people there and wants to get the get the residents to kick the can to feel young again and of course they do become young again my point kick the can and\nAnd the one person who was against it the whole time he didn't play and he didn't get to become young and he regrets it obviously and and that that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually that's a terrific episode\nWe're running out of the time your neck but uh I got to tell you this is a topic that is so dear to my heart of it brings back memories when I was a kid watching television my folks were there in the living room with those those are great time sort of thing\nAnd it's great memories yeah yeah it was a different time and you know for all of us and uh yeah it's great to TV can bring you back that way and you know so it's yeah it's great to think about\nLife was different too sure it sure was yeah yeah absolutely it was a kid I didn't have a cure in the world we\nKnow and that's what the you know that that's something interrupt showing was was yearning for in a lot of us well isn't that supposed to be able to go back to being a kid and having to being carefree and being innocent and and the less stress and everything else and that came out

away a lot of people do I just felt that everything else [laughter] really\nBut you know I I was a middle aged guy I was in a restaurant business I was a stock market forecaster\nI used to that was one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I worked in a think tank yeah parents got sick got called back to Connecticut and ended up in the antique business after a restaurant jobs didn't work out things usually working life\n... that's true but people of color collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my baseball\nCards from the Nineteen fifties I don't know where they are I've asked my mother who is eighty nine years old mom checked the ... where are they she says George ... we gave them away\nWhat I had in the fifties every baseball card and clear that play during that period what would they be worth today a fortune\nWell Nineteen fifty two mantle card suppose it was in great good shape your real good shape right what would you

I've been told that's where the porch and I want ten thousand bucks for it to you by the by it\nI don't know I don't know until I call a guy like you\nWell that's worth a town somewhere in the neighborhood of a you know two hundred thousand dollars you know yeah oh\nI had ALS Caroline's and mental saying Willie Mays I had him all\nTo myself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes [laughter]\nI had to duplicate so we did it with the duplicates remember\nYeah with the duplicates in generally you had like I had Fifteen Pete Rose rookie guards to Islam\nI ran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles and the ... what would those cards have been worse if you'd given them to him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value very much it probably would hurt the value you don't want to do that with a you know you're better off having 'em sign a napkin\nYeah exactly a now old football cards and stuff are they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right now everybody's on the baseball cards that\nNobody's buying football cards which means you should be playing football ... interesting to write basketball cards\nI once saw a guy who had a complete [noise] he had Michael Jordan rookie
