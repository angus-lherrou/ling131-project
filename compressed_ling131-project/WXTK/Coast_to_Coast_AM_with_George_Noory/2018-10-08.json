the president currently does not have the power to ran an absolute pardon a burden that applies oppose the federal and state level this extended pardoning power could be very useful with members of

season this year you and I am and discussing the flu for six years now and it gets even more confusing or the big flu virus now is called age three and two and the ... it's the big hitter especially on the the elderly but George\nThe numbers fly all over the place so the CDC is scaring us that a hundred and Seventy five children died last year but fifty percent of those had preexisting

drinking behavior they were making an allegation of sexual assault if there was no corroborating evidence even among the witness she named\nBen this is over and Susan Collins is very uh it was and

that that\nSounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology are going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said we're of course that place turned out to be ... from\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made the international news with this discovery it it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending\nAll earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion and I think that either\nAnd if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them that are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would have destroyed is already\nIf you're in charge of the military if your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country then why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent\nBut still why don't we do what ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case you don't you need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving a\nBetter to be safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah I'll I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are beings out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but you know here's this is getting dark this this is very dark but I honestly this is a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien\nA fear us talk about talk\nAbout this kind of thing many times on the History Channel um if they they come back and they want to and slave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever if their goal is to come back\nHere and in slave us it might be a better fate for us to commit global suicide in other words and again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know colors on us and and work like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and that the idea is that we're not necessarily\nAs concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan I'm\nI'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made at one of his speeches I Believe it might have been before the un\nJumped in what if there was an alien threat [laughter] you know\nWhat did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to Roswell and um you know the the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who go snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep\nI mean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some ah beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do\nAnd so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps presenting that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings have run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah thank you it's it's this Saturday it's

I won't tell you the story that after they back in the nineties\nNow I I never believed in ... spirits UFOs eighties and things of that ... however ... Nineteen years middle nineties uh I had an uncle had passed away and they were having a little ... their church\nAnd I wasn't that close to him but I decided yeah anyway I I went I was late getting there so I had to sit back for the church was packed and the service is going on and all of a sudden I\nFelt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the push you a check and I looked up and it was my uncle just passed away\nAnd and he told me he said\nJohn ... your car and I wish I was shot at it and what to do it again you said John don't value car when\nI was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up late and what he was gone\nBut still I Wish I knew something\nAnd so I got it right on our friend of mine and next morning I called my cousin which was the son and it passed away and they ask you a ... bringing my car to the un I get him back home he said not at all\nSo he and his go and get my car and took over the cage for them that anyway he um\nHe looked at my home and they pull that that ... ... and it hit by a truck and they they won't kill but they were extremely you know injured a threat I mean they had ... votes in mind that too\nBut I never told anybody this at I was really a lot to say anything that it would it till two of my close friends and um I don't let it late at night but that\nI was sure they have the ... I guess you know up until now I haven't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the car\nYou know what I didn't want to do that after he told me down and\nBut you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no that was the idea\nThat they engage in my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a time I ever had anything like a safe ... you get all the same thing as for CNN\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks among us right now who are uh you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that\nThe past the president and the future all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like that song by the police and so when you are a spirit trapped here and this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline\nBy little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm that person may be astounded by the fact that he ...\nOr she can now see the future to a degree that you cannot\nOr it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle\nAh they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms that are coming that the aunt can't see the dancers more sensitive to what's happening I'm On a lower level so anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who Passover might\nDefinitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this a case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Roberts onto dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point lives like a king and and and this is very funny because he still does ...\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there they were taking them out\nAnd gets article IV releasing their pent up frustrations on him and it was when the shock wave of curses and bad\nLuck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this call here and you know he was fighting back yeah\nAnd it's because of that that um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people\nWho are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace\nAnd I think it's in part\nThese are places that conduct electricity and when that electricity manifest and ... in certain angles at certain cliff it can create what similar to to ball whitening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy\nAround western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these ball the white\nArt just merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or if they might also have some sense of intelligence and uh this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua his website Joshua ... worn dot

at eleven thirty ... and I was in the ... and the Katie hospital and log in\nAnd I'm cleaning and I'm often it's called the day room you know where the ... people come they do activities and all of a sudden I say this will nine year old boy I Would say maybe ten eloquently I cooked steamed directly straight you know just that core I perfectly\nAnd he's looking at me and I start mouth and they continue mop like okay this is kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering\nIt seems like since I've been working there for about a month like you think it's maybe\nAround October is that we're in the spirit you really show theirselves\nAnd he wasn't supposed to be there was he\nI I don't think so I talked to see in a in a\nCouple of the nurses and they told me that they everyone who goes in there by their cell\nOr maybe two or three people they feel like someone to watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh or what do you guys\nThink 'cause like it seems to me is October\n'cause it's not a full moon because it's full moon I could tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHuh do you know the little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they sent from what we understand no loans have died there but they said we don't know a full history\nWhile he's in hospital where do you think Josh\n[noise] well ... thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to when I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy filled being magnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder\nDrier environment and I know that certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you drag your socks on the carpet and touch the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating a luminous life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electrodes data charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible filled around that that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that\nThis time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something go sleep spooky ... or at very least metaphysical\nJosh don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of that goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people who have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina uh especially in ...\nAsheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody that becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah I every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people um for example Scottish dissent\nIn North Carolina then there are in Scotland\nAnd uh we should remember that the very first attempt at an English Settlement with in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Rowan Oak island\nAnd they all vanish so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mystery of the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating Fallon and Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure contributed to the fact that ah I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your uh been again one more time\nOr I go to Joshua pie Warren dot com is no period after the beep Joshua would be one dot com this

them accountable\n... ... ...\nAnd he writes the anti matter column which looks at\nFringe science and the paranormal for the online magazine uses his experience in journalism\nAnd his interest in both go slower and the paranormal to collect and tell stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard talking about some haunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much thanks for having\nMe on very background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that\nWay on Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up\nYeah thank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story on Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or did Halloween cut into your birthday when you're you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday exponential I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it is kicking off the year I Lived this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nA and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural so I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and\nAnd sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to ... go stories with\nTales of sacred in cities and and forty entails so a hunted World War two it turned in to be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military haunting as opposed to regular kind\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university goes stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music there was there sort of a light hearted aspect of the stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two goes for\n'em and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of\nAtrocities and World War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and [noise] you know all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research haunted World War two\nTo was that um [noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think ghost stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect into history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nOr you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops in ... during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details\nSo I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew above the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had a friend who just went to a little big corn\nOh we're customs less than was and you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg Reno was wanted right I'm sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting does it because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma of war\nAh causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some of the arrests that also say that\nYou know the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plant to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole\nSkeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal uh activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most tang to the ball\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories\nAre especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourist there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications a seemed to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of French for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the\nThe father and the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker and when\nThe daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff\nI immediately recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away\nBut then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw and he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she ... he tried to keep that\nAway from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what\nCould have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom put do and he told me that uh he investigated the art dens battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany a and a site of the battle of the bulge\nJust to like that yeah yeah like they want to do a different time warp or something right\nAnd the reason I looked into the these are a ghost plane stories is when I was young my parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they\nWere starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy a ... you make of sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Erie\nThat watch it with my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well\nEngland was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any stories similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to

I didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years navy for me so let's not leave aside well\nYeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so the interesting thing about uh after World War two was you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got all them or to reduce them to scrap it uh luckily for us a lot of\nPeople got into preserving those um\nShips those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports they brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call him shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing this shadow creature around the uh the carrier\nUSS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented\nA ship base a haunted sites are there there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who uh wanders around the deck\nSome of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with a uh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there\nUm and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those are and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved um and have him back here goes and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seem to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy mhm for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\nYeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element\nOf uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but uh when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of\nOf country these tragedies just seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe that were just so primed\nUm to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew Swain we're going

hear people shuffling\nAround the hear voices fans have also blogged about how they believe like they've had an encounter with it goes to\nPrint out they seem to be everywhere will come back we'll

the\nGentleman that Clancy sue gum stands do employ gunned them soon so I'm twenty nine dollars designer labels and that is your personal service you expect but not ones dams known as the ... from the name\n\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm\nDave Schreiber a key vote on the Senate confirmation of the new Supreme Court justice makes news with a comment about the most prominent accuser ABC's truck secrets and Senator Susan Collins of Maine Republican talking about accuser Christine Blasey Ford\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nThat welcome back to coast to coast Matthew swing with us Matthew a Adolf Hitler as sick as he was was also interested in the coal did you come across anything that the dealt with that\nYou know I did and I came away with a a little bit of a different perspective about Hitler in the cold [noise] uh you know initially I thought that Hitler was a coal practitioner throughout his life\nBut what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial when I'm sure there were people have different ideas and I'd be glad to entertain the stocks to [noise] but it sounds like Hitler's early\nOr a loss of the was a influenced by\nA coal groups like the whole society in the real society very prevalent in a pre World War two Germany in that area\nBut what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things are not at a coal theorists but more of an incredible to see a path a nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of our a worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power\nAnd so what you see later is that a Hitler begins to purge a lot of it is a cult groups he starts to go after fortune tellers\nAnd astrologers so I came away with a little bit of a different opinion\nOn the cold in in Nazi Germany uh likewise I was sort of fascinated that the cult played a much bigger role in my opinion a among uh\nThe side of the allied side so\nThere were the wiccan in England who uh\nTry to get together to uh spiritually\nOr go after the Nazi regime uh they held um meetings in the ... got together with the express purpose of trying to to stop 'em and Germany from invading England and likewise uh and I really picked us up from a frequent guest on coast to coast Mitch Horwitz\nYes ah the\nAllied a new thought ... a movement those a lot of the practitioners for that group were very involved and to try and use spiritual techniques a cult techniques to stop Hitler from uh from succeeding so\nThose were a different ways that a ... you know when I tried to write a book I'm I'm really I Know a lot of people write books because they know a lot I like to learn a lot so I go into a some of these stories with really preconceived notions\nAnd then as I delve into it I find twists and turns that that I I tried to bring out uh in in the book\nNow in your stories on haunted rock and roll told me the theme about those\n[noise] well the theme about haunted rock and roll is that I'm really when I started writing hunter rock and roll and again another I listen to our Gary Patterson on your show many times uh\nAnd uh you know I started to investigate and what I thought initially was that rock and roll had this special cult power and maybe people that were into the court were attracted to it\nBut after writing of the country book and then revisiting rock and roll for more on a rock and roll what a ... uh I came away with is the thoughts that music is really just to consciousness raising tool\nAh it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also a key part of a lot of\nUm historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the listener and and the musician\nThat I think makes either people more open to things like the supernatural the cold or maybe a you know actually can kind of promote these these types of powers in these types of of of visions so that's really the theme that kind of runs through all of those book in my opinion\nWell that's pretty dramatic stuff and the like we were talking earlier the current rock stars that have seeded haven't shown up yet but they will I think eventually don't you\n... yeah I sometimes this is a matter of what I find is that it's a matter of\nThese stories in these tales in the supernatural usually start out than to than musician to musician\nA person that witnesses it talks to another friend and then for me it usually bubbles up on line and blog posts and then uh newspapers will investigate I'll look into it goes counters will be attracted to the site so it takes a while I'm I'm Still waiting for some good ghost stories about David Bowie for example\nJames Dean of course died young in a car accident and was in his car chopped up into little pieces and they saw all the parts and apparently they were haunted\n[noise] yeah that's a ... the name of his car yeah he um he had a car was a poor spider or wasn't involved in Iraq and then\nA pieces of it because it was really a race car um pieces of it were salvaged and I know there's one story about um a a one race car driver used a piece in his car and a car fell on him and I think crushed him to death\nBelieve it or not there's a parallel to that in the haunted World War two book there was a\nI think it was a beat twenty four that crash landed in the desert of North Africa pieces of it were recovered are that are now in the national I think air force\nA museum a and pieces of that plane were reported to be cursed in that uh I think some of the pieces went went into a a a a plane that later crashed I think a couple of planes crashed based on and so so there is a connection\nAll right let's take some calls here for you Matthew let's pick it up by going to Frank in Hollywood, Maryland again to start and Frank\nHow did your back with you when you made any subject you know I\nI I I think you know they had some things at the uh uh and not the Nazi Germany but what about\nA place where people were murdered by by not uh\nI watch a film where they don't get a shot at three hundred shot down over a day that they were shut down a credible what was found\nAnd I'm Wondering if any any haunting in in a remote places where you're not you're not take my answer off\nAir okay ... thanks\nFor that that's a that's a great question and I believe I Know exactly which which footage you're talking about and believe it or not one of the stories that I came across a is I think from that area because I I Believe that that might have been taken in Poland Czechoslovakia\nAnd there are stories about some of the victims of the Jewish victims of those atrocities um that still hunters areas again I I I found out of a difference for those those people that I Would leave them out of the book and and wouldn't try to try to um [noise]\nYou know be looked at like I was making any money from that so I I left that out but yeah definitely those stories crop up and I guarantee you if you were in those areas you would find a lot of go slower a lot of folklore ... and a lot of good stories about those places\nNot stop
