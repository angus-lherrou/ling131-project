colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analyst\nGroup and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing\nThat us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly up pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the ion air for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nOf course the Russians or suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that\nWe've tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine or that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria are of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nUh the powerful renewal of a twenty two new start and you know President Trump said I'm ... weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern to solve it\nYou know that is cutting back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world\nThat I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S we're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly headed commission on military technology that is of course being shared a\nSignificantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the stock a chain exercises you indicate that had three hundred thousand a soldier's thirty six thousand a armored vehicles or at least a thousand\nSome of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia straight at\nThe United states now practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War when President Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated\nSome might suggest that the United states was poking the bear and given their\nTheir passions for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest as perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back\nAgainst the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir putting\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nA nationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nAh and the things that they represent they paint or the wife says what Hollywood is spewing all of the world and they said you don't want that in fact\nA potent as is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nYeah and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he you know even though we suffer Terry and she still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in\nThe in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but you know it was just this week\nYou had you know a a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hit\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve\nBeyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\nYeah this past march they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to ah keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that food is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\n[noise] you're not exactly painting pollutant as an evil adversary and yet the the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion predatory economics strategic extortion\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I should go to every one of those Richard and\nThere was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nIn fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been rushing Chinese prime leaders have been meeting here recently and their parents ministers just met you know for taking time

in jeopardize our dominance in space or satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not\nJust the military it's economic it's diplomatic\nAh it's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information a appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and is helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those\nTypes of things on the use of the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates um be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I see the the Internet and what can be used in what can be so yeah there are strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you um about Saudi Arabia and\nHow important it is the United states uh to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a cause Shelby\nUm and how that might I mean there is there or dominoes at play here obviously I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his do Cold

of Americans over there are a lot of technology or they're totally dependent upon our arms of course uh they could go to the Chinese and Russians but they don't want to because ours typically are much better [noise] I I think the big question and that part of the world want is oil\nOr ... how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a cry for with of course their their major address or against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians Chinese are lined up with Iran and were aligned with the Riyadh a regime\nUm wow that's a very [noise] they've got a way of doing things uh that I certainly in the west we're not all excited about 'em but the reality is that um [noise]\nYou know a friend of my my friend oh what's the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is my friend or

lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis stays with is the book is a lines of evil Russia China the United states\nAnd a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived\nThere had been a ... obviously some older patients with the Russians are particularly um\nUh well I wouldn't call them Russian regular troops these are more like mercenaries in Syria the United states has certainly encountered were had heated battles with them or there have been some near collisions in the south China Sea was Chinese vessels how\nDo you see this or what is the the danger of this\nBreaking out into all out war and perhaps as you point out morphing into the unfathomable uh the end and then time scenario\nWell certainly the confrontations or on the uptick Richard you know we had one here recently with the U.S has a\nDecatur or destroyed or\nAre in the grave and race in the south China Sea or the Chinese warship came only a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of bi fifty to set it flew over a you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these pilots uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and your defense weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers with the practice from\nThat these are claimed by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nNext door to them it's really in the middle of it or see but these confrontations are on the increase uh we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea or the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air as I've indicated and of course uh they have their names\nFirst to the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we kill a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime a and of course uh the Russians wife their hands without even\nThough we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any in times scenario or is it is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got in to say is ... thirty eight that we're really talking uh the the Gaga mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's\nInteresting a friend of mine spoke with a a general now president el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a seeks to be the leaf and\nTo establish a cow of fat and his statements have been\nVery very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but\nYou know the release of the American pastor Brunson here recently\nAh was after great pressure we put on him a air do on a to cooperate with us but yet we find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there\nYeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA and he consistently has had over the years of very ambitious thoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that\nSome of these are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who are of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nUh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of allies\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria hoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so\nA lot of players here a confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to Washington and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her want her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait\nUm air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the U.S for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late a they even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ...\nFrom the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to Iran\nAnd on the coastline there then you can begin to make a plutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what I heard of one wants to\nAlternately ... it's just too rich so the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO offensively used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that you know because we will not connect our patriots and other fads to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why yeah there's a it's a non ... we just won't do it\nUh and that is a major um bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk ... secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it uh within Islamic viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nAre just getting set up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation [noise]\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the you know the military and their diplomacy or you\nKnow ... to promote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic rule view of of the removal of then I think that you find that they're not involved with a hoot teaser not involved with Assad a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyadh into Iran is going to continue um but it it if they're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and\nYou know Palestine and so forth then\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a more a better sense of history and were\nWere they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow up from that are positive aspect of that might be a\nLiberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia is well here's van Morrison taking is into the break with the band low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis when coast

I don't happen to believe it that's just me but he was one of the things that sort of bothers me about that situation and that is if we in fact we choose our circumstances\nWhy would someone choose for example or to reincarnate into a life that leads ultimately to physical abuse doesn't that almost place the the the burden on the victim in that case I think you will you chose that life\nOkay there are certain experiences that we learn from and yes I I understand where you're going in and I and I really do feel for the people that do choose a life like that it is a way of learning certain things and please remember we do have free will\nAnd there are times when people will uh advice us in the in the physical to get out of those relationship\nThose relationships if it's a pattern that a person has to learn from [noise] then they may have to go through it but there's always the chance that they can leave those relationships or we leave\n'em I I I understand that when when the child is young there's no place they could run into a because it's if it's parents siblings and there's a ... and there are circumstances where they live on the most horrendous ... a\nCircumstance is yes it is a tragedy to begin with ... yet what we're learning what were overcoming and that's the whole key here\nIs to overcome those abuses and also if for the parents if it's apparent abuse or other types of abuse they have the opportunity to overcome that as well and usually if it's a long term relationship they might have agreed to do that both of them\nThat this is the role that they will take\nAnd it's up to those two people that come to some kind of resolution of their behavior that they have to rise above that particular pattern so we can see the negative of it but there are cases where people rise above themselves\nAnd they become a hero in their own life because of the person that they may have abuse of they've been abusing\nThey may educate them somehow so there's always hope here and yes we do have guys in angels that do help us it is up that we is up to the individual to draw upon that help we need to call on that help our angels in God's\nAlright Joe thank you for that
