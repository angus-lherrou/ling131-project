yeah I said listen you want you you want to hassle of women there so you don't do it but what you have to take into consideration is is that women are going to run\nThings there's there's absolutely

watching is is is a ... a new crop of kids and and I tell folks and he said listen you know people say well these these ... that they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are not that I'm hearing about

feed themselves\nAnd and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became more\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that can\nI don't care listen it is what it is [noise]\nWell listen here's here's how it works is zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want when you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing a conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah what they tell me\nThat makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country\nAnd it's horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does we\nMay not it's not

the tools like that I don't think so\nNo that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know is\nWhen you talk about the trends in change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't get ... they didn't agree with each other and in I've never seen that this bad to have you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I

and possibly when um the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys yet and all they had was temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or try to bring down next man but more importantly that man has can actually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one buddy young wife include and his wife and\nWe had a president had did something so by all it can't even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I was paying for it and with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did that if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature and the second thing I disagree that is sad is that\nI'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school or by it and it but I'm I'm not that old value there\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than the things is that and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business as myself businessmen and women don't have time for now and then\nYou get a deal done we're not going to have a meeting to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have\nTime for that they're spending our money and so the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy doesn't win more appalling let's see doesn't save money we\nNeed a businessman I voted for him\nBecause he's a no nonsense that is that anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up yet I Know of course\nI thought I I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in a dish and he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what time it's hard and other people know that ... ... it it doesn't matter about just diplomacy she knows who she is as I as a man and and uh and as a prior to that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nAnd let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things with you on a jumping\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running the country as a business I think you need to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver toilet a fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that uh our country is a republic with a constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system\nOn earth and the thing that frightens me about it a bit a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to come as young as you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know\nI I don't disagree with with um uh the fact that this you know porn star and in our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just not areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nThat will do but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's\nGot some great ideas I'm not a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says but I'd rather be a little more presidential will move more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them smoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I think that was in their punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know like I think what he has done his dignify but at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nYou're sure that we can sell it on ... for ten times what we pay\nAnd you can also get it on\nAll right stay with us we'll be back in the

drive themselves are not going to happen\nGood good they're already killed several lady in Arizona for crying out loud\nYeah well in the trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks and I really don't have\nEnough truck driver you know what that what we\nWould you like to have a truck behind you would know drivers\nOut or you're not going to do it might not you know we I have many you know what I mean he has a little tiny mini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper GDP which is a high rise and I'm thinking to myself if I the first time I pull up next to I'm a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one technical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper your history\nThat's that's where the truckers are telling me the people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out a school bus it's over it it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway and they're you know the truck has park there and the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nI mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt it's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please okay one of the things that that a A R is troubling demographers about\nChina right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million or um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military and the it's the there there is just a ton and and that that's what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another means you're more breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ... and\nI just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth is the Americans and that is a you know Canada the United states Mexico central and South America or we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need your oil\nWe'd go water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know\nAm one of those always missiles and all the money\n[laughter] [laughter] yeah yeah but I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wacko is like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening\nIn ... in fact I say I say what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north and the south you know that the south is not having children\nThere for ... heard that I found like about one to\nHere's my concern though not from a country but from some terrorist groups that obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you can't possible it has to grow\nSo I don't know what's gonna happen here with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... and ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher against um Hi my question is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the northeast into like down south and at West 'cause like Florida is now the third most popular state ranking New York state and also a Phoenix has become the largest city out raking or civil down here\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Kenny\nThat that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shifts ahead we cover every single state\nIf you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada I'm a [noise] Arizona and New Mexico\nOr the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million want to buy real estate bite in Florida now\nAnd just sit on it yeah instead I listen they the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a bus and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to be if you're not going to add one to say well when will begin to\nYou know

recently returned veterans Bruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for surveyed my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this this is as you got to tell me why me with the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's the paranormal spin happening to me my whole life it started at age for my first paranormal experiences and Angelica experience a near death experience and just from that point on it just the the things have been happening randomly but quite frequently\nAnd I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or Family Matters but to to students and actually I teach a class now at the college I'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nAh it it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching 'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most negative thing I can think about there was um\nA friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide [laughter] you\nKnow that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\n[noise] you know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\n[noise] I I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community up of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist you know historian\nA but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean ...\nWho's the chief scientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he said there's Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty five zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty ...\nAt Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities and from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J be Ryan Institute thank God to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is and I can from this with with dean because he's doing and and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast result they're dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I've just that uh it's just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown unless somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building that night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are than calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's I I\nI think once more people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in and their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and\nCases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's\nMy my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things ah it just kept coming back\nSo they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point at which to do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I ... and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a winter time and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know she'd be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and it was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crying myself to sleep\nAnd I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was this really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen and ah it I felt like I it it was an angelic presence ...\nIt was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be OK took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing\nPsychic right to see 'em there's always this seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or buy a ferry boat\nI uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm up at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passing the north end to with the island there is a a to bridge spans that go from the mainland to\nWhip the island the north end and there's a middle island called past silent\nAnd we always used to stop there when when we went camping and and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for the\nYeah they actually ... and I was running right towards the cliff\nAnd I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light in the warm\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some helpers out there for you I Want to come

that\nYes unfortunately the way that it\nIt was just like an end of the worst end of the world kind of apocalyptic scenario\nAnd I woke up in a in a sweat and and nervous and scared and\nI I went to breakfast with my uh uh friends are just like the continental breakfast and I told them about this nightmare and then we proceeded to the uh the base\nAnd uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so\nSo that was my um my pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nA the you know a in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event and later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific\nThan mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there is my daughter had nobody wants to we didn't know ... yeah we didn't know what\nIt was bruised but uh she she she had the vision she was in the in the city were ashes falling down on her ... she said it was about a foot deep um but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was\nYeah yeah some people had it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who has a\nVerified that this that this happened to them and so there is something to that this this the ... that people had since that and and I'm On a massive scale so which is and it's been studied uh I think the rating talks about in one of his books I I I Can't remember which one of his books but yeah he does talk about that\nWhat do you think of to let them see [noise]\nI I I think I've had experience with with telepathy with my with my mother and uh she was very psychic and we used to just a regular deck of playing cards when I was younger uh ...\nUh camping on the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips on the ah Oregon Coast in at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would uh try to read each others' minds so\nShe would send you know she'd have a car and she looked at it and send me the you know tried to send me with what the card was\nAnd a wet well above chance we would get the the suit right\nWe would get the sometimes the number or the or the the\nYou know there was a king or jak face card a very often we get it we get it a right\nTo the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter a blue collar guy no nonsense and he'd let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop\nA and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and I she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but I think I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big foot experience\n[noise] I I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you this was a ... near Oric which is in northern California and the redwoods highway there and are driving south\nAnd uh my girlfriend was was asleep in the uh uh in the passenger seat and it was dark and we were driving to you know the big tall trees it's very ...\nAnd as I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit\nOf a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark but it was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat\nA ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she she said what what are you talking about big foot I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep drive me\nAnd I said well we got to find a hotel there's one here another mile from here and she goes no no you keep going you keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later\nI found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking with them that this was in fact\nThere's been yeah there's been more siting there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand it from what the the uh the reading that I did about it so uh now if it if it was a hoax or this guy's taken a big chance by stand right on the on the edge of the highway in the dark total dark\nYup uh and then you can get shot at or anything she got\nRun over crazy you know whatever or you know the alternative which which you

us of course we're going to get to your calls as well as we talk about time was up here are just so many different kinds of paranormal stories you've had a a lifetime of activity ...\nYeah I I I kind of been a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description [laughter] tell me about the open casket story yeah the open casket or the title alone we kind of makes your shipping [laughter]\n[noise] well I grew up in a in a in a Norwegian American community and we had this this older man too\nPassed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh we were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly where my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket\nAnd he was so close to me and he said\nAh ah Bruce it's it's it's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of uh I'm okay and uh I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at\nMy mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut ah I didn't actually ask her about it but and then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then that typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and\nUm it it it was kind of comforting\nIn a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird when it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out and\nSee what the suit was they're very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal in and of itself that the college let me do it but ah\nWell then you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's a it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it isn't offered it at the college\nAnd I am a a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and\nSo I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues and and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California\nUh younger people and and older people different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it ... they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it\nBut there are a couple that are a little skeptical\nIncluding one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the nurse\nSeven weeks in the course into the course um and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience and really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fun a that's a hunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in a ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I've had two full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the two ... where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria in a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in ah in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases\nIt was it was shocking to say the least but uh it\nUh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying\nI think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my impression that uh in my explanation for what's going on with that now it's different than when I ... a\nM visited by someone who's passed on and I I might see an image of them in my mind but not\nLike out in the in the open kind of a thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent what they would call an intelligent spirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or or residuals spirit\nPsycho couldn't he says the ability to manipulate mind over matter happened to you\n[noise] I was the uh um the unfortunate victim of well I don't want to say victim but it happened to me I was I was in Germany a lot of these things happened in Germany and West Germany Germany's a very magical place\nI'm the I'm living in an old uh well in an apartment above a ... house which is like a a a German bar but there's like rooms to rent up above it either for the night or for in our case we were a GIs so we were living there near the base\nAnd a one night I woke up and I I felt like somebody was pulling my legs off the bed\nIt was it was very frightening I mean I felt like they were actually trying to pull me off to bed so I got up and there wasn't anybody in the room and uh I I tried I just kind of walked around a little bit I have to go get something you know some water or something\nAnd then all of a sudden I I went back into the bedroom and on the night stand there was everything was vibrating like there was an earthquake but there was nothing else in the room that was moving there was just the stuff on the night stand there was my wife's ah my wife at the time or her hand mirror\nOr a clock and a few other little items that were on the night standard vibrating and some of them fell off and I put them back on there and and then it it kept vibrating again and then I just happened to look out the window\nAnd there was like a Greenbelt behind our apartment behind disgust house this bar and there was a Green Belt and then there was another uh apartment building maybe four stories high much bigger a complex\nAnd I I look directly into this window and there was a man standing there it looked like a man and he was very dark and he was a in kind of in the shadows but I could see there was a figure of a man and he was\nDon't think you're settling with an education\nOr dot com don't
