I suspect you're going to have a lot of emails to answer and uh this will keep you busy for a while it has been a distinct pleasure Lynn and we will do it again one day if or\nI've really enjoyed it

and then he signs of emails than a one of the world's few science based paranormal investigator he's done a firsthand research into all the different phenomenon and this is cool he's been all over I don't know how he's getting to do this because\nThere's not a lot of money in studying this for sure so he's done well lack of asking about that but he's been in sixteen countries four continents\nA study in this kinda stuff psyche goes on houses ... miracle that's you know and that's one by the way a lot of people don't talk about his miracles that also makes like lake monsters and you know a

freebie clown backgrounds ... you know three hundred sixty five days out of the year right\nSo uh we're going to get some we're going to get we're gonna learn about the origins Halloween\nAnd uh it it's just really cool to meet him because he's been all over and you know he's been all over television as well and he does like to keep the science may so let's bring him on here for the first time ever on coast to coast welcome Dan to coast to coast am how are you\nI'm doing well thanks for having me All right I Love will if we need a trademark that that's great\nI Know right I should have went over there and check out the domain hurry up get it for me please [laughter] somebody's got snagged that right [laughter] I Love it\nThat's fun stuff so you're very similar to me you got the old TV background and the passion to know the truth and to study everything and try to pull it all together so when I you know found you know I was like oh my\nGosh he's like he's like this is great so now how have you been able to go all across like the planet I mean you've been everywhere this this is this is good\nWell there's a there's a it's a good question actually as you point out there's a lot of money and\nGrain grow by some sort of X. files department but I'm not exactly you know I I work\nFor a nonprofit education organization called the center for inquiry based in Buffalo\nAnd for them I'm the editor of uh magazines coupling choir and do things like that but I'm but even aside from that I just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to go into an open mind and I try to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking folk or point of view\nAnd so one so partly the answer your question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like for if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that ... been looking at it goes again all\nRight you know it's like they're like we're going to we're going to go to the beach and like that's really cool I hear the monster there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos and so\nThat that that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere uh you know I I happen to be there anyway and so I turned into investigation one I can\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would uh be with a white a candle for a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror and midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\nAnd all these sorts of another one example is a bobbing for Apple you know if you're not new apple bobbing and there was the particular holiday tradition that if you ... if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAny talk to them or one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and pass me credit coming together\nOn my way may I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] so I Do I Do it at midnight\nRight here on willfully night that's right will swing [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know 'cause I I get there are people that say Halloween oh saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um\nYou know I always see it as fun I see it as a I\nI mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think of fall whether I think of orange and black colors I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which is an led goblins and\nAnd it varies bond funds things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they kicked the fun out of it in the traditions out of it and\nAnd uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here but what we have is a banner rapper with us he is an investigator\nAnd an end to all the things that were into a as coast the folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know does a

Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get state panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nTelevision shows around that kind of Halloween and that where the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me thinking you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\n... and ... when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you that actually\nI was just such an offensive like the first of all the you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I wanted for but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know there's always go X ray your candy I mean\nReally do you do people really go to\nThe emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist office X ray at the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out yeah I don't\nNeed to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make it just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy makers okay but he did it yes so that he can steal stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics hear what you know we need to go back to the days when people are ... of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted houses come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second waves of ... of the ah the immigrants to the United states\n... and in fact you we mentioned little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials be have you know they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... hand so that for for so certainly for for for many years\nA court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy the horror right you'd actually\nYeah family is coming together to make a gift costume ... and what you find is that\nThe first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and your plastic molded and stuff but what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as a marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it it's B it's become commercialized for\nUm and this is when you start getting adults who are you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know [noise] the the sexy police officer costumes or a drag\nYes\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you have and they're all you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so that that's fun I mean but I like you I\nI sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that are really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure um so you know you talk about the history of it we now basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much and you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell ... a good question you know I think that um you know ...\n... Halloween ... mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all these day in office all day and and you know we're with each\nInteract with each you know a couple of generations it changes a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people have taken it too far a in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like arson and stuff it's like scary\nScary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed um and it would have like a dress up we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kids love eighty year old kid like to dress up and so is there something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and um you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy\nUh you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or ... you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual or go you know or you\nGot like holographic oh you've got to that because that's usually the giant thing that'd be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to a asking about the St panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm tiny Willis and this is will is leaving tonight\nGot a great story for the board of al\nDavis you're either has overcome a severe issue or what a light bulb went on and I started\nTo research I don't know why I was going through capsules it made me feel so much better I can tell you one thing [noise]\nThe product war [noise] and not only works in one way it works for a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy excuse me my ...\nYear and I in my house [noise] just a better way carnivores referring back into my body [noise] in a while but you know want to spread over there and I fear with him and all\nThis is Richard off broke off a carnival or research international call one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five or there's a carnival or a dot com C.

way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great things great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating\nUm ghost goes hunting stuff so\nLet's or I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of\nGhost tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't that you know and the Frankenstein and the Dracula kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like 'em but then there's this deep darkness and say panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nYeah I mean for a little things where I mean there's certain things to do it [noise] you know from from you know somebody has some of that but [noise] but you know\nIt's for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause damage because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if if during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some corn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the fans paid here what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the role of you\nAnd and again you know it was the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is coming to Eighteen\nYou know thou shalt not suffer which to live um and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this is fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that's that's one of the more uh obviously comes up every\nEvery year so it's coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons I'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ...\nUm I was up in a did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at uh the hearts of St James hotel in northern New Mexico and I was there during investigation and looking to go in\nAnd on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it it said uh where did you boards are strictly prohibited anyone using ... board will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so\nSo concerned that using a word you board was going to open up you know demonic corals or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was was that it was it was codified on a wall and it was I'd never seen that like you know in the rules are going to sign this don't use it and so\nYou know typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was ... that\nA kid the dresses up as a which are of goal will become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that\nUm they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party so the the the the they make a case to distinguish it from Halloween this is our way into harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know the parents were concerned about that\nThey'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving and that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black light and\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations at W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nYou got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was a wacky haunted house\nThere was nothing nothing scarier it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that well yeah you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when it came to Christmas and just lay allies write that down the\nMarathon borrow either right away I assumed those\nHuge freeze those have you ever had them frozen\nOh they were great oh I'm sure you're just taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came in that was like a red and black rapper written or something yeah\nAnd the ruler on the back\nOh man I I mean anything Googled afterward on here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face it last year for McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup member on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on the air now are\nSo well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the past and even when you think about the future and the St panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element and some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemeteries and they go into the woods or they go into you know the um\nT. V. and crazy he the reality\nIs in in scare quotes me and I and I've been on many of the TV shows that he pointed out I was a lot of them you know on both sides of the camera on this and you know and my my point of view is always\nYou know I I don't make fun of go because I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do it and do it right\nYou bring science to bring good good critical thinking so I'll give you one quick example so one problem I often see\nIs a girl centers on TV and and not actually just across the board is is are you surprised even you know amateur groups across the country if they typically engage what's called the anomaly hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know ... or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops wherever it is and they're they're they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there for me um midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around a little ... things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we're all look at this at at ... pm I Am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claims they're the you the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are eat to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that that in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see a ghost undergoing location they there's team of them and they'll they'll take readings for three hours or sick or wherever else ... they'll go home and analyze them\nThe problem is that not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal wrapped around we need to know what's normal\nAnd whatever readings you get\nYour walking around with the M. F. detector magnetometer whatever it is whatever it is you get over that six hours that they can be normal variation that you want to do this you know only happens once a week or something\nIt's has been jamon record that we're talking we're learning about how he is describing investigating his theories die and we've got more of that coming up the way to cook and celebrating Willis we\nYou know every week Randy ...\nPossible by me of course you know a really wide your credit you're listening to the reality is we won the dollars that you know where to go but thank you for that you know\nYour regular regardless of who's responsible obvious that will remain\nGrand in Iran one radio Ninety five ws DJ\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nThis is coast to coast am now here's your guest host ... cranberries\nAnd zombies on the coast to coast am tiny well let's hear on wheel of saline ooh oh\nMan I don't like hearing that when it's dark ...

[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nIt's coast to coast am Connie Willis here\nWill is wean is what's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator of mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating ghosts and it's um\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded um on on your audio taping and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used to detect ghost for the most part they are ones that the replicate\nWhat we can experience right we we all we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know if they're recording them\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... electric field detectors and the problem is that there is no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation\nBut ... but no one has ever proved the you know the location with high EMS um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person or a who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it\nUh and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science or in goes hunting and that's\nThat frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think ... awesome if they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them\nI just don't see I don't see a good quality research going on and that's one reason that wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we could talk about this forever but just for time's sake I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why why what is it [noise] well\nYou know um I I don't know it go for I mean that's that's you know of course that's that's a million dollar question right I mean you even even among the the growth hunter and believers are across the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their\nResidual events that are you just don't have a theory that there is something that's going on and\nIt was a murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and praying that the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional means other people say that they're you know the fear that that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions is problematic for ghost research right because goats can't be both in our dimensional spirits\nAnd you know a an emotional recording into a tree or a house of murder\nYou know for the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena has such a widely disparate range of explanations that the problems so I I don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not meant Scientifically Proven I think that\nMy my best guess if they're real would be basically Couric explanation that would be there from ... fears of the debt that we\nWere we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nMm good stuff for windows for Willis weaned so thank you for getting is the information\nYou have in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can go to you but are coming up so we're going to be talking the werewolf in London

of folks ... with a friend who was doing the poaching\nIn the daytime than the lodge hedge hole forms and things about he said he probably eight to ten foot tall and he ... he took a turn round to speak to his friend and call this thing and he's peripheral vision and then looked and saw it\nOn the left over the head ... he said but he thought he was a young hopes it meant horse so HBO the blessing to the radio off at first\nI couldn't believe what I was looking out so what we're saying is the best thing was as big as a small town it or you know your host\nHe said and the interesting thing was he left over the edge and just landed he said well you'd expect to host a London move forward because the momentum this thing just limited and stuff like a magnet sudden\nSomething not to look at that he said it was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he led them before they run away he said when he was on all fours\nAnd he said if it to the store to open to the being over seven Fulton looked like a body builder he said he no he said he was a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of a of a boom\nAnd ... and he said he ... he was almost sort of Britain tilling cooler you know like a ... and\nThat what he ...\nHe says well he said I went to him to the edge to them to try and get stiff\nJust to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covert crossing the field and into the world or what quite incredible\nUm you know that's four miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast Kony and if you if you go further down the coast to watch a whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was the ... there were featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd ... such as supposed to be aware of that was such a going the bombs to drain rooms into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we'd go this way will type creature reported but moving along the coast and if you go further up the coast you've got\nOld folklore ... old legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the ... bay and raven Scott ... they took him to the ... and you know these stories have to have that they've come down to being handed down in time ... there's\nJust I think those grains of truth in the store is so that was exciting in the Nineteen seventies and the lifting Britain do all his life and\nHe's never seen it since he's never seen it before that I'd never seen it after that\nWhich is quite incredible if this thing I Believe his story about if this thing was native to that Saturday you would think that they'd be more evidence of it so why are we only seeing small glimpses of it coming you know made\nYeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in and they pop out along the way kind of like\nWhen I talked to people before uh we had um\nA friend of mine Laurie Williams she's a remote you are in I Would have heard target and and she targeted she mentioned how they they are actually didn't know what it was you know she is looking at this esoteric target that I gave her and she's talking about how they had these portals\nAnd they were in time warp and they would just go through one time or another and you just see them when they pop into that particular one you know we're we're a human would see him\nUm I find I find it also interesting\nWhen you were saying that Ari yeah is there the world's oldest the operational read our base is right there and all this area where all this crazy stuff happens and I think I remember seeing a sure thing\nThat might be my phone about a cook out people just ... it does it's cutting in and out no well is showing no battery it's all now I'm a I'm Sorry about this listeners to join me to hang up and you touch me back because of the piano will\nWell you're flying right now for sure and will do that at the break for sure but yeah but I can hear you but again I think it I think it's very strange operational radar base the oldest one is in the midst of all of these happening now you're talking about\nThat is correct Tony ... and ... ... briefly jumping\nTo them to where the mutilation taking place but then there's a radar base that which was eleven miles from stocks and rolled as the crow flies and that one's closed about one closed about Seventy two uh efficiently said sixty eight but he was still operational up ... till seven to two\nAnd that's on the edge of the north sea audience ... ... the ...\nOkay now he's gone [laughter] so we'll definitely contacting back on one of his other bones and he has there isn't that crazy brand new song a brand new batteries\nAnd it goes down ... strange isn't it when we talk about some of these things that I don't know I don't know your own story [laughter]\nWillis weaned continues here on because I Am I'm tiny Willis and we got in there and I guess we're talking more about the bleaching where Wolff and other things too creepy in the\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nUh\nNo I Can't believe how easy it will save hundreds of dollars in my car insurance with\n[noise] more or insurance\n[noise]\n\n\nWe're back and we're taking 'em I'm Paul Sinclair and we are pulling everything out of him that we can about the we're most around him it's deeply to wear ... stories from year hundreds and hundreds of years ago\nThe where walls in sleep in\nAnd other crazy crazy things that are going on in the area and then he lives around\nAnd he's learning them any studying them and he writes about them and tonight we get to hear about them ourselves so first time ever on coast to coast and already on his second phone so we've cleared up the phone deal\nSo Paul I'm welcome back with your new phone hopefully this one will last a little bit longer and strange things happened when we talk about\nStrange subjects um thank you very much [laughter] yeah yeah that was kind of funky for sure\nWill go on a honestly they were brand new batteries but I'm On a wire phone now so what we should be fine\nUm you know [noise] where we were jumping into the store is now trying to give listeners a breakdown of why the why the area special on how the stories of come through and\nA little bit of history about the area and everything's quite close to the coast as well Tony you know in most instances would only like four miles away from the coast to the point\nAnd these and the this coastline around red linked to a slum rip them to the un speech and the rugged cliffs with\nAbsolute must have network of sea caves some of them have never been never beat entered I mean if if we romance with the notion that this was a real living flesh and blood creature breathing then\nBreathing and surviving then I suppose it could function in in these areas\nSimply because of our ... in a ... to ... anybody would get a bit of research would find the ... and there's more ships being wrecked out to say than anywhere else in the u._k. you can't get close to these cliffs\nA you know I'm not saying that that's where these things in happy valley is just an angle to look up\nVotes I'm staying quite close to flexed and county and twelve miles away there's a huge area of world lump them to know if you're in North Yorkshire called ... Dale [noise]\nAnd we can sort of accurately they to the summer of two thousand and six and three young men or mountain bikes sort of setting the trailers and doing what oh well all you guys are ... women girls as well we're doing a good such a ride around the woodland pots\nAnd this one may fall into the big tax cuts of gr able is nevertheless an interesting story or late evening still light on the the ... the ... about four foot high and there's all trees all around them as the recycling down these parts\nOf the ... mountain became aware and shouted tuition says can you see that they said about forty two away from them that on the path in the Bracken moving that going down quite fast down these hills\nIs what they described as an upright gorilla now they described it says ... because he didn't appear to be ruining\nAnd that they that black fur covered very big uh you know what I think we're talking like over eight feet tall a while to get the ... before I saw in the city for four to ... votes at least\nAnd these things they described it says like it was on a track your ... you know they couldn't seats legs and they said they were living up around how Dale they were familiar with most of the\nThe ... the phone or on rocks and an ally of the ... there's no way that it wouldn't have been jumping over fall and branches and rocks for this thing ... was just smooth and gliding over the top of the Bracken\nAs though it was just fixed Reggie ... he says when we were going as fast as we could cause I said did he frightening says hell yeah they said we were actually terrified\nThat because they were keeping pace with us and it was looking after that was the strange thing as well ... well it didn't seem to have to look forward\nIt was look it was fixed on them so is it eventually we got to the ... which fault talked to the left until the right to sudden we went right sort of choosing the path that will take them first away from this thing and they left it that's all the scene of it [noise] it\nYes these two friends if they wanted to talk about it I got the story of one of the guys that they still tobacco the story but they they didn't want to they didn't want to come forward\nOr with the amount of detail that this this month so if they're given my book I think probably looking up more something big foot relate to that but once again there's a mystical element to it in the he's\nNot running in the way the conventional way we would expect something to ruin all moving should I say you know [noise]\nSo yeah he you know it's it's\nWe just got this bill for a little bit you know we we talk a little bit before we did this and say Hi to each other and one of the things\nThat that is tough for both of us is there's no word that really work in our language for what this is it's so hard to describe these things and are these events as well as the beans in the creatures themselves but\nYou just can't put into words whatever's going on that whatever it is it's beyond what we know and what we're supposed to know or see or what is supposed to be real and it's so hard to describe these things when you put together I mean yeah we want to focus on the where we'll split\nBut when you put all his together in the area that you are there are so many things that are going on\nIn his radius ... ... and again going back to the fact that these radar bases were there there was a picture that you had\nThat you sent me and I guess it's in one of your books that was a picture I'm a I guess there were some happening that went on some sort of a dance\nAnd that were seen and then the next day or maybe within the same hours now that there's this like vehicle\nAnd it's got some sort of satellite dish on it and it's going up to this guy I mean after these events this new vehicles there\nThat the county you're you're talking about something that we saw in on July the twenty fifth or twenty Seventeen to just if we if we major jump from the ... for a moment\nHe's yeah sure these vehicles\nI got a phone call from a guy called David hind\nUh lives in the village of ... and he said Paul I think you really need to go and look at these vehicles out and I did just that took a camera I got pictures of them and they were the drums and they had a huge green books from the back with a radar dish on the talk I'm I'm trying to do this ... going to cause I'm realizing you might want\nMe to carry on with the world will take your time\nAnd ... and that was a huge trailer which we now know how to ... or a generator which would top to now the license plates which I'm In a ... on the the units themselves was American that\nIn an area the little known the script village called ...\nAnd the patch I'm Blake Hounshell lane Blake how Blake can bring ... to them slumber to them and I'll let you mean black they say something Blake choice black how ... and it just so happened a few weeks before I'd go photographs of a triangular impression the period and pay crop that somebody told me about\nOn black Halloween [noise]\nOn the twenty fifth of July when these vehicles will say and and the state weeks by the way they weren't just that on the twenty fifth of July\nThat's why I was so hard what do we talk about what was that one let's talk about the rules because Halloween is coming up but he has so many other things going on where he's at so more\nTo come here as we celebrate Willis lean on coast to coast [laughter] I'm ...\nI'm I'm I'm a\n[noise]\nNo arguing laws not by your radio grab your smartphone or computer and listen to I
