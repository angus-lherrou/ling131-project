authorities after about ... [noise] and I don't want to jump to conclusions\nIt could be a left wing conspirator doing is to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know things ... he's created an environment so that somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that no you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict\nFrom our authorities in intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about it in the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level America is best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents and\nLeaders in government is not the way to solve this problem in whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that weigh in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this air that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you're giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you've been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that some of these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others\nHe was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's in turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre ... one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who send these packages out maybe they'll go to the public if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their some keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nAnd our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals in institutions and in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and who ever did this\nWhether it was somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd\nBe somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight shut up wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs\nThen wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged him\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right we're willing to change or we will talk this week\nAnd see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman as described the killing of ... to show me as a heinous crime\nIn his first comments and some of his closest aides were implicated in the Saudi journalist death speaking edited investors conference in Riyadh that has been overshadowed by this crisis been sold them and said that those responsible for the killing would be brought to

the fence today um I Would I Would estimate that the probability of this thing track down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time as as being very very high\nUm for purely technical reasons I mean these are all unexploded devices\nThat means all kind of trace evidence is available from them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the UN at some of them were sent through the regular mail for us you\nKnow I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities\nThey probably have that all figured out already the entire us PF network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the ...\nThey got pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office cameras at\nThe post offices ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days or certainly in a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this and then some of these questions are are going to start to be possible\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left the optics story really like\nI mean this is mostly a a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individual if I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet is are we going to be able to afford it\nOr the eye of the is going to raise the band with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole allocation for the month and in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put the high speed or knew it\nThat's in the high red urban areas they haven't shown a lot of interest and putting them in the rural areas so there's that question to are we ever going to actually see where you're\nWriting from Lauren thank you so much will be in touch with you this week as well while a lottery ticket holder in South Carolina who scoop the largest jak bought in us history\nMega millions confirmed that was one winner for the one point six billion dollars\nLet's see how that would be a he's probably obviously meeting with his lawyer on accountants or she is and will figure out what's going on in a moment we'll be talking about dark forces demons with a which that's right next on coast to coast they um [noise]\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness as possible you could add a trio fair relation one of the leading causes of stroke mind out before too I mean with cardio them all the FDA cleared personal EKG dividing the just Ninety nine dollars\nTo order the Amazon dot com and type ... that the Amazon dot com type cardio ... cardio mobile fits in your pocket you can take a D.

it's because our our our was or not intact and I don't think I've met anyone with an in tact ara but it's both and it can also be comic\nIt can be comic curses can be ... doesn't mean that you have to accept it because if you have learned you know you you said God or if you're the gods where the U.S ended masters were the angels and if you make it very clear that you no longer want this to be part

bounce off\nLet's go to the Rockies Charlotte in Pennsylvania harsher look go ahead\nI Charlotte I ... thanks for taking my call my question is\nHow does one heal themselves how one killed him I wanted to know the outs much English just recently heard veil that is that something you can do to yourself\nAbsolutely merging as always always good\nExplains much\nOkay this is just um like you just you get the bundle of stage and you light the same age and I prefer just to stage when I'm naked so right out after a hot bath they should have said that before and I didn't\nUm you just said and between your legs and you'll see age all around your body mostly around your head and especially behind your head because that's where entities like two to hang out [noise] um so every\nCrevice in your body is just going to stage um and it works if you do it forty days in a row if you said your house and you said yourself you definitely will fill a difference\nOh I Hope that works Charlotte Allen in Fresno, California is with us now while I'm going\nTo go and bus um I have a question of how do you do get ... spears or in you know\nHow do you get rid of spirits great question you're going to have to email me for that because it's going to be more lengthy [noise] um I can give you um information on how to do a house ... now what kind of spirits I mean are they pulling your covers [laughter] you know when you wake up in the morning ... ... ... how how serious are these\nWhat's happening is like is like um I wake up in the middle of the night and you're like you ... have you been talking in and then when I go like into the causes no one's there\nOkay so you probably have ... what is known as a a called an earth bounce spirit so it can be someone\nSounds like a mischievous spirit [laughter]\nSo it's probably not like a demon it's probably just that maybe someone who lived there before and they passed on but they haven't really pastime\nPossible so that you cannot get rid of the shirt and spirit but uh just lingers for ever\nWell it depends I think all spirits you can get rid of them because you can appease them as well so what happens in that case and that's a very good question George I'm Glad you asked um there are some black magicians who will send an earth\nDown and wanted me by what would you change\nA magician girls\nI Know I'm Sorry and clarify a magician and it can actually send you an earth mounds spirit and what they do is they will go and\nI'm looking for spirits at the cemetery who have not crossed\nOver and they will um make the calls to spirits who are very disgruntled you know they either killed someone\nAnd then they're willing to do there and it actually\n... are they under the control of loose suffer in\nThe dark\nAs when you show\nSomebody sense though that show I think you're sending out\nWell the magician LA by the dark lord and other apps\nLike you've got to watch out you you got to watch our commercials watch it was her name ... dot com she'll answer your\nQuestions when you email works that way Thanks Chris appreciate your being on the program beyond the secrets or [noise]\nArgued contest for the Senate race but\nUh I picked people that the audience will know in that you will know because the whole idea of the shows to have fun is in this particular door show is to have fun and people know who they are but the best part is when they tried to tricky aren't really creative\nFire remember when the late Roger leader came on and uh I could not gas him at all he had you and I think in honey and it was good to hear when he when he was very good too so I'm looking forward to this we've got three guests will take phone calls with everybody up to half on each one\nA in this night will go by really quick and one more quick question for you goes to goes next Wednesday Halloween Night or you're putting together a number of uh email ghost stories from people and will have the actual people on the year with me that night\nUh it of course we'll take calls from our listeners to what their ghost stories so we're ready to go there ready to go to ship enough to be a fun show we're going to serve on okay thanks to okay so let's open up the first secret door\nGosh I tell them the oil that thing and they just haven't done that yet so come on and then let's see who you are hello there\nAnd how you doing\nOh boy this is going to be tough I'm fine how are you\nWell not only for ... days up oh I Know I got older things get tough for\nIts Stanton reading anymore it's stance in Friedman\nBoy am I allowed a\nHeightened I you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell it's in the middle of the night but I'm I'm a before I'm going to limit the hunger\nAnd yes you are and we need we need you on this program my friend die heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring a I have a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagements and the ... of January November and December\nI Can't believe it two months of out going anywhere against my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you we love your stand that I'm going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter\nIn Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named stamped in Friedman I saw little clipping in the Detroit News that\nHe was going to be speaking before a group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's a ... you know nuclear physicists expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this you want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took by Sony tape recorder\nOut I went to interview stamps and Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis he was the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a rush a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near ... big beer and I don't think\nSo at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo stand telling me telling me what's going on in the field if you follow gee these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or they could be sending a signal\nThe latest word against it looks like they're about one point six planets per star opera galaxy star and our galaxy the Milky Way had about a hundred billion store\nAll that many one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the\nPlace and you know that changed our picture we used to think we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization or around and we're at the top of the heap well all over the place\nAnd that changed our perception of how important we are of course I'm not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and read honey a room in other words for others\nAnd we've come to realize that you know get in here from mayor is not quite the big deal we used to think it was a hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that the you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and

seven foot tall gigantic bipedal creature\nSaid he was thirty feet away from it and he'll never forget it and it has affected the rest of his life and I'm actually going to be going to see that

didn't know about this man it was my friend Mike super who also is a former police officer he lives in Carmel New York\nAnd he um somehow got connected with officer got one and went and actually interviewed him so that's how this all came about and and then I've had a dialogue with officer ... cents and he's very credible and it was not only him\nBut seven other officers are over a two nights ban that actually solve this creature so it was the original two witnesses that reported hearing just God awful shrieking sounds coming out of the woods\nAnd they reported it to the local police\nAnd so the first night there were I Believe five police officers present\nAnd then the second night there were two more present and had these I Witness accounts of this gigantic big foot creature in the
