missing for one one guy coming back Wednesday ... going to be\nBack on the air and I always tell them not soon enough we get more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods\nI Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found as true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great to have you back\nGeorge I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nI wanted to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations that I have not uh I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and [noise] there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me and myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put the in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people these are the drag fighting these are the upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the\nHigh rollers but people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out one from help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and uh\nI kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA runner and out of resources we've got to stop\nWell many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports law enforcement report\nSee who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search or the areas they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you really searching wind and there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books who might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service\nGovernment entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but ah it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances and their parks were they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information that couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it [noise] and uh ...\nAll started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get

got some imitators out there are people who have written books similar to yours as well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that very moment before we jump into the cases\nSo this is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the name David flight is missing for one one missing a national parks there all frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent and listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is that can ... missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click and and you listen if you don't know if somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him a lesson that can happen to sing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data um for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nAnd are filmed impossible distances away sometimes they're alive amazingly enough but I'm often sound impossible distances away and there is no way no way they can walk there on their own or talk about that than I Am\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talk about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child sound say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents to think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with a case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOf four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps a another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours not possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last scene with these numbers absolutely blow that to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is and all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance\nAnd extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away we'll watch the child with such child going to do for the next hour\nI said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and you're thinking it would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare [noise]\nBut I have all these examples worthy heights been achieved by these little kids\nWere they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know an incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on a yeah it's got to be\nTalked about a two year old boy that they just traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges\nAnd even some face down you know the next morning unbelievably or why we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened and a half months that we couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe even know what\nYou have a case in the new book a in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours to have to go watch six miles per hour\nA bunch of kids are going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody picked him up or some something or someone picked him up and locked up there\n[noise] [noise] well ... and the reason these cases have significant is that what you report on a child has abducted in downtown\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know sure ... put 'em in the car and drove them there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the\nPeople in the party didn't see anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody else saw anything nobody saw any cars nobody else was there so how did that child make that distance in that time doesn't make sense\nOr in the new book uh it's law L. A. W. land air and water and a land cases you've talked about before but you've got some new ones including one that happened in the organ pipe cactus national monument Arizona\nReady to take a break now when we come back this one has really creepy and even some of the investigators who are working the case admitted it was really creepy I Will tell you why in just a moment talking with David polite is going to take a break the Ellen Parsons project break down into the break [noise]\n\nThe coast website is now streamline the woman's devices Greek news if you're a coast insider simply want to enjoy our website on your phone visit coast to coast am dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nBe wrong\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] us to just as the tank every week for the friend is made possible by someone else for\nMe of course you know uh if you really want to give credit where credit's due to effectively listen at five after the hours that reality morning at six am one thousand dollar secular by us and nowhere else to go but thank you for that or no thank you for regular ...\nRegardless of who is responsible me hobby a sign that wouldn't\nGrand in your hand on Youth Radio in Ninety five WICK [noise]\nAh no the high heart radio we can sports time capsule for fans of Sandy\nWest and I'm here to take you back on the journey to this week in sports history\nThat's our way back in Nineteen oh three were the first World Series begins play the Boston Americans eat the Pittsburgh Pirates five games to three and a best is nine theory slave all this week in Nineteen thirty two was Babe Ruth legendary call three points to center field before ...\nLegendary raped me apply what did it become OK for men to be lazier so Oscar fatter we need to bring the bed of this country back to greatness as\nInto the Wrigley Field bleachers in the fifth inning game three of the world series and the Yankees won seven to five this week in Nineteen fifty one third baseman Bonnie\nThompson hits a one hour three run home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to win the national Senate southern New York giants Thompson's Homer wrapped up in amazing come from behind run to the giants the giants went on to lose the series of the Yankees\nThe Thompson's miraculous home run remains one of the most memorable moments in sports history referred to as the shot heard round the world [noise]\nThis week in Nineteen eighty Larry Holmes retains his WB the heavyweight title defeating Mohammed Ali and this week in two thousand one the Atlanta Braves defeat the Florida Marlins twenty three to clinch the national league east title and become the first team in professional sports can consecutive division titles\nThat you're a high hard radio weekends boards time capsule when used breaks out we break in ... when you watch the ... west ...

their property and they patrol it and their national park police are there\nWell there's an ... a location called Oregon or Ga an organ pipe cactus national monument and it's an Arizona far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico\nOn February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old name Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico\nDrove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called her\nWell I stumbled on to this case and saw it and some archive somewhere\nAnd I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff ask them for any documents on that case I got the documents in my hand that I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports amazed added a we don't have any\nI said have you heard of the case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all of the articles and all the reports said that they stay that she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and then you as university lab tech to earn some extra money [noise]\nShe love the outdoors hike regularly on January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night\nFebruary first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions was smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture and asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he she he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling\nAnd found carols car parked in s this canyon picnic site with a note taped inside the windshield and it said if\nI'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger smart smart thing to do exactly\nI Wish everybody would do that but then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip\nAnd she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second he

air cases so I Want to jump into one of the most baffling cases involving water it's a guy named Henry McKay but this is really pretty creepy\n[noise] that is a creepy case and ah [noise] it's a new Brighton Minnesota the community just north of Minneapolis not very far with the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old [noise]\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called mounds view again just north of Minneapolis north side this Koester area of missing people that I've written about in the past\nYou had a great job using auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue [noise]\nOn September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California and it was a planned vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend he was a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the ... the early on that Monday morning and ... states that have dropped him off at a location and friendly at the super gas station or Seventy third avenue\nTo twenty three am Henry phone appears trap pocket dial this wife while she was asleep and California and walk to link the voicemail strange sounds screaming paying growls et cetera\nAnd a guy from uh Finland did some amazing work sent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances and your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that and then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles now in the Nevada try and go down there by you\nIt goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle and when I first got on to that I thought you know\nThis seems kind of hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it\nSam in national park yes\nI go that's quite a coincidence [noise] so you're Seventy kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances in kings canyon and sequoia as well [noise]\nAnd when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle there's several thousand planes that crashed and disappeared in this year is in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents of things which seems reasonable\nBut when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh do you have any specifics from the Nevada trying to get into or should we just go you jumped into the cases of air disappearances in general\nAnd it was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the books from Moffett Field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that\nI grew up not far from off the field in Sunnyvale I grew up ... you know and I had plane flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week\nAnd it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps that patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed in there and Treasure Island in the middle of the day [noise]\nWell in August sixteenth Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting sent out of Treasure Island where they held the world's fair there was a man by the Senate earners Cody twenty seven years old an infant Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this\nWell as they depart they start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the feral on islands and Cody was at the controls of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a needed for patrol\n[noise] what both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to Treasure Island for the day to leave on their ship [noise] uh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for person that would be in the bucket\nThey only left with to first hundred and ten minutes to the flight was normal in fact there was no communication and then it's seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles east of the fair on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck and\nThe navy scrambled to ... to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy\nWill the planes encountered cloudy weather with a ceiling a five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them\nAt ten forty five AM Moffett Field receives a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they are to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why it was their\nMinute eleven Fifteen for function cause Moffett Field against they didn't get that in LA had crashed in the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast\nOr the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb missing the gone to was in near perfect condition both motors on the ship or off even though one trial was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were life preserver over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel was in the tanks\nThe radio was in perfect condition no distress call\nFor funds been called back and say they said they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nThe central coast of California had a major search that started almost immediately the navy found to fishing boats and navy built in a postcard shipped to solve the blimp dip\nAnd dropped to ... on the oil slick\nThe blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowds they said all appeared fairly normal but it did go into the cause and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean the\nCrew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the craft were still there [noise]\nThere's a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there was a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break come back we're going to jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing group people\nInto the break with journey wheel in the sky\nMind them ... and I just logged on to ... am done\n\n\n\n\nNow doesn't

watch the ... west ... God and I are hard to radio station use radio Ninety five WICK [noise]\n\nHere's the latest from ABC\nNews I'm Dave Schreiber the death toll shoring in Indonesia more than a hundred people said to have been killed here's ABC's Julia McFarland\nNature of the law that's been in the news is that many many people not to the population who live in poverty\nOne eight hundred four hundred seven one four or five\n[noise]\n\n\nBefore the break we are talking about this US Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast to California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\n[noise] so the navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board\nWhen it hit the beach originally when it hit land it drop one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood\nThere was massive search off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch are like that they were watching on the water there were lots of water craft in that area\nThey never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented and just south\nOf the Golden Gate to a location called half moon bay in that area of the coast I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of that point raise area\nAnd nothing immediately half half moon bay so it's one area that has just strangeness attached to it\nAnd like you said they they came up with some explanation for that to me that were laughable\n\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened ... ... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left of the craft or and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\n[noise] or even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak\nRight because the area of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get in that case I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nIs going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick Marilyn ditch case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was\nThe organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened and he went to base in\nAt the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky\nSome of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken is if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I thought the same thing in multiple missing for ... bucks it looks like people are snatched down to the off the ground and then some of them are dropped back\nInto these uh locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to to point at one in particular but some of this stuff certainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO\nTopic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch and elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by ...\nThey're Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot um cannot make public but they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside\nHe had a had an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... is that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch\nAnd I asked a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone or he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the public has never seen so\nYou know he he has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so\nI don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody who's been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wakeup call [noise] I think so um [noise]\nSo ... you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area\nSee if there was anything related to a disappearance that I could sing my teeth into they can relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but as I said before sometimes I think\nI related to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers are ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood\nBecause they don't want to draw attention to it and I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it's just filled with water\nI have no cases from there it's bizarre and isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow\nUm it's a manmade lake but the was right in the middle of the ... reservation they use a control lead property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at the lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning so that they the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people at Brown there and ah\nSo ... you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things that's or but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nIt's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that the person who told me that in D.C had brought up\nYour books and and your subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are going to want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs could you summarize that one\nYou know is hoping she gets a sleeve before I come ...\nBest friend said I don't know what she's talking about ... ... in the beat goes on that's the limit by morning you're an ex TK how ya doing\nBad because I started getting the point where I was concerned because I knew she wasn't going to get much rest if I came to ban the same time you know she's been so used to me\nMy um all the muscles size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide\n... very concerned about this whole ... nothing but a one on one of the single boy you get into that [noise]\nAh [noise] I Want to know with this ... who hired this guy they check the fact that he's old enough to she knows somebody here is ah [noise]\nReally lived there and the parent company of the fishing boats the parent company obviously didn't do any checking whatsoever they're probably looking for a ... he comes up the Bradley had to sign up there he's an illegal alien ... known illegal alien these are known criminal they didn't do any checks onions\nYeah I Wonder how many more like that out\nThere all over the place by in Italy and the thing about it is he was an illegal alien in March when he was down in Newport News Virginia He's an illegal alien ... what happened to the court system back there they let them go on a bond\nYou know at that time was a loss but anyway just ... now I understand correct me if I'm wrong or the other so I was actually discuss this with her husband can you just sort of marriages that was that it was\nI have no idea
