and so you know I was Graham a special granddaughter that could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gas it but\nHe was he was talking to me and uh you know there was no question but would ask the question\nOr the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had way ... these\nYoung men who did hire people who cried and everything else\nOh and carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that

really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter terror can do this\nAnd that she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to\nHear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop that oh you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that has happened\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five thirty years ago that happened a a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts\nIn front of my face\nAnd and I wouldn't go into houses if I thought a ghost can kill me I Am certainly not stupid but\nI remember I was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when that yet\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here and then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy I Can't walk into a house and be afraid\nBecause that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them and I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've got a step over

say why did you let them do that it's like they did it on\nThere and they knew better right course they did well loved would call me up to date because she always got her her script you know like three days before the new one right which she was good with you she liked ... yeah\nAnd she would call me up and she'd go you should see what the heaven me\nDo oh no no [laughter]\nBut yeah no and she she knew that it was the first half hour was usually over the top the second half hour they seem to bring it back down a little bit but it got the information out there even if it wasn't as hokey as they made it\nTo Dr James van Prague nuts\nWell no because he couldn't see the ones that they were filming\nWhat do you mean talking about why not love so we're on phones here is like the ones I saw\nSo no he was a consultant on the show to are also but he didn't uh but he really Clinton helped set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do it's like when we were in one of the studios I Know\nWe're doing a I'm\nA something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a um is Barbara stand with standing there [noise] and I I looked at her and\nI my mind went totally blank all I could remember was Victoria bar only from the big Valerie\nAre exactly and what she was classic action\nAll while she was a little whip up I think she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm starring because it's like oh my gosh\nAnd uh and she was found and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James the mistake and one of the cameraman said who is that\nAnd James made a mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going I literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it\nAnd I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's it going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead and she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went to the light\nAnd she said\nHuh and I said have you talked to other people live people\nShe said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go that you show up and talk about it in one in the light so I Hope that one of the people that when I get up there she screamed [laughter]\nDo you remember that movie pulled you guys in the the little ... little lady kept showing little I don't go home I won't want why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea I\nI thought that the hip possessions or tricked or something some strange way it changed your personality or\nShould I Know they they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when you go through with for was being shocked for somebody to buy it out there in LA and uh the person that would take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a goat to their house\nAnd sell it turned out that they knew who the goat was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person\nDoesn't know they don't go right and so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was a person on the ... whore house he says and and uh and I helped you know\nWork on that and I looked at him and I went to my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked\nAt me I says why did you put flies in the attic what could that have to do with anything\nAnd he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill I said\nWell I have nothing to do is go I you needed to exterminate or not a gold\nPerson I says why did you even do that it it's like people to do things that they think it's\nAnd to be scary or it should be part of that I don't know where they come up with this stuff\nIs a dangerous Marie I'm to dabble with the other side if you really don't know what you're doing\n[noise] I'll tell you one of the biggest pains in my side is we ...\nYeah I agree with that I had no\nIdea what you're inviting in and it's sad because it's usually teenage

somebody you know\nDirectly but that would cause problems but that was the question I had a little anecdote or two afterwards\nYou mean if if the individual uses the language or the\n... you know I was angry at\nYou know what I Would I wouldn't use try try to stay away from\nSomebody in years later maybe\nIt depends on how powerful the individual is\nOkay and then um as far as uh\nYou have energy is happening or something I've noticed that are in myself when I feel kinda awkward and the ... uncomfortable or around people if I think of myself as sort of a White House generating not visible light\nBut then for red warm you know and you're not supposed to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy either way either ... direction I mean he was on or off\nWhen he was on a\nLot of people love to be around him when he was off a lot of people wanting to be away from it was amazing how that kind of energy works both ways positive negative next up we're going to rolling in Springfield, Ohio we used to the Rockies hey Ronan thanks for calling\nMorning our way today\nWe are fine thank you hope you are too\nOften Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local\nLike I'm not far from where I live probably within an hour has friends come over the person I worked with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I had just\nHad a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I just spoke\nHated it I thought well now he goes well you might as well get up and move around on it all\nAs otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there and uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a\nWintertime and we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar a they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar we're focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck stuff about\nLike a bar full of empires or something yeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or the slaughter right and signed up on a rope or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go\nSo they they agreed and and we left that place and then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was an old dad gummed CD bar yeah and I went in there with them and to this\nPlace and that was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that often enough and the air and uh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I worked with him um and ah yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go well we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know\nA were off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven of us in the car\nAnd uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no moment um\nSo they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening\nAnd the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people when and so I just thought to myself and the only thing I could think to do was uh are farther art in heaven hallowed\nBe thy name leaders are\nDoing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer and it was weird because those guys are this\nOne girl that was what this dude and I went up her where she looked at me and I wasn't I I ... a word she says are you pray him and I says yeah and she goes we better\nShe knew one looming up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes\nLater here come the people at walk up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb when we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that thought it was the Lord Jesus in my heart\nWhich we have these dreams Myers about nothing was going to be stronger than the the like to send me\nWhat do you think that ... role and what do you think their game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they were somebody an do um where they're going to kill you [laughter] I don't think so no I I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to\nUm when me over somehow or another 'em\nLike they wanted your soul\nYeah it was weird I I had talked to this only to my therapist one other time but I definitely felt and our present I'm I'm very uh intuitive anyway\nAnd ah it
