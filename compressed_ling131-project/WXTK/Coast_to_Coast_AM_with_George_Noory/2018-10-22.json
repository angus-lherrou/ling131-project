looking back at your your original book Hooper project that it's still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nOr these look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's the general consensus that are\nSort of matches what other tribes have stated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to the to find a group that says they're an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson ... film and it's you know if people can argue about all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or ape\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nSo when I did with ah the given on film it and one thing Harvey has the ability yet\nIs let's say somebody goes into a bank robbed the bank has a beard on has had on and they're caught on camera leaving well Harvey has this innate ability to take the beard off the face\nShe can see with the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Patterson gambling film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad it's in tribal Bigfoot and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your ... accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentations at conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members of people from northern Ukraine of people from China\nAnd I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different humans look if they are some type of human as I think they are\nThen it it just follows ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you're a space aliens you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ... you know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from 'cause we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I ... I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed up playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things doing an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes\nMatch proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big but that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on it for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth\nKeep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories are these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like when I get them um\nJust because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I Would have to say this uh Dave there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carry off who saw it\nAnd why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to human\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing\nAnd it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him are apes and animals and as you know Georgia's this segment of the big world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill me if I'm going to happen\nI mean these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big but people that die hards don't like it\nThe UFO die hards like it even less they they're not comfortable with that at all but you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are I don't know what you up those are where they're from but\nUm there was enough cases over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book you can't ignore it I thought the interest there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures are engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual for years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm [noise] and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows yeah what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nSo they only future for anyone out there and talk to them and this oh I think he's eight years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in a while my cat will come back from nowhere completely bill\nAnd goes I don't understand it [laughter] and then the same man\nTold them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me\nDon't turn around get back on the horse or get back on my TV and all the [noise] and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property got their so\nCalled dogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they're going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're at a particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and\nDifferent kinds of fruit um do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take here or there an omnivore and many times when the natives are in the\nMiddle of the woods hurting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound here native ... could have done it they don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast to coast am\n... we\nFind out more about two nights gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com [noise]\nOnly on news radio Ninety five WXXI PTA [noise]\n... ...

I have had many sleepless nights listening who everything about the missing persons like it is one of the most unsettling thing that I've heard in a long time [laughter]\nSo good job on your finding um I Want him to talk about the different thing I actually think you're I really love how you're saying it how it's related wild man\nI'm I feel like Rome or off though is that way that we could find out more about wild men because there are Amazonian tribes that were just discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like your idea of revolutionary and I feel like with them and I hadn't years will definitely have an answer because of their own\nAnd my question is easy it's like you're going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones were going to be good for finding that for that that was a complete bomb\nIf I could get you to narrative George it'd be great ... ... what what kind of deal with your other question\nUh they live in the forest [noise] wonder if they bury their dead and [noise] nobody's ever found the body and you would think that one or more have been struck by lightning\nSo good point and when you talk to the Native Americans some of them say that because it does vary their bodies and when they bury him they put giant giant boulders on top so that they'll never be disturbed\nOr another another story I've heard is that they'll bury him in a river under giant rocks and they'll carry the body out into the middle of the river the put it under giant giant boulders and the river and it'll dissipate never be found the idea is is that the bodies never touched\nSo it could be true I don't know\nThanks I appreciate you were going to Eric in Illinois in the wild card lines good morning ...\nOr ...\nIs Eric demonic and Joel guy has everybody's doing the not\nDoing well what's on your mind\nAnyway I got a couple of things here a lot of folks they kind of you know what I refer to as these swagger ing arrogant skeptics that make an effort not to believe in anything\nAnd they always want to say how come you know there's not more big foot saying well for one thing big foot is just like any other resident of wilderness are always on the move there are no match they're always looking for their next meal just like your raccoons possums anything they're always on the move\nAnd the other thing is a when a lot of folks who are uh a witness to big what they always say there's this real future smell and folks wonder why well I'll tell you what if you live your whole life and he never took a bath or a wash your teeth you can smell funky\n[laughter] and I would I Would say you know one thing they would need to be introduced to his body washed shampoo and toothpaste and then might not be so phone but I just wanted to throw that out there [noise]\nAll right uh Dave thoughts on big what being nomadic do the you know from the witness reports do families stay in the same area they move around\nOr you kind of touched on something that I that I bring up a conferences and it's really food for thought first of all I'm with you George I think the Paterson given one film has never been debunked Disney studios came out and said that they at that time they could have never made a costume that was as good as what was in that\nThat segment so it's a minute and a half segment Nineteen sixty seven ... I Want everyone to think about what was the percentage of people in the wilderness in Nineteen sixty seven that had the ability to take film\nOf anything while they were in the wilderness it was minute now think about today nobody has ever come close\nTo taking video or film of a ... foot in the wilderness for a minute and a half like they got on that PG film yet today there's probably close to a hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrying a smartphone which has the ability to catch that\nSo I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe the Patterson film is real why haven't we caught despite that on film and that quality of a location in segment like they did in sixty seven there was something phenomenal about that event that caused that female big foot\nTo stay there because every other time they immediately run they won't look at the camera like this when did they won't hang around and linger knowing that people are watching him something unusual happened\nWell again not to take everything back your skin Walker day but it did the comparison is a pretty clear is that ... there was a loose if there are cameras all over the place\nAnd if you uh had activity in one area and set a camera that would move somewhere else and it goes back to sort of the question that one of the callers asked about drones say you had a drone that had heat seeking technology it attached to it\nUm the description from the tribes the you mentioned in your books suggest this thing has camouflage abilities that he can ... the change of shapes and he can hide\nCorrect that's again one of the reasons that makes this entire different topic difficult to research\nYeah I mean we see it when it wants to be seen I guess\nYeah\nTrying to get one more call in Tom in Vancouver up there in big what country Hey Tom how're you doing\n\nIs Tom on the line ...\nI think Tom has gone uh okay so we're about out of time to have a great work or the title being sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty two does that suggest that another a book of archived articles about these sightings good from some other time\nWell not really no I ... and just so everyone knows that this is a book that contains the actual articles these aren't re rights of the articles this is the real deal Nineteen twenty two was cut off point for copyrights on those articles\nOh so by more than\nYou could print them after them you can't because they're still protected\nUm well it's a terrific a piece of work uh I Love reading it I I Want to go back in\nRead it again because there's so many details that escaped me as I was preparing for the program but I I said some of the writing and this is just terrific and it's always great to have you on the program and I don't know what your sleep but I Hope you're taking care of yourself\nI'm going to be on your show Georgia and the response I get on your show out of this world good so I appreciate it yeah\nWell thanks very much I appreciate it and maybe we'll have you and get Melba catcher back on here some time to talk about that DNA stuff that'd be great\nAll right Dave polite is again a big foot wild bend a giant is the new book check it out if you get a chance at the moment we shift gears to talk about the true story of the worst the disaster in us naval history\nAnd the fifth year fight to exonerate an innocent man Indianapolis coming up momentarily [noise] if you're a ...

disaster in us naval history the two authors are Sarah black and acclaim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching the story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program uh I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\n\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen or most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nOr actually with a documentary that I saw I'm watching it with my dad it was about the war and they reduced the story of a ship to a single line which was the ship that carry the bomb in stock\nAnd added no more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library\nImagine that and you know through looking to what was available at the library I still find anything someone got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it though I\nKnow I thought out what I could ... thought someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it fast forward\nEnjoyed it from college and then we'll know ones pulled the story and you know the right way so I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to me of the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes they asked me to be their storyteller and that's kinda the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd land for you how did you ah hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story incorrect\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project for me the way I got involved was\nI had actually been praying I'm I Do pray about my work and I had been praying\nTo have an opportunity to work on an iconic for over two stories and all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmakers name Sarah Vladeck well let's hear it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis was that I'm In being Indianapolis\nThe storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she pitched it to a major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we've seen since ... brothers\nBut we only base mini series on foot so you're\nGoing to need ready for a while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff though for your family and friends she reached out and and made contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I'm a navy veteran she didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise]\nAnd\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my joke\nIs is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or into letting helper but uh eventually over the course of\nSeveral months we finally met and then ah we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty\nFour and um and then when we did it I guess the project tickets and a half years\nTo Syria where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the the story had been wrong that a lot of the people that were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she had been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that he participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on and so there was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sunk [noise]\nI'll tell you you grab ... my father was a ... at ... he drove a lending a craft from those ships took us troops on the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes the you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the US's Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that did you guys are helpful uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flagship and I'm a small part that a lot of people don't\nKnow is that she was the flagship at the battle with us now or where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent for on the fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat try one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back the land on the Indianapolis story because really the man or before the crash and not just to\nTo you know circle back and\nThe men who marry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army name Robert an army major named Robert for men and who had spent the last couple of years after the war

commander ... as I'm saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view\nIn a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience conviction and so um we were able to make great ... um\nWell with it and then more for published after the war first shit nice to have Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two that written from men are passionate his point of view and there was a chapter on it voted Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger or in the end of the world war two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot he was a commander who cared for his men\nHe was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarine and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around saying on doors asked for radar and more technology for his that marine because that makes them or you didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of his brothers that commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked\nThere was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that the rescue arrived the\nMen were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and to attacks increased as I guess you know I don't know\nHow much sharks realized things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased and you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so sick they could walk on there\nYou know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they could have there's stand on them\nThere's one account you have a sailor who you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking down things drugs thinking oh there's food I'll just reached down and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm a young anthem by the name of John wolf than he actually took his socks off and\nThinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to learn the sharks and and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realize oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are uh happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah everyone knows it's almost the end of the war and they're having this leisurely\nA sale they think across the Philippines see 'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's there I mentioned there were only a sixteen rap between there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap\nOr three groups that for rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right\nSo that there were so any water that was available with only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were than men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how ... the they got that there were others who\nAlthough they knew that the sun and the exposure and the de hydration itself with perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into the into his now and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't\nAnd then other when you know take small for it is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk and out of it but then eventually they would just begin golfing it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called ...\nAnd blood vessels for\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander um who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it was outta sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess in immediately that it did some that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who winds up testifying at the court marshal waiter\nOr an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention or we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a bart Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit within minutes late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this you know kind of explosion coming from below and there's no reports coming in saying that there's any kind of enemy action though you think well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah he I guess at the same kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still went to you know he asked a navy personnel at Guam I Believe you know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in the area don't worry about it and\nSo you know there's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know this gentleman richer live Francis have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he\nActually had diary entries of the time and record at the one he saw this and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when we're ... released about it that he would\nWe're talking with Linda incidents are lagging about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's

if you could discuss for me in a broad sort of strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined conspired to make things worse as if things just sort of drop through the cracks or that made their survival even more improbable\nWell mentioned Parker\nFrom ... to ... I'm looking at it\nAnd the ship a ride to report well why don't the brightest guy in the world and as a matter of fact the report saying it's not a well\nI don't have to report a rival shit I guess that means that don't have to report on Iran\nAnd then you know higher in Milan and things along with the last\nOf a distress signals combine to make it says in Indianapolis slip through the cracks and it wasn't until a PD one venture a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors responded in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell in the books are about these pilots that they dropped all the supplies and tried to give these guys are the water or something you hang onto and they're they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to hit back and there was one guy who's swimming way up\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I don't know where he was swimming do or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left on your plane to help this little loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and\nYou know speaking to any of these men reading their testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives like they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take for you know our ship or else the VP is the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't say one more man and he's still alive and you know that was a burden they carried till the end of their lives\nYou know it's war time is when the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but ah [noise] is it an accident that the story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the times did not believe it was an accident so the rescue occurred beginning on August second\nUh Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August fourteenth that between the time zones fourteenth fifteenth Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk the newspapers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it\nUntil VJ Day until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five I mean Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over\nThen maybe below the fold in a very small article you with us Indianapolis cruiser sunk and reporters that time believed that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was\nYou know resulted in the loss of almost nine hundred men\nOn the very brink of the end of the war\nThere was talk to me about the captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and then was the court marshal inevitable let him slide given that the war just did or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is\nA tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating the ... in the streets split their family is now grieving that their son or their brother their uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who was involved and who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the sinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame\nA lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented this situation and so really you know at the time these names you know admiral king Bruins limits and all these these men who were\nEssentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and\nIn the American public you know holds these men on this high platform and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom\nAnd have them testify and turned her surname sick I don't think that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially you know the captain is responsible for the vessel so the moment that he was\nBrought to court martial there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA little is talking about the court martial of our mentioned earlier the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commanders to testify that had never happened before and then I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain that he failed to the exact the exact thing could have prevented the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the two charges on and not only was it unprecedented to bring in command her how she might have to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all for having his shit sunk in World War two there were hundreds of vessels fund\nAnd kept in Charles McVeigh was the only cap and he was court martialed [noise]\nExcuse me and I'm\nSo glad he did have to charges against him one was and by the way the navy we we found in a records because we went to the national archives we went to the library of Congress Naval War college and so forth\nAnd we found these records where the navy was actually casting about to find that charge that they thought would pick\n'em and as Sarah mentioned there were all these leading lights of the Pacific war who were involved in this you know the the commander of specific forces the commander in Guam and these were men who had really been the architects of this new global sea power\nAnd admiral Ernest King who was the fleet admiral\nOur theory is that he didn't want to see all these leading lights dragged into court and so that's why they were casting about for something that would stick with McVeigh and so what they charged him with was failure to call abandoned ship in a timely manner which was quickly disproven because there were a lot of witnesses who\nUm heard him call abandoned ship and then her to pass man demands the second shift as you are the second charge rather as you mentioned with failure to think that\n... was an anti submarine warfare tactic worship which they're back and forth across based course\nHoping to throw off the aim of the Japanese seven commander\nAnd indeed happened to me they did the stick as the ... at evening twilight\nOr just before the ship was sunk but the standing orders of the military put that in his purview that was at his discretion and he chose to exercise that discretion um and then when commander ... testified at the trial he said that he would have stuck day\nWhether he had been ... or not and then it didn't make a difference but he was testifying and Japanese through a translator and the translator did not translate exactly what he said uh correctly\nCommander ... could understand enough English to know that but not enough to
