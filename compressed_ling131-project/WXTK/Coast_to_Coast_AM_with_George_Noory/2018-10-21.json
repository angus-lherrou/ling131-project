Timothy Conway's sat sang in the summer of two thousand and five\nThomas's taught a class based on the sad thing for the center for lifelong learning he's spoken publicly numerous times both in person and on the radio and then September twenty twelve you spoke for the percentages lecture series mind and super mind\nWhich is run by the SBC see Graham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the month for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty four team is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAnd his article Houdini afterlife experiment\nDid it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry who d'nese um how should we practice I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned\nHe really um [noise] he um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately we got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics\nWe're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um that\nYoung student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he\nWould pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean I'd have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and you'd be ready for that but this time there's\nThis guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive\nA medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer who take a picture and\nAnd ah you know the fake media would be totally surprised if it were you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini him to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah this writing on beating on Harry right behind\nHim up that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems that makes sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I ... I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... is there are so Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritually so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an a vow to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a ... to find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nAnd then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with best [noise] well\nI'll touch an interest in it but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked because that and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine\nAnd I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry die [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and\nIn his mind putting the word forgive in all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to pass\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul were spirit with surviving gap and so this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford\nWas well aware of Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDid this I got a jump in here forgive me Thomas I gotta jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking is going to the break with do me on coast to coast them [noise]\n\nNo\nNo\nNo no I didn't let it go\n\n\n[noise]\nTo arguably the biggest ... contests this November state Senate race the incumbent democratic senator ... his Republican opponent John ... this Thursday night it's W. ...\nMary moderate their lives debate at the Cape and islands association of realtors Tom presenter one mid tech drive in West yarmulke sponsored by just payroll for local company to boarding the local community stay informed this election season on use radio Ninety five W.

paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing a Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com Thomas Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nHe was with his sister ... eyes car accident and his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSay on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James hike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian ... there's another Canadian connection yeah yeah yeah and\nI think it's an I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide the year before\nNow what Ford did for this high profile say on what he did with all the secret do the trick is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up on us Thomas or I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm James ... this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide of your earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little upfront research\nBrings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went to his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case as fun as it is in his exciting it is it it's not going to be the first break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredited the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts it cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe\nIs that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his dad but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my account but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight\nOr when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the than too and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know at first they were going to do it down in the building but then they said let's defect on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and Simon and go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream belief\nBut your inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that she wrote a wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and\nSo I'm now someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex you're being a spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nTell the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to disprove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication with possible\nI Am now here in my desire to do this mistake\nHow all those last stay because of my mistake to lay a whole again of hope and to live with the knowledge that life is continue with\nThat is my message to the world through my wife and through this psychic media those are the word\nFantastic Thomas how do people get a hold of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAmazon dot com is that both the paperback an e book and I do want to point out one interesting thing I'm Dr Gary Swartz wrote the book the afterlife experiments and he was a guest with art they'll all those years ago and I recently heard that Gary sports\nHave Harry Houdini as a spirit that he's been working with over there at the University of Arizona\nHow fasten that's fantastic well we'll have to get to Dr Schwartz on the program again and follow up on that yes thank you so much for this\nWell Richard you're an actor Lynn how you have a good heart and the work you do with making the world a better place and I appreciate it\nAll right God Bless and thank you Thomas resentful when we come back who

the case of FDR um you know this is Seventy almost Seventy five years ago three quarters of the century I mean was it or was it difficult at this stage in the game to to reopen this very very cold case\nThey're all they're always difficult because I never want to know that there's a germ students read all of us\nLike truth justice and the American way and you don't want to think of anything

all the way through school or he'd rather rip off and go play football and so forth and uh it was a well hey here's what was it I Want to use but he was a little shopping was really a\nYou know it was his or something I think that anyone was there for the ashtray and his political where it started out in the last of our main and being out in the positions and they blossom them being I Wonder if you are a lot of people don't know what I was governor of New York edited forgot that they're just not talking about it anymore\nYou're on a you know he he was ... year old man now he just cause I Know [laughter] all the Roosevelt was born a Roosevelt maybe Roosevelt by a Roosevelt which was a little odd or the woman got ready to change the monitor ... part of your life actually [laughter] you know I'm\nYou know I mean this is the evolution of the gift person\nAt least his cousin teddy was his was a distant cousin was the second or third cousin\nI think it was a second ago right\nAnd and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he perceived as younger cousin and the Democrats\nWell\nThey got along really well I'm at the our father wasn't too thrilled about what\nBecause that was just not the way but he was raised with a that Roosevelt name off that would have done anything to find out if he was\nA recording early a full on their special unlike comes\nOut so he did a lot of\nThings without unsavory would ban some self marrying this focus on on funding a number of Teddy Roosevelt you know that in public it was awful lot of weight so you know he was a ... benefitted from the laws will name as well so\nRight and he was also governor of New York lots of you know he was you know he was also governor of New York which is ... has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah it has happened that way through history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have um\n... sort of I I think of George Bush a senior in trying to buy Taksim Kmart back in the er the remember that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man\nAnd there was a famous TV report he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know while he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nThat no one sort of ... you don't notice store or said hey wait a minute our president is gonna is in a wheelchair or he can barely walk is he equipped you know this is thinking back then obviously we know better now\nBut the idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago uh that no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their camera shots well and that whole people first time I got off the subject that this was a guy who said\nHe would get really think I'm horrified thought processes at one time that we really we really saw Joe when he would do is easy like with ... someone ... you will lose their arm and help but look ... or something at the time\nIt would appear to be walking to pick a couple of stops so they could I just you know buying podium use a little bit different than the shops and\nYou know they they do remarkably well\nSo they they are to ward off the fact that in case anything do you\nGet paid in a search jumping to go public and claimed that you know five minutes experienced it so it was shortly and for X amount of hours so I mean propaganda in a you know those those were Walsh anything back down you know it's just that\nThe media was smaller and easier to control\nThat\nWe didn't have other things you know cell phones and cameras on the phone and you know they could make twice a day at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which you're seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely the\nUm ... like this is complicated fire I'm ready to strike\nPoint the men had changed debate in which the president was going to be one in from march until January so we didn't go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that rose or at a waiter take office for or extra so this mystery\nThing all the hundred days and they still judge presidents by ... hundred days um FBI had one hundred it was because it changes\nRight he had a four to four months to a head start listening will not take a timeout comebacks steam and talk about the new deal and the depression\nAnd communism and and much more who murdered FDR Joe Cocker hide your love away into the brain

Mussolini at first he was in awe of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing\nBut you know again I'm history books being what they are that tendency over the last um [noise] so America gets into the war and Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed and night for\nMore than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was\nThere how close\nEngland cans are losing their island they were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this was what their MO was they used to go and lay down air strikes bomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them\nI'm of course the two at my previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church shows the one who\nGather together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans\nBecause they were so similar to the time\nThat style and in America and the the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be from\nSo you know to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great birds I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been his fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure communism and listeners\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and [laughter] you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ... million\nFDR it seemed to a ... and reading a book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned in need us we need it Stalin style and and the U.S\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and installing a pack well Hillary violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind\nAnd they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march\nAnd then you know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to ... because it held his namesake so now it was leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional\nDictator if at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch horses in midstream and go toward styling read\nUm meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission\nAnd they were just says well I don't care I Want to do it so\nStalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us so Hitler has he has the other hand here he has the opportunity to play a little\nA little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's dollars table in which they get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran I think in\nA was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have at even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world a instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still it's pretty robust\nOr you know he you know by by the standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I I wanted to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads that Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nI'm Sorry I'm Len wrote that quote from one of his will I'm rich donors to root too dangerous removed\nAnd after stoned to death they they called him a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nMurder have I got a ...
