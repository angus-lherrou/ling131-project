Apologize\nNow no need to apologize who knew what it was at the time\nWe had gotten a written reports and I thought it was worth reporting but thank you for updating us have absolutely\nHowever earlier that day we're talking about friday the twelfth of October\nA woman and the mother and wife are in Sims Barry Connecticut got up at six AM she was standing in her bathroom and suddenly realize that there were bright lights being shown on the floor of the bathroom\nWhich are flabbergasted or because uh she lives out in about ... of rural land forested land there shouldn't have been any lights on our bathroom floor\nShe walked through the window and looked up and to use her term is George tour utter shock and amazement she saw a rectangular craft with eight rows of lights running down the venture off the surface of it moving over or how slowly headed for a row of trees and\nWithin thirty seconds or a minute it just disappeared from her said\nYes she did hear a home and that raises the specter of a possible blame we haven't checked on blame ship but very interesting report\nPosted to our website and her illustration of what she saw on the bottom of that craft is posted to our home page a UFO center dot com\nWell four days later a gentleman was leaving work and Madison, Wisconsin and he writes\nWhen he was a he looked up in the sky you saw white craft coming at him a in the sky of course he assumed that it was an aircraft to party in Dane County airport near Madison\nBut the more I looked at it the more intrigued he became because he couldn't see any engines you couldn't see any wings couldn't see a tail or windows and he pulled it it was so intriguing and he pulled his car off the roadway and stare and looked at it\nAnd it was at that point he realized that it was symmetrical was papers both in the front and back it just strict off across his head in to the northwestern sky and disappeared from from his site\nNext report was from the next day October seventeenth woman was sitting in Nashville, Tennessee eating or lunch sitting in her car at the edge of a park\nAnd she suddenly her attention was suddenly drawn to a very very bright sparkling craft\nA sphere hovering motionless in the sky as she watched this object intrigued by it she realize there was a blue one approaching the silver one from the her right\nAnd the red one from below the silver fear ascending\nThey all joined up in the same small area of the sky sat there for thirty seconds or so and then all of them suddenly moved off in the daytime sky this was twelve thirty in the afternoon she ate our lunch very interested in the\nReport we have a photo of what she saw on our website but I just discovered before the program that it looks like a Web masters chosen the wrong photo\nLast report comes for Redondo Beach last night gentleman was out at my or in the clear night sky and he saw a failing some five to seven red light streak over his head he got a quick photo we

demanded a blur capital with me today so let's ask him Kevin how are ya\nGreat George thanks yeah in two thousand and two silver was four dollars announced near it cost to production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely nuts nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible though\nShore in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage given\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical\nSilver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go down\nYou know I guess not but could super retired than a hundred dollars announced\nOr if you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach us all time high so we think's a one hundred dollars is well within reach\nRoom when that happened over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything\nThat you can set up to

difference it's very strange I Can't really differentiate what's real and what it is and\nBecause the the the frauds are very good at what they do\nThat's the thing and you know what I watch shows on TV about uh how magicians are pulling in public and I say this is so bad because it's so good at this and it makes all of us who are legitimate look really really bad\nAnd it looks like we're all doing trickery of something so I I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not you should not ask the person who's receiving their reading any questions I shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that why you hear you should be able to tell them that's the first\nTest of legitimacy of ah what you are receiving\nThe iron ore yellow or on a few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers who are others who are critical of him say that he's just a great magician and and I told them I says hurry I got to tell you if you're a magician\nAnd you're doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons magically you if you're a magician I Can't see the trick\nOr you know we're we're you do switch or anything like that ah I've looked at videos I've slowed him down a gun frame by frame\nYou can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he probably the real deal I Believe he started out doing magic trick because many of these wonderful psychic do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a there are six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately\nAnd then it kind of well close together you can't tell the difference\nBut it's wonderful that you're you're falling down that frames and did you learn anything from that we were able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and blocks haven't started in years\n[laughter] try to say that when you were growing up you did magic tricks or you're involved with magic\nAnd did a little magic when I was kid um you know was I was really good at that but you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven uh which really I think steered me\nInto the field that I Know I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce [laughter]\nYes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince\nPeople are really saying something that will really be impressed and they'll say well I was a trick I was a visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific and\nThere there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe who will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking it's so restrictive eliminating you know into higher consciousness go into fourth dimension fifth and beyond\nLet's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and ah other um financial interest or very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because the earth is supposed to be\nIn growing in a consciousness so they're kind of a digging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah you do now Georgia we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers listeners your birth month in days\nTo have a birthday and a first name possible short\nThey're asking about I'm a fellow man to a lot about love and romance\nAnd try to keep each call two minute nap for so many miles has so many people\nWill cut it short would try to get right in there as quickly as\nYou believe in reincarnation\n[noise] I don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly have the experience as we have\nIf we weren't for more than one time in either on the earth or another dimension so I think people can be here the first time because they've been in other dimensions other planets I I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say Dr believe in reincarnation and have to say yes a\nVariation of it and other churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and they're related disorders\nAs a psychic or anything out there that bothers you the the the you feel very strange about\nWhen you see a very strange about like um\nAre you are you

remember\nAnd it's actually afraid to call in I'm very happy to a ... and that's why she went and got the power from we all get our energy from life for us we get it from God at the moment we take our

and he said you know mom I'm fine\n[laughter] and I don't want you to worry about\nMe when I lost my dog he came to me and a little hospital bed the night he died and he was lying on his side it said I I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I passed but I'm okay now I Know it's a crazy they called me mom they really think that your mother so\nAnimals and that's your question try to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go [noise]\nBut they do have are really as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but\nI don't want people to think that two sides it right is supposed to go and you're supposed to go\nAnd you know so a suicides are all different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicide\n... very sad yes don't do it [laughter] no\nYou'd asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have that ability to be on ...\n... ... the threat class that hit you a sense and you're feeling it that's very intuitive so you can

people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories\nWhere they've changed and people begin to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but I get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves\nBut just don't know\nThat's a form of healing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining

Maine yet when my father had been friends for the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died in hospital the doctor told my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that\nThat is one of the first experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books I must tell you George I don't remember anything much from what happened when I was out of my body age three members rather hard living under the afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\nWas I died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions and this is an appendectomy in an operating room and that time I remember what happened it sounds like the classic empty to begin with up onto the field are you looking at the the the the the scalpel in the ... not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to loosen up talk of some pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate wanted to do with an old marine nine year old kid would want to do go on the ride go some addresses\nSo I guarantee Luna Park age nine in my Astros body and I'm drawn into I didn't know that goes straight maybe\nI'm drawn into another world and we're I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that right and I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bit back eventually op this evening to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked\nTo find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding\nThat there will be on the physical you know nine years old who do you talk about this she tried to talk the adults I think it's the medication you're hallucinating or something the first person who could explain\nTo me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition\nIs it oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same and sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my cold dissociation was an ability to travel beyond the buddy traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily\nAnd an understanding is there a world beyond the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell on the phone not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army so moving all the time army brats situation not tell you one of the things that kept me going is it amongst mine does the bulk companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and a face\nBecome and sit on my dad didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and one day all day you can't kill your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rub it younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe had time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why it's a self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and\nCan help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into\nOther will we traveled a parallel worlds for example where we're leading parallel lives this isn't as weird\nAs some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now it was a medic parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find out so for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then and conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solar consciousness survived physical Texas is a pretty pretty important area\nAh so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious not sold them going on\nThis was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my including clued but loving family members are ancestors of spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mine but science tells us about to get in contact information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely each time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams are wild and write them down will notice that they dream of events before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future we can ... hosts the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we also traveled into the past from this my mother lives you learned about connections with drama is playing out and other realities and all the time periods in\nThe multi dimensional universe so this is the key to us and understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the path of direct experience this pop a dream travel\nAnd my stories in the book ... absolutely and in highly from my experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and to give them permission to use this story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers them but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose\nA sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why most human kill human couches across history a valued dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or the goddess if you like\nBut you can talk to nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest sold so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams\nCan be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions in attitudes from Baton on more objective perspective than we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what it might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up to ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step process the sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done ... minutes you get some help with the fact that your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our genes I mean bad habits apart from that is out of it the ... the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness between sleep and wake that's a good time to catch a good time to embark on loosened dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that cut those\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't\nWant to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so he'd slam the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nOpportunities and challenges lie ahead they ... the things we don't yet know about bacon\nSave your life that could save your job they could say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today if I did not know the ... and show that I have that I have avoided death on the road tree dates with death fatal accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecast book was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with the Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to fall on the other side of a blind\nSpot for example so that's one direction for time travel but time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact you understand what our relationship with time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of the time altogether we step into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we're leading a power life this come very interesting when you begin to look at give some lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not at all the power alone I\nThink it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost at that time\nWill be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives of situations of people in far flung places feel proud of your multi dimensional family I'm a bit of an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience\nWe have connected to dramas being lived in other places in times of the ...\nPoint of view it's all going on now I wouldn't be doing what I I'm not doing enough not found myself connected with an Anglo Irish men who came to the American colonies\nSeventeen hundred ...

I was in the graveyard this week and I look at him\nYeah I was in a graveyard I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it or what I call\nShe's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head start he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story the very great story I mean not introduce his whole themes about you know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coven to sudden\nGoal is to a certain place might even be an agent of simplicity but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a news story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and in the ... these examples proliferate so ...\nYou know ... how it works is that the the the attitude of the energy you are carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking waking few around the next corner which is a very good reason everything in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack\nCheck what you're saying to yourself drop the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs and the open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know you need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think those are good body is very important that the first of all I mean scientists are telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to match up into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter\nOf reality as a dense consciousness so that there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot and maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize\nWhat is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time ... example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hits a gosh are my blood\nIs voting in its online you lived in pants and after\nThat I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen gamble the white queen screams\nBefore she put her finger says she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the forward took place on the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment on just the patriots symptoms be says but I couldn't possibly reported people think I was looted you\nWell you know I think so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know things we know what the bleep we know that\nWe know you're not above the sudden medic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people and we feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's part of the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell acted dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again remember your dreams are going to share them the right way you're going to take action that will end\nOh your life and bring some elite and a chief guide in July from your tree I mean that's one aspect of it it's also method of loose a dream and you're going to shut medically dreaming we ... my favorite way up and back you know they'll disagree but that is to start out loose the sailors what does that need it means that we use somebody from being in the workshops\nOr we might take a dream that we remember the starting of course we might decide okay the some romances adventure steel industry let's go on with the three let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror stuff that stuff's going on\nBut going back inside the treatment facing the scary based on the ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who adopted my dream whether it's grabbed my real someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a treat me another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try like state treated sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where\nWe are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state and make it a state of horizontal meditation if you're like a ten to the images that rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the themes that will come to view the porch or fully dreaming of finally\nActive creamy with the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we ... how to look for the outlook for signs of both in the world around you so this is also a program on a method of attending to the dream like symbol\nEveryday life Robert did the dreams ever miss lead us trick us basically\nI think the treatments and sell them misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminder to interpret according to the wrong stand it I think I tend to the trains and themselves to advocate stepped it\nI mean we could pick up things in the night for the for for for the floating around but we don't walk around we could pick up taking us from all the other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that it's truly out of and it\nCan be worked in the service of hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible based but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on a round you might find the behind something that's scaring or buying and you and\nYour dream is a ... a power of understanding about how that might give you a kind of spiritual outlier on life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream of not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to narrow understanding what dreams is about can be very misleading\nYou got to Robert we're going to take a quick
