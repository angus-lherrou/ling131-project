O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in those glaciers is there is a north\nOf Mel oceans will I bet\nWell\nPlanet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise]\nUm and the the um but yes the waters on Mars that's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to breathe the bull\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be Tara formed within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do a thorough what country but\nThe Martians or\nThey're going to do with themselves no when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches those ideas and they bring us back\nA rumble set a tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that the federal board\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm\nRevolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch company is my guest the Chinese will because\nUh uh of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress [noise] command [noise] um but Russia\nCompanies but allowing space launch companies to believe it got started they wouldn't get the gun\nBecause you know the Russian or you know Russia is not a country with organized crime and organized crime family with a country\nI mean and so it it's going to happen and they're going to panic um\nOn Robert ... the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about the phone lines with

Robert Zubrin with us we'll get to calls in the seconds rubber we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\nWhat I say China right now I'm\nIs about where the U.S was around\nNineteen sixty seven [noise] um I mean in terms of manned space flight a you know they've been to earth orbit they I mean there are a bit\nBeyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they didn't launch a small space station which we did not have\nDo they have the rockets and the capability to do that\nTo go to the moon mhm\nUm they can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and then these are ... space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can to you in one third the time at one tenth the cost and if\nUh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with understanding that they're going to need to have rule of law there that they cannot have a government it's simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so potent once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity\nA if you're going to be a first class power much right or you have to be first class in space um\nRussia's going to have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a reason is a ... in a certain I mean the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted past literacy and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know if I live in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to watch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us where you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the ... states that one weapons okay I mean 'cause what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists\nWell a presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that I mean it's a different objection people sometimes have is that uh you know if if space becomes totally privatized then\nGee it'll just be a the rich that get to go to Mars well\nUm [noise] it frankly easier to get rich that to become an astronaut or right and um\nAnd also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become\nThe thing that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs walk\nTo go and um you know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know do a and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're we're going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell surely will um now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets [noise]\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds\nAh they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not to feel if you can get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a ... you know the next new kid on the block me a a ... you know knocking on Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing\nPropulsion too are but I'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert leery in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so it sounds like what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen to your show like\nAnyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the ... and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering I'm going to get there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like America do like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead I'm okay All right well here's the thing\nUm [noise]\nThere there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people\nRight and you\nCan even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong this you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we get destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nBuys in hurts there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks\nUm nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the ... is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well\nUm I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point uh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state\nMining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nAre being launched a ... in the very near future that is because a mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now [noise] ah it has some value\nAnd uh and and and the exchange for those claims are people could get a exploration missions finance\nMine the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable\nFeeling lost not by your radio grab your smartphone or computer and listen

I'm ... and ah I just have a question on your thought to be leaning towards privatization\nBut are you in Anchorage privatization on the colonization of the ... of the Mars or the planet I mean are you looking at just allowed to be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can or are you are you ... the government should be some more involved in\nThe hating how a possession of real poverty as it was would be more if we ever got a point where travel was easy [noise]\nAll right go ahead Robert minute left her\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of government so we could see which kind of government works the best because that's how we make progress\nOn earth you know America was a noble experiment we proved the value of democracy and human rights and\nPeople all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better\nWell if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government or the Russian government or the Chinese government that they formed their own governments they'll go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some will be good idea if somebody would be bad ideas and the ones with bad ideas that are not workable those counties will\nFail but the ones with good ideas immigrants will flock there those places will grow and they'll become an example to the rest of humanity\nRobert thank you again my friend always great talking to you Robert ...

forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy guy shot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a ghost in Paris psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist ah yeah so it it actually\nI actually got a day job and then I studied the parents psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that's something you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well [laughter]\nWell that's good well let's see they they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when apple was at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies bore the give us an overview of what you've been doing random\n[noise] well um you know I ah\nI have a degree in Paris psychology or when I was at University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically it the environmental sensitivity and goats encounters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the clinical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with a ghost studies\nAnd you know I'm sure that listeners to your show no it's it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes by encounters\nOr oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as a loose the nation interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes so individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with\nTelevision shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who were looking for things OR Books with more than just ghost stories\nTales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes the encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights in the cause of these throwing encounters\nUm it ... the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nEven experience and you know ... ... you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years\nAnd if and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several first hand account of ghostly encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting first hand account of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes normal conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's when I came up with some of these maybe theories are and that's what I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts and I also review the ... the the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters\nVotes will then you bring it to do some real science to the picture your brand and I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder\nUm the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some great you know I'm narrow psychology a fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement and non locality and how electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just\nYou know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWouldn't be concluded today brand new about what the ... experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think a majority of it goes to encounter that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly counters it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal ... electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them one of the hell\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them or a ... view on goes so that's um inside it's basically um pull up with the\nExtra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of goes lane counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um ... the or I'm sort of 'em are coming in or being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on\nMy main theories in the book over um what I call a a tele Patrick distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's ... the ... is a real it's a real important part of it goes way encounter\nHow important than is the person as opposed to the vet or something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um it's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's\nKind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to goes land counters but I also think that the event is sort of a\nCatalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that you know I I think if we look at a lot of the ... counters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death\nOr life threatening events or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst that he goes the encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um\nAnd I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of there's a lot of things that happened after that and one of ...\nThese things is um you know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these viral energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens\nI think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to\nSend a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is that the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these this is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an operation of\nMy aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you\nKnow my aunt passed away right on time that I had that and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying I somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distressing they'll saying to me and I picked\nUp on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and um you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affects certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nSo I I really enjoyed not joy but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the seemingly on anything\nWell with Brenda ... his book is called the ghost studies ... dot com of course linked up at coast to coast

Brandon because the person who died who comes back never had someone tune as business had they had the tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there of ghostly encounters have\nTo do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the staff of a father or something\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\nDo the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that's sort of sets in motion a plan to sort of ... psychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if if collective consciousness\nThe consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere [noise] um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think the thing I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement aberrations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death I'm such a pretty\nHigh number eighty percent it's huge yeah yeah\nYeah and and perhaps these bereavement operations and it's from the disease shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psych and perhaps apple versions could be sort of a way\nTo process the motions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the disease could help us move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards revolution and I ... and when I talk to this these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one death after the evaporation\nAnd I think on TV usually go negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive\nUm it could come out of it goes counter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is um something to look forward to it it's not all negative and demons and things like a brand\nAnd what have you concluded about the people who are more receptive to these kinds of ... and then counters than others what's so special about

there are some test out their specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nI don't like human magnets or something or yeah yeah exactly you know the research is kind of\nSometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's some\nSome really unique experimental design that um you know where they're actually doing I found out after MRIs jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain is actually and their bodies are reacting\nTo this electricity at very low levels so there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can you know so and this is true for but we all we all experience
