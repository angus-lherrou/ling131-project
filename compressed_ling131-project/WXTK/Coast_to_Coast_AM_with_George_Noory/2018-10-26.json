body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun\nSo that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than Neptune a good way out there but they had ... narrow down the focus so yes there were only going on November first started another surge because the new calculations\nPredict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology's planetary scientists department in Pasadena, California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion\nIs a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for\nYou isn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail was probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing enough direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right and like no no no it's five thousand times more massive this is what we mean\nWhen we say a planet and the other part of the solutions to\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where my does have come from why use this massive object all the way out to the edge of the type rebel going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or any ... inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition of\nAll of this was just speculation you can probably come up with so many different ideas to explain how it got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like not to we think it's a ... tune like planets just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clones it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be sings about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter lightly you're it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the rebels and the or clout\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there's a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're ... sure because we don't know what is beyond the planet and we don't quite know how the

hundred events can become as often as every other year and so there's really extreme floods extreme she did it become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what her computer models showing to do is have you worked on the eye BCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those the stuffed with\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact\nIt seems that some of the larger nations the United states included my adding whole now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\n... unfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems\nWill only become more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that short a period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes in house and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migration away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned votes on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where

... of such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally wants to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from Lola choose\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war ... all of the the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to\nA lot of the crises\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head and the same mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in

continental US state\nFlorida now has the most property at risk a study finds that three hundred and fifty one billion dollars worth of homes will be risking persistent title flooding\nThe researchers say if that global warming and sea level rise does continue that in more than one million properties in Florida well have chronic flooding\nAnd that when you look at the map as it is extended by

at seven thirty PM mountain and another time zones around the country in the world I've been in my office where I'm Talking to you tonight in front of this computer to share news with\nThe general audience that is growing around the world for my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell just a three weeks ago and October third I was doing updates on three categories\nThe first had to do with the very distressing subject of half cats beheaded cats\nAround the world bloodless\nWeird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox is in a car road kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspots solar observatory shut down I had a received a whistle blower emails saying that are actually uh the child pornography was just funny deflection\nThat he actually involved the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Harlem an air force base of the ... down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then the third update\nHad evolved from my asking my profiles YouTube channel audience on September twelfth anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately\nAnd I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was talking about\nWhen the next morning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream\nSo I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird or I sent the puzzle to a photo shop at video analysts I've worked with for years\nFirst I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nHe did\nA video loop that you can see right now all of this at a ... report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got that from the photo shop analyst was\nThat he thinks this is truly anonymous\nAnd uh then I asked a that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office\nAnd believe it or not a second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder\nOn October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me\nEmails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like act applies than I Do not know this is the extremely a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt\nThat there were people who were telling me they had never mentioned any of this parent to loved ones their children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard and he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida\nBut what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight\nThinking about all of this is provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard\nOr talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida home\nMissed was in the spring of two thousand in age and I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn of the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bad coverage of all my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see\nAnd then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and ears open them again\nAnd through the window I can see this misty gray bomb drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was\nIn this dark bedroom it was\nAnd this and I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling and slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head\nAnd I was just frozen fascination of I didn't know what to think then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind off by three dimensional lighted hire a glass passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was a feeling of euphoria and won this with this living thing\nThat was surrounding made and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time\nI was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers was coming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously\nAnd I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it I don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nAnd you describe the shape of a ... that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of what kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head tell a possibly\nKnow there were no word there was no sound the hiring glitz we're almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I can see peripherally these hiring glass but they had the same texture of the fall and good would shadow in life\nBut they were living minutes at the same time and they would just blow by me but kind of leave\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head\nAnd as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a download information that was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was this super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe\nWas indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now at that moment it was for something that was being given to me\nBut I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall misinformation because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any sub text in your mind or your soul about who would be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it made because of my past experience with ever since I was a child I've had psychic dreams\nDreams of having relationships with an

question is leading to answer that people are raising more issues and scientists are also coming forward and saying that they have information about this and so tonight if there's anybody listening on
