the tag or what those Lynn is one of the central voices and the new consciousness ... but she's the author of several great books including the field and the tension experiment underway this the power of eight Lynn is the editorial director doctors don't\nTell you and also the architect of the intention experiments that she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program you two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI calculated your money\nYou know I get an intention a bit when a several weeks ago hurricane\nFlorence was heading toward the Carolinas or the other groups you know the category four or five and we did a little more let's bring it down in a ... a tropical storm really fast or something happens at work so they\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep that uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now we've run about six piece intentioned experiments trying to lower violence\nUm last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the most violent place in America which is believe it or not a U.S a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri\n... and we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked at and I had a professor of statistics look at this from the University of California and she saw that\nCrime went up in St Louis is a whole property crime went up in St Louis as a whole property crime went up went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent for before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on here\nWhat do you think this is what people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the feel of what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I liked I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our ... everything is energy\nAnd our thoughts are another kind of energy when there are worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster to purify water\nTo healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and you know of those thirty three twenty nine have shown measurable positive significant effects\nDesigner trend the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug has his good record is that in terms of studies so\nSo as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seem to be created that has great power\nTo change things now he'll thing\nThe experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis\nAnd then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k. and we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the deep pack of the middle east\nAnd also a very prominent Israeli ... a documentary producer so we had eight and Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know with the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know I'm just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know\n... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play ... in the ship your upbeat and positive well that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individual for instance we did an intention once for a kid cold Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide he threw himself off of forty foot structure\nAfter his he broke up\nWith this for a serious girlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage he had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community to start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief and the power of intention was pretty stupid\nIt worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of Arizona noted psychologist\nAnd a Jessica us who is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research I worked with the late ... I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert\nUm I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable\nAnd then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and with some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientists didn't know which ones who were sending intention to so we had it real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or own Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results\nAnd the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's going on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nAnd do you know loom the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group for the test why ... why not three\nFifteen [laughter]\nWill the power of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of\nSure sure my God we're told oh no they were students who never even done meditation and all they had twelve minute video for\nMe I Would have to do when we're gonna take a quick break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work\nThe power of the age and some of the incredible things that can be done with the power of intention truly remarkable wouldn't Mick Jagger ... linked up for you at coast to coast day uh ... dot com sober other books the bond with\nThe intention experiment and\nSign up now ... zone or free email newsletter get a today it goes to goes DMV dot com\nMarriages that I have no idea how long they were married they said two thousand in a was a two thousand twelve they went to see a therapist because they're having problems in their marriage and I guess that's when this came up I\nSpoke at well that's my point is she gonna supplies why wouldn't they have been also said\nYou'll refuse to justify it don't mean to you know build their last for the heat from I ...

blew\nOut of the blue another woman over spent and she gets you know she over spent on a holiday or group doesn't intention for she hears from the hotel says we accidentally overcharged you buy exactly the money she was overdrawn\nI'm somebody else was down to her last two hundred dollars she wanted to set up a website she had a port wine staying and wanted and was wanting to do a website and set up a business to help other people not feel bad about their birth marks\nAnd she's down through last two hundred dollars and she suddenly here from Lloyd's of London ... she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue\nSo this happens so often that it it has convinced me is not just luck is not just happenstance\nAnd you say universities are studying the power they what are they doing\nWill we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all ... state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger power vague you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its identical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at the immune system markers so what changes in your immune system when you do this\nBut one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas you're it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we\nWe actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us\nSo that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow America America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be ... that would be an interesting experiment\nWill you know we're doing one this that this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in ... county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence but\nWe've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou talked about a mirror of what is that\nWell then mirror affect me was the biggest piece of this George because you know we weren't just seeing affects among the receivers of stuff\nAnd the receivers of the big intention experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened to the participants in these intention experiments\nSo when we started doing these peace experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the website and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beam in Star Trek remember these are people who were participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners that we're getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nSo that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment if not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to those people it changes their lives being part of that\nWhen we're gonna come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we

definitely um I've certainly seen that in my own life and seeing it in in many in many instances but there seems to be some sort of scaling up in a group you know\nI I wrote about this is my last book the bond about how we are really need to be part of the community George\nAnd you know that is are are kind of birthright it's also are feeling of\nOf coming home in a way you know we were always meant to be in groups we were never and we were always part is supposed to be part of the greater home we've never supposed to be alone and I think there's something about that group support\nThat group feeling that you know you got a load of people who are just wishing you well there you know intending for you for your health for your happiness through something that's really powerful\nAnd you know in many cases with my master classes for instance when I put people in groups there total strangers and they don't meet in person they're meeting virtually you know they're meeting on Skype or zoo or conference call or something like that\nMany of them end up feeling like this is a badge of people who are closer to me than my own family never they never unless they've never actually met them in person\nAnd that's the incredible thing about it but it's that idea of a group of strangers you know praying for you basically that's very very powerful\nHave you found Lynn in your studies that these abilities\nWe work uh for people\nOf certain age brackets of certain sections or does it skew anything\n[noise] no I mean you can be young you can be older\nYou know I think that um the people who tend to do this stuff or people who are\nYou know anywhere from their thirties to their seventies um it really depends on what they want in their life they I've had young people I've had older people and it it works for them I think it's all about\nUsing the techniques that I teach you know in becoming a a master in tender essentially knowing how to really focus your mind knowing how to\nWhat kinds of things too intense for and how to do it but also being part of that group and Jeff meeting regularly and I think it's that meeting regularly that does the trick I mean there's a guy called Michel Dean I write about my book who is a\nClinical psychologist\nBut suffered from depression which such so bad that it was often suicidal that's not a good calling card for a psychologist\nSo he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so being part of the group they intended for that\nAnd what they intended for was that he would find the source of these in these depression and soon after that he got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal is\nWho worked out that one of his liver filtration systems wasn't working and he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right\nAnd as soon as that was treated his depression completely lifted but the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened over the year not only did that happen\nBut he ended up going back to his fighting weight he lost weight the it got back to his you know his his weight that he was as a young man\nHe um he is chi gung practice he was practicing chi gung that Gump better\nHe got a writer's block and was able to start writing again um he also developed something to help other people with I think it's with depression is special I'm a special kind of technique\nAnd everything in his life with getting better\nAnd even his training you know his his um his is trainer at the gym and said to him what are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve but he he was one of the people who met religiously\nAnd in fact one of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they'd never actually physically met\nAnd there were times when mutual would say you know I had insomnia last night and I couldn't sleep and Robert would say don't worry man I had you covered and he was intending for him to have a you know to to sleep better\nAnd so knowing you've got that constant support is really strengthening in every way\nOver the year when when you do these intention not experiments but when you do these intentions to do something what did they do actually I mean you sit there and think I mean what what did they do\n[noise] okay well there's a lot of little techniques that make you a good in tender I mean you know the popular view is that you just have to think about it and believe it ... as long as your eyes or whatever you do\nUm but it's you know one thing to really keep in mind Georgia's that were intending all the time [laughter] you know and we sabotage most of our intentions we we think that we're just having\nYou know we we have a meditation in the morning we do a little power thought and that the power thought is the thing that's our intention and that's the only thing the universe is going to hear\nBut um as I wrote about in my book the field\nYou know we are and meeting energy all the time we're meeting a tiny current of light all the time and our thoughts are another part of that kind of mission and we're we're kind of leaky buckets we're we're broadcasting twenty four seven\nAnd so if we have this one little power thought thing I'd like to have this\nUm but the rest of the time we're thinking no it can't possibly come to pass or on such a loser or I don't like my hair or whatever you know were sabotaging it and so one of the
