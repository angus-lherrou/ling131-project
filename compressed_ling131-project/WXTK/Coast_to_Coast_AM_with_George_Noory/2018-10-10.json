least impactful social media platform on the Web to kill and\nGoogle has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported\nThat the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts let's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus from silver plus\nIs is a Google a social networking platform and it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um there's going to be missed\nWhat it's going to be missed by millions of people you know this is the story that's going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise]\nReally in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run Google decided not to put an\nAd on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored post right these are both things that drives people crazy or his book so there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or\nBy Facebook into thinking well you got to have the ads you gotta have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's going on\nBut sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\nWell all the right at the top of they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't as they found that in a during ... as I understand that during their on auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical vulnerability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that were that were um theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that a lot of stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation\nAnd they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place\nUm and ah it would've been a lot better all around if they had\nIn the meantime all of us who've been using Google Plus all these years of trying to find other places to go we're experimenting with other things and I'll mention that there the Google commercial version of cocoa puff which operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a

peers say and your colleagues would you wrote this book did it surprise them\nA great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very right here that uh but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people parked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy pre cognition telecast psycho couldn't he says you you of course we learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nSo the computer will vary that picture shown sometimes it's a violent picture sometimes at the picture of a peaceful landscape like a mountain or river want something that wouldn't arouse the body\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect think Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture show\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on the system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chose videotapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in pre sentiment experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no cycle Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRights again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world\nWhat I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that have been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also looked at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that\nMatter the classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes in fifty percent ones over time\nWhat the experiment does it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more ones and zeroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd in ... people have that ability growing up\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton studies where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world around event that we know\nAre produced heightened emotions and nine eleven as one example where we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant ... basically at a at a single moment\nThat we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike\nAt nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event yeah before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr a yellow her you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did\nFor ... she had the ability to bend spoons and keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who say doll which trickery its magic but the new people believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and or\nCan it be taught in cycle can ... be taught\nWell I've heard of of spoon bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked\nInto it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nBending metal for example and early ... as an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw ... than spoons\nSo there are many people who have suggested that this is real um but a side note on your a gal her very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I include in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons pending it's in the context of remote viewing abilities and what they say again this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching him closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo you know there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that studies were run and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that found totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website and where people can get your book\nShore my website is my name mark go

game\nLast week in Nineteen fifty the Cleveland Browns played Pittsburgh for the first time in the Steelers thirty Seventeen by this week in Nineteen fifty six Don Larsen if the New York Yankees [noise] which is the person you know here in the history of the world series even better it was a perfect game\n\nWalking\nBack Margot over with us we'll get to your calls as well this hour mark the near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates\nShows that light that everybody seems to see going into that tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up to ... this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was the nation perhaps it give the into a window into a reality that we typically don't eat with our eyes I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have\nTheir in cardiac arrest ever started hated and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than at any people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nSo these are cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest come back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant\nIn cardiac arrest is severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is from doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it\nWas later found to be that the federal later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the time were being stamp and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinct gets down and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body\nThey see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body Intel's the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual study that the med school had looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce scraping his one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible drama on this topic you've learned a lot haven't you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid at Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist and immaterial left\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think there is this phenomena going I just think regarding and the ... uh where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there's no God or no devil I Would call it an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I wouldn't call it may be seeing your Laramie no space no time\nA dimension but my question to you is specifically I liked it\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded than Xanax or at antidepressants or major tranquilizers ... [laughter]\nThat chemically the brain and their work they do affect\nChemically the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical leave the brain through these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches\nThe going back to psych ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in the mind that's my first part my second\nPart of the same one question is Alzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious of the minds of those things that show and here's my question for you it doesn't show that if\nThe mine in the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the mine is connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I thought a lot about personally because we do know that there's a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's ... medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we\nKnow there's a correlation what I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however is that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness you damage the brain if you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between\nWhat's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness when what do you think mark of reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall things that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified by medical records by the UCA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks for physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nAnd in some cases the medical records are found so\nIt's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another often simply\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm On the go ahead\nHi George and yeah I have a question for your gas sure how high thank you for\nA ban on the show so I'm back in two thousand and one I experience [noise]\nI told comment was set on but it was actually six mental tell a path experiences with in one week\nI had a spiritual revelation that made me become vegetarian and and now there was no one else around no um food now animals that I was by myself and I guess I'm I I like to know people that are tell a path now you said that\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet a but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain configuration that make people more able for duty thanks\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be wiped\nThe ability to proceed something where the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has ... outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the world or an allergy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though there are localized in their individual world it's like they open up their ... and they accept water that outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir\nI'm ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing but it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately it ... me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise]\nA lot of things that I that was a I including those sightings and everything else I've been able to do

Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it the action at a distance it gets the speed of light what the fastest anything to travel and yet here we have in Haiti a connection between ... articles\nSo there are things in the frat average of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't see them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do like ugly [noise] this is open me out completely but also it's it's it's produced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on brings a whole new meaning ... things like altruism which were all neck and helping another is really a version of helping ourselves to me that this had occasions for it's her personal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again in one more time you bought your website and where people can get your book and then to upside down thinking\nThank you George my website is mark Goldberg dot com and they are K GOP E.

book by wrong collecting Maureen would more goals chronicles stories from the wrong with the young knowing the unexplained it'd be unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic transfer medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the deceased at the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which Hitler Massachusetts that she took Moreno ... wing and Guided Tour and where you used to not only understand but also controls the gift of the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult sale says\nShe's practice studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more worried about what the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a couple of the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much looking forward to the last Fifteen Years old all this happened for you\nI Know that get on my God\n[laughter]\nTell me about Cabot the official which a sale\n[noise] you know when\nYou know early on you know the high and you know\nWhen I was younger you're walking around town you know are very you know she you know and at\nThe time people welcome or with open arms or did they go oh my God there's er which\nYeah that's a great question you know many people that well let's just say that I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it\nWas a little bit of a battle between business and you know and the town at Salem and really believed in the witchcraft and I'm\nReally changed\nThe way they look at it now right now I go to town so I really worked out well\nNow you are a fifth generation psyche transfer medium that means we're talking about way back to your family you said disability ... what year who did it start with you\nKnow it's interesting because my mother never really wanted to scare me she just you know like what I that's the same um but I Would talk to her spirit and I\nAs normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to you know she told my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in the matter of physical and that spiritual realm and one day I mean she was with talking you know in their sixties she finally told me that she is you don't want Maureen\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and\nDo readings for them and she said you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio\nSo\nWould you see that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that\nUm I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so\nI never really knew her um\nBut my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDo they ever passed dome stories from one to the other but you could ...\n\nYou know the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and uh she was\nMaybe maybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true self she was very unique because that's what she said so\nThat the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me\nTo tell the story but he started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special court for class that he took\nTo try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing it and go set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would um but it's a team of individual that\nYou know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for the things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nSee one look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run and the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so\nIt's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations to people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just off the wall when you go to their house just losing it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred and investigations\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street you'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat have you conclude about what this may be are we a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think there\nWell I think\nThere are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house um there's\nDifferent you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door you\nKnow door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs\nOn you know all these out she'd have\nSomething go on in the oven like she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in soil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her oven I'm it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's\nSo after a few minutes I'm thinking oh my God this is not a little girl I could feel the spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this isn't meant no it's not and he was getting adamant that you know it wasn't and I need to talk to\nUse them brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right um he leaves run up at the top of the driveway with the guy moods any rags me down on the on the driveway and he looks at me he said I Want you come back here tonight by yourself and I said well you know I really\nDon't feel it's a little girl and you've got to be careful you know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know is there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nMy best friend she yeah [laughter]\nHe said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want\nYou here and I thought oh my God I just have to get out of here so that\nThis year will be back in the moment with more coast to coast\nUs to address the

we were doing they public go centuries money for the man and I was in the\nLibrary there are a bookstore I guess it's a better word for it and I'm a member of the man came in and she told it all about uh\nHow that used to come in in the morning and sometimes they would find books in the middle of the floor and they couldn't understand why it happened so she finished their little spiel on one side and then I get up and began to talk it suicide began to speak one of the books from behind me came flying\nInto the middle of Rome in front of thirty five PC and there's no way they would just fall\nNo it didn't it was like just fall down behind the I mean as they come flying by the end like somebody\nIt was throwing them at you exactly the and like I said with thirty five people saw it I

know but that was just a wall where\n... what has for you that you know on the cases that you've been in have you ever felt that your life was in danger\nOr ... did\nNot by the by the leaving me\nAnd I first book uh goes chronicles is more goes ... is the second book on the series a marine and I did an investigation with the daytime investigations jumping called me up and\nAsked me to check out his house so I gather already you know we went to his house and the places that mess it would look like it's been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and ah so anyways uh they were pretty big ... uh in the the kind of got us for a while after we did our thing and\nUh one of ... separated me from the other one and the other one talked more rain we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and uh so he wanted Murray and come back well but that didn't turn out so if there was any fear was then

you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by\nAudio than you would bring more audio cut me so it it it varies avoiding according to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization\nThat you've come across a I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization visualization\nOr actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it a charges that they weren't really well I was ghost towns in but more while I was just doing normal stuff yeah\nI work with a lot of White House history funds for him and we do you know public goes on and that type of stuff and there are two separate occasions or one that I Do these goes to his cause I'm On the board of directors of a voice on top of a White House that we do these hard to toys and one time we were in this um [noise]\nIt's ... uh like an observation tower where it's a square building with glass all around you and ... windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred sixty degrees and there's one daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them doing my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman\nA walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the law the side of the wall you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself and she came and they didn't want her to miss anything so I stopped and waited for like I saw her continually walk all the way to do it and I waited and waited\nAnd yet nobody came in so finally I said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there\nBut yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no one there and oddly enough\nThat ... is with the coast guard 'cause it's on the coast guard base\nA coast guard reports and women walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing I'm an I'm perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public a ghost town on uh what Iowa light hosts and benefit pool meal\nMain we're in the White House ah keep U.S House it was on the um renovation at that time we were sitting on the picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen I'd look towards the kitchen my service dog all across the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the there was no\nThere's no sounded out so I jumped up and meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd when the dog the dog was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to the woman she says right would you see it I just I saw a dog she says ... to describe it sure absolutely SARS clear as day and I described the dog she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a white housekeeping here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so all the White House keepers afterward took care of them until the dog actually died in ... I don't she says the dog you describe pretty much matches\nBecause he has a dog that that of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean his\nThings that I'm really not looking for goes but it's certainly saw it would appear to me as a ...\nMinute still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back in both the euro will take phone calls next on coast to coast am runs ... of course is linked up at ... dot com and their latest book is called more ghost chronicles and\nFind out more about tonight's guess log on to ... dot com\n\n[laughter] we walk\nWhat's going on rock and roll lovers Sandy ... what are we thinking back his wings in rock and roll history in Nineteen sixty four with the beach boys recording dance dance dance with Glen Campbell playing the lead guitar intro would go on to become their wealth us\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy two James Brown handling these much of his audience by meeting with President Richard Nixon in the White House in endorsing him in his bid for reelection this week in Nineteen Seventy six one hit wonder is Walter Murphy in the big apple than when the number one on the U.S singles tired when\nI'm the gentleman mash up just go in classical music\nThis week in Nineteen eighty one during a North American tour the Rolling Stones laid the first two nights at the Los Angeles memorial coliseum in Los Angeles the opening act was prince dressing as controversial bikini briefing trench coat ran off the stage after ten minutes do the crowd doing ... beer cans at here\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety three Nirvana entered the U.S album charge number one in utero their third and final studio album her main had originally wanted to name the album I have my cell and I want to die and this week in twenty sixteen lonsdale where you know I didn't Buckingham Palace becoming Sarah rhetoric\nWhen used breaks out we break in when you went to see gay West Germany ...

I don't know if you've seen that\nYet or no I haven't seen that yeah it has a ... it's pretty that's you're already is our number is ... ... dot com but it's pretty cool sorry about that maybe\nWe can concentrate and bring nothing down from a for doing nothing that would be good [laughter] we've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do any because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to note somewhat about a for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to know a where the cost of tree you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of ... area you might want to concentrate you your audio recordings serve\nIf for a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I tried to get too much into the details with tour of\nThe coin is for lack of it or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for ... strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question 'cause and that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know\nYou know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you to hear from people but you know they loved the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know from those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know if they want help to move on and that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nGo to the person who brings you when do they want the ghost auditor\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect from us in a in a very of the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house Clinton's is something we're not going to do it though you know or are we from someone else\nUm but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls for both of you let's go to brandy and granted big California walking to the program I brandy\nHuh hey thank you for taking my call ...\n... um yeah I had a question and I had a really really rough year after year that's probably the worst year of my life and I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see\nThe year next I mean you're being a lot better hopefully things starting to go more my way\nMaureen this would be for you\nThat's for sure yes [laughter] yes\nIt was um okay so Brandi I did pull a couple of cards for you um and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding on to a lot of hurt\nThat have been happening around you right um and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but you know and the other kind of poll is you know this was last year now are things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I Would tell you is that for you can get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that has taken place it's a learning lesson right now for you\nUm and it's time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but\nI'm calling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying um but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day change are really trying to put on a mask but you're not\nFeeling it is that correct or now a right [noise] yeah yeah okay\nSo put ... think of it this way right so
