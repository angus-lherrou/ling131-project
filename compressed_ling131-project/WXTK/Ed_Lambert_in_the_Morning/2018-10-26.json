of last year yeah\nUm and you know Julius Jones had that that was necessary to get people to run for office now Julius Caesar is making well over a hundred thousand dollars or the median household income on Cape Cod is I Want to say sixty six thousand that's for a household\nSo these politicians who are making eighty five hundred thousand last year they're not poor and buy them crying poor is an insult to hardworking families on Cape Cod\nOkay and I just wanted people to know that the amount of money they're making now eighty five to a hundred plus thousand dollars\nWe'll finding a rental

whether they put a sign up for however they do it I mean they're going to get thirty or forty people are coming in to fill out a nap in order to get in there you know\nIt's extremely difficult to get through that process and find out okay I'll take a chance on this couple you know where that guy or whatever it might be\nBut once you give them a chance the problem is it's hard to get rid of them\nYeah if they're going to screw ya right\nNow I just wanted to weigh in on that\nI I I don't know what to do about that I really don't because I a lot of people talk about that Joan and a lot of

this morning\nI said no this is way we should be doing sea ice is asking that a suspected illegal immigrant be kept behind bars after the man was charged with raping a twelve year old Milford girl\n\nTwenty seven year old out of Milford is an Ecuadorian\nEasier illegally federal immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman John mow and told the Herald yesterday that ISIS requesting that the western county house of correction where he is a remains in custody right now I'm twenty five thousand dollar cash bail to continue to hold him\nOn an immigration detain or even if he posts bail\n\nWas Ecuadorian was illegal alien was arraigned last friday and charges of rape of a child with force indecent assault and battery in a child under fourteen both are felonies\nHe's a bad guy\n... illegal alien eventually [noise] uh let her go after raping or [noise] you you don't even want to hear the view this twelve year old little kid went home\nEventually a drove or home they said and he told her a or not to say anything about it and uh I he ... he should not have done it made me sorry you did it but that's the way it goes meanwhile the kid told their mother she called the cops and this illegal alien now is are being held and\nYou see what I mean and this is the type of thing that you guys out there\nYou safe community people you've sanctuary city people that you don't want local officials like Jim Cummings or or the county lockup in in Worcester\nTo hold this guy regardless of whether he makes bailing on at the request of ice because he's an illegal immigrant\nTell me how that works\nTell me how if he puts up twenty five thousand dollars worth of cash bail and and as walking free tell me how that makes any sense whatsoever because ISIS already told you to hold him\nOn an immigration detain her\nNow what ... what my problem is here is I'm I'm trying to put my head inside your head down your sanctuary city had everybody\nBut it hasn't been found guilty\nOf it and he hasn't had his moment in in the why should we read he's illegal alien to begin with people\nHe doesn't have a right to walk free to begin with and all eyes is asking the\nWestern sheriff's

Enforcement\nFor said he agrees with birth will county sheriff Jim Cummings that under the immigration and nationality Act Section to eight seven gee the sheriff should alert ice\nThat an illegal immigrant is being held in the jail on criminal charges that ultimately turn that person over to ice and not put them back\nThe street is an illegal alien he's arrested I have no issue not just the sheriff basically turning information over the ice to basically say does this person have a family does this person of a misdemeanor against them so if that's the case they can be re changed within the criminal justice system\nHere is in favor of supporting the safe communities act which among other actions supposed the constitutional rights and due process equally for citizens of bugs citizens
