to three to one over the Yankees now we go what a Astros come to town right yeah ... that's going to be as a uh uh item to once again you know I think it's going to be a horse of a different color\nSo deserve they deserve the slow clap and honestly last night\nIt was amazing because the bullpen was perfect until they got to the closer yeah and then I'm thinking there's just no point did the whole idea of your bullpen and the fact that Kim Rowley as your best part of the ball and in your clothes are so now you're saying oh\n... you can get to that point now that we do have an ... and this guy gets in and loses his mind and almost throws the game away so now I'm concerned about that\nThere is no part of this both and that can be untouched ... ... ... I mean he used and could you know sweep than I Do now but it just doesn't feel like it's a any better than it was earlier I well\nThey celebrate I mean you know what it's good to get out of New York you know it's good to get at two wins out of New York and we when the series like short with them okay\nThat's all that anybody can hope for like you said after the fourth fourth year of uh not doing anything good luck Red Sox are playing the Astros I don't think you have a snowball's chance and eighty but good luck\nNo team is a wagon\nIt is or wagon hey look I'm Drew Brees all of a sudden now is the best quarterback in the world right or throwing the ... the most passes of any quarterback right passing yard ... passing heritage and uh\nHe uh there was a I was it was cool watching the um the response from a Peyton Manning I thought that was pretty keep a man it's a hot ticket I like the guy and now that he's out of uniform I liked the guy or right and it's rare hanging around these parts I Know but I liked the guy right I Can't stand his brother\nHis brother is a is a worse Peyton Manning is the real deal with only one interesting so not much to like or dislike right but I I thought that was an interesting response he had for Drew Brees congratulations drew and um that you know it it hit home ... somebody said to me is in the afternoon ... wait a minute wait a minute\nI said Tom Brady has just about every uh a record in the books no served as does not I mean he's a he does as far as I'm concerned he's the greatest of all time but\nUh Drew Brees got the most yard at random and then the patriots speaking as major playing at\nThe chiefs a Sunday night the chiefs are coming in five uno powerhouse Gees they look really good and they look really good how are we going to stop the quarterback is our our fence gonna come to play our defense it's going to be an interesting game Sunday night at a it's that the Gillette\nIn but it's going to be an interesting game with the chief in town\nYeah us more opinions for you as we get closer that have been inundated with Red Sox lay less\nVaried will see what's going on but that said that some of the things that are happening right now American League championship series starting when it started Friday Saturday Saturday Saturday a\nSaturday Night Saturday Saturday day\nOkay that's what's happening uh as far as it before I get into some some things that are going down right now in down in Florida bats but before I get there you know Doug brought up to ... go sign\nAnd how they had the final decision isn't this the the landmark whoever they are All right this is the landmark commission they don't have the final say All right they have an input into the uh\nAustin mayor and the Boston city council who have the final decision about the ... sign everybody now we've all seen it believe it or not the ... signs been up there for what Seventy five years or more All right\nMaybe closer to eighty years\nAnd it's been a a talk about a landmark since Nineteen forty I mean ... you know during the war for crying out loud\nAnd then it was updated in the sixties whatever it might be but it's been a landmark in Boston and really it's been a landmark for Fenway Park and the red Sox not just ... go Boston it's really about Fenway and the red Sox and everything else\nAnd I know that the bill companies uh bought up some of the buildings Dan ... a bill is a big time developer and uh\nThey uh they bought ... some of the buildings up but I I'm One of these guys let's leave the ... sign their right I'd make it or it's going to be a vote for the city council and the mayor in order to do that\nA bill wants to have the opportunity to take it out of there if if development so uh so demands I mean they may relocated I don't know they make make some kind of a deal but and I'm sure of the city council will look at it from that point of view going make any money out of this thing\nBut the people are saying and I would like to hear other people are saying that but I don't know I don't have a a finger on it but I think all the people all around Massachusetts and probably New England to well you know want to have a say on the Fenway Park Red Sox said go\nYeah and again the fence people don't want to move to buy I mean it could be wrong um it's it's kind of weird because it is a landmark but I didn't mention is during the crossover when dug it mentioned it it's also a commercial\nThing right so it's not it's huge it's and it's an interesting landmark because it's not a typical you know just uh I don't know an organic one if you want to call it like not Lincoln's face right it's just it is a commercial piece that as becoming grain and the community so I don't know if that changes people's opinion out or not but it just it's an interesting sort of twist to it\nWell the problem that we're not the problem the reality of the situation don't you agree everybody I Know bicycle gas\nHas nothing to do with the site and you know what I mean I've ... I've decided not by and said go I I don't like sit go I don't like the people behind it I don't like Joe I don't you know all the different things so I don't buy said go in and it's just that's the way it is\nThe science is not going to make me ... let me put it that way so as far as an advertising sign yeah it's great\nDoes it really work I don't know maybe for somebody has no idea what they're doing it does I don't know\nWho knows but as far as I'm concerned the ... sign can stay\nFive oh wait seven seven five nine nine eight five are toll free phone number is one eight eight eight W ex TK Ninety five one interesting and and I'll talk about Florida in a minute but one of the things about ... gas and you heard the story this morning about gas prices are through the roof\nOr well let me put it this way they're rising their guy Matt give me a little bit of a rap of what's going on with the gas prices pleased\nWith oil prices rising so our gas prices nationwide oil feeling the effects of high demand sanctions on Iran and less output ... back\nIn the past week the price of regular unleaded has risen about four cents a gallon on average according to the Energy Department in California prices have shot up ... cents a gallon in the past week because of refinery issues on top of oil prices\n[noise] when you get up into the into the stratosphere here of oil prices and how it affects you and me and everyone else you ... your ... you can you can sit there and say hey look I'm paying three bucks a gallon or three fifty a gallon I'm not paying buck Ninety or two twenty five anymore\nBut sit down and think about what it really means to you and your commute and your family and your trips to the the drug store the trips to the dump whatever it might be and what it's costing you\nThere are an awful lot of people that commute here they my commute up to Boston or take a look at it from the point of view of what it is if you if you get ... let's just say that you get an average of twenty miles a gallon for your\nCar let's just say twenty miles a gallon it's what a hundred and call it a hundred and fifty miles to Boston to back\nSeventy miles that Seventy miles back call it a day so what you're what you're talking about if you get a twenty miles to a gallon and you're going to a hundred and forty a hundred and fifty miles round trip every time you go to Boston and back it's Twenty one bucks or more\nThink about it every time you go to Boston and back it's at least a twenty dollar bill maybe more depending upon\nDeath to use high test or have you got an old clunker that only gets Fifteen miles to a gallon or you've got an SUV that makes eleven miles a week down then you're paying a hell of a lot more but that's the cost every time every time I go to the dump\nAnd back for instance in my car I listen to once again twenty miles to a gallon but I got to have high test so every time I go to the dump and back it costs me about three or four bucks just to go to the dump and back\nNine miles twenty miles ten my ... you know so think of it that way a dump run for me 'cause four bucks\nIt's expensive to throw garbage it is\nNow on top of it all they want me to recycle this and you know and it's like on the honor recycled this yeah oh yeah I don't know\nThat addict you got to consider alternatives though I mean is it worth buying the the electric car or something in the ... that it isn't no where he's at the mercy of oh heck\nNo it's not I mean and you know you it's not only OPEC though it's supply and demand the but they're basically three things go into its supply and demand commodities and the value of the dollar ... because of the value of the dollar is is skyrocketing then all of a sudden the gas prices will come down\nAll right thanks for the call my take it easy [noise] I mean ... the most expensive thing I can think of nowadays to go to a Red Sox game then then now you're now you're in then my now you're talking about hundreds of bucks just to get in and out but large matter of fact let's go to Senator Tom how're you doing this morning\nAny you sound like a cheap skate today I Am\nI mean you know when you win the lottery you won't have to worry about all this let's\nTravel gosh no other though I'll have my own limo in the driveway\nI I Know you already have plants re a helicopter pad and the ugly [laughter]\nI was just going to mention and going to see the red Sox\nUsed to be that hot fairly close to the you know within a quarter mile for like twenty bucks\nYeah one of the gas stations right\nRight and then the gas station stop selling gas because they are making so much money park and then it it it hits forty\nAbout three years ago and this is just first standard game just a regular season game was forty bucks to park in those areas now with this series coming up\nYou can see anywhere from eighty to a hundred bucks to park their now\nI'm not surprised I'm I'm not surprised at all I mean they're it's supply and demand with these though with a series coming up right now you're probably right God ... a heavyweight\nYeah any way quickly what we should do is take the limo up and we'll sit up in the ex gay uh she bought an avid anti immigrant and look at this that goes dying\n[laughter] ... that's expensive but that you use right that's probably what it's going to go to seven thirty time for the news I met

that to uh to our traffic guy\nLet me just ask you a crazy question speaking of a traffic just very quickly west to main street\nWas a parking lot yesterday apparently\nAnd ... and in Hyannis you know going from like the rotary all the way up\nTo the high school or even the lights at strawberry hill what the hell was the cause of the problem I mean he was somebody was telling me even if you're taking an alternative route go down by the\nThe water and swing around you know incentive they'll be drone couldn't do that to either cops were down there keeping everything closed what was going on west main street causing the\nTraffic yesterday morning it was huge I didn't know was there an accident there\nUm I haven't heard or ... or a traffic I talk about anything that happened but it was a huge back up in a problem for hundreds of people trying to get a trying to get into town on west main street and and it's I don't know if you've heard anything about it uh but it was a it was really a pain in the neck\nAnd uh like I said people trying to take an alternative route or were still stopped and said no you got to go back to west main street get around this way I don't know you don't know what I'm Talking about math because you're not familiar with the area probably\nWell I'm not usually heading in that direction um I Know in on main street you know heading toward you know back toward Yarmuth um they'd be having a lot of water work you know you've seen the hydrant and things like that and that's going on for weeks um but I don't think that's anything close to what you're talking

type of thing or the companies they're all at all if you are a lot of water they don't have anything left never mind your big box stores\nSo when it comes down to as we know how long these storms are

and we're talking about ... miles that's where Michael is heading right now and after they get through the island as they call in Panama City beach island after they go through the island is another inlet and then Panama City is right there that's going to get hit too\nSo it's really in your mind don't think of Panama City beach as a as a ... beach or as a ... call those beach or something like that it's like\nUnbelievable tourist area unbelievable build up a population in restaurants and gas stations in stores and and places people live and ... it's huge\nOkay so that's what that's what's going to get hit by Michael heading right towards it and then it goes in one after that but down and said you know I think you need to remember that many many\nTimes these folks about evacuating have no choice if you're in a lower economic situation they may not have the money to leave those with pets may have no place to\nTake them there are many many people\nInterviewed in the Carolinas who couldn't or didn't leave because of economic reasons they couldn't afford to drive several hundred miles and stay for several\nDays in a hotel and some people just didn't have any cars\nIt could be the comments that they're making down there and we've been through this before I Will just hunker down or simply different ways to convince themselves and others are they're going to be OK those less fortunate than us often have limited choices you know done it that's an excellent point\nAnd for the for an awful lot of people even getting out of the Carolinas as you said\nTo drive a couple of hundred miles you know with the kids were the car full as best you can or maybe ... dad had to take one ... mom had to take the next car now you've got two sets of gas and everything else and then you've got to go find a motel\nYou know some great westerners some uh will keep the light on for you and stay there for three or four nights at the cost of eighty Ninety a hundred bucks just for the room nevermind food and everything else\nYou're talking about Macs and your credit cards and everything else that's what's happening so it's a good point on it and that's why they're there they push the shelters wherever\nThey may be you know get to the shelter bring your dog bring your pets bring your cat and I and I carry a you know the carry on thing bring your ah emotional support animals like squirrels\nWith you dump dump\nShake your head squirrels there was a grows our emotional support you know the the one of the airlines I forget which one it was a big deal yesterday they kicked a woman off because she wanted to come out with her a squirrel which is one of those emotional support things\nThey say oh well if it was domesticated I guess that's okay right oh there's no such thing as a domesticated squirrels oh you can domestic ... domesticate none nothing I have domesticate a raccoon I've seen people domesticate Fox I've seen him do it with ... ally in right now I Am then\nOkay they said no to the squirrel and she got all ticked off and I'm probably gonna be a lawsuit who knows but that's what I mean Donald is that you know you can you can take these that's why they have the shelters\nFor the people that I don't have a way to go how can I go I don't have the money what am I going to do with my shit so you know that type of thing\nSo the shelters are the only other ways and some of those as they said done it to your right some of those they can't guarantee because of the storm surge and everything else but at least it's\nSomewhere well yeah shelters the next best bet but pets definitely complicate that if they're not allowed so you know what do you do you leave the pets behind I don't know that sort of a a moral choice I guess you know what it is\nThat that's that mad is\nFor an awful lot of people that's that's family they can't do it\nThey can't do it and uh whether it be the or a year rag doll cats or whether it'd be your you know ... whatever the dogs that they can't they're part of the family they're not going to let the dog die or the cat die no I mean I can see letting a bird die\nWell no I Can't I mean some people with them a

Thanks Mike\nI'm not going to start killing people but I'll be damned if I'm going to listen to someone come up to me and threaten my wife grandkids or anybody that's in my car because I'm white because I Want to go straight through an intersection and they don't want me to because they are the mob not going to happen\nSo if you actually uncover the polls were actually at about twenty to twenty five percent at thirty percent among or somewhat likely voters\nAnd the pollsters thing that everyone is stupid and they don't do mathematics so we're doing extremely well in our entire campaign has been a ground campaign with excellent social media\nUm it's much more efficient campaign then you know taking twelve million dollars millions of dollars from people and that's the way we should be running our country frankly in a very uh economical way\nWhat you're saying about the polls shave it is you're giving yourself a a huge uh jumped from the uh the Boston Globe or the other polls that are out there right now because of of how you're interpreting the mathematics and who the people are going to be vote what you're saying is at the end of the day\nThat you are going to be up there and the twenty five thirty percent of all voters\nWe are at thirty percent if you look at actually the boss and stuff like pollen that'd be a problem as obese pollsters for far too long people have given a no one looks at the map\nPeople don't know division ... very simply put a so if you actually look at the polls it should be your favorite how many people are favorable divided by what how many people know you\nOK fry yeah people don't know you that's an in determinant\nNumber so when you actually do the error correction worked thirty percent among somewhat likely voters they have a a sports team to the polls are and no one has questioned them on this because I I don't think\nMost politicians even though mathematics anymore so we're right\nNow at thirty percent among somewhat likely voters who they do not believe will ever come out in a in a midterm election so are a movement is getting people out were unlikely voters somewhat likely voters to come out and those people are never even sampled in the polls\nSo it's basically a completely ... oh let me ask you rake picky about\nIndependence okay let's forget about the ... take all of your knowledge ... and and then we'll get into what you stand for but all of your knowledge about this that and the other thing with all the degrees at the end of the day All right let's assume that you and Jeff deal split the vote against war and would you go along with that said just for the hell and now it's like\n... it's it's a complete nonsense a thing as a drug deal with that up by Charlie Baker to take away votes from us that's Jeff deals purpose he's not the Trump chairman you lie to people all across the state thing is the Trump chairman and is likely a criminal violation what he's done misusing the Trump brat and I think everyone should make that correction we've published a website called rat\nGeoff Diehl dot com which puts the five back every Trump or sitting out\nIn fact if you look at what deal is actually doing is he exist to become the next lieutenant governor that's the deal you're stuck with Charlie Baker\nHe has no intention of being worn and war and promote him as a Trump chairman and all this other stuff when you actually endorsed Charlie Baker and we're the real threat to Elizabeth Warren and anyone listening should not even consider voting for Jeff because he's a fake Trump or\nAny ... of the Democratic party and Charlie Baker just suck votes away from someone like me that's why he exist\nSo the bottom line of this whole thing she but from what you're saying is that Elizabeth Warren is going to win it's just a matter of how much she's gonna win by\nRight now I'm not saying that I'm saying we're the one who\nYou can get well well well you just you just telling me the gym deal as you said he is the is the er the anti whatever but he's still going to walk away with a substantial number of voters you only got ... twenty six twenty seven days left and how do you you know you haven't convince people yet to get rid of Jeff deal you guys are going to split oh a lizard been sworn going to be the next senator well\nCommonwealth ... at the entire model is based on listening everything you've list that I Know is listening to people who aren't even elected to office\nCalled pollsters okay and remember the mistake that was made with Trump\nUp until ten days before the election WBRC was saying that uh that Hillary Clinton was going to win by twenty seven percent if I remember um these pollsters thing they're they've essentially hijacked American democracy in a midterm election the typical model is to point three million people\nVote and Ninety percent of them are very likely voter but when you have a candidate like me who has not appeared\nOn the scene in Nineteen thirty ... the last time an independent honor roll was on the ballot\nSo it's a completely different dynamic and when you change the dynamic like that it's total uncertainty in the mid term Elizabeth Warren is so afraid of us and so is the Republicans that they're keeping me off a debate states think about that\nWe got twenty thousand signatures sixty percent of the people we represent and I hate to say this that dark skin American is not allowed on the debate state\nOh ... don't play the race card she went out and you don't have to know become a way it's\nNot only a dark is among but I have dark matter which I've waited about it all the people who do not get accounted for in any election five\nPoint five million people are uh uh uh you know\nI can vote for point five million people registered to vote three million people only vote in a presidential only to a point three million people vote in the mid term well we're bringing out all these other millions of people who typically do not vote ads I call that dark matter and most of the universe is made up of dark matter right and that is not\nIncluded and I don't mean racially in\nI Know but ... the election hey look you know as well as I Do see but you're a smart guy when you say dark matter\nPeople aren't thinking about dark matter like ... people are talking oh this is a racist thing and well ... what we have to discuss about race as I'd like you are Democrats don't want to put a ... you're giving the American people more brains and they have ... come on the right people are not going to sit there and analyze last like you do\nIt in the twenty four election five\nGuys were allowed on the debate phase three independent in the governor's race why is she even not allowed on the debates\nDay do you think it's OK the Republican not under the ... states know the Republicans\nDidn't get the reason you're out as an independent right now are you originally registered to run as ... wait a minute why might not on the debate\nI'm a ... he was paid two hundred a gay and both Jeff deal and how we car\nShould be apologizing to me because they're so concerned about cabinet in my case was outright dismissed by women who have done this to other people and and what they should talk about as wide Charlie Baker stunned does not have a mug shot and ... and why Jeff deal is endorsed Carly Baker the guy who assaulted a woman on an airplane no mug shot nothing so what they have is\nOne rule fraud there's another another rule for everyday people okay you're you know you want to clarify that okay
