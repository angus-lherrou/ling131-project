{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "Let me explain first what's the difference between them owning this property as tenants in common\nAnd them owning the property as joint tenants with right up survivorship\nTwo very distinct ways to own property and you will see this by looking at the deed go look at the deed you will see it\nRight on there as to how you own it with your other family members or siblings or whoever you own it with ... here's the difference\nAs tenants income and the three of them one dies vote one third owned by that deceased sibling will now go according to the state plan of that to see siblings\nSo if they've done a will that leaves everything to their spouse siblings you are now going to own one third of this property with your brother in law mhm\n... yeah that's what's gonna happen or she might have just inherited her husband doubtful and it would have went to the kids mhm her kids okay\nI get that and maybe that's the way I Would probably want it I Would want to be able to control my one third ownership interest in the property right if it were me I I Would want to be able to leave my one third to mice\n... ... and and so tenants and common if you're going to own it this way is the way to go why because if it's joint ownership with the right of survivorship then when one sibling dies\nThat one third would automatically go to the other remaining siblings survival of the fittest and yeah and you wouldn't be dissent heritage or your spouse if you're married and or your children which you probably don't want\nNo slight clean or in the first issue and you know maybe you want to make sure that your share is protected from those long term care expenses well that's where the vocal trust is going to step in\nThat you had to make sure that your your evoke about trust is drafted properly\nFortunately for all of you taught is right near brand new guy that gives you the information you need to determine whether something has been drafted properly it's his brand new guide for the month of October it's designing and income on the air evoke about trust and it will really be a good starting point for all of you to understand what should be in your trust\nWhat should not be in your trust in how these trucks operate in your day to day basis\nCall right now to request you're free copy of Todd's brand new designing come only revoke about trust guide eight six six eight for he five six nine nine that's eight six six\nEight for a five six nine nine or visit our website legal exchange show dot com to download your free coffee\n[noise] so what else are some of the issues that bother me with this arrangement okay well one I probably wouldn't own it\nOther than tenants in common I wouldn't even know when it that way at least not the rental the rental I Would immediately jumped to the idea of owning an L. L. C.\nRight maybe not the vacation property but the rental property why because if it's a rental property and three siblings zone and if somebody gets hurt on that property they are going to sue three people\nOh I didn't even think of that and all of their own personal assets they\nHave families and yeah you know they remember this isn't the siblings only ask that this is just one of them they might have their own home their own IRAs their own four O. one K. is their own investment accounts bank accounts yeah that's a problem that's not a problem for the creditors that's a really deep pocket for the already\nIs three D. pocket\nThree deep pockets so putting it in an El Al see would be my first thought and each of you guys could be a one third shareholder of the yellow sea that way the liability when the lawsuit comes for the tennis\nThey will sue the company and not you personally huge difference is that\nThe the three of them a shareholders what if they are concerned about protecting from long term care cut their individual area bill will trust be one of those shareholders\nSo now moving past the El Al see discussions Susan let's say\nAgain where would the shares of the yellow sea go the shares of the yellow sea would go into this irrevocably medicate trust them from hotel actually if if that's\nIf that kind of planning works for them right I mean if you're self insured and you have enough other assets you know you may not be doing a medicate irrevocably trust\nBut you certainly would put those shares into a revolt couple family trust yes but let's let's assume you're right let's assume they they want to protect their assets not only from the creditor of the slip and fall tennis\nBut from the nursing home well then there's Medicaid irrevocably trust comes into play and we put the shares in and they put all their other assets in ... into their own respective irrevocably trust so what does this do\nFor the Senate and common idea it's still allows each family took control where's their third of the property goes mhm\nNot to the other siblings yeah well that's good it avoids probate also good it's going to help them reduced their pro or their estate tax liability if any also good\nAnd most importantly it will get the clock running so that if one of them get sick and go in a nursing home it will protect the assets from the nursing home\nWhy that's so important and you don't think about it as much when you're doing just your family planning this actually impacts other families because if you don't do it the planning and one sibling goes into the nursing home\nThe other two siblings who are not in the nursing home yet\nThat asset that they own what the one third\nOwnership of the sibling who is in the nursing home is at risk because the nursing home they're going to now tell you\nSiblings that are are healthy by this out or lose it to ... now there's some sibling exceptions that can work here but in any event you have now jeopardized the other siblings ownership interest in the property and of course you're put at risk for your own\nUh children your own family as to losing it for them so yeah\nLots of issues when your own property like to steal your\nPlanning folks don't just roll the dice and not only are you putting your assets and risking your spouse's assets that you can be putting your siblings at risk as well\nCall right now Todd has written a guide for the month of October it's designing and income on the air evoke about trust and it will be a great starting point for you if you're trying to educate

forty five six million I don't feel a year ago today an eight six six eight for a five six nine or downloaded right now from our website legal extreme showed dot com\n\n\nInstantly this from ABC News sign on over there on this\nOf course now has nine justices Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in last night President Trump is celebrating\nWe have a great new Supreme Court justice and he's got to be there for many years\nBut what we call her adoption program is adoption forward and basically what it is is we're having a conversation with that potential adopter we're just finding out what type of lifestyle they have and it's just a general conversation so it's actually a very simple honest process\nGrudge you need to be sure they have the space they have the wherewithal to feed them and all that good advice because sometimes I think people will go out and adopt an animal without a great deal of forethought and say gee I look at the land I have here I Need a dog or three [laughter]\nThey just go out and get them to get the dog home is is I wouldn't but this is a lot more than like barking for what happens if and when that happens well\nWhat we try to do ahead of time is to have the conversation and just you know find out things and just try to educate them and hopefully we can get all that information out in the front and then we can decide what pet would be the right selection for them okay so you helped him ... yes are you involved in matching them up\nAs a matter of fact when we when we get new animal then you know we give them a little chance to settle in and then we evaluate\nThem medical and behaviorally at us a lot of information as to what home would be appropriate for them so we have someone come in and they are looking for certain maybe energy level or certain type of behavior for lack of than we can direct them towards an animal that would be appropriate for them\nSo you're a behavior ... with animals\nI Am not a behaviorist but I Do have a good knowledge of animal behavior so I basically oversee that\nWe're getting on all of our animals in and settled and evaluated in a timely manner and also making sure that they're getting as much in Richmond and just enjoyable time as it can be you know during their stay in the shelter so that they're not just bored and everyone has the\nThe preconception that sheltering is sad and doesn't have to be so we try and give them as much play time in Richmond and one on one time this weekend so that that will make their stay more enjoyable and also make them more adoptable thinking\nThe boat and I think particularly older folks who might be alone so people are thinking about having an animal what kind of thing should they be\nThinking about I think one of the most important things to consider is your\nSchedule and your lifestyle or are you at work a lot what type of animal would best match with that you know if if you or for instance only homemade hours a day a dog might not be the best option unless you had someone that was going to be helping you care for that animal and even many cats may not\nMatch up depending on the cat you know some pets require quite a bit and other things you know do you have any allergies you know we can help steer you away from certain types of animals\nAnd and then if you want a dog like Ron said his lifestyle are you looking for a dog because you like to jog three miles a day or are you looking more for you know one dog likes a little stroll around the block and then just wants to be on the couch with you that type of thing so we want to talk about all those different things to\nBecause we want it to be a great match you wanted to hopefully be forever match but if it's not that's okay too and if it didn't work out\nYou know we look I'm not sure of Stephanie you've folks have something coming up today and a legend gentleman's voice you'd have to get the ah reading material because there is something going on this afternoon that will help wild here what is that\nThis afternoon from Florida the M at Galapagos which is on a six say in Orleans we are having what we call wise crackers trivia I'm so ten dollars at the door and gets you appetizers there'll be a cash bar we have a silent auction and we have wildlife trivia\nSo no your trivia because no you're wildlife I should say because you can wind up to two hundred and fifty dollars in gift cards and it also supports while care\nOr just to shoot the inside of my liberal part trying not to\nLaugh [laughter] wise quicker [laughter]\nWho came up with that that would be you\nYou know I don't think I'm the owner and a Donna ... came up with that it always perfect\nOkay and this take place from four to six that's correct okay and uh people can drop in any money raised goes to you folks\nYes and you can just drop and you don't have to RSVP\nOkay we'll come back to the folks show or if you didn't catch all of that we will come back and make sure you are up to speed

Cod\nUm it's basically people come together a great food drink great beer and support several different local organizations and this year knock the disposal um added us we are recipient of a portion of the proceeds because the first time I\nKnow it's been um I think this is the fifth year now while yes a huge honor for us\nGreat and and how much do you normally benefit\nFrom ah last year on they gave us a thousand dollars well great yes ... ... feet a lot of animals yes they were on a lot of squirrels\n[laughter] uh nuts [laughter] um\nSo let's talk a little more about things that might be going on with the animal rescue league what kinds of things would you like the folks to knows more than\nA to come and see us [laughter] we're lucky to have your lane we [laughter]\nLocated on routes exam Brewster ... and we're open Tuesday through Sunday from one to six thirty for adoptions and that we're looking for volunteers need help\nWe're we're in the building or early in the morning 'til evening and we have many many volunteer shifts available so people want to just come in or they can go on our website fill out an application\nOr we're looking for all sorts of volunteers to be a friendly a person in the kennels smiling and helping clients who are looking at pets\nSometimes they want to do administrative were sometimes we need help with cleaning um we're also looking for more volunteers to help foster some of her animals that come into our our shelter that aren't are not ready to be available for adoption yet may because they're too young\nMom with kittens kittens without mom so there's a lot of different opportunities available and we'd love to have a lot more volunteers 'cause they really help us do what we do an orderly way language Stephanie volunteer oh absolute or they're huge they're huge what is the website a are real Boston died or\nOK Errol Boston dot org books and uh [noise] this is a great\nArea for volunteer you know I've I've always been pressure as I've talked with so many of the non profits over the years above the fact that people respond the the people like animals here on the Cape particularly ... is a big animal fun area\nIt's a it's a great place to live if you love animals and um we have such great community support and I'm I'm sure wild hair does as well um there's many wonderful nonprofits on the Cape and and we're we're very fortunate to be one of them\nAnd um we just love spreading the word about everybody and uh we uh worked with while care very closely actually had to call them yesterday\nBecause there was a snapping turtle crossing route six say and fortunately some good Samaritans stopped on we help to snapping turtle across the way and it was on our lawn for a couple of hours not sure what it wanted to do so I gave a ring over to while care and spoke with Amy\nAnd I learned a few things um I guess snapping turtles may still lay their eggs in late summer but right now is a little unusual\nSo she was probably looking for a pond to hibernate\nAnd uh so it was it was fun it was enjoyable and we helped or we hope to get there [laughter]\nBrutally good things similar to stop their car and get out and so it was wonderful 'cause we're like in a panic we saw it outside the window and we're trying to run outside and we're like no yeah and yeah and yeah people there's a lot of caring people on Cape Cod absolutely so\nThe animals that come into you Stephanie are passing through you're not a an adoption agency per se\nThat's correct um so the animals that are brought us our goal is release um so we don't accept cats or dogs those would go to the animal rescue league actually today someone came to the door with for chickens\n'em and fortunately we were able to find their home I'm so they didn't have to go to the animal rescue league um but it's it's strictly wildlife that we care for\n... for for injured and so forth right oh no you need volunteers as well to volunteer to do with you\nWe always need volunteers and we could not live without our volunteers\nUm so we need volunteers to help in our clinic which is basically you know our wildlife emergency center\nAnd what they do is cleaning and diet ... and they eventually learn how to feed squirrels and baby birds and it's a very hands on volunteer opportunity there's a lot of cleaning and I won't lie down people sick with it they get to do a lot more with the animals and salvage\nStart out as a way yeah it's\nIt's all part of it the job in the care of the animals\nWell cared for the animals even volunteers are committed they have animals at home they know the the procedures that have to be done [noise] they'll dogs catch what what's the most popular forces mules dogs\nEagle might be a challenge little that's one animal\nThat we don't usually asked her volunteers to go out and rescue [laughter]\nChallenging I Would think they need some special handling\nWell that brings the program and I want to thank Stephanie hello Suzie executive director of wild care\nAnd she's also a wildlife rehabilitate or in that way of Sandy is Edgar loopy and Veronica Sacramento who are with the animal rescue league of

to to cut them back or to do that they are pretty low maintenance so you know yeah cutting back not going to really hurt you or by doing that especially going into the season where it's just going to be\nJust a real cool cold they're going to go dormant that type of thing [noise] um yeah so it wouldn't hurt if you don't cut them back\nWell you know [noise] I Would say I I Would definitely Burnham I'm almost ... about like six inches at this point okay um [noise]\n... your biggest one is to really do the the the spring pruning that to your best to get the best flowering um\nThat's when you want to do uh the sixth sense is the best um so ... they're going to be about six inches an early spring and then you're going to do that that second a pruning in July\nUh-huh ah those are the the most important uh pruning for them on TALK daisy so if you don't get I get around to doing any of the cut back at this point that'd be fine to it's just\nI'm going forward make sure you get those those um that spring and then that July ... back to make sure you get the the plant the way you want it that can that\nCompacted version of it's a smaller version or so it doesn't get out of hand or you want the the leaves to be closer together on the stems\nNot had read out or when it's spread out is just being forced to much ah looking for water that type of thing I'm\nOK spring and a and July or the best time could prone\nHandles that now you can do that right now like I said I'm ... now\nWell see you want to do it after the flowering all done you you want to wait and have you know enjoy the plant do everything and to win you know enjoy it while it's here\nBut like I said that the bigger pruning a times for a month talk daisy is that springs that our earlier springs and then around July Fourth fish I'm packing them back a bit um and getting it cut back to compact that plant a little bit\nAnd you're not really trying to ah make some divisions of the ... to five years because after three to five years the plant starts to over a crowd so central to die out if you have too many shoots of it\n[noise] so that's usually down around July as well so that would be part of your pruning back at that time so those are the two most important times to be doing it in my opinion\nOkay Patrick thank you very very much I appreciate it\nNo problem in a good luck guy in the future with those

less and less you think that you need to it needs to be a bigger plant a bigger pot the one thing I'd look at 'em so\nTake a look at the soils that there\nAre in the in the plant I Want you to take the the ball because it is sticking up from the ground a bit like I Want you to pull out it from the pot and see if it's really tied in there or if the soil is loose [noise] um if the soil is loose you do not need to replant it or anything along those lines\nYou want to really I'm\nJust leave it be but if it is very tight you could replant it\nThat being said at this point it's really doing

wanted to wait a little bit more time to see the kind of time it uh correctly you could wait another couple of weeks\nOh I got real big to lean on it already\nWhich is which is perfect um the thing you want to do is when you want to start to see those those shoots coming out the flower buds that when he stopped fertilizing you don't want to fertilize at that time a because you've given

for a little bit here and I want to\nI Want to answer all the ... or questions for a ... do you have a question about ... what was your question\nI don't know what I like them or not good for the prize last year I cut in a lawn yep burning fat All right\nYeah so it's actually one of the things you want to do is it's usually right after um the first frost is when you want to bring them in on you want to have a little bit of die back on the the Dahlia itself is this is what I'd like to see him do\nSo that first frost happens you're gonna see a little bit of the foliage is going to as kind of black and a little bit and you're going to cut off\nAll the the plant except for about two inches ... all the way down to the ground and what you're going to do from there as you're going to dig up the tumors um\nDig up you know root ball decent size or you can get all the tumors and the the roots that are there what you want to do is you want to actually then from that root ball leave it out a little bit to dry for a few days on earth where it's not going to get hit by the frost\nAh so you know\nMaybe it's under a deck um it's kind of out of direct direct sunlight but you want it to dry\nYou know usually we think of the sun's gonna dry stuff out quicker but we want to keep it out of that direct sunlight I don't you don't want it to dry out too quickly I saw frost free area\nHuh once it's a dried out for a few days you want to try and shake out as as carefully as you can any of the excess soil that type of things kind of get rid of the soil that's on it 'cause you just want the tube or itself\nThen you're going to put them in some sort of like ventilated boxer or a basket that type of thing place them in there with that as you have done with peat moss or you can use like a slightly moist in sand or for Mickey light\nAround and those three any place in in a cool dry location where the temperatures are going to stay around forty five fifty five keep it in that that that section or you don't want it to get too warm you don't want it to get too cold huh\nThe one thing you want to make sure is you're going to actually have to periodically water through the winter\nI don't get a little water over at\n... that's exactly what I Want you to do I don't want you to be you know\nTaken a hose and watering them this is more of like you can actually miss those\nThat you know the the ... the tumors are slightly\nAnd it's really one of the things you're doing is you're checking on them so they're not trying out but you're also checking for any of 'em that are rotting out to get rid of any of that um so once they they kind of go into that period of some of them you can easily just you know break apart if they're rotting seeking taint the others you don't want the right to you\nTo just go to everything else um so that's one of the reasons why you periodically check on it\nUm you know it's it's probably every couple of weeks it's not like an everyday type things um you know until you kind of get the hang of it uh it sounds like you've done it before but um until you get the hang of like okay it's going to take about two weeks in this time for it to dry out I'm gonna check every two weeks or you check every ten days\nIt's kind of a process that you kinda have to\nFigure out on a case by case basis of it depends on the you know the temperature if it's if it's sticking more in the fifty five degrees and sometimes gets a little bit warmer they might try out a little bit quicker and they might be trying to actively grow a little bit you want that cool temperature like I was saying that forty five fifty five degrees\nIt's it's kinda the same thing with dealing with an morale is is giving up that dorm and see period a lot of ... to ... want to have that dorm and see period over the winter a couple of months of it so that I can rebuild for the next year and come back better than ever\nOh okay what kind of like ... like I I don't know I used a bone ghetto right kept putting the whole planet ...\nOh yeah project you can be using that that's not a problem\nUh and then from there um during the season you could use like a garden tone ... ah that would be great to to fertilize it a few times you could go with some of the liquid fertilizers er during the growing season when it's got a lot of the leaves and it has a starting to bloom or\nYou could look for a heavy a balloon booster type fertilizer what that would be as if you look at the three numbers they're on any fertilizer that middle number\nBeing the highest of the three is

knowledgeable and I'm Will truly be messed\nThings um [noise] um I have spoken\nTo your dad I'm\nBefore one of his last broadcast that I had a situation where I had a lot of crop grass on my front lawn\nAnd he has suggested to get ... glass grass killer app to lay down probably two maybe three um springs to make sure you kill all the crab grass which I had done and I'm approximately\nSeptember the twenty fourth I lay down new grass seeds fertilizer and I put that up to the lair topsoil and um the\nGrass is growing very nicely but there are some places that are still kind of beer and other places that are kind of family a growing\nAnd I like to find out is it possible to step on the grass at this point the time it's only got about two and a half three weeks since the ... started I step wanted ever received those areas\n...\nDefinitely out there and do that I'm usually so its grassy depending upon the areas um\nIt takes about fourteen to Twenty one days maybe twenty eight days for a fee to grow um I like to look at it it's been how is the twenty fourth so we're looking at two weeks already\nI'd definitely get in there and put more see down multiple Sufi\nOn the grass is welcome to destroy theloop close who I\nKnow I'm ... at this point is starting to come up and be fine what I'd like to see you do is just not spend a ton of time on their obviously just had over everything with the spread her um that you've done maybe\nYou know I Would do the whole lawn not just those areas that haven't hit something\nBecause what I like to to say is if there\nIf there's nothing on the ground and you don't put any seed down there's there's nothing with leaves to compete with the weed seeds that are there so that's why I like to put down seed and that that goes for any time of the year a lot of people will say excuse me [noise]\nDon't put grassy down in the middle of summer yes ideally don't put grassy down in the middle of summer but if you have an area that you've you've killed off and it's just bare if you don't put any see down one of the week is going to compete with\nThat I'll be ... that's one of the reasons why won't you do to the whole law not just those little patchy areas\nBecause you might just get\nSome new growth in there and the other areas some could fade some could not do as well I like to see everything covered a and just and re done so it's been two weeks I think you should be fine you do not have to put another starter fertilizer down do not if you put one down because that will last for about six to eight weeks\nI Would definitely look at it in a in a few weeks maybe\nUh the end of October\nAnd see if you know if you're starting to see some of that growth I'm seeing those areas that are filled in\nUse like a a step for or application for a fertilizer like your winter riser again or to help it through the winter or almost it's like a five or application process\nUm that fertilizer will help put the the roots to bed helped put the shoes and everything collect them and make sure they're taking care of\nSo I can go to a store to get a application for fertilizer\nI mean I personally would go to a local garden center but you can get them anywhere um you can you can even go on line or we have a great sponsor a natural alternative\nThat will actually if you call them and tell them what you've been doing they'll get some of the right formulation for you um and remind you when to fertilize going forward that's pretty cool thing to do that you know you might not have from a box store\nUm that being said putting fertilizer down in the in the fall is just going to help you for next year um if you just put fertilization put fertilizer down in the spring a couple of times and then don't do anything every year you're almost starting over\nA ... that's why I like to see the five step process it really really does a more for your lawn and and that type of thing [noise]\nSo the application for as long as you put that out again at the end of October\nAbout October beginning November as long as out of the ground hasn't completely frozen but it's definitely something to do a ... process [noise]\nAnd and one quick last question two and a half to ... just for the older the dirt and just leave it there and be as if I get up a blow to destroy the world and definitely Angela\nOkay\nHere's the latest from ABC News I Want

five six six zero four to six one again the eight five five six six zero four to six one I Want to go right back into the phone lines and answer some questions for you this hour or Nathan who's up next\nOverland in Massachusetts Evelyn welcome to the ... how can we help you\nPatrick I'm yeah I got another minute talk Stacey question I'm not too familiar with doing a lot of planting but last September October I bottom line talk daisy plant and it ... it\nWas either ... or ... shows me on this year it's just flowered about three days ago and it does look good did I hear you say earlier that every three to five years that can be send out yeah and how do I go about doing it around the plant and look for ... [noise]\nYeah so one of the easiest ways to do it like you said you kind of dig around the bottom of the plant and see where I'm\nDifferent plants are technically you want to look at it 'cause if you were to just stick to shovel and right from the center and just cut eye you might be cutting a lot of the good fully into the good plant\nThe montage will send out shoots off the sides and create their own plants\nAnd so those are the ones you want to send out those are the ones you can take you want to get as much as the root system as possible or you can kind of dig in the soil a little bit to see how it is but I Would almost suggest doing that in the spring\nOn not at this point in time let it go into a dormant period and have some of that because you're going to want to prune\nOr the um on TALK daisy in the spring and again in July and the spring are going to cut it back to about six inches\nOr so it's going to be focusing on re blooming read or not re blooming ... I'm ... and getting bigger that type of thing I so I Would look for that or to do it at that point [noise]\nUh okay so like it was very late this year might have been a little bit earlier last year when I bought it [noise] um so [noise] when you said in the spring and then again about what month\nSo about July uh maybe number on July Fourth think of that time period um\nYeah so basically right at the beginning of the spring um when it's really starting to warm up [noise] um that's when you're going to cut it down to about six inches um you know\n[noise] it's so some of the growth right now you're going to be leaving there if you're going to kind of let it go\nYou know so that's why you want to cut it in the in the early spring so it can ...\nAnd then you're going to give it a couple of months to to grow gets stronger and on July Fourth is used that as you know I'm a reference that when you're going to permanent again you're not going to cut it all the way back to six inches at that point\nYou're going to do more of like a pinching type\nUm cup cutting back so it doesn't go to flower at that point\nThe whole point of of flowers and plants as they want to go to seed so they can reproduce that's usually what happens with the flowers and so among talked daisy it's just like those they're going to try to create that the that that flour so that it can it can\nContinue on going forward it wants to reproducing get bigger and better so that's why that July Fourth is that pruning time or to cut back a little bit\n[noise] so if I didn't have a bloom like now it's just boiling now and I know they bloom late this is what I was told but um I start pinching around in July I Am I going to get any flowers this\nTime yet so [noise] so by pinching in July is going to push for the growth what is doing is is reinvigorate in the plant so uh all the plants have hormones in them that create a that pushed the growth forward and by pinching back that one hormone that has become the leader\nHas now become too hormones trying to become the leader he gets to the stronger plant a bigger plan so well when it is what it's doing is bigger it is the more fertilizer can take the more water can take the better it will be for you [noise] by pinching them it's going to allow you for further a growth\nIt leaves and some of the religious beliefs\nLeaves some leaves in some buds I wouldn't go like crazy like I said at an early spring one is you're crazy prune if you will held back to six year almost like oh I Can't believe I'm cutting this to what it looks like\nBecause you you're you're saying All right I kind of back about what's going to happen but that's what needs to be done in the spring and needs to have both six inches of growth\nThat will start to to ... to um produce more leaves and get bigger and better around July Fourth you kind of back a little bit and then it's going to get bigger and better again\nSo it's a it's a multiple step type process or just to get the uh those blooms at the end of September beginning of October\nOh thanks a lot I just like I say they didn't say much on the tag and now I Know what to do [laughter]\nWell good luck Evelyn it's um it's it's one of those things is great because it's such a late bloomer you get that feeling of like that summer that in the late summer even in the fall oh yeah it still feels nice to be outside and so it's the perfect it's the perfect end to the summer if you will or in the\nMailbox and some of us neighbors with a little bit of a hill and so it was it was nice coming around and yesterday and seeing flowers or you know quite a few of 'em are bloomed out and it just it kind of lifted because there's been so gray and rainy up here\nYeah no I understand completely I was we just drove through um the Berkshires and everything is turning colors you know your ear yellows and reds and and they're beautiful but looking at him you know what's next in that\nYeah that's that winter

number here is eight five five six six zero four to six one again eight five five six six zero four to six one [noise] we were on the line with\nPaula before the break in a I had her stop real quick 'cause I Want to answer the question what was your um your second question Paula\nAbout that hadn't back yeah I'd like to keep it in about ... feet high no ... well too fast and said that I came to me it often enough and\nAlso as Hedges a you're probably to keep him in a smaller area you're gonna have to burn them a few times I'm just to keep 'em compact um [noise]\nWhat I'd like to see you do is usually the pruning is done before like July fifteenth no later than July fifteenth uh it's like an evergreen type a hedge or what type of ... is it\nGoing\nSo that what happens with an evergreen Hedges if you start to prove and really right after like to live Fifteen or later um\nYou can actually get a lot of browning it dries out quicker because of the heat of the sun and you could do more damage to the to the Hedges so usually I like to see them done before July fifteenth free ease to remember date\nBefore July Fourth is probably your best time to be doing that in that way it has that that time during the summer to focus on keeping the water in it not being in that shock of being cut back\nOr you want to make sure that when you do pruning you prune backed by a third of the growth\nThat was like a third of the green not not a third of the plant or because sometimes with the evergreens or they have a very ... structure and just green on the outside the snow very thick on the inside if you were to take a third of the plant you might take all the green off\nOkay so you want to look at it as the green and go buy a third of that that's the general rule of thumb you don't really want to go more than more than that you can go to about a half but I don't recommend it anything over half your usually doing more damage to plant a very good for it so that's why\nLike Paul said I\nCan I can now\nYou could ... now because we are getting into those cooler temperatures we don't have that heat that that could be coming down on the on the uh Hedges she can print it again at this point\nA to be a good time to do it because we we do have some time before it gets real cold and really before a heavy frost when making a few frost send the next month I'm you know three four weeks\nBut that's not going to do the damage on the head you if you wanted to cut back now um but again like I said just never cut it back between that July Fourth process at a time period until about middle uh September when we get that heat that heavy heat and ... it really can affect the plant long term\nI think if a Mac and they said it had to say\nThank you qualify for the phone call enjoy the rest of your day as well [noise]\nThe phone number here's eight five five six six zero four to six once again eight five five six six zero four to six one will go right back into the phone lines are Nathan who's up next Cynthia is on the Cape Cynthia welcome to the ... garden club how can we help you\nOh I thank you very much I'm just want to say quickly that um I really enjoyed your father over the years haven't let her for a long time I just bought a house on the Cape and I turned on this radio says they don't have cable TV\nAnd your show came on and I just it was like deja vu all over again and your father really inspired me over the years to become a gardener\nAnd I live right down the street from that ... um garden center here and found that and um we just cleared a lot um it's like a fix or I'm I'm a lot of small tree that was kind of a what a lot so we have a blank slate\nSo my question is um [noise] we want to put in some sort of a low maintenance um landscape plant some trying to think of um I don't want to have a lot of fun I have about ... but I'm thinking of some kind of crafts that would be like a low maintenance brass to plant it wouldn't need\nA lot of fertilizers and water and stuff like that and then the other thing I was wondering about is\nRecommendations on ornamental grasses and tied ranges and um\nI was thinking like for screening rhododendron some of the green giant ... so I was just wondering what your recommendations might be for some of those things first thought he was perhaps\nOkay so starting with the grass um there are a couple of products out there you could use a ... premium grass seed\nAnd it has to ... it takes a little bit of time for it to establish a before it becomes low maintenance and that's kind of like the same thing with most grass seeds any ways you do have to take some time to help I'm invigorated help getting rowing and going for the for the\nFor a couple of years usually I'm\nOne of the things about the pros premium is it's less water less a fertilizer or less mowing so it's really that low maintenance lawn um but like I said does take a little bit of time but it is a good product\nOr you could also a take a look at some of the Jonathan Green products grass seed or some of the bone I'd a grassy products\nOnce those get established they actually will take a little bit less fertilizer a little bit less watering um take a look at the the products that there are some out there I Know [noise]\nBecause you said you're in film if you could go down to the store and you could get a um Jonathan Green black beauty\nGrass seed it has a deeper root system so that route system goes further down so it's drought resistant or disease resistant because it's getting out there so that's a good seemed to be putting down they have different ones on the black beauty is mostly sunny it'll take some shade a lottery then\nYeah we've taken down all these trees so yeah we remove the stumps and everything on so we have to put down some sort of a base because I'd never gotten on the Cape so the soil is completely different from back home in Framingham so yup I'm I'm going to have to have somebody bringing in like ... and I'm ... I'm\nI'm not sure exactly what to do very handy the soil here yeah so\nThey definitely want to add as much as ... as you can if you're putting a lawn down you need you need a good base to it\nBut if you could add some compost to that as well maybe what you do is you take a for the lawn you know fill it put a bunch of loomed down cover the area give yourself", "show_name": "Ed Lambert in the Morning", "year": "2018", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "07"}
