more and more about the rain coming okay so just to hang on to that and know that we're going to get it um one thing it'd be the one thing I Want to do talk about\nI Walk in this morning a mad and Joel Rose that he comes up to me did you see the photograph of the uh of uh Craig kimbrell and and uh the closer there on a game or Tuesday when the red Sox she was treating\nThe picture was treating\nAnd I said no I didn't see then he'd so we send it over to me and I pull it up and there is a a photograph of our the red Sox pitcher Tuesday night closing out the game that we barely won that he blew almost for us in the ninth inning this guy\nCheating cheating\nAll over his hand and the his ... up there's arm on top of his uh the brim of his baseball cap is is pine tar is buying pitch\nIt's covered\nThis is the sticky stuff you ever had of course in a pine tree go a pine tree and put your hand you know sticky there's that's what they're using\nAnd I said to myself I went all over everything I looked at sports stories I went on the Internet I couldn't find the thing about anybody outraged about cheating but the red Sox cheating\nNothing\nAnd I said what I mean ... pitchers had been thrown out of bowl games in suspended for cheating and here's a blatant thing of cheating that the red Sox pitchers were doing for this guy anyway during the playoffs and I I couldn't believe it and I said the mad\nJust like I'm going to say now Matt what's up with cheating and everybody knew he was cheating ... somebody in and say anything\nWith a non issue because in baseball this happens all the time that you use ... or other\nThings to get a better grip on the ball so it's against the law it's against the rules it's treating it is but it's sort of a ... it is it's a soft rule\nIt's something that's in the rule book but it's not widely considered a big deal unless the player is literally dripping in pine tar then you pretty much our reluctantly have to go out and say something\nBut he was dripping in pine tar this photograph\nYeah he has a hand you know I didn't have\nThat on its hat it's all over his in I don't care whether a dome it's cheating is it not\nUm it it really is and not in this day and age when you're throwing Ninety miles an hour you want to make sure the Patriot has control the baseball\nMajor league baseball rule eight point zero zero governs behavior for pitchers subsection NATO to clearly states quotes\nThe picture show not apply a foreign substance of any kind to the ball this means any substance spit balls are illegal the penalty for violating this rule of anything at all is a meaty objection from the game and probable suspension\nSo that's different that's a spit ball you're saying\nOh no no any foreign substance of any kind um the ball right so anything added foreign substance that modifies the surface of the ball in any way Scott sing it\nOr anything pine tar in particular is said to improve the pitchers grip and cold weather and making the ball more difficult for batters to hit and track\nIt's against my Matt ... I I don't get it\nI'm not coming off of this because if if you have a baseball and it's a it's either very humid night or it's a cold night\nThe hitters are going to want to sit there and gas where it's going to owe baloney now on I'm telling you that's the case the hairs are going to sit there and argue over this if someone is using a spit ball someone's out there with sunscreen gunk\nAnd screwing with the baseball like that and as life on it as not suppose you that's different and that's easily seen by an empire just about everybody watching the pine tar thing is nothing it's been happening for I didn't even know how long I've been watching the game\nIt's it's an archaic rule and they they have the Rosin bag out there so they can use the Rosin bag but a lot use pine tar it's just it's a very common thing because the battered youth pine tar\nBatters that's a rule they can put it on their baths right so a lot of pitchers also put out on the top of their cap or the inside of their cap or whatever it is or the back of their neck again it asked me used within reason\nPitchers are thrown out of games because of pine tar mat if it's dripping off of there now and ... dripping yeah no no I think it raining yeah and\nI've seen it happen I mean we we saw it happened with the red Sox and Yankees game this would have been like three years ago his name was Michael ... to ... got thrown out of the game yeah it was like three years ago I Can't remember the last time it's happened\nBut he got thrown out they'd be they saw pine tar on his head\nBecause he's an idiot because it was dripping off his neck\nThe one they got from what's his hat I you know what it is every one I'm I'm just surprised that that I'm not a big time baseball fan I really am not All right I mean maybe get when you get into the play offs oh okay I'll you know I'm now I'm pumped\nBut they play so many games it's a you know Tuesday night than Thursday Afternoon and double ... over here I mean at one time I Love to go into Fenway and watch the games there but watching it on TV but I but I got to tell you this this idea of you know\nThis is not deflate gate I mean this is not nonsense this is real this is pine tar gate\nAnd it happens all the time and nobody and everybody ... looks away I mean it's like steroids and everything everybody's on steroids everybody uses pine tar\n[noise] I don't get it man\nI just thought like I said I think it's been widely accepted because I think the policy let's call it that a major league baseball as they want the patriots to be able to grip the baseball in tough weather or whatever the case is\nAgainst the rules and why don't they changed the rules but I'm the commissioner step up to the plate and say look he's long as you don't use too much pine tar is fine\nYeah I just I think that's what's widely accepted right now I don't know why they haven't changed the rules of assume because it's impossible to change anything in baseball because of its or no they ... change\nRules I mean now you can walk a guy without throwing for pitcher that's that's correct yeah\nOK they change the rules all the time I don't know maybe it's me I just looked at that photograph this morning every one and I went\nYou're kidding me this is in your face cheating and everybody does it huh\nWell that's why I'm Jeanette I got thrown out of the game and twenty fourteen or whatever the heck it was\nRight and that's why I was not many stories I Am because again this is a widely accepted use by pitchers within reason\nOnce again you always go to throw in that within reason crap yeah because it has only grown now not in reason this kinda yeah you can you will get thrown out if it's so obvious it is yeah\nIt was I don't know is that picture a the the photograph is that all over the Internet or I mean if you if I can use Google Craig kimbrell photograph\nMcCain you'll get to results because again nobody cares about the sort of thing [noise]\nOkay let's go to limit by everybody cheats in major league baseball well I guess we have to live with a bright\nBy the way it is a is a interesting in my view or editorial in the in today's daily or a buddy Joe Glen is running for a county commissioner for the county assembly of delegates\nAnd it's got a a piece of the Arabs and point by point of\nOf why he should be the right one a take a look at it by the way

I hired at it's great to go into some of these other cities like Pensacola Panama City Florida and listen to the awful nations as to what's going on down there yeah event like the hurricane it's\nIt's an extra that's an excellent point Rob right get the I heard I get up and you can go right down there and find out what's happening locally [noise]\nIt's it's amazing the listen I just wanted to throw that out good\nPoint thanks Rob and Rob does not work for I heart but good good a good way of looking at things too much time if I got before we have to leave [noise]\nI'm a labor job back to the news\nWe are in Cape Cod local news authority WICK west you are much Cape Cod and I urge radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK\nHere's the latest son I'm Stephanie Ramos the sun is rising my devastation\nAnd Florida after hurricane Michael ABC's peak homes is in Panama City beach\nResidents battered by hurricane Michael are still coming to grips with what they went through during the storm praised down everywhere satisfy\nI'm good at that and I got all that kind of harping on this illegality and you know I I don't want it off with that I kept at a question you know actually you know the difference between an awful and ah\n[noise] ah no I don't\nI mean how are you an\nUnlawful is when a person an AK ... against the contrary to our written law I okay\nIn illegal ... thank you\n[laughter] I tell you talking about walking into that one Rick ... talking about walking into that the shaggy dog story all day long as my father used to say good morning everybody let me let me tell you about what I what I Want to talk about right now\nUh Kelly Ridley junior [noise] he's a twenty year old\nWho's up for murder murder one\nHe's up for two kinds of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and murder not Kelly Kelly's only Twenty years old Kelly was in a barn school district court yesterday and ah\nThey're looking at a uh a motion right now that they uh they ... they want to have but ah you see the defense for Kelly is that in his brain was informed enough\n\nAnd they want to bring an expert in who was an adolescent brain person\n\nBut they said right now they're not going to allow him to testify because the brain guy the expert about brain is talking about young people make poor decisions and they have a problem processing they're poor decisions\nAnd bringing it into action in other words all Kelly Reagan's Ridley Twenty years old now\nHis brain or or he didn't have the ability to understand and process you say what he was uh doing when he fatally stabbed another guy in charge now account with murder one\nNo Kelly the defendant has admitted repeatedly stabbing the person ... yeah I did it yeah I did it I kill them\nBut they want to bring the defense wants to bring in this guy who's going to say but the problem with Kelly's brain everybody did it still growing\nThat his brain is isn't a it's a poor decision making brain and and therefore he shouldn't be a tried this way because it's about his brain\nThe doctor wanted to talk and in broad terms about adolescent brain development in that capacity for impulse control and young adults\n[noise]\nI don't know how far\nOur society is going to reach\n[noise] to try to protect someone in defense someone for killing another person or for doing something like this that his brain was not engaged\nSteady at Eighteen or Nineteen years old you do not have the brain capacity for decision making\nThat your brain says to you at Eighteen or Nineteen years old that I should go out get a knife or right because this was one thing which is building up on building the to around the fight outside of the party\nOr the or Kelly picked up a scooter picked up a scooter and hit him with a scooter and then he pulled a knife and stabbed in four or five to his brain didn't have enough capacity to say not going to do this\n\nBecause my brain development did not have the capacity to tell me my brain me my brain talking to me I don't do it Kelly dumped the killing don't stab them\nIt's not that he was high on drugs or booze no just uh your brain is not developed a far enough for you to know right and wrong and it makes poor decision making and young people\n\nGod I Wish this defense were around when I was a kid growing up I could have drawn my mother and father to shove it\nI could have said yet at a head I wish it was around when I was in high school and college\nGet rid of the stupid choices that people make at different times in their life it wasn't me it was my brain my brain isn't developed enough to last twenty six I'm Glad that this wasn't around when I joined the navy\nBecause I was only in my early twenties God Forbid that I made a choice\n\nBecause my brain is still growing\nGod Forbid that anybody should never say that seven years old is really the time or you know right from wrong that you really as a little kid that by seven years old you know that you shouldn't be doing that or shouldn't be doing this never mind when you're Eighteen Nineteen or twenty\n\nWhat blows me away is that we will go down this road judge roof oh by the way had said uh I'm open to right now I don't want him to testify because it doesn't make any sense on a general basis\n\nBut I'm open if you can Jimmy any precedent setting case ah but ah I right now I say no this guy you know you just you're not going to put him in front of the jury this or this expert\nThis PHD fight or whatever he is to talk about young adults and raising the issue of of we don't know what's going on and self the impulse control self defense or whatever it might be I just don't get it everybody\n\nAnd sometimes I ... you know Steven Hyannis Port Said oxymoron headline in the front page of the uh newspaper this morning teen brain expert\n\nWell as a parent we my wife and I have been teen brain experts as along with just about every one of you out there and knowing to teach your kid right from wrong or maybe you don't\nMaybe there's no such thing as right from wrong anybody maybe there's no such thing as a a basic moral code of you know stealing is wrong generally speaking you know you don't want to steal but go ahead and see a you know the end and get that uh that PlayStation if you really\nGot to have a I don't get it people and I and I guess\nWhat I don't get also is when I hear or see a front page crap all this stuff like this we can have it both ways\n\nWhat we want to register young people to vote well they don't have a brain yet well I Know but we uh ... and you know you give them their license well they don't have a brain\nYet it's all to me hokey pokey ...\nI don't know about you\nOne count of murder one to constant assault and battery with a deadly weapon yes I did it\nBut I ... I didn't realize what I was doing because I was too young I I there's a there's a reason for me or it's not about that I was a bad I buy but bad parents and my father kick me or my mother had a solved and I it's just that my brain wasn't there\n\nIf I were on a jury I Would look at this and I bring it on All right I Would love to hear this are there that the prosecution and defense go after this uh expert guy and they want me to feel bad for all Ridley their murderer alright because his brain was informed enough\nThey're not contesting at all of what he did they're just saying ah ... ah
