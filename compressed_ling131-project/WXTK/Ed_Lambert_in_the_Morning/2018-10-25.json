certainly was a morning I was happy with the game because it was a close game that they won so that was\nOne of the things that I've been waiting for is can they win a close game in the bullpen\nYou know come through with a shortly or a tie game and they did so that was great I mean I I'm Glad I saw that David Price has show now that he can at least pitch\nCombination lay in the postseason it wasn't just a one off thing and the Astros theory so that's also a very good moving for if he has to pay as you get in this series so a lot of good things to take away from last night I think more important than the first night\n[noise] well it was a ... with the with the when of course they're going in and going out to the left coast to an oh I still don't think they're going to sweep I still think it's going to be six game series but we'll see what happens ah we got to pull at least one out of the next three coming out or going out to the west coast\nEven if they lose every game in LA it's coming back here for the final now\nI don't want to lose every game out there just one went up there but it's the world series [laughter] and my wife my wife said you know how come we gotta watch seven games where the world series and the super bowl is but one game\nAs the way it in a way it is that's right\nBy the way was Curt Schilling just there's some other some stories going around the floating that they brought back\nSome two thousand and four or you know some of the favorites for the world series back then yes and the you know a Tim Wakefield Pedro Martinez days are adjacent very tech and so on and so on but they didn't invite Curt Schilling did anybody say why\n[noise] no but he is kind of gone off the rails as far as I Know over the years so I'm not sure if that's why\nI'm Single medically I don't know if it's just politically I I don't know if he's criticized John Henry and that as the owner of the team has and probably sat well with him um and that's just one of the theories but I did notice this and I will certainly to take it\nLook into it but that's my guess\nThe a team executives said that they didn't reach out to him they told the Boston Globe no we didn't ask them\nOr it wasn't that despite they said it was originally just going to be Pedro and David and wake in in ... but we you know we heard since ... mothers and so we included on but we didn't we decided not to reach out to a Curt Schilling\nAnd uh and he said that I don't know shelling said basically from what I was able to pick up he said hey look no big deal I I don't care about that the was good to see everybody else there I still have my three rings in three toed trophies so I'm good you know but it's still it was a a\nIt was sort of a a disc to occur chilling and maybe because of his getting fired from different position than his attitudes and different things maybe that was\nAnd it is possible it's politically motivated I mean John Henry in the Boston Globe wing left and shelling obviously on the opposite side of that I mean it wouldn't surprise me I guess but like I said I don't know if it's necessarily that um I just know that I think in the past shelling has been critical of Henry so yeah I don't think he gets the invite for that reason alone\nYou know OK well All right no big deal right but just ah let's move on\nGood morning everybody big news yesterday and and uh it's still ongoing right now some of the enlisted more devices to come but give me a an update on the status report of the of the uh packages that were mailed it to a lead Democrats and CNN and now the movie stars\nFor his service are all involved in this sweeping national investigation into the search for whoever sent those explosive devices to prominent Democrats ABC's Kenneth mountain with more from Washington\nFederal authorities are now looking into a possible a suspicious package center former BP Joe Biden explosive devices as suspicious packages also said to the homes are offices of the Clintons\nThe Obamas California representative Maxine Waters and former attorney general Eric Holder a pipe bomb discovered at CNN smell room was addressed a former CIA director John Brennan\nA similar device was set to billionaire a democratic governor George Soros Monday federal investigators fair there are more explosive devices out there as they search for suspect cannot smoke in the ABC News Washington\nNew York police department responding to a suspicious package she had three Seventy five Greenwich and address associated with Robert De Niro and at one point with Harvey Weinstein no confirmation as of yet as anything more than a suspicious package well\nI mean if it's a ... year they'll find out pretty soon whether it's whether it's the same type of thing that they've they've been going out and they also talked about as you heard not only do they uh have they got eight right now but more to come depending upon where they were mailed and how it was done\nUm one of the questions I have is um from what I can understand about this whole thing you know were they meant to explode\nI mean they're very um\nOh I don't know what the word is a elementary type of bombs but I don't know and that they ... they said they were filled with a glass shards and stuff and I don't know if they were meant to explode or not but it was still very dangerous or ABC said that that they could probably improve upon these bombs pretty quick\nWhat's really concerning to me and I'm sure law enforcement is the fact that there were seven devices and for all we know there is other explosive material like a lab sitting around somewhere in America\nAnd that you have an actual bomb maker out there who is prepared potentially to figure out that since the seven devices didn't go off\nSomething has to be tweaked within devices in order to make them explode\n[noise] it's a um it's scary and it's wrong and its terrorist activities President Trump a ones out in Wisconsin but he said you know this about what we've got to do about these threats\nIn these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United states of America\nAnd basically he also said that these acts or will not be tolerated that no matter who is out there doing it or whatever is happening they won't be tolerated\nThe full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice\nAt the rally last night on in Wisconsin or the president\nCondemned political violence and called for more civil political discourse you said the nation must stop treating political opponent opponents as being morally defective and blamed the news media for the negative\nAnd false attacks I don't know how you feel about it\nUh but you know everybody has to put a mirror up a little bit on this one as far as uh the uh the attacks you know how we stop treating political opponents is being morally defective or\nThe president said acts of threats of political of violence have no place in the United states\nOr this egregious conduct is abhorrent and um sometimes that uh uh once again as I said you've got to look in the mirror Mr President of the some of the things that you know the come down right now about the\nPress the media and everything [noise] neither side right is can be whitewashed and neither side of the political spectrum I can be looked at from these bombs and and being sent a as not having their hands involved some way with that\nJohn Brennan who's a former director of the CIA said that ah pointing the finger directly you had a at Donald Trump or last night\nHe has to realize that every single day whether he ... he's a role model not just a role model for these individuals who might be engaged in this role model for the next generation of Americans\nOnce again it goes both ways to\nFor Jon Benet Brennan can't stand the president and I understand that but he he's right that the president needs to be a role model a but at the same time you know he goes on to say hey look this is what the but bullies do this with the president does\nThis is what unfortunately a lot of ... a lot of individuals do a and he's pandering to those ... very very uh disturbing or sentiments that some people\nAnd and the question comes out is in and I'm not trying to make light of this at all every one\nBut at the same time I'm looking at Maxine Waters at the same time I'm looking at polo see I'm looking at Eric Holder I'm looking at Hillary I'm looking at a I mean the list goes down and down and down about what's been going on in Washington DC\nI mean it's a ... you know Mike said the same things that are the leading lights on the left get suspicious packages I wouldn't put it past them just staged this like a sick Halloween prank since the only they stand to gain from it\n\nOnce again you know ... and then these possible uh going down that road yet let's go to Plymouth Rick good morning how you doing Rick\nGood how are you guys good I'm with your last call I think they know me nearly they're trying to blame it you know I saw something on CNN there like that he thought you\nKnow what do you call it out of a report or anything over you know nothing but yet and that it's on ... oh\nWell I mean yes see CNN said that he was pretty sure that the uh that all of the uh the president and the White House should understand that it's a this is Jeff Zucker he said that there was a total and complete lack of understanding on the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media\nHe said the president and especially the way up press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders should understand that words matter but at the same time Rick ... with all due respect to CNN and Jeff Zucker and everybody else it goes across both ways it really ...\nThe best thing I like what Trump said we are one thing I that kind of bothered me is like what we call it or not be tolerated I don't know what I mean it's like and if they can't they're not back which is not you know\nI thought you know a long and other countries that mission\nI don't know All right let me run for the news thanks for the call Rick I appreciated I met labored I'll be

they got the uh Julian syringe and floors are going at\nEach other tonight at the uh Yarmuth the realtors down there you have an ... that ought to be an interesting thing that will be hey you guys are the first birds will ... is a a Bruce ... some parts of Brewster Yarmuth burns while in all of them is right\nThat is what first Barnes Noble is um what are some of the main ... let me put it this way three main issues that you feel that when going around Steve and you're talking to people everybody what what do they care about what what's what's important to him\nShort let me I'll talk about talk about three things ah first of all the environment or environmental issues I think of something that cut across party lines here um you know everybody in the Cape recognizes\nUm how fragile um our uh\nOur our whole mess and ah and things that we need to do to protect that\nSo uh do spend a pretty decent amount of time talking about environmental issues and some ideas I have the we can we can improve the environment\nOr ways in which I Want to go further than uh than Peking hill has a currently I'm we're at a point where we really can't afford to take baby steps on the environment we need to take a more aggressive approach in order to uh uh you know\nProtect a Cape Cod and protect folks here in the first ... let\nMe stop you right ... that's a that's number one is the environmental issues what does that mean would it when you break down what our environmental issues and yeah we want to protect this we want where it's very cold fragile but what the hell ... what does that mean\nIt's a it means a lot of things that it comes down from things that you do personally and individually um to greater planning that we need to do along the shores for ah for coastal mitigation\nOr you know we saw last winter this is outside my district but I I often use it as an example um we saw last winter that two storms took out Seventy five ... beach\nThere and and prompted a you know ... to ah to be torn down a prompted the town to spend money to move because he broke years ahead of when they needed to to uh to do that so we obviously have some big picture things that we need to plan for and ah and work on it was a recent study\nThat said uh thinking about twenty five years is about four billion dollars a residential property in Massachusetts that's at risk for steady flooding uh if things keep going the way they do so there's some large scales pieces with that but there's also some smaller scale things in terms of what individuals\nCan do in terms of what their own habits are in terms of what they consume\nA being more sustainable um\nAs far as waste water goes which is obviously one of the very big issues are here uh you know I proposed that the or the state uh expand the program today has\nWhere if you're septic fails you can qualify for low interest loans are they are tax deductions that are involved I Want to expand that sort of people are at kind of the end of the useful life with their septic all want to upgrade to something better um that they also qualify for a\nA for tax breaks and uh and and that alone so you're saying\nDon't wait till it fails don't wait till it fails you're saying it right now you're you're septic system is in and it's been around for I Know\nThere is going to happen and\nYou're you have the ability now to what you don't have the ability now to go in and and get the low end\nIntersect like OK exactly you want to say I want to expand that because so much of what affects our our groundwater comes from the homes yeah there are so I think it it's just one of those ah crude and things that we can we can do to encourage folks to ah to take better care of the land\nThis the idea of doing something along the coast I mean would that's an issue a coastal mitigation or the homes he said uh over the next twenty five years but what what can you do I mean what is what can you do is is that right I mean what what what can we do to stop the ocean\nIt's a great question and you know what you're right ... um it was you know one of the points that are represented well and and I agree on is that ultimately nature's gonna do what nature is going to do with that so you know there is a there is a point where what's going to happen is going to happen\nUm I think they're still planning um that we can do this still things that that we can do in terms of restoring beaches and shorelines and does that will help the least laying by some time too\nTo plan for the [noise] you said personal over that people can do personally what they that they can do for an environmental I mean we talk in plastic straws I mean what are we talking\nA well the septic is is certainly a ... is is certainly one piece there um\nRecycling is obviously a a a another good one people have have really stepped up um in our towns in terms of the of using the or the recycling I'd like to see more composting available the roost recycling center was introduced to small\nUm compost program and the reason I say small is if there's not a very large been to collect Gump bugs right now so I'd like to see a or something like that expanded so the more that we can keep things out of\nBeing burned to being shipped somewhere whatever I'm the better off we're going to be and we also know that the ah the the cost of that our towns are incurring um for plastic\nUh is going up the they're not getting the return that they they once had an and it's becoming more expensive for the town's\nFive awake seven seven five nine nine eight five are toll free phone number is one a day they WICK Ninety five one talking to Stephen leaving which he's running for a state representative and first burns well steaming the ah you said environmental was one of the top three nice talking to people all through your district or what do you think is number two\nUm and I don't mean to shorten one or two I mean\nThe rise of inter yeah just jumped the three things to ah to talk about um their education as an education funding is something that um I uh talked frequently about on the campaign and and has a has struck a tone with people we saw last spring that the town of Yarmuth had to uh\nFinancing override 'em over half a million dollars in order to uh\nUh pay more for their share of the uh the regional schools\nOr the states just not doing its fair share in terms of funding um the foundation budget needs to be reformed um and even beyond that there are numerous areas of reimbursements that uh the state's not fully reimbursing\nI'm as regional transportation which affects the Y in AA and na said it's a circuit breaker which a reimbursement for special needs students um that's a very expensive cost to the towns and also when a student leaves the public system to go to a charter\nA there's reimbursement for that and that's not being fully funded\nNow I supported the fair share amendment which was thrown off the ballot um I still support it in a in concept\nUm that we do need more revenue there was a there was a a report recently that says we're under funding education by about a billion dollars\nOr where you're a stay in the state and local and state um as a as a whole but I Know that if the state was doing a better job of funding those areas the that I spoke about\nUm than uh yup Yarmuth wouldn't have had to do a an override our towns in general are our property tax payers had been fantastic it's supporting education but I think the state needs to to step up and do more for a to support that and not as much towards our a property tax on her ... well really the property\nOwner does it say about it they sit back there and they get their tax bill they pay their tax bill you guys in the school committees and the finance committees and everything else that are the ones that are along with the superintendents the teachers come out with the budget\n[noise] what are we in reality talking about specifically authorized overrides come up\nWell you know I I Would be a no guy for our own over I Know right down to the gym I don't know why do you need an override you know that type of thing if you want a debt exclusion terrific we'll talk about that but and override is forever and it goes on for ever and increases for ever and that's the type of thing that I don't\nLike right and that's what I I Am trying to stop moral Bryce were happening specifically ah for education because I think a a property tax on it was like I said had been fantastic stepping up for education and ... and supporting override specifically for the schools they've been great about that but the state needs to do more\nIn the in the Fort towns that you're involved with as a as the first ... ah how's the police funding going\nThe police funding um\nThere is no issue that I'm specifically aware of in terms of police funding\nUm one thing that I Would uh I Would mention is a um kudos to US Senator Sierra and uh and folks up there for getting some more funding for training that has been something that's that's been a gap and we're going to see some more funding for training a what a shame that we had the tax people more for that uh it it wasn't\nThe budget isn't that a shame so those idiots up there couldn't find a room and the budget for that so they had to throw tax on rental cars\nYou know what I mean give me a ... well it's it's good that that that they're glad to have it however however it's coming in they're glad that they that they have it and it's going to be a resource for ah ah for all the police departments here on the Cape\nRight there's a lot of people out there and no idea what Medicare is that good that that would have the ability to ah to opt into a program like that so how does it work\nSingle payer health care how does it work every month somebody in the government takes so much out of your paycheck um in some places that is exactly how it works um and again the comparison of cost between what you are paying in to that system\nVersus what you're paying and health insurance premiums um is less uh to me it just inherently makes sense that\nUm here's me here's my\nPhysician that there is some middle person in between making decisions about what you can do you got to process papers you got to do this you got to do that and insurance and insurance companies exactly I'm Talking about a new makes examples where people\nUm you know a physician and said you know we want you to get X Y and Z treatment and insurance companies saying well we'll do X and y but not CSI\nOr there so it's coming in the way if people being able to get a decent a decent treatment so to me it's inherently ineffective and inefficient to have that uh that middle peace there I'm not saying we jump right into it\nBut it's like yeah we flip the switch and all of a sudden we have single payer we have to look at cost at training at a at how we get our way out of our existing system to transition into that so doing it in a responsible way\nWe're going to take a quick break for the news we're talking with Steven Levy woods who is running for state rep in the first
