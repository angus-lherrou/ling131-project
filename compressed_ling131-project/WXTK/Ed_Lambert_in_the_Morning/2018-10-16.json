day they WFDD a Ninety five one in my email address is that at Ninety five WICK dive time Senator Elizabeth Warren [noise]\nClaimed native heritage with their DNA Analysis that came out yesterday by most the Monti and basically people all over the United states\nFor the most part and laughing at the situation that she set up Cherokee Nation Secretary Chuck Hoskins is should the following\nStatement and I read it it's useless to what she's trying to do and Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with their continued claims of tribal heritage let's go to the cell phone J uh Greg good morning science or hold and how you doing Greg\nFast that are you doing that good it was one question how what what what was it\nHow many great grandparents was it was her up like six or seven according\nTo CNN's a article that came out yesterday and let me get it in front of me how many greats are there and they're a\nGreat great great great great great grandparents so that's what six\nSix grades before a grand\nOh let me ask you a question now uh I don't know when we finally got it worse in Oklahoma the Cherokee Nation is\nYeah but\nMy great I'm about her age my first great grandparent was born in in the Eighteen eighty yes\nSo my ... from there that would put them in the what Seventeen or sixteen hundred I don't think we were out to go over there yet\nSixteenth century Fifteen hundreds\nYeah\nI don't think we're out of Oklahoma that well I don't think the math adds up\n[noise] the problem with all of this stuff is that\nUh he base it on their ancestry most of it for a new European basis but because they didn't have any native ancestors any basis for Native American ancestors going back that far they pulled it from South American people's the people of South America at that time\nAnd then trance litter rated it and to Native American\n[noise] oh I see okay so basically this is just kind of like a kind of sounds like a ruse to me\nShe she is hoping that she's going to put it to bed because she's running for president and she knows that this is going to be something that'll be brought up continually this her taxes and everything else which he's trying to put to bed right now because she's running in twenty twenty\nAnd and now all we all know that that's what this is out in you know what Greg the analysis is silly alright I'll just say the least All right it's it's silly the Cherokee Nation is ticked off a that Democrats are ticked off at her\nAnd the fact that she trying to because the only reason I don't want it now is for presidential run but the problem is she keeps lying about that she never used her quote unquote Native American heritage to get ahead and she did\nOh yeah I we all know she did yeah you know it's just I just I find it fascinating that anybody would give this like CNN or anybody else would give any crazy at all\nReally this whole thing about her heritage yeah I Know in the way this whole thing was done the whole why they wouldn't even\nGive this any sort of ... just does it I absolutely amazes me so\nWell I don't think they are I mean you know number one I don't I don't think she gets by this I really don't I don't I don't\nEither but I Know the media is going to try to help her get by as much as they possibly yeah well let's see how it all let's see how that works out right oh yeah [laughter] Oh thanks Greg Lake\nYeah as a ... a CNN rights for example Cherokee ... a nation requires members to be directly descended from at least one person as a Nineteen oh seven\nOne of the ... tribes of Delaware Indians in Oklahoma one uses a similar role and the other requires applications to be at least a part I'm at Delaware by blood quantum granddaughter grandson that type of thing\nThey said Senator Warren qualifies for none of these measures yet she did have herself listed as Native American at Harvard law school which use her assertion to specifically claim greater diversity of found guilty\nI don't know about that I doubt I a couple of months of an economy does not make brick right there\n[noise] okay All right and and see I look at other things with the economy so I okay I mean we are

a lot of money went\nI mean a lot of money and go to Matt and very little oversight yeah we spent\nFive hundred and forty million dollars when the house and Senate were not in session that means very few eyes took a look at this\n[noise] okay well that's the way it's amazing\nTo me the way business has done up there and it's amazing to me how the governor can sign that bill ... Fifteen yesterday afternoon it gets to his desk and nobody says anything about it and nobody says wait\nA minute wait a minute wait a minute and they're saying oh no we need to do with the ... in the ways and Means Committee Monday afternoon said wait a minute\nThis is covering shortfalls in various accounts how can you have shortfalls in various accounts Holly if you ended the year was one point two billion dollars in in the in excess\nOh I guess that if the fuzzy math ...\nAmazing and we put up with it too isn't it amazing well we don't have any say about it when he put it that way so uh let me just put it this way over a half a billion dollars goes\nTo spending tore cute little projects here there and everywhere from FSL\nAnd covering and they of of half a billion dollars the only amount that they set aside to help the people up and end over and you know every you know Lawrence and end north Andover which ten million bucks\nThat's a ... billion dollars as it yep but but I Am ...\nWait a minute and I'm sure that the they had a million dollars is going to pay police overtime for everything exactly on up\nThere but at the end of the day we should not be on the hook for that the taxpayers should not be there should be all coming out of Columbia gas yeah I'm all of it should be coming out of Columbia gas with the taxpayers of Massachusetts should not be ... yoked responsible for\nAny if this cleanup math it was Columbia is gases fault Columbia gas needs to own it they need to pay for all of it and I hope that the state's going to go out you know is going to go after Columbia gas\nI Want that ten million dollars back because I Believe either that she's going to the rainy day fund or taxpayers should get a refund I I mean there's a lot of different ways to do it I mean I think of the two hundred million dollars that that\nWe haven't surplus why does this summer they come back to the tax\nIt doesn't I mean what what's laughable yeah they said okay we got to spend ten million bucks for overtime and trailers and everything like that and we expect to get it back from Columbia gas what's this spec expect I'd be suing Columbia gas right for right now\nYou know and also they take surplus money which we didn't have a right and funds to the executive officer of education 'cause they're establishing a grant program for public schools and enhancing safety and security measures by upgrading or reforming retrofitting school buildings\nI mean what is up with this we have in a budget that went through right now in the tens of billions of dollars and yet they are going to take an awful lot of this do and just shove it towards this this type of stuff I I don't get the way they do things up there I really don't\nKnow you get what they do the way they they do things\nTo say that I wanted to make that\nThe taxpayers are their personal ATM\nYes they do to stop and I don't know it's you know how it's going to stop we got to change the money one day I got to change things around big time vote 'em out ... days Twenty one days\nAnd I know that I'll get some calls from our state reps in every in emails you don't know what you're talking about it you don't know we needed to do we needed to do we had to have the money all baloney you know\nOh that is if they need the money okay great let's not\nDo it when the house and Senate are not in fashion\n... put it in your budget to begin with right period don't take the money over the there was a surplus of a billion dollars and more and use it put it put it in your budget today if you needed money for the preservation trust fund take it in the ... this year's budget you know what I mean I don't know\nI I just don't think that they should be spending half a billion dollars with very little oversight and and and that you know that look\nThe legislature was not meant to be run by two or three people as they elected body you know representatives of each community and as a hundred and sixty state reps in the house and and the forty in the Senate and and that there should be far more oversight\nAnd they're also getting two million bucks in their pocket\nAnd that's what bothers me for a human resource improvements you know what I mean\nThis goes right back to them they're buying everybody off including all the senators and all the the state wraps up there everybody gets bought off by by saying well you're going to get another forty eight thousand dollars or so you can hire Peggy sous sister in law to come in part time you know\nWell they do an audit the legislature that's the other problem and not pay they don't audit so you don't know where all the way of their money is actually being spent\nOh Bruce starved for grain um yesterday said wait a minute wait a

Bible eight seven seven five nine eight five\nAre toll free phone number is one a day they WICK a Ninety five one a lot of discussion about a Elizabeth Warren and really open up a bag or worms she didn't I don't think she put anything to bed a at all relative to\nA her Indian quote unquote heritage or not a with her a release of the information about\nThe analysis on her DNA uh but that is ongoing that's not going to stop they'll continue on no matter what and uh there's two sides with all that story I mean I was reading that uh that Elizabeth Warren\nAlmost had a meltdown apparently a late yesterday in last night\nOr Elizabeth Warren as thread of a twenty plus threads in tweets\nBegan about five thirty last night where she attended to both insult Trump and defend yourself on the uh the situation with a with a coming out about her a DNA Analysis or twenty tweets\nAnd for someone who usually doesn't do it apparently um she's right there than the first week without any evidence or Warren made the outlandish claim\nThat Trump quote makes creepy physical threats about me\nWhich I don't know where that came from but those are part of the type of stuff with her reaction ah for ah for what people are saying about her Charlie say that now that Elizabeth Warren DNA test came back as being positive for being part Native American are you willing to apologize for\nCalling her Pocahontas and is Trump willing to live up to his promise to pay one million to her charity as if you don't get upset I ... I refer to Trump as Pinocchio\nWell Charlie that's that's terrific and then you know for doing that and putting oak hill but for her claim that she is Indian heritage that you haven't read apparently bustamante and what others are saying about her American heritage and anything else CNN says that maybe listen up Charlie\nMaybe [noise] maybe\nHer a single person maybe her great great great great great great great grandmother\n\nMay have been may have been part Native American the conclusion you go back on that is you're going back to the sixteenth century\nAnd as a bustamante said he pulled an awful lot of the information on DNA because they don't have any information and the DNA going back to South American and uh and south of three different countries in South America in order to pull up the uh uh any information they may have\nSo don't get all excited Charlie just to read on\nA Mike and born he got about ... minutes Gulf War and Mike\nI don't like 'em and I don't like um [noise]\nOr whatever the name is Warren she she's a show of it is a female show is is a male chauvinist I Hope they younger people lie and I hope they find some people within the next like one of our listeners\nForget his name that will get out there and why and stabilize the United states because if it's like a bunch of high school kids he's if you have to address\nIt she says they're talking about the possibility of Seventeen to twenty four different uh Democrats that are thinking about running and you might be so I'm just thinking about Seth Moulton\nWho say I was out in the ring [noise] yeah I I Would feel very\nI've got to go Mike sorry about that were coming up on nine o'clock after nine questions three I met ... hanging\n\nBreaks out we break in when you watch the ... west ... God and I hardly radio station news radio Ninety five ...\n\nYears old lady from ABC News I'm Emily brown push for answers and if the parents have a reporter last scene that they signed the consulate in Istanbul, Turkey taking place in Saudi Arabia in Turkey today here's ABC's can traverse secretary of state Mike\nLaurie do you agree with what do what Matt just said\nAbsolutely um it would be ... for us to remove any one of the other groups that are in this list such as\nI don't know we could say and you know we would like to remove somebody who is Catholic or somebody who has a disability or somebody who um [noise]\nUh you know isn't it something we don't agree with we just don't remove their civil rights and I think that removing any classes people from this anti discrimination law is most likely to me a violation of the constitution and their civil rights [noise]\nLaurie I uh I was talking to a friend of mine oh probably now two days ago over the weekend\nAnd she said to me yet I said we're going to be talking about questions three whether you want to vote yes let's leave it alone or no I Want to change it to lose the transgender\nShe said to me she said I don't care about any of the other uses but I don't want my fourteen year old daughter going in the ladies' room and having a guy come in well she's there or in and she says I just don't feel comfortable with that I don't think it should be that way\nI have two things to respond to that one is then you need a different ballot question because this ballot question is much more broad than just um\n... ... more broad than just on a limb and needing transgender people from going into your bathroom this law if it is repeal repeal their rights to exist anywhere in public including hospitals dentist office theaters and whatnot\nOn my second question is um\nWomen are always in danger in private and even public places changing this law one way or the other is not going to make that fourteen year old anymore safe [noise]\nOkay so what you're saying is that the way if we vote no on this if the people out there vote no on this they're taking all rights from transgendered people in any public accommodation where there'd be a restaurant or a gas station or something like that that's what you're saying that's\nThat's correct and that's my objection to to Iceland or you know mostly\nOkay so do you go to a great\nPoint here and you know I think that this is really really important distinction for people to understand\nThis locked extract younger people any place not work or school and so every place that we live our lives when we go to a coffee shop or a restaurant and so I think that uh you know we all think about uh you know putting ourselves in in those situations and the\nNumber of places we go during the day to live our lives and we need our obligation to our families that are at work\nAnd all of that so that's what's really at stake here and I'd also just say I take a little bit of issue with the premise that your friends are brought up there's nothing about this law that allows them to enter women bases and so I'm all this law does that\nVery simple protect transgender people and discrimination and ... but they're not thinking about this fall that a lot of men or women it\nSure does it allows allows complete access for for anyone who is a transgender to enter into the bathroom of what his gender identity is Matt right\nWell again I'm going to take issue with that because I think\nIf it if it doesn't let me know because I'm I'm trying to read this is Jeanette red folder that read book where and I'm and I'm saying to myself wait a minute it allows people who identify as male to go in the ladies' room\nPresident allows them uh uh uh people ... identify a lady to go on a men's room I as a man they're going to know\nI don't know when it says what does it no more [laughter] [laughter] I feel identify as a woman you use the women's room but you're a man on the ... the woman who use the women's room that's kind of well that's what I'm saying I got you got messed up yeah a little bit yeah the wording is ... ... yes\nYeah the wording is tricky I think it is and you know it's important for people to understand that when someone identifies a transgender woman or they're living their lives with a woman and so I think that the point I'm trying to make here and so\nUm it's really under you know it's understandable that people may have questions about what it means to be transgender we all are we all have questions I certainly had questions I met transgender people in my life\nUm but I think what we found out in what you do find that when you have the great fortune of meeting a transgender person is that they are just entering a public restroom for all the reasons that you and I use a public restroom sure to get in and get how do your business and go I go about your day\nMhm okay so once again so what does this woman should be telling her I forgot about twelve or fourteen year old daughter\nHoney if a guy goes in there he's identifying as a female\nDon't worry be happy he'll do his but he will do his business because he identifies as a woman even though we stole a man the physically but don't worry about it just leave it alone get in get out he will get the identifying as a woman will get in and out don't worry about it\nWell again I I wouldn't I wouldn't frame it quite that way because I I I it and I feed a forensic are limited when I'm\nWhen I suppose okay you'll see honey I Know and how do you know their transgendered women\nI think the point is we don't always know right so we shouldn't we shouldn't really care so much um I think that also let let slip this argument a little bit I major saint say uh we repeal this part of the law\nRight so now you might have trans men going into that fourteen year olds bathroom\nSo someone who started life as a woman who has transition to a man with a beard dressed completely like a man well technically have to use your daughter's best friend how is that going to work\nI don't know I hate it screw it is don't you re it screw in ... there were all screwed up so let's just leave people alone and let them live their lives anybody entering a bathroom with various intent is breaking the law\nWhy don't we do this instead of having men's bathroom and women's bathrooms why don't we have a sign outside that says man or woman man or woman\nWho do you think someplace to do that I Know yeah I think it's [noise]\nYou liked that Matt ...\nWell I think we're not going to advocate for businesses to have to create new space there's\nLike no no no not in Minnesota they want to go ahead and do that they already got bathrooms right\nOne of them can be one of them can be a male female the other going to be male female\n... as a work out a lot of places already do that but again I think that we want you know this law does not uh does not work but if it's a great in effect staffing what this law does add a and per head it's discrimination against transgender people in all of places have problems\nWhen they talk and in the in the red booklet everybody by the way we're talking to Laurie manager was talking about Wilder who are in favor of uh leave\nExcuse me leaving questions three the law as it stands right now in place\nAccording to the red booklets voting no repeals the bathroom bill law and prevents men from entering women's bathrooms locker rooms dressing rooms and intimate spaces\nThe law violates the privacy and safety of women by allowing any man identifying as a woman including convicted sex offenders to share woman's facilities\nUnder the law any attempt to block the man from entering the women's locker room dressing room bathroom could result in an individual penalty of up to fifty thousand dollars a year and a year in prison businesses are also affected like female spot owners\nWho face discrimination claim for declining to wax the journalism and men identifying as a woman\nNo law should make women and girls feel unsafe and exploit their privacy and security the mess legislature passed a law that goes too far even refusing to include a provision to exclude sex offenders a no vote protects women's privacy and safety that's the state\nI think well and I got ... inaccuracies they are not do you wanna um yeah for sure and I\nJust want to point out that what you just read at is the statement from the ... ... ... if though that's very clear\nThat absolutely that's not that's not objective\nStatement that it from one ONE Campaign\nI think that the major point here for people to understand that um anything that happens any criminal activity that happens in a public restroom or locker room\nAnyone who commits a crime whether they be transgender or not we'll be arrested and charged as they should be nothing about this law changed that\nOkay but does it does it change I'm going to use one word that was that Elizabeth Warren use just last night's does it feel creepy is that is if people feel creepy about this is that okay that's basically I'm not breaking the law and what ...\nWhat the laws vary the laws very clear and not be spread and proper purpose since so if someone feels that it is as though it is being used to have proper purpose they should\nBring that to the uh to the management of the establishment they're in or all the police and oh the address there's nothing about this lot a lot of people to use it for improper\nAnd also being having just because you get somebody is creepy or you disagree with somebody doesn't mean that you get to deny them their civil and human rights it's okay to disagree but you eat this is America and these are American citizens will be denied their civil right to exist in a public place [noise]\nWhat is the a maddening in in ... what is the [noise]\nTo accommodate privacy rights of other people in the meantime chill they\nTend to notice solution or eliminate those areas\nCurrent law okay those those those fringe\nOn the privacy of other individuals to because there is no monitoring got okay I'm from\nWhat I Know there's ... hang on a second I understand where you're coming from let Matt and Rory answer your question go\nYeah they receive that got I I don't want to diminish your concerns because I think it's important to recognize we all care about safety and there's no doubt about that I care about that you really care about that that we can find common ground there here it's what I Would say\nIf someone enters the bases with the intent of committing a crime that police will be called and there'll be arrested and there's nothing about this law that have changed that and those are\nWell anyone anyone in the public and called the police\nAnd the guy to object to change and Gary ... just your stranger that's outside of that they already have you stopped him move I I don't know if you're under a who he is\nA well again I Know you have a mission that someone is easing the spreading proper purpose you have every right to tell the all the and the ... states that if you\nI Would encourage people to go read the lot it's not a very long lost a lot about one page already long it on the fate a website\n... made a statement earlier about that there's been no incidents of any problem with a transgender person that that may be true but there have had that dog translate into people and that's the problem is that they can take advantage of the ...\nThey can do that now that they don't they don't need any law they can do that right now women are always in danger from some men with and the various intent\nNorth ... I'm ... I'm going to hold you there Scott I appreciate the call I got to take a break everybody we're talking about questions three yes\nKeeps of the way it is no changes it around okay you get out of there let's uh let's take a quick break I'll be back after the news I md labor this report is sponsored by staples\nDo when you went to the local news\nGood morning I woke Perkins weather's WICK news up they are middle borrow man has been arrested on several gun related charges following a shooting on Sunday in where he had it happen around ten Fifteen pm Sunday where him officers responded to the area of West boulevard for a reporter was shooting in the street\nFor the information was that there was an altercation involving several individuals and the suspect fired a gun from a dark colored automobile before fleeing the scene officer determine no one and this was struck by gunfire and the shooting was the result of an argument with a resident of West boulevard the doctors were able to identify your shooter\nHe did they spent cartridge near the corner of eighth street in West boulevard collected the cartridges evidence were him officers went to the suspect's home in the middle borough accompanied by middle borough police and after the investigation Twenty one year old Zachary blonde home of mental borough was placed under arrest\nAnd taken to wear him police headquarters where he was held but ten thousand dollars cash bill was arraigned where him district court Monday bond bond time as a charged with assault with a dangerous weapon discharging a firearm within five hundred feet of a dwelling carrying a firearm overloaded with a license and position of ammunition with an F.
