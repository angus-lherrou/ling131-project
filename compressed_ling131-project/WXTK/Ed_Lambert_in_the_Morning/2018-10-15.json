things first of all when it comes to things like Social Security you you you get what you give 'em and it's based they base it on how much you put in a how many years of work things like that and so I

good ... ... it's a it's a good question it's\nA great question you know something the fact is for the DACA recipients when they become citizens it it does is a difficult thing to do\nWith the folks that are here as legal resident it's much more easy thing to do because they have a different status and so you could flag them as as people that are not citizens that are here as residents and if it's a it is a a lot it's much easier thing to do for folks that are just here is legal residence versus legal citizen\nPoint well noted and one of those things were going to have to figure out for the the citizen component of it which are the DACA recipients\nThe problem or not a lot of people say Peter also the healthcare system that is one of our is Sam said basically costs go up a you know ... how did how do you get that under the control\nA huge huge issue so I'm just a few things there's a few things we need to do a one is we need tort reforms and tore formulas to actually they would help prevent reduce things like frivolous law suits and things like that\nOkay short this orange and I'm getting a ...\nThere's a reason they're going to fight it and that's because over Ninety percent of folks in Congress all lawyers and guess what they want to do when they get out I'm not a what we need I pushed strongly for tort reforms um secondly what we needed more transparency relative to health care cost\nEd you myself most of the folks listening they know how much it costs to get their real change in their car I'm shouldn't you know how much it costs to get your hip replaced it hospital ex versus hospital line by the way with the success rate is that both of those hospitals we started having that type of transparency guess\nWhat happens we stop bringing costs

minutes\nPretty wide ranging interview from the president of the United states but let me give you a little feel and flavor of how this went down sixty minutes president Donald Trump going into the lion's den with a Leslie stall\nI always used to say the toughest Paco in Manhattan real estate guys and Bob\nNow he's saying that babies who hid that hit the political people this is the most deceptive vicious world\nIt is and vicious it's full of lies deceit and deception you make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with that table give me an example I don't want to give you an example I'm not look at it in the meantime nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do remember that\nWhen you look at taxes you look at regulations you look at uh making deals with other countries nobody's been able to do anything like this\nActually most people didn't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it but\nIt's a very deceptive world the other thing I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was I I I really made it I'm not saying that as a sound bite I now I knew how to change the subject again well no but even that way you ask me a question like about separation\nYeah when I say Obama did it you don't want to talk of that now I don't I don't know I was making going around your answer but you did it for time I'm just telling you that you seen in Maine much differently on the subject I disagree but I don't want to have that fight with you hey All right now the fight with the nighttime I'm president and you're not\n\nBoy oh boy I we looked at each other and my wife and I looked at each other and they said you know Donald you're absolutely right I'm president in the meantime I'm president and you're not\nYou know and he was talking about how dishonest and fake news and everything else he was in there and Leslie stall gave it a good shot at it I think the president of the United states was very very smart\nAnd doing a sixty minutes with Leslie stall I think that what his intention was as is his rallies across the United states for whomever is to take a hard look at it yes I Will sit down and answer your questions may not be the questions of the answers you want but I only answer your questions\nSecond of all when he when he when he said about a ... you know I I got to tell you right now I always used to say the toughest people or Manhattan real estate guys by blood and he's now I Know they're babies\nThe most deceptive vicious world it's vicious it's full of lies deceit and deception you make a deal with somebody and that's like making a deal with that table when he's talking about political\nPeople in Washington DC how right on the money he was\n\nAnd he is the first time the first president I've ever heard say it like that or see it at all\nAnd for him and for the for him to be treated as he you know we I thought he was he did a very good job\nBut when he said he looked at it you know I don't want to be but the media and he was writing about Lesley Stahl how they'd ask a bomb on the question how they'd throw stuff had him whereas it with me I'm president and you're not\nWell I'd like to get a bumper sticker I'm president and you're not how did you feel when ... when he talked about Saudi Arabia let's you know that's a big issue Saudi Arabia and the whole thing was that\nWith the um the media guy went going in there this is how president into a Trump talked about the comment on the un Saudi Arabia where we are going to do we're\nGoing to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nAnd he kept going on she kept asking him about what do you think what diseases we don't know we'll get to the bottom of it we don't know we will get to the bottom of it\nLet's go to the truck my morning you're an ex TK how you doing Mike I'm On an adult you had a good weekend sir Yes sir\n[noise] glad you're touching on this because I'm just no no respect for the president you know I give them credit for going in there he knows what he's gonna\nGet um [noise] you know [noise] [noise] I\nIt doesn't do them any good on remember Rush Limbaugh talking about it last week he doesn't know why he can't these interviews with\nThem because it um it's just total lack of respect us is all I saw a let him finish the question\nUm you know and and he did a good job keeping his cool it because as president of the United states he deserves respect and he doesn't get it from a journalist like her\nI think Mike that he did accomplish something unless I'm God Forbid give me that I disagree I disagree a ... I don't regard to the same feel the same way that a that a Rush Limbaugh I did but I I got to tell you I think he did accomplish something I think he accomplished for the Republicans\nFor those of us at a conservative out there\nThat he can handle a what's going into the lion's den Leslie ... of the world or the left\nNumber two I think he also has some independence looking at that show last night that usually watch sixty minutes 'cause I'm On a Ninety nine times out of a hundred I Will I don't watch sixty minutes but I got to tell you right now I thought he did a good job I really do own\nAid and he did an excellent job would be very easy for him to deny the interview\nYou know just now too busy at something going on that night but um I don't know it just the lack of respect I was getting a my wife and I both were getting very you know let them finish the question number one I'm you know you look at\nI don't want to keep going back to Obama but but but you know it 'cause that's what everybody\nDoes and and we all know the story well my key and what do you know the power to top yeah a brass than the media treated\nHim over all the things that happened in his\nDuring his tenure in all I I I don't know I I'll\nLook at look at it it's it's it's evident and you got your wife got it suited we might get it's evident to me\nWhere she was coming from and what that side of the aisle is looking at because they won't deal with the accomplishments they won't deal with anything else they want to know about you know mad dog Mattis they want to know about climate change in his cabinet didn't everybody leaving\nRather than in and he finally did say it and I'm Glad he did you know I'm president and you're not another ...\nYou know hey that's the way it is\nYeah and of course that she didn't want to talk about how the Democrats know treated a cabinet oh I Know that whole issue Joe did not want to go ...\n... and he was had enough class not even to pursue it but but he brought it up\nAs he should have right yep thanks my don't get discouraged on this one I thought it was a a pretty good uh I thought he did very well\nAnd good injury one of the things that I liked about the the situation when Lesley Stahl they were walking okay there there's this walk wherever the hell they were and she said up to about him about the Mueller investigation let's hear what would the which are what the hell that went down\n[noise] well you flash [noise] pledge that you will not shut down the ...\nInvestigation I I don't play anything but I have no intention of doing that I think it's a very unfair\nInvestigation because there was no collusion of any kind of ... I don't want to pledge why should I pledge to you because I play in jobs pledge not to play\nBingo\nWell isn't that nice for a change setting or right back on their heels in my opinion with all due respect to Leslie stall I don't pledged anyone why do I have to I'm not going to pledge to you I'm not going to well why wouldn't you pledge I'm not going to pledge I Know why would I pledge do
