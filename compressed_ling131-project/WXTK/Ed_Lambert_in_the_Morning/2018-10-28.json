{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "So couldn't he just take all that bank account money and throw it into the investment account just before he goes into the nursing home or before you apply now half of that\nYou know a great gray area although I've tested these waters as well and and I think what you're going to run into is no or if they see\nThat that just happened they're going to say that that was an action that you took that made a formerly available last at the bank account into a not available last at a joint account I think you're going to need to do that within that you'd have to do that\nMore than five years before you entered the nursing home [noise] not a loophole for me then not a loophole but if he had set this up long ago was that the other point here I don't know how long ago he had set up by investment accountants it's very possible that if it wasn't within five years\nThat all of his money is at risk even though he might have thought in his mind somehow half of it maybe wasn't protected when in reality none of it is protected now if he had changed the owner and the beneficiary on the life insurance policy to the child more than five years ago\nI think he would be okay with that uh it would be protected I don't love that idea but at least it would have been protected so that being said what's gonna happen when we go to apply for Medicaid 'cause she's going in to the nursing home\nAnd you know what what you're probably hearing here folks and realizing is wait a minute there's no benefit to given it to a person you don't short and that by your clock\nDo it to your ear evoke about trust Todd's guide for the month of November outlines everything you need to know about these trust how they operate the information that should be in them and then the information those troublesome clauses that absolutely cannot be included in your ... trust if you want it to work when you needed to folks\nCoffee or free copyright now eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine at your last chance to do so folks eight six six eight for eight five six and nine nine or download your free copy on our website legal exchange\nShow dot com so okay now we've got\nAn understanding of what he's done we go into the nursing home we apply okay as you were saying Susan from uh I'm going to compare estate recovery versus trust planning mhm right so if this was all put in a trust the bank accounts the investment accounts the home you know all in the trust\nWell then you see the ah\n[noise] ah there would be ... there were ... and we're beyond five years there would be no state recovery here right yes it's would be protected not half mhm all and know a state recovery won the individual dies\nYou just die and whatever's left in the trust is there the life insurance on the other hand I could not have probably put that into the euro vocal trust because if I did change the owner and beneficial to the trust\nIf it's still required premium payments than the father could not pay the premiums because then he'd be paying a premium on a policy he doesn't own therefore\nAt five o'clock would start every time he makes the policy payment\nBut if he had put assets are bank accounts into the trust then you could pay the premiums would that trust money right\nThen he could as long as there's enough money in the trust to pay those kind of a very good point Susan you could actually do that\nVersus what he did he gave it to the sun changed the owner and the beneficial to the sun I said yes after five years you would have protected downside who's going to pay the premiums what do you want to bet the dad still paying those premiums you're going to have the same problem with dads or another short cut problem that doesn't actually work\nAt the end of the day mhm so\nYou know at this case I'm thinking the irrevocably trust would have not had any of these issues\nSo now what happens now in his case we're going to apply for Medicaid\nAnd they're going to say the houses non ...\nI like it yeah it you've got you know none of the bad things happened by owning dodging alone in a life a state with a child I get it but\nAt least it's protected from the nursing home and you know a state recovery let me explain he even though he owns a life a state interest in the property since it's his home\nIt's deemed non accountable while he is alive and when he dies the life of state expires like magic it disappears\nAny lean that would've been on it also disappears and so it passes outside of probate to the child and he becomes the full owner and the simple so what that means is no state recovery because at least in Massachusetts you need to check with your state\nBut some states have expanded a state recovery but in Massachusetts a state recovery is limited to assets that are in your own name on the date of death\nThe life estate avoids probate so therefore it doesn't own name means that goes to probe it hey okay so that's a good deal [noise]\nNow what about this joint investment accounts let's say we didn't do it more than five years ago and not even half of it is protected what are we going to do you can't leave it joint thinking that somehow that's going to avoid probate right because the whole assets accountable\nYou're right or two thousand dollars so thinking you're going to leave a joint and get on Medicaid to avoid estate recovery is not going to help you because you won't get on Medicaid you and me\nBecause you had that money and your name regardless of how the ownership is if it's half and your name it's all that yeah\nIt it's so in this case you're over two thousand dollars so you don't have to worry about a state recovery 'cause you're not going to get on Medicaid right\nSo that's not a good deal same thing with the bank accounts what are we going to do we're going to take the bank accounts and the investment accounts liquidate them and either buying annuity in his name on Medicaid annuity to convert it to an income stream allowing him to become eligible for Medicaid or\nPut it all into a pool trust depending on his age and how the numbers play out also avoiding the five year waiting period yes there'll be a pay back provision on both\nBut at least you'll beyond medicate ... and when I say a pay back provision that's really a state recovery right so instead of worrying about it going to probate because it's in a pool of trust\nThat trust itself has the language that says we don't need to worry about probate it's going to say right in the document after you die pay back the state at least the amount of benefits you received from Medicaid\nTakes some advice folks avoid the last minute dance do your planning in advance do it right\nMake sure your trust is drafted properly how do you know what shouldn't shouldn't be in your trust well Todd has written a guide for the month of October it's designing and income only ... trust in at your last chance to

very Armstrong representative Armstrong advisory group and the securities American companies or unaffiliated [noise]\nAnd so sometimes it helps for people to be able to track themselves over time and see how they're doing and again it helps people not be so afraid and I think that that's a really important aspect when dealing with these kinds of diseases you know we used to all be afraid that we're going to get cancer and we didn't want to know and it seems so overwhelming and now everyone is afraid of this\nBack in my day was polio and everybody was concerned that was good to have an eight or something we had shots for a longer is now you mentioned adult children living off Cape ... situation myself I live alone there are a lot of people who live along mhm [noise]\nAnd they are probably a little reluctant if they said something might not quite be a hundred percent correct the little reluctant to come forward because they're\nAfraid they're embarrassed possibly out or we get to the people who are living alone and maybe having the development of of some kind of cognitive impairment\nOne of the really simple ways we do that is to do things like what we're doing right now we get the word out as broadly as we can that help is here that it's free at that it's easy to access and it's in your community\nI think that's the first thing is that people know that there's somebody there so that they are so they don't feel quite so alone were lucky on the Cape we have great services here we have amazing Council on aging we have a terrific healthcare system\nThrough Cape Cod hospital et cetera and Cape Cod health\nThere's a there are a lot of resources people's uh church's faith communities are very very strong\nSense of community mindedness is very strong so a elder services Cape Cod in the islands I Would be remiss if I didn't give them a shot up they do a Yemen's job of keeping track of people so that you know the good news is there's a lot of help out there to be had\nUnfortunately we know that that one of the terrible symptoms of this disease is isolation so part of what we do is provide a lot of social and cultural events so that people can get out of the house\nAnd we every one way or the name tags because one of the reasons why people stop wanting to socialize it's because they're embarrassed that they don't remember people's names so a simple way to level\nPlaying field is for everyone to our name tag and I'll tell you that\nThe middle aged among us are more than happy to put our name tax 'cause nobody remembers names very well [noise] um but that's one of the small things that we know that we can do to accommodate people with memory loss and encourage that encourages them to re enter\nTheir communities to go back to church or go back to um the choir that they used to sing and go back to their bridge game so you know all of these things are\nSymbiotic um and have to do with making our communities\nAre more accessible and more accommodating to people who are living with these kinds of diseases and that means we have to do a better job of educating our community so that's another fundamental piece of the service we provide as we do a lot of\nFree of charge educational programs you\nAlso have a large caregiver community because usually it's it's it's not a disease you can really do all those are certainly cannot you know and you need to have a show that he would you talk about caregivers and what's involved and being a caregiver with your family member or someone from the outside\nWell as you say these are not diseases that anyone can have alone\nAnd there certainly are diseases that don't present the same in any two people who have them or any to families that are navigating them so our strategy is to get to know people as well as we can in order to provide them with the with the service it's going to suit their needs the most particularly\nCaregivers tend to neglect themselves they're going to put the needs of their loved ones ahead of their own so that means they're typically going to miss their own medical appointments\nThey're going to stop doing the kinds of social activities they used to do a et cetera and we know that especially in the spousal caregiving community um among older people\nUm the health outcomes for caregivers has often worse than it is for the people who are living with the disease\nSo part of our um our mission is to support caregivers in as many ways as we possibly can understanding that as they go so the person in their care is going to go and it's a little like that old\nAdage on the airplane where you put your oxygen mask on first we want to make sure that our caregivers are as healthy as happy as they can possibly be and that means helping them reduce the amount of stress that they live within a disease uh that can take two to Twenty years from diagnosis to death\nAnd that means a lot of years of what turns into twenty four hour care\nFor someone and um it's it's a really really hard job for a young healthy person\nIt's exponentially more difficult for people who are older um men of a certain generation don't come into this with great care getting skills because they were out earning a living and cetera so\n... uh men typically may not know how to do the laundry they may not know how to cook quite so well and they may not know some of these basic caregiving skills and they\nDo a almonds job of learning very very quickly how to care for somebody that they love so\nIt's a it's an endeavor that we think uh um should be honored and upheld in our culture and is often or not um unpaid family caregivers makeup you know millions and millions of dollars of\nOf lost wages and ah ill health so um we feel like rather than penalize these people we should be honoring them and supporting them\nAnd what they're doing how do you go well supporting them\nWell we um first of all we have support groups up and running in every town on the Cape\nWe run nearly fifty support groups a month for caregivers for people with the disease so if a caregiver can't leave their personal alone but needs to come to a group they can bring that person with them and we run an activities group simultaneously with our caregiver support group we also run support groups are people who are in earlier stages of decline\nI'm so support groups are really big way for people to build their communities expand\nUm their knowledge base um all of our support groups are run by professionals so they are people who come to the group will not only get the benefit of their peers but they'll also get the benefit of the professional running the group\nWe do ongoing found support for people's so we have a four practitioners in our office who whose job it is a to touch base with caregivers at least once a month\nMore or less if people need it understanding that these are progressive diseases and just when you think you have it all figured out something's going to change so\nAnd and part of the added benefit to that is that people are making relationships with somebody over time so some folks um our phone people have been talking to you for three or four years every month and you really get to know somebody over those amounts of time\nUm so we do phone support and then the other kind of pillar of clinical work that we do is um supportive counseling um family meetings\nEt cetera that kind of thing so people need more individual help in care planning on\nAh some counseling around issues involving caregiving or old timers in dementia that's another thing we do where part of\nA study through New York university\nThat uses teleconferencing as a way to bring whole families together no matter where they are in the world with the counselor to be able to\nUm discuss and process what's happening um in terms of the caregiving and so what happens is everybody's on the computer and it's like Hollywood Squares you see everybody's face\nUm and this brings all members of the family into the conversation and helps people understand that\nYou know people think that if you're not there to drive somebody to an appointment or prepare a meal that there's nothing you can do to help\nBut we actually know that that isn't true part of what you can do is listen to somebody and understand what's happening and through having a deeper understanding of what's happening\nTo the people in your family um you support that primary caregiver so maybe dad ah gets really nervous around four o'clock so a kid could and that's when\nHis wife is starting to prepare dinner\nOne of the adult children in Montana can called out every day at four o'clock and say hey what do you do in and get them through that rough part and you wouldn't otherwise known that if he didn't understand the daily ness\nOf the disease and what it looks like so we're really trying to help people build their own teams their own a network of support\nAgain a dependent on on what their family situation is or what their caregiving situation is\nLet's give them the phone number you know the goal\nFive zero eight eight nine six five one seven zero\nOkay folks were give it to you again they'll someone does call you and says\nMy father has been diagnosed with also every [noise] what do you Jews and goes are coming to you and they don't really know what to ask right they just say well I was guided to you and what do I do though\nWhen we turned into done for any and ask a lot of questions so um we try and get as much information as we can about about who the person is um are they in a crisis or not are they the beginning of trying to figure this out a lot of times people will not pick up the phone and call you until something's gone terribly wrong\nAnd the ...

[noise]\nThis spectrum our weekly public affairs program at I hearts media Cape Cod where we take a closer look at the issues events and people affecting the Cape and now young Bernie [noise]\nGood morning welcome to spectrum in the segment of the program we're going to be talking about\nTechnology and you might say to yourself Doug you've done a program on this before and the answer is yes has with the same gentleman entomologist Larry gaps issues with the Cape cod cooperative extension Larry good to see if it's a great back in Studio with you it is getting to be unloaded put a special seat there just for you [laughter]\nWell Larry has been involved with the project that we want to talk about this morning so that it continues you're familiar with ... ladies and gentlemen with\nTics some of the things you can do to avoid being bitten and all those various things so Larry has just completed a a call the technology project where he has put together ten videos\nThey run from six to eleven minutes\nAnd they're ten of them are each one was a a different topic and Larry should've been a college professor because these are extremely well done ladies and gentlemen and easy for you to sit there and take notes and at some point you do come around and would give a test drive um\nWe can we can and and uh there'll be opportunities for extra credit\nOkay good health so I've taken the first ten I'm ready for the next and so let's start out by talking about the technology project how it came about why you\nDid it we've been getting support consistently from Cape Cod healthcare through their community benefits grant program and so when the last grant cycle called for proposals came up I was trying to think okay what do we want to do\nWe've done a couple of years of supporting to testing we've done direct mailing soil Cape Cod houses trail signs and I got to thinking that I Do a lot of outreach I Do workshops at libraries and senior centers and\nEvents like health fairs and conservation days but those events don't always match up with people's schedules of that of people that want to learn more about how to protect themselves from these terrible risks of these five tick borne diseases that we know of and so I thought well let's take a workshop\nAnd break it up into ten pieces and let's see video it\nAnd have graphics and see how that flies and so we did get a grant from kid caught healthcare for for twenty five thousand dollars to support the project so then we put it out forbid and Cape Cod community media center and Dennis came up with the winning bed so we started collaborating with them\nAnd the advantage you're working with them is that they have a television studio which afford me a lot of latitude on\nThe type of format and and how we were going to construct this thing and I will tell you it was a lot harder than I thought it was going to be we spent six months working on this and are there are a lot it takes and retake some retake sin looking at it and saying that\nDoesn't work let's let's try it this way so they were very good about coaching me but we finished the project and so basically if you're interested in something or like tick identification in ecology yeah we've got a segment on that\nHow do you ... to treat your clothing and foot where and what's the deal on ... in terms of toxicity\nYeah we get a video on that how do you get a tick tested shirt I'm sitting here at my computer and I'm just showing you how easy it is to do these type of things so it was a lot a demonstration and practical information and I will say in these ten segments which rose up to about Ninety minutes\nWe put in everything including the kitchen sink\nYes you did there are ten great topics here folks and we're going to talk about a couple of them here this morning how did you feel about doing this television was no audience in front of your virtual audio ... that\nWas something I didn't expect is that you find yourself you're you're alone in a television studio and you have to be laser focus for six to eleven minutes\nYou don't have a script you don't have a teleprompter you have some visuals to talk of of so you've got this information layered up in your head like your air traffic controller\nIt's information traffic controller and it's frustrating that you might get in to seven minutes of a nine minute video and you stumble over yourself we've got to restart\nSo some of these bloody things took upwards of nine takes and it was exhausting but when we finally looked the finished product quite frankly they came up better than we had hoped\nAnd so we're we're now trying to market this thing push it out and actually some people we've posted on our website we put out a press release we've been getting media coverage such as we're doing this morning and to raise awareness of this in in the recruits outside of Orange County that watcher activities\nAnd so there are there are other places Massachusetts that are looking at you know the opportunity to host these videos on\nTheir Web sites I was contacted by a group in Australia the RCs have discovered me how\nWas your first trip down under Mike McGuire my director said that it can happen [laughter] but I think it's funny that I get a lot of good eye mates from from the people I'm communicating with down there's there's a tick borne disease or awareness group down under\nAnd and they want these videos as part of their education package so we are we're happy to share it but we want to see\nReal big distribution on Cape Cod because we think it can provide a lot of benefit\nThe way that you access the series folks is very simple it's something that you know all about it I'm sure it's on YouTube\nSo if you go into YouTube and search ... or search Larry ... I asked this all all pop up and there you'll be\nSure the other way you can do this is just go to our website Cape Cod extension dot org\nWe have a two page and you just scroll down a little a little ways and click on it and it's going to bring up a playlist and get a snappy introduction to get your attention right up front and I'd be curious to get people's feedback on them as well\nFolks may not know what the cooperative extension is\nCan we just take a moment until people they access your Web site they're going to the Cape cod cooperative second shirt was up its many thing\nIn ... we have a group of Eighteen different people that are involved in things like horticulture our master gardening program\nThat has its ways drop off program that people are probably familiar with we have a marine program that works closely with the shellfish growers on the Cape we have four H. we've got\nThe pet sitter most effective which um I did realize its its dogs primarily\nNot so much cats in fact it doesn't like cats get Lyme disease at all but it's quite common and pooch is but horses and and goats which I I didn't know\nGo throughout their email mhm so if your dog or\nWhatever other pet you may have you need to check the for every time they come in ...\nWell checks depending on the the dog I mean I had a black Labrador a tick checks are are pretty tough but\nThere there are products that are available that or even if you can't find the ticks on the dog so the either products like canine advantage to you know the topical or the rest of the color\nBut but Katie brown and walk people through you know\nEach of those in in the importance of talking with your veterinarian so she brings a lot of good points to the surface so again it's it's a it's a good segment\nYou mentioned just in passing dogs and lime disease mhm dogs can contract low yeah is very very common very common as it as severe as it is with humans [noise]\nIt it's it's similar in humans because not everybody's sick the\nSame way so so in ... in it like both of my dogs at it I never I never would have realized Labrador is they both tested positive I'm looking at the symptoms I should have been looking for as things like left their gee well all their their labs they're they they're here in the moment um\nLack of appetite uh if if my lab's didn't go to their food bowl uh for dinner it's not because of Lyme disease it's because they're dead\nUh [laughter] so it or there's no food in the bowl no uh but but I Know I've talked to hundreds\nOf dog owners in my time here in in some cases it can you know result in like the people problems you know the the what looks like rheumatoid arthritis so they get lame and can't walk and and so yeah you see different manifestations\nWhen the treatment be the same as it is for human beings\nThat I don't know and I I I don't even stray into that arena and just scary I don't see the effects are yeah I don't have a qualified medical opinion since I'm I'm just a bug guy\n[laughter] and easier to bugging you this morning votes never heard that one before and I'm sure I was out of work I Try to sell the original\nOne of these days I gotta do away with my ... talk idea so as we begin to wind down a little bit let's look back and what do you want people to take away from this program\nThat that we have developed the most comprehensive\nUh educational tool that's out there you go out there and look for tick videos and there's certainly a number from out there and I looked at basically all of them\nAnd they they all have a lot of shortcomings and so we put a product out there that covers everything you could possibly want to learn\nAnd and we just put in every single piece of\nPractical science based\nEvidence based um information and right now I'd I'd put that educational package up against any resource it's out there on the Web\nThe the ones that I've watched I agree because they go and much more deaths than you and I do hear on the program exactly they really give you a much better feel folks for what the problems are with tics and they're going to be people out there right now we're going to say\nOh this is the fall the tick season is over\nOh sure that's that's the um [noise] it's one of the misconceptions about you know a cold weather you know or a phrase and and so people associate that would end the mosquito season and that's certainly correct\nBut chicks over it takes lived through the ice age okay how the heck did they do that well they adapted over time to be have the ability to synthesize a chemical called cholesterol\nWell what's glycerin all these guys make anti freeze so you can't freezing kill them all they do is become inactive will so whenever you get temperatures above freezing and no snow cover of active topics [noise]\nSo I tell people when they want to know when tick season is because people think that there's a starting an end to it well there is a chick season started January first ... in December thirty first and pick up again January first\nShe that's almost a year\nJust to buy just about so it's it's like you have to be vigilant year round and it's not hard to do if you even do the right tactics and um\nIt it's it is we're not building a rocket ship here on the tactics that we've outlined we've dismissed a lot of tactics that other extension programs recommend a because there's no data you see a lot of recommendations move your birdfeeders well there's no data to support that [noise]\nSo we've distilled this down to you know tick checks and for me through treaty clothing\nUm a perimeter yard spray for which we have a demonstration video and pet protection one two three\nNow we have come to the end of our time most till the folks one more time how they can see this series\nShirt you go to Cape Cod extension dot org\nOr we have a ... page scroll down there'll be a little banners says for Arctic videos you know click here and it'll pull up a playlist in and you don't have to watch number one through ten you can you can pick and choose which ones are most interest right and and\nOne ... one of the things I tell people is if you're learning something\nTake and share this information I Would love people to socialize this send it out to all your friends and relatives you know members of your family or because they can benefit too\nSo that gives you some idea of how serious a this issue with takes is I Want to thank Larry ... says he's the\nSmall which is ... kick a cooperative extension for coming back with us or get to talk about the new video series technology and hopefully folks you will a drop in and look at the mall or one or two or whatever 'cause you're going to get a lot of information feast on Alton\nWarm blankets your grass journal and\nYou can do that as well that's not a problem um it's one of the reasons why I'm Talking about doing it now is we still have a bunch of a leaf dropped to happen\nYou know this the nor'easter we just had\nA yesterday in into this morning dropped a lot of the leaves so I like to not use all of them you know there's there's tons of hundreds of thousands leaves that are on the trees you know especially in my area of a bunch of trees around the house\nUm I like to just at this point in previous cut them up and bag them into the lower and use them in into like a compost pile on and get that going you can definitely use it to have that ... over the the lawn\nAnd see I see no problem with that at all it's all up and down the hill you can overdo it having too much\nYeah if you have too many you know say you got you know three four five inches that might be a little bit too much to do a ... you know next top dressing an inch maybe inch and a half a hamster thing you've got to look at is in the spring\nThat's so it's not just about having too much it's about the follow up in the spring\nI Would back them all up in the spring is you know\nYeah it's so definitely some of that going to be broken down and it's going to add neutrinos the soil but in the spring you want as much sunlight to be hitting the ground as possible you know by by cleaning those up\nIt's going to allow the sun to get in there and help any of the roof growth uh for the other for the other you know blades of grass\nIn the morning if you leave it on and starts

in the um\nThe trunk is about four feet tall they ran into him and then the branches just take a grown beautiful you know it went down to see how we made out after all the heavy rain and wind and\nRub the trunk of the way round up to [noise]\nSo it as it recent a sea in like the flush is just it's it's like I'm obviously it's going to be wet from the weather but is it like a different type of wet like you're you can feel that can be him everything that's in there\nI didn't even touch but I Know right right on the ground around a cheese shooting [noise]\nWell [noise] you know it might it might be the end of the tree but there are some things that you can do to try to protect it\nHow they carry a garden centers it's like a a cardboard but it's a a light cardboard thinner cardboard that you can wrap around the trunk 'em let it be a trunk a protector foot around their boat you know to go that four foot up\nYou know usually you can do it some pretty tight I'm ... and make sure it stays that way they also sell plastic ones where they go around the trunk sometimes she might even the amount of garden center a when trees coming in the spring they might have some protection underneath there is\nYou could also take like a burlap bag or some burlap and put it around the trunk to try and protect it\nYou know take a look and see one of the things you could also do ... and you know it's it's hard I I don't always like to do it unless I'm really\nNot sure there's no insects and it it seems like a I'm a ...\nThe thing about it is is that it's black when it gets sprayed out so it's the the trucks going to look completely different than it ever has obviously it already looks completely different because there's no bark on it but it feels around it usually what that does sometimes though is it seals insects or anything that are in it\nIn it it just feels that part up\nIt might it might be worth doing just to help protect the tree for the winter uh you could try again like that cardboard\nUm it's a really light cardboard biodegradable cardboard that you can put around um it's almost like paper thin with little ridges on it you can get around there to protect it or you could try the plastic are usually in a white plastic that you could do an inch and a half caliber like that easily can be done\nThe other thing you know if you're worried of in the area is spraying semi repels all from bone eyes to keep the deer away idol last usually about thirty days they have the liquid in granular forms spread that out in the yard make a perimeter around the areas that you're concerned about um [noise]\nThat could be you know the the second thing to really do to help so if they're not going to come for other trees or you know it's\nIt's a shot at this point if it's done that much damage it it might not be good for the tree but you know\nI was wondering because going all the nutrients and everything go up to bark and watch the strip the trees all done\nYeah and you know if it's fresh what you're seeing the the bark on the ground it might be okay to do just to try it that's why it was suggested neither the the printer sealer or the that that like corrugated um cardboard ... material or to help to to cover it\nYou you don't want all the elements and everything to get in there and and just be sitting on it that type of thing and you're trying to keep it away from any of the small rodents or insects there'll be chewing on it because now it's easier for them you know for like a small rodents it's easier for them to get in a ... to the park because there's not that heavy heavy bark um so\nYou know definitely use either the ... or something to cover around the trunk and really try to help benefit for the winter I think that's one of the only shots you have at this point\nOkay I'll Try that I think I like what you said about spraying it because I really feel it\nIt will and if it's really fresh which it seems like with the bark on the ground you should be All right to use that ... I I just went insects are active and it's it's an old wounds\nAnd spraying that you're just stealing the insects and where's the seems more um fresh and the insects might not be in there so maybe just kind of check around secrecy and anything and kinda you know wipe it down a little bit that type of thing [noise]\nOkay so it's like as far as the nutrients and all the SAT ticket up to where the foliage is is is it that were\nMade it'll help but it's not going to stop any of that from going through so he's definitely try it I'm going to we're going to have to bring justice second now so\nHopefully that helps you you have to do just as a day\nEvery week what a grand made possible by me of course you know if you really want to give credit where credit's due for a living at five after the hour every hour starting at six am one thousand dollars a year old Bob but for us and nowhere else to go but thank you for that there are no\nThank you for regular now regardless of who was responsible for your child I Would remain\nA grand in your hand on your radio Ninety five [noise] WMGK\n[noise] people still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just\nSettling but when you think about it\nWe are in Cape Cod local news authority WICK west you're much Cape Cod and I urge radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK\nIsolated from ABC News I'm going to run the are the people who died in yesterday's synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh have yet to be identified but authorities say eight of them were men three women Pittsburgh mayor ... says he doubts armed guards could have prevented the massacre as President Trump has said\nOn have that freestyle effect\nCan also up put it in like a garage a but it needs that during the period to be ready for next year I'm so you can do it again next year\nIf you want to bring it in so you can use it all winter so you can see the flowers that type of thing you're going to have to continue to take care of it and work with it that way um but usually like I said they have a dorm and see period so that's why you would put it in a pot water right now maybe water it or about once a month maybe a little bit less\nUh going for the for the entire winter I you don't want the root system to stay wet you want it to you know have a little bit of water in there so it will survive but at the same time you know you kind of let it snow let it sit and forget about it a bit\nOkay and um is this the right time to add fertilizes at fertilizer or hemlock [noise] I have a a a soldier's road blocks\nSo you can easily use Holly tone on them at this time of year I don't have ...

the\n... the ... there are certain ones that will definitely growing clusters\nWhen they when they um when they bloom and they have their their their um a plant so they definitely do I\nHave I so I should cut any of 'em are already\nKnow how I get real I wouldn't see a lot of people have will have problems getting flowers on the the plant so it will have more fruit\nOr that you're actually benefiting well from having them like that you definitely want to have the flowers come in and and blossom for you and have them all in clusters like that you should be fine it's really a wild one other suggestion if I could\nUh for you would maybe looking into a I don't I don't know what size pot you have them in but maybe getting a little bit bigger pot to\nGive half the man that twenty five gallon one of those done well never mind co-op one yeah no I never mind that's a that's a good size on then I had to walk in and out\nOkay are they spaced out nicely I Would assume or what\nThey want
