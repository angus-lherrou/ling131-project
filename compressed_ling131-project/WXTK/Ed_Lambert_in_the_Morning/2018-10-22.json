W the big ... the big flame thrower [laughter] uh we're a bunch of other things too but I won't get into it right now so uh before I get into some politics is actually I Want to talk about\nThe Baker Charlie Baker I I like Charlie Beck I like the governor\nBut I can understand why if you're a conservative Republican there are times you just shake your head at the sky and it's like dude are you a Republican or Democrat women seriously which high and Republicans say that a lot of Republicans\nFor having supposedly the most popular governor in the country who is a Republican it's amazing how many Republicans as anecdotal I suppose but uh how many Republicans bad mouth Charlie bacon they don't like him at all and I really don't like him and it's this because this is it what are the caller said to me one day [noise] pat\nThere's a little too much of that reaching across the aisle stuff with the sky and they don't like you know a little too much cooperation with the Democrats and hey\nYou want what you know you want what you want but there was a um debate a I'm\nW. GBH about five days ago I think it was Wednesday of last week and it was the most bizarre thing I'm going to play the sound for you the most ... thing I've ever seen\nAnd it didn't get as much attention as I thought it would particularly because you know a Senator Warren Elizabeth Warren a the lioness of the United States Senate ladies and gentlemen\nThe next president some people will tell you the United states of America and of course it just drives a lot of people Republicans absolutely insane uh and she's got a feisty competitor a Jeff deal who's a state representative seems like a a good a fellow I don't think he has a chance\nThat's a beating her running to the polls that are out but ah he's he's in there he's fighting and they're doing or you know they're doing debates and stuff like that and Charlie Baker this is what's weird\nGovernor Baker has publicly endorsed Jeff deal for the United States Senate that's a fact\nSo I'm listening the other night to my friend Jim rowdy and his wife hosting a debate on W. GBH wasn't up to date I guess and about halfway through and of course ... a wise guy and and he was kneeling anyway and uh the Democratic opponents are an opening and he took a J Gonzalez\nAnd um ... what was coming up was\nGovernor bakers supportive Geoff Diehl Jeff deal as you may or may not know was like Donald Trump's guy\nIn the election\nHe was like the co chair or something some title like that I mean Jeff deal and I'm not criticizing the man I'm just saying if you don't know I'm telling you Jeff deal is a Donald Trump guy\nAnd if he gets into the United States Senate he gonna have President Trump's back\nOr it's not it's it's a it's a it's a great campaign lined by the way a lot of people will vote for Jeff deal just because of that because the support or\nThe support Donald Trump certainly in this this debate the other night you got the clip ready they're a map in this debate about about thirty minutes into the debate this question of deal and his support for Trump and governor Baker and his Democratic opponent John J. Gonzales are sitting there in the studio\nAnd and Charlie Baker is not a Trump guy\nHe said he wasn't going to vote for Donald Trump in the election he has criticized and continues and I'm not criticizing Charlie Baker I think in may be right about some things his criticism of President Trump you know\nCharlie Baker is not a President Trump supporter it's quite clear but yet he\nHas publicly endorse the campaign of Jeff deal who is clearly a huge Donald Trump supporter getting the the problem here and this was being you know chatted about on this on this uh television a debate the other night so we're going along and\nAnd the moderators uh are are doing their thing and then suddenly\nA stroke of brilliance a slight break if you will for the Democratic challenger Jay Gonzales it's Gonzales says you're about to hear who suddenly interrupt since ... an ass Charlie Baker a really really really good question here's the W. GBH debate from a Wednesday night\nFor him but I mean are you going to vote for Jeff deal [noise]\n\nGoing I'm going to vote for uh for me and I'm going to vote for Karen polio and I'm\nTo um [noise]\nVote for a series of other candidates as well I don't know what I'm going to the respect of that one you don't know if you're gonna vote for the guardian endorsed decision\nThe you're asking people in Massachusetts to vote for Jeff deal and you're not even gonna vote\nFor him I said I was going to support the ticket and I do but you may not vote for the second I'll make my decision eventually I'll make sure people know why\nYou're telling people to I mean to me this comes down to clear loyalty for the Republican Party\nOver or someone ... supporting issues like pro choice in women's rights and algae tiki rights which\nLet's be clear Jeff deal is the the share of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts seem to be a rubber stamp for Donald Trump select a agenda in Washington and he would do everything in his power to under cut these very rights that you say support and you say you're clear on your position\nIt sounds like you're clear in asking the people that states than Jeff deal the United states that\nI'm very clear in my position on these issues and I've worked very hard on them here in Massachusetts and I'm going to continue to work hard on him here in Massachusetts\nHow many you just said a ... he said okay so that's the uh peace if you want to comment on it I mean what's the question here does Charlie Baker support Jeff deal a or not really and uh\nSupposedly what the media is writing is that after this debate on a Wednesday night\n[noise] uh and the you know show debate was over\nA on on public television there was a media there are covering the debate and they went right over to Charlie Baker and they asked the same question of governor Baker that his Democratic opponent Jay Gonzalez asked them on air on the debate is you know are you gonna vote for Jeff\nDeal I mean you publicly have endorsed his campaign [noise]\n\nWhat's going on I mean what what is the deal here but you can't say whether you vote for him and not so supposedly um\n[noise] according to one meter report that I'm reading\nA the reporters went over to Charlie Baker after this interview on they asked him about this and uh he did a one hundred and eighty degree\nAnd said yes I'm going to vote for Jeff deal and that has gotten\nSome reporting but not a whole lot of reporting I've noticed\nAnd if you read newspapers like the Boston or\nA Harold or they are just crashing\nA Charlie Baker over this are they are really upset I never quite understood why but I'm Jeff deal\nHas an amazing amount of uh uh uh in certain circles of media support a talk radio adores him um uh the Boston Herald really adores him a few other media outlets out there they really like Jeff deal a lot\n[noise] um so what the governor did was like ... ... she was like did they did not understand we like this at all because it clearly which team or the governor Baker is not going to vote a for a Jeff deal or at least he doesn't really want to vote a for Jeff\nDeal ... and\nJeff deal frankly could use some help and there was a couple of the columns over the weekend in the Boston Herald um uh was it a Jeff Jacoby I think it is is pretty good a columnist for the Boston Herald he wrote a very scathing as to how he car who's on this radio station in the afternoons from three to seven\nUh really scathing commentary about governor Baker on this you know like what what's going on with you\nYou know you're running as a Republican man and all this stuff and and you want Republicans to support you but if skews my candor here but you ... it seems like you're willing to screw the Republican candidates for the United States Senate governor Becker what is your problem well\nThere's also commentary ... some of the side of the Boston Globe they know what the problem is I think the difficulty piece mentioned this as well it's just that that Charlie Baker is Republican light\nAnd he is really really really really into reaching over the other side of the aisle and working with Democrats and uh there was a story this weekend for example in the news some unprecedented number of a Democratic governors and democratic um [noise]\nAnd you know here's a question Ron that I'm curious about and I know like me you're a local political junkie and I I I'm watching from a distance with great fascination the state rep race from botched up all the second a district we will Crocker in this new ...\nAnd I know I noticed that Charlie Baker is all over the radio endorsing will Crocker if governor Baker lived in ... would he actually vote for will crock\nAh well that's a good question that's a good question\nWhat are the reason for that it was a\nWell Crocker's wipe is the ... the Republicans pick committee woman for the area so that I think that the the water and Lauren I'm a much else but\nIt may or may not but but if governor governor beggars campaign as I read has endorsed officially the Geoff Diehl campaign wouldn't you think governor Baker would be a candidate and they think\nYou would think so but then again you know the you know you got the struggle going on probably with him personally and then\nUh you like the belly you that you've done all this uh ... I'm a elected Democrats will eat a lot of I think he does\n... don't want to snowball stuff and then a lot of his policies and positions on issues the more you know to the Democratic party than the Republican\nParty I think I think that's part of a tumor on or is that a governor Baker is cow town to both Republicans and Democrats and and Democrats to be honest about it they don't just disliked Donald Trump they hate his guts\nAnd er so governor Baker wants their vote for governor bigger to go far with too far with the Jeff deal saying he may in fact start alienating a democratic voters here in Massachusetts\nWell the the ... ... ... the Republican base though you know I guess he wants to every day is cake and eat it so I Hope\nThat the that the ...\nAlways enjoy chatting thanks Ron yeah

thousand votes at the end of the day on November six we need to make sure that we get our vote out or we need to be sure that other folks that have committed to was a will come forward\nOr right now uh as you probably know a today begins a early voting October twenty second or running for the next week and a half or so were you know obviously I'd go after those votes were going after her absentee

too long ago um by [noise]\nThe terrible accident with a great white shark um but more importantly I think we really have to take a look at that very very closely um\nEspecially when you look at a shocks being on the endangered species act and that's not something that we can change\nSo we need to look at scientific evidence we need to look at scientific reasoning as to why things are happening the way they are I mean I have my own belief um\nAs a a fourth generation family Cape Cod her uh my family was all on the fishing industry the fishing business um [noise] I Know that when you bring in sales you're bringing sharks and that's a common sense a kind of a factoid or if you will but we need to find a way to balance it\nDo you have to be careful how I wear this too on on a scale of one to ten John ten being extremely so one now it's not on the radar screen how important is that shark issue [noise] well\nI think it's a critical issue uh in terms of a tourism or related services are down in Cape Cod especially in the national seashore you know it's probably a you know a seven or eight because anything that impacts tourism on Cape Cod\nOr is going to a is going to impact the economy and when you look at the number of cells that have come on uh to the islands especially a Muskie get a in some of the other smaller islands in and around the attack at\nUC that we have an over abundance of them so as a result shocks coming in my folks come to Cape Cod to to to to basically swimming our beaches and if they are afraid to go to the beaches somewhere down the road that's going to have a negative impact so we need to figure out a way to resolve this\nWill be back with John after a break your news radio Ninety five ... of the news this report is sponsored by staples\nDo when

I live in comic where I live on Kevin Elaine people know who I Am they know what I'm about uh there's so many folks who I've met along the way that even tell me that they're not even sure what Julian

particularly a tax policies and they they pack that to keep our citizens here there's no reason we should be forced to move a and move away from my friends and family I'll hang up and listen to respond to\n... thanks Gary John [noise]\nYeah well in terms of ah retirees I couldn't agree more uh as I mentioned uh uh when I was being interviewed by the Cape cod times of for a an endorsement I told them and I I thought one of the first things that I Would do\nOr would it be to take into consideration a finding a bill that would allow for anybody who has worked in the state of Massachusetts for Twenty years plus in his retired to be exempt from taxes are at the state level for the first hundred thousand dollars so that we don't lose the to Florida we don't lose them to New Hampshire where there is a\nNo I'm a state income tax so first and foremost I support that I think those of us were paid into the system for twenty thirty forty on some cases fifty years I should get a little a little perk uh um when we're basically a little bit older are so that we can have a little bit more ah expend all money or a little bit more um\nA opportunity or if you will to uh to be able to uh to stay in the state which is an expensive state\nA relative to drugs or you know as I mentioned earlier you know my opponent supports the um\nThe safe injection sites which I'm opposed to a you know we do have a scourge of a opioid a related drugs are in a it's an epidemic uh and that's not only on Cape Cod in the islands but it's up and down a\nUh the east coast a mid West is it's it's across the United states we need to look at that and I think uh what we now have in place throughout the current governor ... trying to\nMake sure that folks that are ah are the folks that that they do have a drug problem or do get Ninety Days to a hundred a hundred days are covered by health care or to basically helping them wean off of that particular drug whatever that opioid might be\nOn so I Would be supportive of that also so overall you've you've hit on a number of different issues that I think are critical a number of different issues especially when you when you brought up the ... the whole idea of illegal immigrants that does cost us two billion dollars ... two billion that's with a beat 'em\nThat two billion dollars could be spent other ways uh I I think that there are are there a

five one you know if it's not too much of a burden on you\nYou know what I think I Would like to do because we played it right at the beginning of the show I think this is a big deal\nI can I get you to play that W GBH\nA debate moment with Charlie uh a Baker and Jay Gonzalez short we're going to go now All right I just I I Want to play this again for everybody now mind you I like Charlie Baker I voted for governor Baker I'm One of those people I'm a registered independent but I'm One of those guys I think it's important particularly in Massachusetts\n... you gotta if you're a Republican you got to work with the Democrats you have no choice\nIs not a question of what you want to do if you don't you really are in trouble\nBecause the Democrats are control but I I Want to say that going into this I like Charlie Baker [noise]\nUh but I sometimes politically speaking I shake my head at him he's got people like at the Boston Herald and I think a lot of conservative Republicans I I think are quite angry with Charlie Baker this is just one example of something but this one really blew me away I was I was watching the debate\nUm uh on\nPublic television between governor Baker and his Democratic challenger Jay Gonzales\nAnd it was just amazing to me and and broadly set 'em up I I Do the same thing I suppose friday set them up a little and Jay Gonzales was given a chance to attack and ... and Charlie bakers democratic opponent he really he he he laid some gloves to punch on Charlie Baker what was it all about well\nWe're about to play for you about thirty minutes into the it short about thirty minutes into the debate this was last Wednesday night I just find this amazing the Charlie Baker did this\nAnd Charlie Baker was asked\nAre you gonna vote for Jeff deal Jeff deal as a Republican I've never met him but I think I'd like him he's a go getter\nHe's you know the little guy going up against the giant quite frankly but the guy has got the stuff to to give it a whirl lot of people like a representative deal\nHe's going up against a very liberal Democrat Elizabeth Warren I Believe most of the polls are showing that Elizabeth Warren is going to win this thing on November six but that aside for a second there is still a lot of energy that I hear out there for Jeff deal\nBut definitely deal needs some help he does he needs he needs a major player in politics to step up for him [noise]\nCharlie Baker supposedly is the most popular governor in the entire country\nYeah [noise] so Charlie bakers asked and joy bakers\nIn pain has endorsed Jeff deal that's a fact so during this debate Wednesday night governor bakers asked a question\nAbout are you going to ... are you going to vote for a Jeff deal what do you think would be an obvious answer from the governor here is the GBH Wednesday night's debate\nIt off for having are you going to vote for Jeff deal [noise]\n\nGoing to I'm going to vote for ah for me and I'm going to vote for Karen polio and I'm\nTo um for\nFor a series of other candidates as well I don't know what I'm going to do you expect to that one you don't know if you're a vote for the guardian endorsed minutes isn't\nThe you're asking people in Massachusetts to vote for Jeff deal and you're not even going to\nVote for him I said I was going to support the ticket and I do but you may not vote for him to make that decision eventually I'll make sure people now [noise] so I'm\nTelling people to I mean to me this comes down to\nClear loyalty for the Republican Party over a someone\nAs she supporting issues like pro choice and women's rights and algae tiki rights which\nLet's be clear Jeff deal is the the share of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts seem to be a rubber stamp for Donald Trump select a agenda in Washington and he would do everything in his power to under cut these very rights that you say support and you say you're clear on your position\nIt sounds like you're clear and asking the people in the states that send Jeff deal to the United States Senate\nI'm very clear in my position on these issues and I've worked very hard on them here in Massachusetts and I'm going to continue to work hard on them here in Massachusetts\nAnd now is that that was a governor bigger had to say about it I I just I'm\nSurprised that Charlie Baker handled it that way now I have to tell you a that after that debate was over there has been some media reporting but not a lot uh there were reporters in the uh public television studios and they descended upon the governor and wanting to know\nIs that true you're not going to vote for Jeff deal but your campaign endorses his campaign why governance and so he recanted what he said on camera\nA and did a one eighty and said yes I Am going to vote for Jeff a deal so of course now you've got a columnist particularly out of the Boston Herald you've got I think some more conservative type Republicans out there shaking their heads saying they don't know that they don't know what the hell is really going to do\nBut I thought it was interesting and I agree with this and if it sounds like well you're pitching for Jeff deal well maybe I Am a little bit I liked the underdogs are too I ... when Scott Brown first ran\nAnd got elected for the United States Senate that's the Scott Brown I voted for and I liked after that it went downhill so I like this Jeff deal just because he's the underdog and I realize and if you're a realist you realize representative deal needs some help here\nAnd Charlie Baker would be an ideal guy to try to give the guy some owns particularly when you're now days out a from November sex in this important election for Jeff deal against Elizabeth Warren\nAnd uh you know why not and I don't believe the governor has any intention of doing this why not come out and like cold some fundraisers for Jeff deal and host them and put some on behind you know the fact that you are the most popular governor and the entire country or the latest polls have Charlie Baker\nDouble digits or a head of his Democratic challenger J uh Gonzalez but not squad out of Charlie Baker he didn't want to say during this TV debate at least this was my take away he didn't wanna indoors Jeff deal why\nLadies and gentleman you know him you love him he's making America great again because of Donald Trump\nAdd a Jeff deal if you didn't know this is a huge Donald Trump guy and he was the what was the co chair or something like that of Donald Trump's campaign and the state of Massachusetts deal is a Trump guy Jeff deal has said\nOn I suspect we'll get a lot of votes for this or that he's got Donald Trump's back if you put him into the U.S Senate ah\nCharlie Baker does not like President Trump Charlie Baker to this day and I'm not entirely criticizing Charlie Baker I think some of his criticisms of President Trump has actually been kind of on target\nThat's not really the point in the world of politics Charlie Baker to this day continues to criticize and fault or Donald Trump Charlie Baker does not like Donald Trump\nSo it's an awkward all around moment for Jeff deal for Charlie Baker ah for whomever for Republicans are that Charlie Baker endorses the campaign but yet clearly seems to be very hesitant I'm trying to be fair here that he would actually himself going vote for Jeff deal\nI mean talk about screwing a fellow Republican and I think and we had a few phone calls this morning that's what the callers are saying is just you know the classic rhino out of Charlie Baker I find Charlie Baker and interesting man I I as I said I happen to like him I I think he's a good governor I'm okay with the bipartisan stuff I don't care\nThat much about the Jeff deals and lives warns of the world or whatever [noise]\nUm but I Do see the frustration done a lot of Republicans in the state have was Charlie Baker\nAnd uh it's ironic that he is supposedly a some polar poll say those although I Can't for the life of me understand why California would feel this way he is the most popular governor and the entire country so safe simple\nAnd he's obviously a very popular here in uh Massachusetts but he's a lousy Republican\nWell I point this out to you and I'm trying not to take sides I suppose yeah and I will say this there are a lot of people I think good people who really don't like Elizabeth Warren because they don't like her politics they think she is bad\nFor the country and Jeff deal would be a good alternative and I also will say Mike I have to admit Massachusetts\nHas the habit and I think a bad habit of sending nothing but Democrats down to Washington DC in the congressional delegation that's nine ten eleven people from doing the math right\nYou get out of that many people do all those ah Congress people into state senators we can't bring ourselves to send one down there and when the ... Massachusetts Mike to send one Republican down they're seeing how you do have Donald Trump\nOr the Republican or as the president of the United states will not be smart on our part\nOn it you know speaking for myself I ran for office that I was I'm a Republican I wouldn't be backing the president of the United states\nI don't like 'em or what it comes up with um I think we're in for big trouble because ... is way out of whack it's going to catch up on the line\nUm I don't like Elizabeth Warren I just don't like her reasons why but I did watch the debate um friday evening and she cleaned this clock and that's not what's ... what's the point to me is what gets guy that's running against your\nWho is backing president that I think it's good for this country and that's the American\nWay that makes American so I ran into a situation I watched that debate might because I I I obviously haven't had a chance yet but I I'm interested you say she a clean this clock home yeah emails that day\nShe got she she took on it she deserved it has um you know she's she's got to know whether it\nWas like I got on that that cheery mental note I got a break for the news thanks for the call it ...

not everyone agrees with me the Twenty one trillion dollar debt\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are culpable however the latest\nInfusion of a debt was because of that a tax cut that Trump won and

noon or good morning to you sir I Know that's not actually what you wanted to talk about home equity and something that's coming up on your show today but just\nThe a record amount of home equity Americans have fourteen point four trillion dollars\nOf untapped home equity and we ... it it's at the point now where we expect that\nWill start to see people use that to buy cars they'll use it to pay for educations for home improvements we've never seen this much home equity in the country before real estate values have gone up and Americans since the crash of two thousand eight have been very diligent about paying down their debt which is a good thing\nSee my attitude my home is that I Love it that I Know it has equity a lot of equity and I resist really hard Barry not taking out a a second note by borrowing against the house kind of just figure in my old age you know that's going to be a plus for you you got a lot of equity in this property you can borrow then if you need to but
