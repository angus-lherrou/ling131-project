permitted us use the word hate\nOr kill you would never ever communicating that toward another individual now it sounds kinda naive and childish but it it really has stayed with me and in our modern you know social media world and everything and just people using that\nLiberally everywhere every one you know ... get paid you disagree with me you're a hater and again it's a small thing but it begins to perpetuate this ... that everybody disagrees with whatever the issue is it's just a hater\n[laughter] and then it it didn't quite\nTo evil and so on I mean there's this it just seems it just

o'clock Randy hunts going to be joining me in running for real\nOf because I spent nine years serving the town of sandwich on the Finance Committee and six years on the board of select them and I learned those issues and those issues about town financing and how the town's rely on the state\nUh are super important when you're at the state level our governor and our lieutenant governor and even the house speaker were select board members of their respective towns once upon a time\nAnd I think it serves everybody well to have that experience we've also done a lot um I've been identified as somebody who's been working on this opioid crisis for a long time I hate the fact that the introduction of ... no about four years ago when we first saw it in Rhode Island minutes here\nIs now causing over Ninety percent of the overdose deaths it's a killer and it's caused what\nWas going in the right direction to go in the wrong direction for a while but I lie well because it's so deadly that has the reason people used to die on the order of a few hundred not that that's insignificant but a few hundred per year in Massachusetts before all of that sentinel showed up on the street\nNow we had in twenty sixteen\nUh over two thousand people die in twenty Seventeen we had fewer we're only one of seven states in the country who has started to bend the curve\nA but still close to two thousand people and a ... where it's on a slow a dissent unfortunately\nIt you know educate me a little bit or do people go out and say I'm On a drug him on heroin I'm I'm doing coke or whatever it might be but I'm going to go try some fending off I mean it or is it fair no added to some of that stuff to make a deadly it's\nBoth add a there are pills of pure ... know that have been pressed so that's something that could easily kill you they the drug pushers are trying to sell a bigger high or high\nAnd you know people want the latest and greatest and they're not in their right minds when they reasoned about this stuff because quite literally the science says that their brain has been altered and they just do all kinds of things that the normal person would not do\nIs it expensive or it's not um ... and here's another problem\n... know has a real leg up for a couple of reasons it's fifty to a hundred times more powerful than heroin\nOkay that means that you can traffic fifty to a hundred times less of the substance and get the same results so instead of having you know thousands of pounds of heroin that you need to move around just recently in ... and\nThere is a raid on a house that had Seventy pounds of ... to know worth twenty nine million dollars on the street and enough toxicity kill half the population of Massachusetts\nSeventy pounds I'm I'm Sorry to say that there's only a third of what I way but it's easy to move Seventy pounds or something around as opposed to heroin which you would have to have seven thousand pounds of that which is a lot harder to move around so from a supply chain standpoint it's brilliant\nAnd this other drug that we're starting to see carfentanil is another magnitude more powerful\nThan ... no so part of the strategy is that you can get these drugs to where you need to have him without anybody seeing what's going on and they're coming in\nFrom China and it's gonna be like a Breaking Bad eventually a B student in chemistry could put together ... lab with relatively simple compound so I have a feeling that when we do better at shutting the a supply coming in from France in China\nThat people are going to start making it themselves an awful lot of money\nHas gone into a opioids and and the opiates that are out there right now Randy everybody talks about it\nIt's usually number one and number two on their list of what can you do what do you want to do you want to check it and what we're throwing him now tens of millions of dollars at this problem what the hell are we going to do how do you ... ... how did how do you stop the supply if you're not going to stop the demand\nHow you can stop the ... and you can never stopped to supply\nThe answer to the question is you have to stop the demand a I give it a simple analogy of um you know no demand\nNo supply chain of stores a look at blockbuster who goes to blockbuster to rent videos well there is no demand for that so they all close that that's a simple concept\nThe way out of this is to keep people from ever getting to the point where they use these drugs and those people who have been treated and get into long term recovery supporting those people to make sure they stay in long term recovery we just got some money\nFrom twenty five million dollars from the feds under a Medicare waiver\nAnd we put this state foot all of that money into programs to educate and prevent and interdict people before they ever got to the problem and to help with the long term recovery of people so that they don't go back into the problem that's how we squeeze the middle out\nDon't you think that education is a ... as part of that whole thing Randy a is a is a bunch of bologna I mean people already know I mean it's not you're not educating somebody not to not to do heroin or not to coke or not to do ...\nThey already know that they shouldn't be doing it and if their brain is so uh so fried anyway what's this education all about I mean there seems to be an awful lot of soft money gone into education that's not doing a damned bit of good\nNo there's not much money that's gone into it we've spent about one percent of what we've spent overall on education and prevention so we aren't throwing too I'm okay a lot of money and that's part of the problem with second graders fifth grade or seventh graders\nYou know may not know of the dangers but one of the things that we're doing now because of a bill that we passed this last session\nIs that we are screening the nurses are screening kids to find out who the ... who the kids are who are at risk of these and other risky behaviors and intervening or look if you have two parents that scares me\nThat ... does it scare you know look here's the nurse intervening hey honey come here he's in third grade is a seven year old\nMom and dad or drink a\nDead have done a\nMom and dad used to stay home a line there I mean\nI don't know those it's the ... called the protocol is called Asperger's it's screening brief intervention and referral\nTo treatment and it doesn't ask those questions I actually have it on my cell phone so you can see the questions I Love ... send them to me one of these days they absolutely well you can just go to the apple store and download an S. B. I. R. T. programs or you can see what it's like\nThe questions are actually all given to the parents before that's ever asked of the ... and they have the option to opt out if they want to opt out so that covers that\nBut I don't think they were identifying a whole lot of kids\nWho teachers and counsellors and the administration don't already know are at risk for these ... and I agree but it puts a scientific protocol in place that is a little better than just saying you know Johnny seems to be acting up maybe as a problem at home so\nIt covers the PC aspect of a a blowing the whistle on ... like you could say that you know five\nAll eight seven seven five nine nine eight five are toll free phone number is one eight eight eight WICK Ninety five one talking to Randy hunt Republican ...\nOn the line we see it all the time whether it be shine Gannon or anyone else it's out there we have bad people on the streets and we allow them back on the streets because because of why I don't know we got what's his face up there in in the north shore\nA feel good feely that uh does things and and nobody does anything about it and nobody talks anything about it and it's part of I think\nIt's part of all this mentality of\nOf it's not fair or if we if we uphold the law as it stands for federal and state point of view then we're not going to have people that are ah are going to drop a dime because they're afraid and I think that's all bullied baloney Internet itself about dropping it if you're here legally\nAnd you see something that's going on from illegals you're not afraid to drop a dime you're not afraid to tell anybody about it you\nPut your finger exactly on the point there what we're ignoring in those pleased to be humanitarian and all and that these immigrant populations are being preyed upon by their own people and a lot of cases that's true\nBut what we kind of forget is the people that are here illegally who've overstayed their visas who have crossed over the border illegally or just flew in somehow\nUm they're not here legally right let's you know we have to back up a little bit and say do we have a country or do we not have a country if we're not going to have a country and we're just going to leave it wide open then that would be something we can decide to do but it wouldn't be a place I Would\nWant to live but don't hide behind it the people that are out there that are in favor including our own state senator others that are running for representatives don't hide behind your sanctuary are safe communities say that you're in favor of open borders from the United states of America let anybody in and call a spade a spade\nRight that's really the endgame of that without a doubt and let me tell you something Seventy percent of people polled in this state disagree with this whole idea of sanctuary state\nThey um budget on the Senate side was amended by one of the state senators here uh to have the sanctuary state\nOr it didn't get out of conference committee I predicted it would not because I don't think that it would have passed the house um because of so many people that realize what's going on here and the governor and people make no mistake about this he said he would veto a budget\nThat had that in it he would veto that part of the budget for the sanctuary state I Know he would have done that it never got to his desk and
