went and carried a sign somewhere you did a sit down protests that does not make you a veteran okay\nA veteran can be somebody that that you worked on the machine shop all your life you're you're a veteran of whatever that is but the common veteran is a military service\nAnd being a civilian person uh dissing the service does that make you a veteran I Can't believe we're even having these discussions by the way\nI I Can't ... but in this day and age of course we are\nOf course we're having the session oh one of the thing\nAs a kid growing up and I'm sure an awful lot of us had talking about discussions did you ever have that little bottle of of er syrup coffee syrup on the shelf or in the house or something like that\nHave you ever had that and then you as a kid you take a glass of

had that Matt Coffay certain ... well a lot of\nPeople still have coffee syrup alright probably not as much as they used to but it tasted like coffee ice cream by the time you're ... you know we all love that well I read somewhere last night that there's a push that coffee syrup should not be given the kids\nAnd I don't know why because the coffee ice cream and but somehow about how they make coffee syrup that it's not going to be good for kids so therefore coffee milk is not going to be good for kids anymore and that coffee ... I don't get it\nBut that's once you know just one of those things that's out there maybe people don't buy coffee syrup anymore I haven't had it in the house forever and the day but I you know the kids when they're younger as some some of them like to the coffee flavored coffee ice cream you know\nNot a cup of coffee but coffee syrup in your milk anyway that's not good anymore so I just want to get that off my so therefore I take I took on the air force uniforms there's nothing wrong with coffee syrup and oh a veteran is not a veteran if you're holding a sign up somewhere okay\nSo let's just forget about all of that and move on one of the things also I've been told according to two letters to the editor in today's newspaper met [noise] you're probably wondering why am I doing why am I doing this just\nA\nAre two letters today and the letter in the letters to the editor in today's a paper and now I realize or from Louis intro and ed ... meals what the problem was sharks in seals as\nA gay the sharks in seals that are out there that we had a big debate down in wealth late ah different people talked about different things but we now I Know now what the reason is why we have the sharks and the seals and everything else\nAccording to Louis intro\nWhen I was a child there were no seals or sharks in Cape waters\nButts through climate change and natural evolution of migration and pre nation we now have both okay\nSo it's climate change and natural migration systems that now we have both here that's why we have sharks white great whites and that's why we have so many damn seals\nBecause of climate change Edmund down in Martians males that I think it's fair to say that most Massachusetts or most people of Massachusetts think climate change is real All right\nThat means I'm coming to grips with the fact that we can't control the world and we can't control the sharks in the world due to climate change [noise]\nFor\nSo run BT and everybody else and all you people down of wealth late and forget about the seals\nForget about silk pops in seal noses and getting rid of the seals nothing we can do about it because the seals in the sharks the dumb because we have so many here has to do with climate change and migration patterns has nothing to do\nWith the federal lack that are that protect seals and now we as a seven million seals are born every day has nothing to do with the protect it's all about climate change and a natural a migration patterns about seals\nSo you can take all of your stuff blaming a climate change 'cause that's what it is every one or that years ago when they swam here there are no sharks and seals but climate change has caused that\nJust that's the that's the official I think I should say those two letters such a thing\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n... by the way one of the writers went on to say that uh uh that even on NPR she heard that the main reason there are more shark attacks and the reason there are is that there are more people in the water\nThat's the reason why there are more shark attacks through a National Public radio that's what they say and um they called ... or what he says is a simple minded uneducated solution and he doesn't know what he's talking about okay that's a\nThank you very much our local newspaper for printing those two back to back letters to the editor on seals in sharks now we know everything there is to know about it [noise]\n...

able to talk about bringing your Bible to school and everything else that goes with the rights of the of the student\nYeah and I hope so too because I've\nYou know I've seen and I've heard many stories about kids having their uh their face silenced in in schools um I actually actually a witness to I'm In a first grade class I was assisting in a a teacher the teacher gave an assignment and asked if there are any questions or comments\nAnd a little boy raised his hands and said it it's like when God and she came over and she\nGrabbed his arm and she said you can't talk about that here\nAnd I just I remember the shock look on his face and I probably had the same look um it was a one of my friends her daughter's um her daughter and her friends a lot of their heads and and we're praying over their lunch in the cafeteria and a teacher came over and said the same thing you can't do that here um we've had um\n[noise] that I had to do it's not true right\nAnd it's not true and that's a violation of their First Amendment rights a student shouldn't have to\nLeave their faith at the at the door when they go to school in the morning but\nUm the the the schools um they they teach us a secular I'm In a world view you know whether it's ... revisionist history um they don't teach creation as science only um evolution um there there's um [noise]\nGod has basically been race it started back in Nineteen sixty three when prayer was banned from the schools um and and now uh you know when kids um bring up\nI got in the schools that their silence one you know one girl I'm In junior high school she question something that a a teacher taught that contradicted with the Bible said and she was publicly shamed she was told that the the Bible was a book of myth I'm so these these in some\nWays a teacher's this is only good God\nAll yeah all of these things happened on Cape Cod a ... and and found the schools I'm a ... school kids were told that they couldn't wear across to school\nThat's not that's not true they can you know when they crossed the school yup\nAnd they fought it I'm ... and what's interesting going on and found with right now one of our one of our members has actually been standing out holding a sign for the past week you know telling people bring your Bible to to um to school uh and uh she got in a no trespass order\nFrom the school from the um the police department and it listed all the schools are and\nShe wasn't standing on a school ground but the the order said not to stand on not to be on or about the schools so we contacted a lawyer or like with this about me\nSo anyway she moved down the street this was an exciting story um ... you know after after a couple of days people started beeping and waving and cheering um and uh and now like kids are hanging out with the bus windows yesterday of a ... a bus went by and\nShe said all the kids were standing in and they were ... chanting Jesus Jesus and she thought that they were maybe mocking her\nBut then they can they started yelling out the window you know God Bless you you know see it tomorrow and and uh because she's been showing up every day\nWill will love you where where where where's the coverage of the story was it in the film is enterprise\nOh no you won't you won't find that the the the newspapers are are very liberal and they wouldn't cover anything like this\nBut there's but I mean she's so excited because there's been so many people honking and and um you know waving big trucks going by and honking and and you know thumbs up and so ah but yeah the the the founding schools try to\nShut down you know and she just she just moved down the street to she said it was it turned out to be a good thing because she moved to an intersection down the street and she's been getting more visibility\nDown there so as a student ... let me try to clarify this right now number one student can bring a Bible to school any of the week that they want to or a prayer book or an addict gives him or whatever they want or roads Thursday is just the national\nBring your Bible to school or your cat it gives them or you or whatever it might be All right yeah yeah\nWell there are numerous lawsuits to around ... let me just a construction were assured or an article of clothing that that maybe has across on\nYes absolutely absolutely it's it's their constitutional right I'm there have been a number of lawsuits around the country where kids have been you know the schools have tried to silence kids about their faith and and the kids always win because it's their First Amendment right they they um it's\nYou know their religious liberty I'm ... and ... you know this event um will allow\nA kids to identify and connect with other Christian kids in the school it provides them the opportunity to share the love and hope that the gospel with their peers and it reminds educators that students do not have to leave their faith that the schoolhouse door every morning ah when they go into this a secular I'm an environment\nThey they are doing an okay\nIf a kid has a T shirt the white T shirt on the front of the T shirt is a a black drawing of Jesus Christ mhm and they can wear that the school as long as it doesn't break the code or whatever yeah code might be but they're going to be on that as a religious picture of someone yeah 'cause they can wear the school\nYeah and if if they get any pushback from the school then you know the ... the parents are getting involved and say you know that my child has a right to do this um I mean we see the same thing happening in some schools are out west with the flag the until they can't wear the flag on their tee shirts\nBut like I said in ... in lawsuits there was one lawsuit where I'm a a valedictorian was told that she couldn't the administration wanted to see her speech before she\nGave it was told that she couldn't um praise God uh who she felt was actively involved in her success in school and she did it anyways and they held back her diploma and and she sued and and there's\nUm there's been um yeah numerous a law suits around the country but the the schools just ...\n... and less some somebody stands up to the schools the kids don't realize that they can do this you know that that child who is in first grade class you got the message and so did all the other kids in the class when the teacher grabbed his arm and said you can't talk about that here\nGod Almighty I doesn't do the parents the parents are obviously do you have a right to go in and talk to the teacher\nWell they do if they if they know about it um parents\nWill but I I think a lotta times kids you know don't go home and tell their parents to the I Know the the junior high kid in my uh Sunday school class told me and when I talk to her parents about it they said oh we didn't know anything about this [noise]\nDid you uh are you guys or anybody else a catering the educators about what is a ... especially when it comes to a Christian belief\nWhether it be Catholic gr evangelical or anybody else about a Christian belief in what is and what isn't allowed in schools are you guys going around and talk and the school districts\n[noise] well maybe you should\nYeah um we're starting with the you know churches and\nAnd uh um you know some of us have been um involved um in dealing with legislation that's a you know causing a lot of these issues um but um [noise]\nBut yeah we we need to I mean the the uh the schools um especially um teachers and administrators who are um hostile towards God have have given kids you know the message and and we need to tell them that you know now these these kids\nThey have a they have a First Amendment right um they\nIt shouldn't be silenced in their face\nOr a couple of questions for you I'm Diane one of our listeners just said ... are you talking about public schools\nThe the organized religion activities in school what the individual doesn't believes is one thing but it's also my right you believe and teach my child and I don't want that as part of my kids' education\nYeah it's a was to bring the Torah are bringing the horrendous school or there would be outrage or not public schools are played paid for by taxpayers separation of church and state\nYour guest can be a low key religious zealots for all she wants but don't force her beliefs on my kids are they use but\nWell I mean I I I feel that the secular world view is being forced on on kids um I I think there should be a balance\nI don't think that a a family's faith should be contradicted and and that children who are growing up in a I'm In a Christian home should be told that the Bible is a book of myth or told that they can't wear their their Christ\nUm if if uh you know if a child is talking to another child about their faith and they don't want to hear it they they can you know walk away um [noise] you know one of the things\nWe are trying to get you don't you know the ... you don't want kids standing on a soapbox during the ah during class going from ... the other ... a proselytizing about Jesus Christ or the savior or anything like that that's that you don't want that\nNo but what what we do want is um is Bible clubs and all the schools\nNowhere does it say that religion or any religion cannot be discussed or talked about in school or in public\nWe take a break for the
