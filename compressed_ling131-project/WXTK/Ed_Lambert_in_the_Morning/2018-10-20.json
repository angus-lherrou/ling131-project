H. P. financial dot\nCom shorts usually it's pretty financials retirement roadmap show where your route to a successful retirement goldie as each team anytime at one eight hundred to two seven seven seven seven seven or visit them on line that his age being financial done you know here's\nYour host very\n... the topic of the show was is the majority of your retirement plan based on the stock market and want to give you some ideas of how to change that if it is because that's a lot to rely on your entire life and work life in retirement life\nIs based on just the stock market that can be pretty daunting so we talked about that we also talked with attorney Keith ... man is to see how familiar you are advisor is with your state plan and trust plan to porn that they're on the same page your financial advisor in your attorney\nAnd we talked to keep the client who had worked with him still works for them but didn't necessarily work with us right away back in two thousand eight and the results were a loss of six hundred thousand dollars not because they didn't work with us but because they left all their money very exposed to the market\nAnd then during ... market report we talked about why the markets dropping off or had to sell off it does ah in the volatility ... it has had\nOver the last few weeks so that being said ... out of everything we talked about if you're the listener and you can just remember one thing what's your take\nWell I just think it's just you know having you know speaking of the volatility just if your plan is entirely market dependent\nAnd you are and needing to sort of liquidate and take money out you know not just living off dividends that's one thing but you're actually living off the earnings and the gains\nThen volatility can be very stressful I mean stressful for us I mean this is Mrs ... you know our job and my job and I'm sitting here like looking at the computer screen like you know kind of like come on let's go down come out you know what I mean and I'm I'm sitting there like I'm stressed out about it\nAnd I couldn't imagine if you are retirements\nWas based on that was your retirement was based on staring at a screen and like yelling at it to to to kind of get\nBetter and to go up and to show green nuts to withdraw money\nWell that that's what I mean so it's like it's stressful enough for people that are in the business I couldn't imagine having to retire and rely solely on it and try to have a a comfortable retirement when markets are the markets\nWell I Know it keeps take away is probably going to be similar to the volatility 'cause he had a client that necessarily didn't take his advice ten years ago\nYeah these are the times where when people come in again we've been in a ten year bull market runs so complacency is easy at this point right you know you sit there you wake up every morning you look at the end of the year screen oh yeah you know gone to the next year onto the next year onto the next year [laughter]\nBut ah you know ... does rear its ugly head last year we really didn't have much volatility also that's ... that talks about super complacent right\nThis year we're starting to see earlier in the year we saw this and now we're starting to see it again and again this is why it's so important to have a plan in place like marking gene when they came in they had enough money to retire they had enough money to do everything they want it to do in retirement [noise]\nTheir advisor advise him to keep it where it was and then that delayed their retirement you know almost five years the last five hundred thousand dollars over about over five hundred thousand dollars when again\nThey didn't that didn't need to happen they they had enough money to get where they want it to go that cost him five years of retirement to go with that from the time he standpoint God Forbid something happened to them health wise me didn't get to enjoy retirement\nAmazing and they came can you imagine that's a great takeaway keep because people listening right now can you imagine like the second guessing if you had the chance you had enough money saved up you right now might be in this position like market gene had enough money saved up where they could retire as long as they took a little bit of risk off the table and developed a plan\nTheir current advisor at the time ten years ago talked him out of the\nLast five hundred thousand dollars and now they had he had to go back to work as a contractor for five more years when they could have been retiring and traveling and doing what they wanted to do than having the grandkids and that changed and that change and that that we don't want that to happen to you\nAnd so I just think I Know a lot of you out there because a lot of you out there like my own family and like my I look at my parents and\nMy dad growing up when he went to work he was a plasterer he'd wake up at five in the morning he'd shovel the snow off of his truck\nGo to work all day come home still have some energy to hang out you know play ball with me or whatever we want to do my mom would then took us into bed and she'd go work the night shift as a nurse and the sacrifices they made it to get to where they are I always told them like his dad and mom we don't you want to get to retirement\nThis is your whole life all the sacrifices that we just talked about when it comes to going to work early shoveling shoveling snow off your of your windshield working nights come down to having enough for retirement\nWhy would we risk that why would you ever want to risk that so if you're listening right now and you're not sure that you have a plan that's going to take you to into retirement are you a hundred percent sure you have enough income that's going to be generated are you sure that if you ... if you have enough money right now do you want to risk it and have maybe that portfolio will be cut in half if we have a market dropped

B. wealth management below sea and SEC registered investment advisor officers in over in West Berlin Hyannis our officers of convenience and only used for client meetings\nBut when I looked at the numbers they were worth about six million mhm no never mind the six million isn't worth putting the off four point five million of it was in an Ira wow I said I Can't\nDo Medicaid planning for you was for a million dollars in an IRA and I explained to them right even if you wanted to protect the other two property such a hat and some other money\nWhich we could do you'll never be eligible for Medicaid mhm because of the Ira and even if I was to try to do the Ira last minute planning which is the only thing we can do for IRAs and we've explained that on the show we can do last minute planning for an Ira but\nIn this case it was his and if he got sick and what in the nursing home in order for me to a movie Ira permissible early to the healthy spouse I'd have to cash it out\nOh and think about that tax though if they were million by one point\nFour million I ran a numbers I said there's no way we're going to write a check for one point four million just so I can get you his Ira right start paying the nursing home because even if he lives three years at fourteen thousand a pop it's like four fifty\nYeah I Can't stomach one point four million in tax and you know and then can you imagine if you made the transfer thinking he's going to live a while and six months later he has some catastrophic something happens in the nursing home when he dies right now you spent one point four million in taxes when you would not have needed to do that\nRight and that money coming out of the IRA although\nNormally it's taxable completely when you take that money out of the IRA in this case if their private private hey we're only arraigned money tax benefits\nAs writers and you'll get adoption for the uh for the money you're using just spend on the nursing home so you're actually bleeding it out almost not quite tax free but that just about to get a big deduction\nFor your ah medical expense so yes I think we educate we don't advocate one over the other it's very important that you come in and see where you're at\nSo we know that you can't put those IRA assets whether it's traditional area Roth IRA although you don't have the tax implication of ...\nAnything that's still in that IRA rapper cannot go into that tries not not in advance you know what else would you put into the trust while you're going through this process where someone who is in heavy on the IRA side they decide they want to do their evoke about trust planning what kind of assets would you actually transfer into that this\nWell when now let's go to someone who who's more the everyday client right you you got three million unless you're likely to be there's really no question you you'll probably concerned about nursing home care right and so now you've got that vacation home your primary residence those are two usually big assets that people want to protect\nThey can go in ... right and usually they're there's also maybe an investment\nOil they would want to put some of that and that can go in ... not the Ira but the taxable investment portfolio or even or even a rental property 'cause remember when you put the rental property and you still get the right to the income right so it's still yours you haven't given it away in that regard and so yeah they can put the rental property in\nAnd and get that protected so pretty much\nAnything you want to protect other than the Iraq and put in\nWhich is great so you you have that flexibility get that clock start and you know what it's it's really about education this whole process tied everything that we do on this show is to educate people even if it's when they go and sit down with someone else another attorney to get their ... their documents drafted\nIn the back of their mind they can be thinking\nHuh I don't think that's what Todd said oh no we're able to do so we know there's a lot of bad legal advice out there yet and lay and and I think\nPart of the reason we this this do we do this article this way is it it does provide you with some of that information about how to begin\nThe process how to decide what belongs in what doesn't belong in things like that so ... ... and how to to know when to do it right I had a forty nine year old couple come in now they got young kids miners you know this is not yeah not ready for that yet you need to do regular\nEstate planning and they did need to do it you know and and I'm certain that they will but uh but\nSo yeah it's not it's not for everybody but if you're going to do it you really need to understand how to draft a document you made it work\nAnd you know

case which did go all the way up to the appellate court in Illinois it was a an estate planning attorney prepared for the oil or are willing to trust\nAnd he was married and his wife ... wife had a a dimension or had all summer so they want it to prepare a special needs trust for her\nFifteen periods in the past sixty five years when rates have risen in stocks have gained with average gains reaching twelve and a half percent and there are only been three instances and those rising rate environments when stocks of actually fallen\nSo what sector is can we invest in that could actually benefit from a rising interest\nRate environment while I'm In one sector that benefits typically from rising and straight as financial ah banks make money by you know buying deposit cheaply and then selling them for higher prices while higher interest rates will force them to pay more for deposits interest rates on savings accounts and other consumer products typically rise much slower\nThan interest rates on bones you know the average rate on a one year CD for instance climbed from point to seven to point seven eight and started sixteen whereas the home equity line of credit rate went from four six nine to six point one nine percent\nThings Mac folks if you have questions about the market about the economy or about your portfolio please visit us it Armstrong advisory group dot com\nYou've been listening to Wall Street weaken review with Michael Armstrong no back to the legal exchange with ... and Susan ... hours\nListening to them legal exchange and it's time for us when we're done we'll answer your questions about anything and everything of including this big blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan followers\nTired of it you questions from listeners for you first question comes from Bob in Boston mass and Bob rights\nI'm interested in protecting my sons inherited his inheritance from creditors however if he remains married and then ... says his wife\nHow can I include her and my plan so that she would receive something after he dies but keep the majority of the assets interest from my grandkids so he wants to include the daughter in law and his plan\nThis is very strange\n[laughter] well um I I said I don't really feel the same way yeah [laughter] but you know I mean I Do\nUnderstand that you know ... you think\nYou know that you want to you know you you love your in laws and even though you're really only think you love your in laws are but\nAnd and you want to try to take care of and it's kinda hard to have your cake and eat it too though so what I Would what I Would think you would have to do is you would just have to say that you know upon I think in in the trust Bob you create you would say upon my death\nYou know if my son is married ... make sure they're married on the date of death right so if my son is married to acts on the date of death then I Want to carve out you know a percentage some percentage to\n... her just give it to her you know a little piece of even even if the sun's living 'cause they'll share together mhm right if if if it's something you want\nHer to have and you ... and since you want her to have it you really don't care about it being ... the divorce comes or not you don't care because you're giving it to her than than than give it to her and then her but even if the sun's living they can enjoy it together\nIf they get a divorce or whatever you gave to your daughter in law would be subject to the divorce which means your son would get half\nAnd she would get half so it's not horrific as long as you put a percentage on the amount you want to go to her and then you say the balance of the assets so say I carve out ten percent of my state mhm I Want you know ten maybe even five percent\nI Won five percent of my assets are and and maybe you would even limited you might not want real estate to get involved here so you might say I want five percent of my non\nA real estate trust assets\nTo go to a share for the benefit of my uh daughter in law provided she is married to my son on the date of my death ... uh and that share can be paid out directly to her\nAgain ... if they're married and sons living than they have it together so it's kinda like you gave it to your son right no different than if you paid it out to your Sunday would share it yep same idea [noise]\nOkay so that's off the table then the balance of the trust assets Ninety five percent of what's left ... would be held in this\nTrust designed for future creditor protection divorces and bloodline planning down to the grand kids which is what he's asking about here so I think Bob you're going to have to get the lawyer to get some creative drafting\nBut I have yet to come across the situation that we could not accomplish one way or another you just have to understand the pros and cons of doing it\nI Would not want to put it all in the divorce proof language trust where it's supposed to pay out in the trustees discretion for the don't or or for the children and the grandchildren and the spouse of the sun\nTo me that just smells really bad I mean if the divorce comes later and\nShe says her attorney takes a look at that language right and she says you know I'd like half of what's in that trust that Bob put together yet right\nAnd Bob says well it's not mine or ours we always have to ask the disinterested trust the for the distribution I suppose the disinterested trust he could say no\nEven though it's right for ... but it but because it's for one of the beneficiaries the right dose right I just don't I don't like it I don't like how it feels\nI Would think that he could then are you to say wait a minute she NPR both beneficiaries of this divorce poof pocket this kind of who's so yeah I get that plane\nYeah but I still think the ... to ... to trust the ultimately could say no I don't have to give it to anybody if I don't want to rent and it and it would probably work out but if it were me I cut it may can lean I'd cut it off I'd say you know what\nWhatever piece you want her to have give it to her and put the rest in the divorce proof trust for children grandchildren spouses are out okay\nGood advice there folks Todd has put a lot of good advice in writing for you with his guide designing in income only ... trust he has written this guide for the month of October ... gives you a great foundation of knowledge when you were starting out in the process of having your trust drafted a clue that's\nThe important information that must be in your trust in sixteen troublesome provisions that absolutely should not be in your trust you can request you're free copy\nOf Todd's designing your ... trust guide right now by calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine or download your free copy on our website legal exchange show\nDot com taught our last question comes from Janice in Milton massing Janice writes I Am I on the power of attorney and she is now in a nursing home we are private paying at twelve thousand dollars per month\nShe only has a home and we're in the process of selling it because I can no longer maintain it and I'm not in a position to be able to rent it is there anything that can be done last minute to protect the two hundred and fifty thousand that we will receiving proceeds from the sale of the house [noise]\nThat's too bad I'm I'm going to spend just a few minutes on the part that they said they can't do and and really explore that you know I Know clients say they can't rent it or you know they're not in a position I mean to me\nRent it but you're always better off keeping the house I think ... than selling it in a house ... especially a primary residence when you're doing\nAnd it was last minute planning techniques\nOr a primary residence is non ... just because of what it is so I don't have to do anything fancy non count at all I get it for a single person like in this case\nThey'll put a lean on it yet but at least for beyond the Medicaid rate versus the private pay rate much slower much lower than private pain we won't be a twelve thousand will be at six thousand a month so so keeping it as always in your best interest uh and and even if you don't rent it\n'cause they said they're not in a position to rent it if it's the primary residence just keeping it ... ... you don't have to rent\nThe downside would not renting it is someone's got to pay the heat the electric to taxes maintain it and the kids might not want to do that ... although I still think it's a home run to do that [noise]\nAh but so if on the flip side you want to rent it now you'll have rental income coming in the house will still be just as non accountable as it was for as a primary residence ... even though you've converted it\nTo a a a rental property but now you'll have maybe two grand a month coming in ...\nThat you are allowed to use to maintain the property pay all the bills the upkeep so kids are not out of pocket at all and the excess rent goes to the nursing home\nSo now I've managed to keep the house\nAnd maintain it not out of pocket for the children\nThere's so much that you're supposed to know about what should and should not be in your ear evoke about trust so that it works it's all about the drafting folks but how are you supposed to know what should or shouldn't be in there you don't\nFortunately for you Todd who is our elder law expert\nHe's written this guy that will give you everything you need to know including what must be in their sixteen different problematic provisions that should not being there and he's also included a question and answer pretty comprehensive section on how these trust work every day\nYou can make quest you're free copy of Todd's designing in income only irrevocably trust guide right now by calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine or visit our website legal exchange showed dot com and you can download your guide you can download our podcast and you can meet your questions for Todd the answer on the air\nSo how does it work if you're you know a loved one providing care I think you have a lot more to worry about in this case a oftentimes you're not worried no so much about the stealing or they're not getting paid in fact lots of times you don't even want to get paid right um but the parent wants to\nPay yeah a lot of times they do 'cause you might be reducing your hours at work you're all circling the wagons you're all pitching in well you might even give up\nYour job right here for our parents fulltime and you need you need a financial flow of money yeah so so if you're going to do that folks then why we're not worried so much about the elder abuse part of this case or the criminal aspects of this case\nWe're worried about the future Medicaid application you know things that you do well you're living ... out of normal acts of kindness goodwill actions that you take you don't always realize the impact that might have on a future medicate application\nSo if you're a parent that you're caring for ends up going into a nursing home\nRight 'cause they're ... and you can't uh you get to a point where it's beyond your capacity yeah they might need to do it acute medical care or effective so so what do we do in the interim what we want to get paid if you want to get paid you must have a personal care contract\nEspecially if you're a ... a family member doing them like you need the personal care contract\nAnd you need in the personal care contract to itemize out the kinds of services you think you're going to be providing\nFrom running errands to doing medical prescriptions to doctor visits to uh things around the house and the type of care you're actually going to provide for the loved one whether it's toiling transferring bathing medicating okay put all that and\nAlso you need a paragraph in there about the hours you think you're going to be spending ...\nAnd how you're going to get paid whether it's twice a month whether it's every week and the hourly rate what's a good rate do you think taught as a guide lies you know I've seen enough fair hearing decisions come down on this that that hourly rate for a non\nA nurse practitioner and you're just a family member you know stick around twenty dollars an hour okay I think you'll be okay but even at twenty bucks an hour if you've moved and you can justify a lot of time\nEspecially if you don't have another job and so you could be moving you know five thousand a month out ... easy um and if you're doing that you need to then not only have the personal care contract with all of that information in it\nYou need to then make sure that you take the money and deposited in your account\nAnd reported on your personal income tax return okay so it goes through that process ordinary income that those two steps the contract and the reporting it on the income tax return converged this from a non from a loving arrangement where you're not expecting to get paid ... an actual\nYou know I expect to get paid proposition ...\nAnd you might even have the parent issue a ten Ninety nine ... at the end of it as a gift right we want to make sure so there's no gifts so that if she does get sick and goes in the nursing home later\nThe transfers are not considered disqualifying transfers there's no five year penalty period you've cleanse that and you get to keep what you are and and then you're faced with just the last minute planning for for the love on at that\nYou know folks you need to have a solid plan in place Todd's guide\nThat he's written for the month of October it's designing and income only ... trust it will show you how these trust are working and it's all in the drafting\nThis guy shows you six different um ... must

know I don't know about you but it seemed to me a shockingly dark could look up at six thirty this morning that combination of the longer nights and the cloudy weather this morning made it quite\nQuite dark at six\nFifteen six thirty when I was up [noise] and uh this is the season right as the fall is upon us\nFive zero eight seven seven five nine nine eight five is the number you can call a with all of your garden comments and questions this morning and of course early in the program is the best time to get through and I think all of my\nOur callers are\nAlso you know wondering what happened why is it so dark outside uh because it's it was a little bit of a tough morning to get up and get going but there's so much to talk about so first thing is we did have a frost All right there was a late for us to the other night\nAnd so some of the things that are particularly frost sensitive did get sapped minds in use are now done All right um my son patients it got nipped so it's not quite as gorgeous but it didn't quite get done in the at\nThe ... and what else are the Mike fortunately my pineapple said just still okay so my golden delicious pineapple said which just came into flour it last week\nIs still find that usually ... does pretty well until it gets quite cold and it is forecast by the way to get quite cold in a couple of days so if you didn't have\nThings you know really get nipped\nLast night or the night before Sunday\nNight is supposed to go down to twenty nine so that's going to be you know that's going to be at then it's going to get warmer again and then we're going to have a little bit of a [noise] uh what used to be called Indian summer which is always the the warmer period after the first hard frost\nAnd so it looks like next week is going to be that\n[noise] so what does that mean for us outdoors what that means is um get up there and take your values if you want to take your values up uh this is a good weekend to do that\nAnd or the next week it will be a great time to do it because it's it's pretty nice outside so that's number one number two it's time to pull those annual ... out so that you have a good fresh area to plant in next year\nAnd in the parade emails whether you cut those back or whether you leave does that's kind of up to you because there are advantages and disadvantages to doing the\nIn the fall and it really is a a personal decision that each gardener can make I talked about this uh at my ...\nAnd so it's a good thing to do to put fertilizer on them whether that something like\nFlower tone or plant tone or a it could be a synthetic such as asthma code or you could use liquid like miracle grow whatever in the summertime it's important to fertilize them so that they didn't have that strength built up and that's part of the key to getting them to flower\nYeah well I Do at this point it's too late it's too late now\nBut at this point give them that six weeks of chilling rest time and then bring them into the house into a warm and sunny location and let's keep our fingers crossed that this year they'll do it okay\nOh All right thank you very much I I I've been waiting so long\nTraining no well I Hope they produce for you this year okay thank you You're welcome bye now OK\nYeah indeed a it is that time to bring those amoral is in a and certainly if you haven't done that bring them in a today or early tomorrow because Sunday night it's supposed to get even colder and you don't you'll lose the plants if you leave them outside so uh you know certainly a little tiny touch a frost\nDoesn't hurt them but if that ball freezes in any way it's dead so you want to take care of those amber realist right away if you haven't already mine came into the garage a that was one of the things that we did in the past couple of days was bring those into the\nGarage and they are all I I have many AMA realists like probably I don't know a dozen\nPots at least and um what I Do is put them on a wire

Ridgewood avenue\n[noise] remembering the golden age of radio when radio was Sunday night starting at ten o'clock news radio Ninety five WICK [noise]\n\nEight seven seven five W ex TK that's five zero eight seven seven five nine\nNine eight five is the number that you can call to join me this morning on the air\nUm we are talking plants and gardening and we were talking before the break about what's worth saving through the winter\nI Want to talk a little bit about taking cutting things of plants that you want to save through the winter because as I mentioned that can be a great way to save things like ... and ... the common window box geraniums coal is coal lists are very very easy to save\nWith cutting Z so um that ... to do that what you need to\nDo is to take a piece of the plant from the end of the growth\nThat's about six inches long alright so cut off the the six inches off of that window box geranium a remove any flowers right I Know this is hard to do for some people but ... any flowers off that might be there\nAnd then be sure and cut off most of the leads you want to leave only three or four\nLeaves maximum on that cutting and the reason is because it doesn't have roots it's going to you know just jettisoned some of those leaves anyway it won't have the water to support those sleeves so cut off most of the leaves just leave the ones at the very top three or four leaves maximum\nI get yourself some oh and by the way if you want to put them in water right after that for a little while that's fine but the best way to to uh take cutting Z\nAnd to make sure that the plants do well is not to leave them in the water are there are I guess some plants that can be rooted in water and stay in water for a while but uh most of them do much better if they're only in water for a little while\nAnd that's because of the bacteria that builds up in the water can sometimes cause of the Sims to rot so you're much more likely to have success\nIf you only leave them in water for a few hours while you get all your other supplies assembled alright the supplies that you should have on hand are some rooting hormone powder and you can buy\nThat at any garden center and then some either fresh pot ... soil or fresh seed\nStarting ... do not use used parting soil do not use used seed starting mix and do not use soil from your garden\nYou went some fresh patting soil or fresh seed starting next you want to put that fresh prodding soil or seat starting mix in a bowl and get it nice and wet at a lot of water and mix it up with your hands so that you broke and all the surface tension and you have that\nThat nice wet piloting mix or seed starting next is going to feel a little like making mud pies to you All right it's like getting your hands in the mud when you were a kid and if you were never allowed to do that as a kid no out now is your opportunity so\nYet that stuff and then put it in the pots alright put it in some nice clean containers that have during the trolls and it can be quite wet because you're not going to cover the drainage holes with anything and so the excess moisture\nWill come out of the drainage will once you have that pot filled with that quite wet piloting soil or see starting mix then you take your cutting out of the water\nRoll it around in the rooting hormone and what I usually do is knock some of that rooting powder onto a plate so I'm not getting the ... stem in my brand new fresh bottle of rooting hormone I Am rolling the stem\nOr in some hormone powder that has been put on a plate\nAnd then once I have said the bottom three or four inches covered with the powder then I take a pencil make a hole in the the seed starting mix the Rudy the I'm putting soil and stick that\nHormone covered stem into the whole push the soil against it with your fingers and then put it in a place where it is right\nAnd the road a ... society you know for many\nPlants they're our societies of enthusiasts daily society as a hostile society right so if you particularly love a particular plant\nA go online and Google you know the name of that plant with the word society and chances are you will find a group that celebrates that plant not only can you learn a lot about that plant from these societies\nBut these are great people these are plant people these are people who are in those Aztec about plants and gardens and so you know it's a nice group to get involved with if you particularly if you want to learn more about a particular plant\nUm you have an up a option to go to different trips that these plant these plant society's take\nTo various locations you you can see private gardens through these uh societies you can learn about um for the rose society you can learn about how to enter a road show you can see a actual demonstrations in gardens\nAre so much going on and it can be wonderful and frankly\nA lot more fun than learning about a plant on line yes you can look up information online and of course we can all do that and that's a nice thing to be able to do at eleven o'clock at night if you can't sleep or whatever but I'm having contact with people who have actually grown a plant in your region\nThen you know you're getting local information or you can ask questions and know that you're getting you know the right the right information or that you're getting an accurate identification um so uh where it's you know if you're just posting something randomly on line\nAnd you might be getting a rose or ... or a hostage advice from somebody in Texas and the growing conditions are different there so a Cape Cod roe society are good\nFor us and Audrey I was born and are winning Cindy earn Reich for starting up again and once again the organizational meeting is taking place October twenty seventh at ten am\nAt the Ehrenreich home which is at three seven eight zero main street in Barnes Noble and they're going to have by the way at that meeting I'm a program about miniature and many Flora\nRoses so you'll have an opportunity to learn about that type of variety of rose as well as a future a roast society meetings as well [noise]\nFive zero eight seven seven five W extricate that seven seven five nine nine eight five\nWhich is the number that you can call to join me this morning on the air with your garden questions or problems we have three lines open so it is a good time to get through\nI'm Leo called earlier from west principal about wanting a dwarf Japanese maples that's red red and and Leo um we didn't get to it while you were on the phone but hopefully you're still listening because one of the uh read a ... and ... is called scarlet princess\nSo check that out call and you're you know local places to see if they carry or will carry scarlet princess\nI don't know I'm actually I have to look and see if Monrovia I'm Kerry scarlet princess\nBecause if they do um what you can always do with Monrovia\nIs order it and have it delivered to a local garden center\nSo you know and look and see if Monrovia offers that plant on line Leo because you can order one and have it you know sent to the local garden center if they do\nA again though the downside is you don't get to pick the shape which is always the best thing about shopping locally not only are you a supporting local businesses but um\nYou get to pick the best plant and I always recommend that people start locally because they can go in and see the plant pick the shape find\nThe healthiest one gets a size they want all of that talk to the people get the supplies for planting it at one stop and the plants that you buy locally will always be larger than what you order through the mail\nIf you can't find locally than ordering it is a wonderful thing because you have access to plants that we don't find otherwise uh by ordering from you know sources outside of the immediate area [noise]\nFive zero eight seven seven five nine nine eight five let's go to the phones and talk to Daniel who's calling from Dennis good morning Daniel\n... yeah I don't want to let you\nYeah you can either leave it in the pot and just haul the whole thing into a location where it's going to be cool but not freezing or if you don't have space for the pot in a location like that did get up right clean the ball ball off\nA let it dry somewhere\nAnd then take it and and store it in either a paper bag filled with dry peat moss or a paper bag filled with sawdust or a paper bag filled with Dr ... soil All right so you could empty you know some dry pouting saw it on the bottom of the bag put that ball been filled the rest\nThe bag up with the politics are close it up and then you want to store it in a place where it's going to be cool so say around between ah say forty five and fifty five sixty maximum\nAnd a store it that way for the winter time and then pot it up in news fresh soil when it gets warm and put it outside at the end of may\n... which I thought that\nThat should be fine as long as it doesn't freeze and you don't want to water it of course and you can just pull it in with the foliage still there once the foliage Wilson\nDies back cut it off and just leave that in the garage 'em and you know I'm pull it back out next next spring I Would probably if this were my plant I Would probably next spring pull it out but then I pop the ball about\nThey some are in play sarin mustard plastic um they have huge green lights yeah um and\nThe plastic because of the weather on a lot of them are pretty pretty wet [laughter] so I Need to bring them in today but I'm Wondering\nI cut the leaves right and you should you should not cut the leaves what you want to do Nikki is bring them into a cool place like a garage or not there by my bed or you know an enclosed porch or something and then just let them dry out with the leaves on and the leaves turn brown and then you clip off the brown leaves once they do that\nBut they're not they're not going to rot are they because the pots or so that\nThey shouldn't if you stop watering them I mean if you wanted if you want to you could bring them into a warm place first so that they dry out faster and then move them to the cool place you know you could put put them on your dining room table for a while [laughter] and then move them into a cool place\nAnd you wouldn't\nYou know take them out of the soil\nAnd well usually we don't now would it hurt to take them out of the soil knock the soil off the roots and then just let them dry out on a ... something no it wouldn't or you could certainly do that and then pop them up again you know before you bring them in the house for them to break dorm and see\nThat a lot more work obviously\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah but if I were you what I Would do is some time either before you bring them in the house or before you put them outside next time a transplant them into clay pots\nAnd clay pots have a couple of advantages number one they don't stick quite so wet and so the bulbs are less likely to rot number two they don't blow over you know the the leaves gets so tall in heavy in some ways it's good to have some weight holding the whole thing down I'm so and they look nice and clay pots as well\nAll right well thank\nYou so much you have a lovely weekend thank you you as well by now\nGoing to take a break when we come back more calls or whether you have a question about your Amarillo is your elephant to Europe planting\nSprings lowering Bob's your high drain just your lawn whatever it is we're taking more calls when we come
