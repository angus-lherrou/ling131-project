things that I've\nBeen watching a different shows last night and and different talking has yesterday afternoon\nIs the fact that the media loves to a focus on those that are rioting in Washington or in New York or in San Francisco and getting together the placards and the people that you know a ... saying no cat never Kavanaugh\nOr the death threats to different senators the ducks thing that went on all the different things out there so it's you know I ... for you to come out and say hey look you support Gavin I'm I let you do it because there's so much negativity out there that's all we hear a ... go ahead\nI also want to thank you um because again having listen to your show or as much as I have recently actually the most I've listened to a talk show\nMy entire life combined [laughter] I appreciate that whether you agree\nWith a caller and are you let them have their say and you try to see it from their point of view and and you show them the respect that honestly if there were more ... politicians as open minded as you probably wouldn't have half the problem\nWell thank you Andrew I I appreciate that it's too bad that the politicians are that we have up in Washington lose sight of the fact of why you really why they're there and what's going on for the most part it's it is too bad\nWell in the Philly thing is like whether you're a Democrat whether they're Republican it was like at the end of the day actual all Americans are we all supposed to be on the same side aren't isn't your job when it comes down to it supposed to be working for the benefit of everybody\nKnow so much of the subjectivity a goes into it Andrew in people's minds about er which side they're on and I've read so many different editorials to\nAbout ... exactly what you just said\nThat isn't too bad that they can't or\nSomehow get rid of that that hate to Trump and that hate of of what's happening right now with their their guy didn't win and all the different things and and be honest in truthful about what they're doing and what they're doing what they have done to Kevin Hi Andrew is just trying to push the thing off pushing the thing of\nAnd just to use that strategy to do this delay because

a\nKind of silly because that I I I looked up when a back way back\nWhen when the abortion law was passed on demand I guess uh what's the word to use I wasn't\nOf sexual assault and even right I think

Lee that was brought up at the uh on Thursday\nOr by Mitchell who's you know the the are taking over the prosecution she ... when a when Kevin she was asking can judge Kevin a direct question she replaced in front of him and all the others on the Judiciary Committee a piece of paper that was a definition of sexual assault\nAnd she read it along the Gillette judge Kavanaugh take time to read it also everyone on the Judiciary Committee read the piece of paper or a sexual assault [noise] and then ... Rachel Mitchell then read it into the record of what she has deemed or what was\nDeemed as sexual assault\nAnd it had something to do was and I don't remember it specifically\nBut it's an act and what you said a person intentionally sexually touches another person without that person consent\nOr courses or physically forces a woman or a person to engage in a sexual act against your will they also said it's a form of sexual violence which includes rape which is different than a sexual assault and she said it also means that someone\nMight press a a a a a a member of your body against someone else so she ... she read this thing they she rented out I don't have it in front of me but you can probably get\nIt I understand that but you know\nI don't know how old you are an old I Am but when you started dating somebody or whatsoever ... dance people rubbing their bodies against each other even in today's dancers they rubbed their butts against each other\nI mean where how do you just I understand what she wrote I understand what the words say but what the word state it's not reality [noise] All right\nIt's it becomes reality when the when the woman or the man says no stop it that's when it becomes reality\nThat's when ... when the sexual groping or you know cop and a feel or whatever it might be ... that's when it becomes a when that person says knock it off no that can be interpreted if you keep it going his sexual assault\nThere's got to be there's got to be the no in there if someone's own along with it it's not sexual assault\nAnd then as he said she said you\nKnow I said no you didn't say no you know ... years ago it was a things were different you know there was no no no yes yes yes you know nobody\n... and the subject that is both a the most ... subject in

talked to you\nAbout your sexual escapade one day we're young for fear of being a demeaned or not ... yet already be an embarrassment\nMaybe yes maybe no I mean people are different all over the place to read so rather than making a blanket statement the generalization possibly in different circumstances you're right but I Do know that sexual assault becomes that when the consent is not there from the other party that's that's the bottom line to that thank you all the ... and\nIn our own testimony she says she said no\nOh no she ... she said don't you remember what you said specifically Kevin I put her hand over my mouth so I couldn't say no\nI thought your social she couldn't screen\nOr yellowish great well maybe the same thing I don't know [laughter]\nThankfully viable eight seven seven five nine nine eight five are toll free phone number is one eight eight eight WMGK Ninety five one the definition of sexual assault will differ or for different circumstances but the key in my mind is
