to do that and you just want a quick recap of today's show what the most important parts of it were as it pertains to you and your retirement\nWe're going to leave you with our top three ... takeaways right now so Keith what was your big takeaway\nEarly in the show we talk to the ball in their retirement rules and\nFirst one was you know as you start to into retirement you need to think about adjusting\nAdjusting your mindset adjusting to the fact that you're not going to be saving money any more but you're going to start to be spending and it also it's a nice adjustment in regards to your mindset because now you you don't have to work right you can enjoy\nYour life so it is a big step forward when you do retire in regards to the adjustments that you go through assuming assuming you're spending will go down you know when we build plans for folks that's where we assume and chances are whoa you know with the cost of living and things like that going up as much as it is\nIt's important to plan is if you you know your what you need now is what you're going to need then and go up\nPrepare for alternative sources of income remember people back in the you know my parents and things like that they have pensions to rely on their Social Security to rely on so many retirees are coming in now a days saying\nI have Social Security and I've done a great job saving\nHow ... how to how do we how do we make this all work so you got to really think about using your assets to supplement in provide income for you and in retirement no your nest egg no the amount of money to have in the type of money you have from attack standpoint and when you should draw on each bucket and why\nAnd then the last thing is\nBuild a plan for your retirement don't go into retirement and what we called wing it you know you plan for vacations hours weeks at a time you should spend more time planning the retirement than you do your next vacation\nStuff teeth and just to kind of take it back on that I mean I sometimes you know tell people a story about how you know if you ever sat down for a job interview right and then the person that you know your new boss said you know darn Keith don't worry about it you know to just work here and are just call me if you need to paycheck\nAnd it's like no you you would be you know I think I'd like to know exactly what I'm paid for this job and take the bus like no no no no don't worry about it you know to just call me if you need a paycheck\nAnd it's like people are entering retirement in similar fashion\nWhereas you know now that their their monthly income to build or do they need money and if they have a plan sometimes it's as simple as I call me if you need money\nAnd they don't have a plan they don't know where that paycheck is correct so it's like look if you wouldn't take a job without certainty as to when the next paycheck is coming in where it's coming from why would you ever retire with that same amount of uncertainty\nSo you know keep for rules are five rules is kind of what that builds up to and just want to remind people that you wouldn't take a job like that so you wouldn't be entering retirement either\nIn the in the best time to build and implement the plan is when you don't need it it's before you need it so that you can get ahead of it so [noise]\nSo whatever you're doing right now I guess I Want to ask you you know what is money mean to you and what's important in your life right now\nIn what really matters to you at this point in time as you are getting ready to potentially retire and the upcoming future\nUm you know we have we ... we shared a story earlier mark and Karen in and they were in a position where they had a an advisor they had a portfolio but they had NO PLAN in place there's a big difference between having a portfolio of stocks bonds mutual funds compared to an actual plan\nSo when they came in they had NO PLAN they had way too much risk in their portfolio and they were paying high fees when they left what they had was a plan that the ... the risk was reduced substantially because they're retiring and three or four years\nThey had an they had a a place they had a plan of where their income was their paycheck within a come from like ... said they weren't wing it they knew where their income was going to come from they were able to reduce their fees they're paying\nAnd they were able to build a full retirement roadmap plan that looked at income planning investment planning taxes health care and legacy so think about where you are right now I think about where mark and Karen where before they came in compared to how they feel now and how they have a plan in place going forward to retire confidently\nIf you don't if you're like Mark and Karen where they were a few months ago where they had NO PLAN in place\nDidn't have any basis for how they were going to retire if they can retire how much can they draw from and you want someone to help build that out for you that's what we're here

God and I hardly radio station use radio Ninety five WICK [noise] when you went to the local news\nGood morning I'm more more with is W ... news update\nMarshall police are investigating and crashed between a car and a motorcycle friday night the accident occurred at the intersection of West main street and strawberry hill road and seriously injured the motorcycle driver who was taking a Cape Cod hospital and then by met flights of an off Cape trauma center\nAnd the seven o nine would be acknowledging that you made let's say a hundred thousand dollar gift to the kids have a portfolio or five hundred thousand dollar home if you gave away your home\nYou know less the Fifteen thousand dollar president interest exclusion that you're allowed to give away so that's the freebie gift that the freebie file anything don't even need to file if that's all you were giving away but because this gift exceeded that amount\nYou would file it reduced by the amount of the president interest exclusion the Fifteen thousand dollar freebie\nThe amount over that would be considered\nThe taxable gift and so if it was you know a hundred thousand dollars minus the Fifteen you have an eighty five thousand dollar taxable gift\nDoesn't mean you're going to pay tax because you are going to eat into your eleven million one hundred and eighty thousand dollar once in a lifetime gift tax exemption ... by the eighty five grand\nThat doesn't hurt as much but in Massachusetts and depending on your state even though there is no state a state tax mhm\nOh I'm Sorry no state gift tax yeah you do have to reduce your estate tax exemption\nSo if you only had a million dollar exemption you ate into it by eighty five thousand dollars well now you are under a million and if you gave away a five hundred thousand dollar home let's make it a real gift you now have five hundred thousand dollars left of your exemption not helpful\nYeah the taxes and a lot of people don't realize when they say oh I don't need the attorney I'm just going to put the house in my kid's name\nThat's a gift that's a gift I mean we're not even talking about all the other negatives and loss of control and things that go with putting the house in the kid's name ... but the forgetting that you're right it's a gift\nAnd it's a taxable gift and it really does impact the estate tax calculation going forward right for the person who made the gift not the recipient mhm the recipients folks has no income tax or gift tax liability OK okay ... go\nAhead and how does that I'll defer if you transfer assets into a trust you still need to do that same tax form the form seven and nine and so forth\nYou know and that's a beautiful thing about these irrevocably trust everybody says things are so you know rigid inflexible and scary scary word that every local I've given it away and all this\nI tell people right in the beginning when you set up these zero vocal trust they are in complete gifts for gift tax purposes you are not giving anything to the children ... you are not giving anything to the trustee\nYou are simply putting it in the trust the trust would own it\nBut for gift tax purposes it's an incomplete gift because you as the creator of the trust have retained and you've heard of spoke speak about this before\nA limited power of appointment which means you have the right as the donor or to a point the assets to charity mhm\nWell because you could appoint him to charity\nAll during your life we don't really know who the gift would have been made to right that's what makes it an incomplete gift it can change your mind you can change your mind so therefore no seven o nine gift tax return really needs to be filed and there is no gift tax liability\nAnd not only that but there are benefits to giving your assets that transferring your assets into an area vocal trust\nVersus just giving away their kids from a capital gains tax ... so you you may be unnecessarily creating a tax for your kids were none what exists that's exactly what I just kept it in your trust or even in your own name that you're doing that from a tax perspective\nAnd and also the creditor issue yeah or you don't own it anymore I mean this is a whenever I clients tell me well why don't we just put it in their name I'm like I won't do it yeah you need another lawyer because I'm not going to have my client give up the ownership rights to their home\nThey need to feel comfortable that they can live there the rest of their life they need to feel comfortable they can sell and downsizing and young move to another state and\nAnd not be impacted by adverse gift or capital gains tax consequences we\nDon't like it pay in taxes let alone unnecessary taxes folks if you have been thinking about\nCreating an eerie vulnerable trust

agreement case out of Alabama\nActually went all the way up to the Alabama Supreme Court\nSo it started out with a I guess the state of Bobby gene Hicks sues\nSo when you say that there's still room to grow for those looking to be fully employed what do you mean by that Mike\nWhat what I mean is that there's a large group of people who are underemployed these are people that have part time jobs but would probably work more if they could find reasonable paying jobs are looking at Americans age thirty five to forty four who are\nYou know a group of workers most likely to be employed you can see that they're still significantly less likely to be employed than they were back in two thousand seven to eight Nineteen nineties or even the late eighties\nSo according to ... about three percent of American part-time want to work fulltime but and that's comparable to the weak job market to the early to thousands which is another sign away remark is actually not over here to\nThings make folks if you have any questions about your portfolio or the economy visit us and Armstrong advisory group dot com\nYou've been listening to Wall Street week in review with Michael Armstrong no back to the legal exchange with ... and Susan Powers\nListening to the legal exchange and it's time for us this thing when we're done we'll answer your questions about anything and everything including me if they blaming process once again here's a lucky and Susan followers [noise]\n... a few questions from listeners for you first question comes from Linda in lake worth Florida and Linda writes I Am widowed and have two children my daughter is financially well off but my son is not and he recently moved in with me\nIs there a way that I can make sure that he's able to continue living in my home if I pass away\nWell I think that the question that's missing here Linda is do you also mind if you just inherit your other child ... shouldn't say that in this question I'm going to assume the way she's phrased is that\nShe doesn't want to just inherited her daughter I Would assume so she just wants to make sure that the son\nWho doesn't have a place to live it sounds like the daughter does right or can can live in the house so let's make some assumptions so let's assume we don't want to just inherit anybody 'cause most people don't\nAnd let's expand this a little bit because I see a lot of problems here in addition to this one you talk about our vocal trust Susan it is I think is one of the most important things to mention a and I know we're discussing it in the material\nThe ability to change your mind yeah right if this had been given away to the kids\nAnd reserved a life a state and that's all and now later on when she wanted to just take care of the sun\nNot not as guaranteed you can't do it because the daughter has half ... you're even though you have a life estate you've you've lost the ability to rethink how you want that remained her interest to go\nUnless you get kids permission so not as good a ... a way to do with the Iraq a couple of trust if it was in there\nAnd can you do it I'm going to assume yes we need to trust even if she doesn't have one ... so if we take this house instead of doing a life a state Linda we put it into an ear replicable trust one just like we're talking about in our materials then\nWhat can be done well then once it's in their ... Linda would be able to call let's say I was the draft her she would call up me and say you know Todd I we did this trust and you know two thousand six and\nNow my son has fallen on hard times and I need him to have a place to live the rest of my life can we fix it\nYes we can fix it in the trust that we don't need to talk to the children at all we can simply name uh exercise the power of appointment in the document allowing her to uh just how she leaves the assets to her children\nSo now that we know the flexibility exists to do this in an era of a double trust even for all of you folks who might have done one years ago\nFor Linda it looks like she hasn't done any planning so we will create the trust now and we will put this house in it and we can set it up this way from the get go\nThe language and the trust which say upon my death I Divide in allocate everything equally to the children\nHowever with regard to the property located at X Y Z street mhm that needs to be held in trust for the benefit of my son put the name and\nAnd the language in there should go on to say that my son can continue to live there the rest of his law\nIf but to put some teeth in it that says provided he pays all of the bills real estate taxes up jeep maintenance et cetera\nWhy because one there may be no money in the trust\nTo do that right and then what the house gets sold or by the real estate tax people put a lean on the house and force the sale you don't know ... right so you need money to maintain the least he can do is maintain it\nPlus the rest of the assets might have been divided equally to the kids and maybe you wanted them paid out so maybe the daughter got her piece mhm and the son got his peace well then use that money son to pay the bills\nAnd you'd be looking at any or evoke will trust in this case because we want to make sure that houses there for the sun so we had to protect\nThat that's exactly right okay planning that would be done here would be an ear replicable trust so that the nursing home can't take it in case Linda falls into one before she\nPasses remember we still want to protect Linda ... is all about Linda first and then the children but this would give you that ability to do that so and if and if she if he doesn't pay all the bills than the house can be sold and the money simply amongst the children so we've got this inherited the Donner\nInland and if you or any folks listening are interested in finding out how these very vocal about trust operate on a day to day basis great place to start is with education and Todd's guide that he's written\nFor the month of October it's designing ... trust this guy will show you exactly how they operate it will also include information about the drafting of your trust in information that\nAbsolutely must be in there and all those problematic clauses that absolutely must not be included in your trust you can call right now do it soon because it's your last chance folks because the month is over\nEight six six eight for eight five six nine nine minutes eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine or\nDownload your free copy on our website legal exchange show dot com\nTodd our last question comes from bill in ... burn math in bill writes\nMy wife has MS and has very little assets in her own name years ago when she was first diagnosed I transferred the home\nOut of her name and put it in just mining my question is about my IRA that's worth around eight hundred thousand should I changed my primary beneficiary to my kids just in case I die before her she would like the likely have to live in a nursing home if I pass away before\nThis is a very interesting question and and it reminds me of some other real life stories and and\nYou know the the idea of planning through short cuts\nIs not always good planning or trying to do it in a you know a quick manner or some kind of a cheaper approach\nI I don't I don't think it always is the best and so when I look at this and I say OK I understand that\nMy my wife has MS we don't know from this what stages she's putting the house and your name now really doesn't do anything you could put the house and your name last minute as she goes in the nursing home putting it in your name now I guess of I'm not even sure why you would do it it doesn't help\nAt all because you can always do it last minute right and again I Would imagine that since she has MS that you guys would at least have powers of attorney in place now so that you could start signing her name and paying bills and ... transferring real estate in case she does go into a facility\nBut more importantly the fact that you've got and that that that your wife has MS should be saying never mind my house and my other non IRA money what should I Do with forget the IRA from it all that other stuff\nYou should be doing planning yeah not just sticking a house in your name what about your investment account that you didn't mention in here that might have you know five hundred thousand it mhm\nLet's take these assets and do regular planning as if she didn't have MS 'cause you know how long MS takes ... can be a long time yeah there's lots of treatments and so we don't know so\nWhy not set up your state plan put as much as you can knock the Ira\nInto these irrevocably trust and learn how your life won't be affected learn how you can live in the property manage the money pay your bills live off the income sell the house ... none of these things change when you put it into the euro vocal trust but now you have a five year waiting period running\nThe clock is starting you got to do it this is a big life event red flag care\nAnd not just for the wife mhm but it's running for the husband remover just because one has MS doesn't mean the other couldn't have a stroke and end up paralyzed so the important thing is to get the clock running for both of you not try to plan just for her\nAnd what do you do with the IRA and in this case if he assuming he does his his trust planning what would you do with the IRA\nPutting stuff in it right we do that we change your deed we actually change the accounts so in this case\nUh this Sherlock person I guess that's how you pronounce your name or had a check checking account put together with a P O D you might see them as T. O. D. transfer on death payable on death to her husband Jerry basically a beneficiary attached to her bank account Tribeca correct is not a brokerage but a bank account\nThen later on she created a revolt ... living trust and then died in twenty Fifteen mhm\nWell Jerry went to claim ownership of the account\n'cause she's listed as the table on death\nBeneficiary you shouldn't have to go to probe it you shouldn't have to go anywhere you go get the money that's what that means ...\nWell the bank said no you don't own it\nShe transferred this to the trust mhm and she said that there was certain statements out there that were you know I guess they produced a bank statement or something and some some computer generated records and and they had a copy of the trust\nBut interestingly enough the only thing that they found that was signed was the original signature card and that was signed in\nHer name alone ... so the point of this was the whole\nDecision came down on a a a summer a judgment that the bank was gonna say look summary judgments should apply here meaning there is no question of fact just approve this thing right allow me to be right the bank said that's what summary judgment means\nWell this court said the ... the Missouri appellate court reversed the lower court and said you can't ...\nSummer a judgment here not when you have a sign signature card and her name alone even though you might have other bank statements and the like\nThere's a question of fact that needs to be resolved and that's all they said they didn't say whether it was actually funded or not funded they just said that there is a question of fact it needs to be resolved we need to go to court and pursue these facts\nI Know that we'll refund trust Todd so let's see we had an individual transfer on death account and they create one of these trust\nWhether it's ... ... we open up a whole new account and transfer the assets over there is no linking and just changing the title on it it's an actual Newtown and the name of the ... without a beneficiary\nYeah and that's a good point I think what ... what the argument might be here is that maybe she kept the same account number ... changed the name\nAnd now because that's what you did there still may be a beneficiary designation attached to it so even though you change the owner to the trust if you left the beneficiary designation on their Frank then maybe it isn't\nIt's going to go according to the beneficiary designation not according to the terms of the trust although the trust doesn't die the giant but well that would trigger that yeah\nBut it's interesting so it would probably pass outside the trust outside the will according to the P.

welcome back to garden line this is the first thing for seal for this morning I Hope you're all nice and warm and snug somewhere on this rainy day off first nor'easter of the season with I'm afraid probably many more to go\nBut it's a good day to be thinking about what you have left to do in the garden maybe doing some reading and one of your favorite olden gardening books may be thinking about next year's guiding plans and um\nWe're talking here we've been talking this morning about some good gardening projects that should still be getting done at this time of year the phone numbers here if you have a question or if you'd like to just discuss your garden with me which I'd be very happy to hear from you\nThe phone number here is five zero eight seven seven five nine nine eight five or eight eight eight nine nine eight five nine five one\nOkay so we have just talked about storing Dahlia is never going to talk about storing ... which is a similar process if you've never grown ...\nThese are those exotic whack see looking lilies\nUm that you can buy for a fortune ... floors or you can simply grow your own they're very easy to grow and\nAnd uh as I mentioned like Dahlia is there a perfect cutting flower or you can just enjoy them in a pot or in the garden and that's one of the nice things about ... is that they can be grown in pots as well as in the crowd\nThey're not as big as Dahlia is um although some smaller values can certainly go grow in pots to or you can draw the bigger ones in gigantic pots of fewer so inclined but ... are more manageable size growing about one and a half to two feet tall\nWas very attractive foliage most of the time they have green foliage with um [noise] ... white spots on them quite quite pretty as I said\nVery few disease problems or insect problem so\nShe quite an easy one to grow um [noise] so if you have grown ease up on what to talk about storing them maybe I'll just give you a few tips in case you might want to grow them next spring you would buy the tumors at the store or someone has given you some pot it already you can then save the troopers for next spring\nBut if you grow these you want to just put them in to save the pot maybe just an inch below the soil level and there are very funny looking plant the tumor is really around almost\nWell I Hope I'm not gonna offend any men out here almost like a man with a bald head the roots come out the sides of this round white to Burr\nAnd that's the way you plan to do with the bald head part up if you will there's a a a more curved part underneath and that goes down so you want to put them in pots down about an inch\nOr you can put them into the soil a couple of inches deep two to four inches deep and that works out quite well when these get growing you don't need to put them in the sun 'til you start to see some foliage as soon as you see foliage they do need to go into the sun but they'll take\nFull sun to park shade in fact they prefer not to be baked in the afternoon sun\nSo that is how when they need good soil and they're going to need some fertilizer along the way [noise]\nBut we're going to talk about storing these lovely plants in just a few minutes but we're going to talk to Joe in how which Joe\nGood morning or the ... there were more ... for the winter okay too\nHard or ... or more values and the end of Europe where\nOkay that's three [laughter] uh well first of all let's start with those knockout roses you don't need to do much with them if they're just really whipping around because they're too long to tall I'd give them a light trim I like to do the heavy pruning on all roses in late march early April\nSo I just you know if like I say if they're whipping around and you're afraid to gonna get bent or broken or if they're reaching out to grab someone Everytime someone walks but I feel free to cut that off\nOtherwise ... [noise] you know you\nCan but it's not necessary on knockouts and the problem with mulching roses is that rodents have this lovely tendency to get in there and not all way at the root stock and we don't really want that to happen so in a really tough rose I prefer not to bother mulching so um have you have there been around a little while yes\nOkay you should be fine um it'd be a very rare winter where you'd lose a knockout rose at least on Cape Cod are rare winter we lose a knockout rose to coal damage and to be honest with you you're probably more apt to fuel mulch it really good to lose it to critter damage\nSo I probably would just not do much of anything they're an easy one that's what I Love about knockout roses are very good okay now on the deli is once you get those dug up you want well to do is first label them second cut back the foliage too about twelve or Eighteen Inches you can cut it back\nA new look around through a highly rated ...\nAnd the best place to do that kept pace with the caves largest selection of beer and wine and spirits and friendly experts to help you choose and of course are legendary low prices go with everything Japanese find one and spirits in families in Hyannis and at ... dot com if it's important\nTo you it's important to us on air and Ninety five point one or on our hearts radiolab use radio Ninety five do you watch the game\n[noise] [noise]\n\nGood morning and welcome back to garden line this is in for filling in for ... this morning I Hope you're all feeling nice and smuggling warm is a little bugging the rug\nOn this dreary nine a day but next week's weather promises to be quite nice so get out there and get your garden chores finished up\nWhile we still can and that includes things like planting garlic storing values and other tumors plants which we'll talk more of in a few minutes\nOn the phone number here if you have a question about anything that's going to happen in your garden for fall or going into winter the phone number here is five zero eight seven seven five nine nine eight five or eighty eight nine nine eight five nine five one and I'm going to be talking with Liz morning Liz\nGood morning I'm thank you I have\nCalled her originally about my victory but while I was waiting I thought to more okay and what about us army like big tree is about four or five years old and I can only describe it as tenacious but in the first year I brought it in and put it out you know and right\nWhen it was just a baby and it grew nicely and the second year it got so huge I only brought part of it in some that have rooted they left it in the ground and then the third\nYear it it sprouted divided in half and gave that way [noise] and then the part that was in the ground die right I forgot about it\nAnd then like three weeks later I was digging\nIt routed so this year it is now there's the senator maybe a couple of damage that are about five and a half feet tall but it spread about five feet wide mhm this year last year I had to write\nA ... a big deal right here I have ... lemons dies Greenland good and\nI don't know should I cut them off and bring them in um but but really ... how do I what am I Do it\nLike do you have any idea what the variety is on it\nI think the Turkish one\nRound turkey ... yeah well that's a pretty hearty one which is why you're having luck with that coming back and there's a bunch of things you can do with them um we had a fee for quite a few years ourselves but it was sort of the same thing where it would get so big that it was it was tough to decide what to do with it um [noise]\nYou can certainly pot it up and if you have separate stem so long as you have enough room mass you could pot up part of it and bring that and you can cut it back somewhat but if you've got figs on it it's a little tricky this time of year um if the other ... soft it all\nProbably a no okay no I I think they're gone I I Do oh okay they got Boston do you think\nYeah I don't think I'm going to harvest them but I I don't think I Want to pick it up either\nAll right then here's another possibility um is you can leave it very tall like that improvement in the spring or you can prove it somewhat now what I Would probably do is mulch it quite deeply now this is where you do want to take\nSoil or compost or something like that and ... maybe a foot or more deep\nAnd then wrap the whole thing in burlap\nAnd ... and burlap\nOr some some of the fabric is going to breathe and lots of leaving old sheets would do the trick\nUm it doesn't need any light once the leaves are gone so you don't have to worry about that you just want to wrap it really really well\nAnd make sure that wrapping isn't going to come off in the wind if you need to put some plant stakes in the ground you know tall ones to attach the wrapping to those steaks and you know if I Know my husband he out there with wine and like do this ... thing all around the whole tree\nAnd then um\nAnd then you know you're taking a little bit of a chance but by and large the roots at least we'll come back every year almost always is a very rare winter when you lose the roots\nSo that's a good because you have a brown turkey too there are some that would not come back every spring okay we were talking about specifically yours Ira and so if you ...\n... ... that it isn't terribly big you know it's\nA fig trees a weird they have like these long thin branches and I mean even in warmer climates like if you were to go to Virginia ... white hearty\nFit there's somewhere it's like a cross between a Trina shrub they never to develop into like a a tree tree you know they're much more of like a shrub with new growth every year and actually that's a good thing is to have\nThe new growth and to be trimming off in fact if they have too many sides a lot of people will trim those off and just leave you know two or three main stems going up and then off of those up higher you can leave some of the side shoots\nSo that you get the fruit and you can be pinching those I don't know if you knew that if for no more fruit if when it's in the growing season you count five leaf tips so one of those sites use that comes off one of those main stems\nYou get five leaves one two three four five and then you pinch it and the same thing with each of those items that comes out pinch and the pinching usually forces them to produce the flowers and the bugs more so you're going to get more fruit out of it by doing that\nWith this pinch me I'm just sniff it on your ... if it's soft enough with your fingertips if it's not take a pair of scissors printers so you've got those five leaves these are the issues that are coming off of the main trunks\nAnd snip it off there and then you're going to have a plant that's sort of more orderly not so big in wild and wooly but you're also going to have a plant that's going to produce more figs few\nFriend yeah so give that a try next spring but for for the winter the best bet is to put some kind of mulch and again you know I Wish I could\nFeel good about telling you to put straw down there but we have such a rodent problem on Cape Cod that they can cause so much damage to the base of plants that I'd much rather have you put even just um\nAdjusts soil or compost or something and the reason we're mulching it up that top you know ... or something is you're just trying to make sure that that part doesn't die back because as I said the roots probably won't so even if you didn't do anything you probably will have some new growth come up in the spring\nMhm mhm but you will be it'll take longer to get fruit you'll be you know you'll be getting fruit and probably not until late in the season whereas if you can keep some of the upper growth alive and again the burlap wrapping with burlap or whatever's going to help to protect it from wind damage we have cold dry winds here more than anything\nUm so that's what we're trying to do with that\nOkay then my other two Clinton's a very brief Sherman looking out\nThe window and I and I wrote like I have a beautiful climbing world yup it flowered um and it has a real hip hip those off now\n[noise] that is on to your preference you can go out and do you know if you're afraid that that's going to bend them down or break the stems because they're getting heavy you could certainly go out and snip them off and like I said and on climber is what I Do is if they have\nLong branches that are really gonna whip around in the wind and get damaged anyway I'll snip some of that off but I'm not doing my heavy pruning until snoring on them and then I'm a big believer in late march early April pruning on the roses\nSo at this point I'm just kind of targeting them up so they don't whip around so much or even you know tying them to whatever it's attached to to keep it from whipping around so much and then if you want to take those rose hips off you can but it's not absolutely necessary so that's an up to you kind of a thing as long as ... ...\nWell the birds eat them maybe\nThey might yeah I didn't leave no yeah we'll go ahead and leave them then and they're not going to hurt anything at this point in the spring you gonna open pruning anyway\nOkay so my third question is uh my uh indoor plant as the burning oh yeah and\nWhat do I do it on the last bike has died back in like a welding and all the leaves are turning yellow now\nIs it still outside or you brought it as well I Would probably just cut it back um they would like to be cool all winter\nThey don't really like it hot even in the summer here so\nPut it in a cool place if you have a basement window maybe even that's a good place and then just you know you're keeping it above freezing water it periodically not too frequently do not fertilizer just let it go until we get to February and march\nAnd um let me know how you make it out with that one because I've never over winter that one but I Know that that would be the procedure and I know they like it could\nDo ... I was ... back yes how all it was about twelve inches\nApart so that has no plans about twenty four and says\nOkay you print it back to about eight to twelve inches and and you'll get some new growth yup got to go to the news a thanks for calling and I just very quickly wanna give you the phone number five zero eight seven seven five nine nine eight five we have to go to the news this is in first filling in for ... you're listening to ... WRX today [noise]\nWe are getting jobs local news authority WMGK west ... job and I heart radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK\nPolitical views are widely wants to work with say out at a nightclub and knew him from a gym\nAnd within just a couple of months there'll be ready to set a few all over again we will still talk about over wintering ... isn't just a minute let's go to Diane and see what she's calling about Hi Diana\nHi good morning good morning I'm I have to um hot to throw the Sharon and I'm not I take a little ship out on the ground oh sure and the pot like twelve by ... by a yeah it's been in probably three quarters of the summer\nAnd they're all living there all healthy yeah what do I do now\nYour best bet is probably if you can just bury them somewhere just in the pots don't take them out of the pilots just sink the pots and to the ground somewhere like vegetable garden\nThat's what my husband that that's why ... ... if he's listening that's why what some parts of a vegetable garden have now become a shrub plantation but [laughter] but yes that's a perfect place or went to them because it is nice soft soil and it's easy to just pop them in there in the pots\nAnd then in the spring you can just pull those pilots back out and by then the root systems will be even better and if you want to take them apart a plant them somewhere else at that point they might be big enough to do that with\nBecause as I've mentioned before this morning the roots really do grow a lot in the fall so best to leave them in their pockets but if you can sink those pots into the ground that ...\nPerfect it one other question like Christmas ... or ...\nYup and your wife fertilizer might get let it go\nNo don't fertilize until spring now a mine ... mine spent the whole summer outside I brought them in a couple of weeks ago and it says you get chilly and boy are they looking good like yours are I'm sure it's going to be a a great winter full of ... [noise]\nUm so I wouldn't fertilize it just water them when they dry out you know you want to do one over water them you want the so to be drafted the touch and then give them some water and that's all you really need to do with those put them in some areas where they get some light and enjoy them\nSo they amoral if they bring in and I put it in the dark I Am a realist is yeah now that's a different course of a different color you can\nCut the foliage off and bring it in and put it in a dark spot I some years I let the foliage go but this year I have cuts into you know it depends a little bit um if you've got lots of sunshiny window space in your foliage still looks good you could leave it on and do that\nUm but either way they're not going to bloom until the days start getting a little longer and the temperature gets a little warmer so what I'm doing with some of\nMine is just bringing them in a can fully jobs bring them in leave them to dry for a while and then when I'm\nWhen you're ready and whenever you're ready as when you're ready you know if you want to start them in December my watering them again and bringing them out into the sun and uh one location or you can do it in January or February whatever makes you happy that's when once they start don't fertilized 'til they start to get leaves when they start to get their leaves again\nThen you could start giving them a little bit of fertilizer it's also good opportunity if they seem to pop bound although they like to be somewhat pot bouncer don't make the mistake of\nYou know putting them in too big of a pot\nBut um if they seem like they're just too big for the pot then that's a good time to put fresh soil and some people even take the tumors out of the pot shake off the soil and um and do that over the winter if you have to 'cause you don't have the space than you can do that I think it's easy to just leave them in the pots and\nLooked soil dry out and then start watering them and I'm ready\nOkay well thank you so much for all your information and and I think you'll you to your mother that might come by\nAnd I hope everybody out there is staying dry so um the phone number zero five zero eight seven seven five nine nine eight five or eighty eight nine nine eight five nine five one\nNow to risk for going you know if you have regular wax ... which are the kind that actually looks just like a regular house plant and you wanted to lift some of those or even some dragging a wing ... types of plants from your garden you can just simply\nCut them back a bit and let them get some fresh growth when they come in those you're going to just put it in a pot with good soil and maybe well I probably would skip the fertilized but keep them ways um put them into\nEither and east or west facing window doesn't have to be a south facing although at this time of year it could be south facing 'cause they're not going to get burnt but as spring ... comes close are you going to want to move into an east or west window\nAnd just keep those growing all went to his house plants and then you can pop him back into the soil or in the spring you could even divide them at that point to risk for going as however which are the ones with the big showy flowers such as nonstop ...\nThose are a horse of a different color like the ... and the ... you need to bring them in in store that Uber's now if they're growing in pots you could again simply cut off all the top growth\nLet the soil dry out and store them in a labeled pot makes sure you'll labeling it or you won't know what you've got an that pot\nAnd then throw that in a dry place usually my basement is full of plants like that in the wintertime so that's a great place if you have a garage that doesn't get below fifty or so you can storm and there\nAre I'm not that lucky mine goes way down to like ten [laughter] so that's not a good place for me but it might be a good place for you so long as it stays fifty or so degrees that's all that those those plants need now if they're not in pots and you want to take them out of the soil or take them out of the parts that they're growing and\nYou have to do this very carefully I Would generally tip the ... over\nGet this cut the tops back to the pot over get the plant out of the pot\nCut it back and then\nThere's going to be sort of a ... mess the tumors are not always obvious onto ... so and you feel that ... I Would just take that soil and all and it should be a PD so that's what they like to grow best and has a very pd soil\nAnd then let that dry a bit and then put it again in a cardboard box with a paper bag in the basement\nWith some kind of a either peat moss are piling soil or or again my old favorite the the wood shavings and label that bag and then in the spring you could pot them up in a nice PT\nPlodding mix with some fertilizer and get them growing once they get leaves you're going to need to have them in the sun you don't need sun for them until you get to that point\nUm and we're
