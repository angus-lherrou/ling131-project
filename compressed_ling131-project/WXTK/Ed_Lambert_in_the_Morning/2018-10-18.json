Houston's not playing up to their game they're pitching has been awful their catchers socks so that helps too and there's a lot of things working in the red Sox favor but they're definitely earning it not trying to take anything away from the red Sox so it's looking like they're making it back to the world series one went away\nThere on the brink right now everyone is three and one one more when whether it be out in Texas are back home here in Boston one more wind and a and I got to tell you the chances of them are winning right now I ... the odds are so in their favor it isn't funny\nYeah I the last three that they've made it they won all four o seven and Thirteen I think I think that's the last three so\nWell good luck to the red Sox I'm not going to mention anything about the next game because you're going to vote against me anyway shore but I have a feeling they're coming back to Boston and a winning in front of the home team\nI think that's fair but Houston has a little bit of look like they're kind of got to roll over and die and I'm not I'm not sure if they're necessarily going to battle back from this\nThank God oh for heaven's sakes last game at home for heavens it got

figure out you know get through all the\nYou know the the ups and downs and the ins and outs of what's going on with the with the voting but it's a and we're talking last night Matt and my wife and I my wife said that I have never seen so much interest in a midterm voting as ... as we have this year\nShe said usually it's hard you know but you know but this year it's uh it seems like every breath in their brothers got to get out and vote gotta get out and vote that so much interest in the midterms\nAnd it has to do with that not only nationwide but also you know statewide in the questions that are on the ballot I think that are are getting everybody all psyched up about we got to get out and vote\n'em on a national level or whether or not the or the Democrats can uh uh there are a few points ahead still can take Congress I mean take the house back\nOr which I don't know I once again I don't see any blue wave I see an awful lot on the on the block but the Senate it looks like the or the Republicans are going to probably increase or their number on the Senate from fifty one maybe three or four more senators are going to be Republican\nAnd one of the things that I found out\nOr we were ... we were noticing it and talking about it is the fact that every time we talk about what's going on politically the Democrats are ahead or the Republicans are ahead or whatever it might be even on a local basis there isn't one word\nOn the polling about the independents and and just about everywhere independence are registered on enrolled her at registered more than either Democrats or Republicans\nSo I don't know how that was maybe the polls go you know are you a Republican no I'm an independent well how you're going to vote but they don't give you that break down at all in the polls and I think that's a a major mistake because there are so many of us that are registered and enroll independent\nAnd I find that a an ... interesting none stat if you will coming up into these elections and um we live in a in that state and we live in a in an area if you will where you're going to find an awful lot of ah it didn't used to be that way I mean\nCape Cod used to be a dead one

written by Betsy and Brewster\nHere's my brief but spectacular take\nOn the twenty Eighteen elections\nI'm voting for Steve leaving what's for state rep in the first ... I voted for Ron Bergstrom for county commissioner Julian Syria for state senator J Gonzalez for governor\nOf course they're going to support her for Senate of course they're not going to support Jeff deal\n\nBecause Jeff deal is a was a state rep for women and they said Jeff deal is a is too closely aligned with President Trump he co chaired the election campaign ... a supporter of Trump well of course no we're not going to go go with him\nBut we are going to go for Elizabeth Warren and yet they do they talk about it she they don't give you all the negatives but they do they try to be fair but I don't see it as as such\nBut um we'll see but it it's not that big a deal we knew that they were going to do that very little uh a surprise is coming up right now but I Do have a feeling that a

[noise]\nRunning for state rep second burns was about five minutes or actually four minutes in in front of a nine o'clock right after she gives me right after nine ... some people say took a Charlie Baker do the cleaners yesterday on their on their debate we'll be talking to Jay after nine o'clock alright\nHere we go I don't know if we're going to try to get more calls but I got to ask you this sure right on down the questions question one what is the last question one is yes yes yes yes question one question to question three\nShe didn't even you didn't really give me a chance to to ask why or anything like that or a question one is yes you feel you should have the or the nurse is a certain amount of uh nurses per per reputation just her you know believe you're just going to cost us a ton of\nDo I think investing in human health in great the life outcomes for the patient is always going to be expensive and I think a bunch of the numbers that are flooded are actually an accurate so you think they're lying through their teeth I think there's probably some miss representations on both sides but I'm voting yes\nSee I can say line through the ... you can write you say misrepresentation I mean no I understand that okay question to set up a commission to take a look at what we're going to be doing about funding\nRight I think kind of campaign finance reform is wildly important subject to be\nDiscovered I don't I didn't even think it needs to be a question I think it's stupid they could set up a commission and suddenly want it to I mean we out all the little bit of leadership up there from Toledo and some other people they could have had a commission now we've got a ballot question I think it's a waste of time I hit a set up the commission for Christ ... yeah All right great question three uh\nI think taking away transgender rights it was just unconscionable to be honest with you and I think a bunch of the predatory behavior that people project out is going to happen is not going to be coming from the people that um you know there's just a lot of casting aspersions\nYou know if you get up in the legislature and I know that ... that if you do Paul one of the problems I have is all of this stuff about well let's be transparent let's do this let's do that when it came to different questions like the like the uh the amendment I mean the law now on the books about transgender they didn't let the people vote on it\nBut the nurses are the people got to vote on it because they're too chicken to take it on up there and the state I Love it I agree with you a hundred percent on that when they showed us from the uh the transgender to the people let them vote on it\nAnd they ... and ... and uh they didn't and I think that's what the ... of people are with questions three right now you know yeah that's what the feeling they weren't doing their job a great what are you gonna do\nYou're you're not allowed to resume or getting in there and when yeah how about term limits what he's like [noise]\nI think term limits for executives governors and presidents makes sense I don't think they make sense for collaborative a legislative bodies in which um if we did go with term limits what you'd end up finding is that the power ended up going most likely to lobbyists who would become the permanent sort of ensconced class in a ... they already are they already are and I think it would cost and\nYou can see it up there for drinks in their hands go up with Sarah pick one of these days have lunch and see how many people are floating around [noise] yup they already are [noise] yeah\nSo I think it would only a strengthen the hand of lobbyists and so I think every two years is the term limit that the legislators are already given\nHow 'bout that well the commission might that might help that if they set up question too so\nThat everybody doesn't get an awful lot to do from whatever their whatever they're doing so they're gonna have to take a look at it maybe yes maybe no I don't know five oh wait seven seven five nine nine eight five are toll free phone number is one eight eight eight WICK Ninety five one time in the truck you got less

with you when you're special operations teams are out there in the in the world we have dramatic advantages and when you're walking around the planet with fifty of your best friends\nWell armed and well protected you actually feel are incredibly secure so I think it's a real good point that you're making about the dangers that are along the border I was effectively walking around with a knife in my pocket and a backpack on my back in the in the ... and deserts and there was a number of threats for sure\nPeople getting in touch with you by checking me out on the line Paul Cusick right policies like dot com yep ... dot com or a good point and isolating United and thanks for coming on and I met labor will be back right after the nine o'clock news with Jay comes out saying\nThat when news breaks out we break in when you watch the gay West Germany gate God and I hardly radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK\nIn on the missing journalist him off the show he went in to the Saudi conflict assemble more than two weeks ago he told his fiance that if he didn't come out to call to people one of them has now spoken to ABC senior foreign correspondent in handling as symbols\nI don't have the resources they need and people can't depend on them to get to work on time we just started dragging our economy backwards it's affecting people's quality of life is very real way and I'm not satisfied with the status quo so I'm gonna I'm asking the wealthy to pay more taxes so that we can tackle some of these issues\nOkay so you're in favor of the millionaires tax obviously\nYes I Am okay I I I've I'm\nOkay let me just interrupt just go back to transportation just for a second if we if we spent six times more than our neighbor to the north on roads and everything else would you agree that maybe there's a little bit of fraud waste and abuse in the union systems and what's going on right now are not\nUh no that's not our problem are problems we've been under investing in transportation were forty fifth in the condition of our infrastructure and the country forty sevens the commute times we first\nAnd disabled trains at the MBTA because we have not uh then we we've got an old infrastructure system and we haven't been making the investments we need to make to make it work for people and you know Charlie Baker his whole approach to issues like this the status quo first\nFor most no more no more taxes so where are we what do we have what's the best we can do and that's not working for people and so I'm gonna ask the wealthy to pay more in taxes that we can make a difference and fix these issues that are holding working families back\nIn the right to find wealthy force Jay\nSo I've got a very specific proposal to raise three billion dollars in New taxes each year one is to bring the millionaires tax back it would it would ah increased income tax on people who earn over a million dollars it would raise two billion dollars a year for the state that can't happen at the earliest for\n... until four years from now because of a it requires a constitutional amendment\nSo when we can't wait that long so the other thing I proposed\nIs to raise a billion dollars from the wealthiest universities in our state with an endowment tax\nOn universities that have dominance of over a billion dollars and\nUh I think it's a fair proposal you know we've got huge wealth gap\nIn in our state in our country and\nThese institutions like Harvard and MIT and others had been able to accumulate these huge endowments because of our public policy that we don't tax them\nOh these would raise real money to make a difference for real people in this state I Am not going to raise taxes on lower and middle income people but I Am going to be honest with people that we need to raise taxes from the wealthy in order to to address some of these issues in education and transportation\n[noise] you're talking about private universities and colleges is that correct yes no cast how many are would be affected by this and dumb and tax\nNine or would be affected and um\nIt would raise about a billion dollars a year for the state oh a and I think they can afford it I'm based on their historic performance and the rate at which there endowments they're growing I think these institutions are really important to our state\nUh they're they're huge assets for innovation based economy in great they provide financial aid to their students but I think they can do everything they're doing today based on their historic results and still pay this tax and make a big difference for working families in the state\nI'm Talking to Jay Gonzales everybody Democrat running for governor of the commonwealth of Massachusetts what do you think about a sanctuary state Jay\nSo I supported legislation a that was referred to as a safe communities act which basically would have required that state and local law enforcement officials focus on enforcing state and local laws and not do the work of federal immigration officials which is not their job\nThe federal responsibility and particularly now I don't agree with\nTrump's approach to immigration I think he's acted in a way that's inconsistent with our values are and the last thing we should be doing in this state in my view is contributing to this year he's creating in uh the immigrant community\nOr by taking on a role that isn't our responsibility\nSo what ... what fears in the immigrant community really what what fear do they have if they're here legally what for you or do they have\nWell they they have fear of being a being separated from their\n... their handling Leno if they're here illegally one example legal if you want it after a legally\nImmigrants legal immigrants not going to be separated from their families\nWell I'm I'm I'm giving you one example um there's demand Francisco who who I met who's been here for ten years or what came seeking asylum asylum was rejected but he was permitted to stay here year after year paid taxes member of the community got\nMarried has children all who are American citizens Donald Trump detained him put him in jail or trying to deport him after he followed all the rules and uh and that's not a good result\nWill not a good result evil families personal results aren't there wasn't it wasn't as if it wasn't\nDonald Trump's but first of all he he he did not well ... do you do not follow all the rules\nYes he did\nHe was rejected he did everything he was told to do\nHe was re enacted for asylum you should have gone home right\nWell at ... this is this is an issue we we apparently disagree on\nWell he did not do all that he was supposed to do you said he did everything he was supposed to do he went up arrange island country ... ... illegally country seeking asylum\nCame to this country illegally seeking asylum they didn't allow him asylum he should have gone back home just we'll just along with all the thousands of people that are coming across our southern border right now seeking asylum they got a court date and then they either stay or go he didn't go\nSo he did not follow the rules I must say I'm just saying you know\nYeah I understand what you're saying\nOkay how about licenses for ah for people that are not residents of the United states\nYes I think we should issue licenses to undocumented immigrants um\nIt's a matter of public safety uh and I'm I'd much rather have undocumented immigrants\nLicense and driving uninsured on our roads the not\nBecause we're talking with Jay Gonzalez everybody's going to take some calls or let's go over to Hyannis been good morning you're on a ...\nA good morning at all but forgotten by Ben mayor about a\nGovernment investing how does the government in about ... and other words you're saying best in the MBTA\nYou mean the government your tax more I mean how are you going to worry about the money's already there where's the money going\nThen the issue is there's not enough money to make the MBTA worked for people and so why\nWhy you know I quick story of girl but I I Know\nWork than the MBTA when she was Eighteen years old at age forty three she retired with ... percent over a yeah OK fired up\nAbout bad someone else pick her job and they make a long story\nShort this girl when she's eighty we're going to be paying five ... ... is that feasible\nYeah okay that's a good bet Ben thanks for the court I'm not\nSure what your point is but um but what do we what government plays a really important role in supporting all of us in one of its fundamental responsibility is making sure we've got a transportation system that people can depend on\nA ... it's the ports our economy it's critical to our economy businesses need their workforce to be able to get to work and we're falling down on that job and to say that the reason we're falling down is because of unions is in my view ridiculous\nUm we've got to invest more to make our system works for people and that's the responsibility that Governor Baker is not following through with\nJay one of the uh in the Boston Herald reporting or in their analysis\nThey're saying that you build your campaign for governor and promises including everything including single payer health a universal pre K massive investment in the tea but a lot of the critics are saying and the the GOP analysis anyway saying that it's going to cost us upwards of sixty billion dollars in order to reach those goals what do you think\nWell mass geo peas and not a I'm an objective observer and this and uh the sixty billion dollar estimate of theirs is ridiculous\nOK I'm a you said you wanted to really want to do most\nOf what they say that sixty billion dollars is moving to a single payer health care system which would actually save us money not cost us money\nAnd the three billion dollar um specific tax proposal that I've put out there to raise taxes on the wealthy to invest in education and transportation is going to allow us to do everything that I said it's going to allow us to\nGive every child and family access to affordable childcare and pre school where we are the most expensive state in the country right now it's going to allow us to fully fund our public schools it's going to allow us to ensure that public universities in community colleges are affordable for residents\nAnd it's going to enable us to fix our transportation system in at the very least it is three billion dollars more that we'll be investing in those things to make a difference for people then Charlie Baker will because his plan is zero and that's not good enough from my perspective\nFive away seven seven five nine eight five are toll free phone number is one eight eight eight WICK Ninety five one let's head over to Rochester Russ good
