Keith ...\nIt's about so much on today's show really as it pertains to the five different steps we feel like each person listening needs to take to have a successful retirement so what is your number one take\nAway from today show yes really embracing the five step process you know so many people out there are working with advisors and\nMaybe they focus on just investments or you know maybe they're working with attorney where ... where they just focus on you know legacy or they're working with an account and then they're just getting their taxes done but they're not all talking to each other they're not all communicating and working together to maximize your retirement\nOr five step process gives you the ability to say yes I can retire you know I Know I have enough income I you know my investments are properly allocate it you know making sure I'm looking at and not missing any\nPotential tax savings looking at everything from health care standpoint to make sure you're not leaving a huge question mark at the back end of you retire and then finally making sure that we transition them money from you\nToo ones are the charities or wherever you want your money to go to in the most efficient way from a time standpoint a cost standpoint and attack standpoint\nAnd if I'm listening right now Keith I like the fact that I can do this all in one spot I don't have to go to sixteen different places to get all these things ... do we do it all here we're most advisors let's face it they build what I call a partial plan is your investments see next year you're not focusing on the entire picture So Matt what's your number one takeaway what\nI'll do is they'll just focus on one I mean they're all very very important but just when it comes to volatility and just sort of the investment planning portion of it I just sort of the siege all of our listeners that don't let the market control when you retire\nDon't let the market dictates when you were going to put your noticed and let your boss snow and make sure that the market never forces you back into work and I say that because by taking control of your overall portfolio\nMaking sure the risk is where you want to be making sure that you have sort of segment into your safety ... assets your income assets and your growth assets taking all of that steps make sure they are the you make sure the fact that the market will never ever\nHave a direct impact on your lifestyle on on your retirement and and just on your overall happiness\nIt's awesome I couldn't agree more and I think my takeaway is going to be the common question we get the most is number one can retire and when I've been hearing a lot lately is folks coming in for the first time off the radio show and they'll sit down and me and they'll say\nI Know I Can't retire I'm not sure I'd probably have to work into my seventies and so I mentioned earlier in the show we had a couple of that came in two years ago billion Angela who said the same thing there were sixty four I said what are you going to retire and they said we're not going to be able to I Know we're going to have to keep on working where most even embarrassed to be here\nThey've saved up five hundred thousand dollars and I said\nLet me let me crunching numbers for you let me see what this looks like\nAnd I just tell you that her and her husband Angela and her husband Billy they were able to make it they were able to retire we were able to build them a plan and I love being the bearer of good news they want it to retire ideally by sixty eight in the planning tools that we use\nWe actually get them to retire by age sixty six and like I mentioned they came in two years ago at sixty four so you know what they just did\nThey retired I talk to her about two three weeks ago and they're planning a trip for their entire family to go away and to be able to travel one that they never they thought they couldn't retire now they have actually take a trip as well so you until you pick up the phone you never know what your situation looks like until you have a plan built for you\nIn all took four billion Angela two years ago to have this financial independence that they've been able to create\nIs a phone call and I love working with awesome families that don't think they can retire in a lot of times they actually can so right now over the next two or three weeks we have set aside five appointments only from this radio show if you call right now in book a visit with us here's where you're going to get you going to get an S.
