{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "Um okay well she gets the kids on board yeah yeah yeah it's OK model so we have no trouble and they agree to give back the money\nThat they get so that ma can buy another house mhm 'cause remember folks when you have a life of state and you get older the value of your life interests while you are the president owner of the property the value of your life interest is small the older you get\nSo at her age and and I forget how old she was she was about and I think she's pushing eighty ... the amount of procedure she would've gotten would have been maybe Fifteen Percent well that's not enough to buy another house no on five or six hundred thousand dollars\nSo they sell the house and then lo and behold unbeknownst to her son decides to say you know what I'm not giving it back to money wow well she doesn't have to right that's a big problem\nAnd so this is why I don't want you to ever give the house to the children and ask for that permission and so then a little bit longer goes on and she says well listen I Can't have this um a aggravated I'm going to file a lawsuit against my children or my goodness oh yeah so she does\nAnd you know what folks before we go any further let this be a lesson to you don't let this be your real life story gets your planning done get it done in advance if you've been wondering how these ... trust operate if you're concerned about protecting those assets\nTodd's guide that he has written for the month of October it's designing in income only ... trust it gives you the guidelines of what needs to be in your trust what must not be in your trust\nPage eleven shows how you can sell your home after it's in this trust without asking the permission of your children page fourteen shows how you can change your beneficiaries\nInstead of filing lawsuits she could have just change her beneficiaries at her well ... if she uses these trust call right now for your free copy of Todd's new guide\nEight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine you can also download a copy on our website legal exchange show dot com\nOkay so now we've got the lawsuit filed he's suing [noise] yeah the ... the one that the three men are all three girls cash a check I guess she's suing technically the child who won't get well and he won't give back the money\nUm and so you're right that was a great analysis Susan that you made whereas if it was in the trust not only would you not being and gives permission to sell your not need to ask for permission to get the money back\nAnd you could change beneficiaries anytime you want your out none of these problems of existence had done the vocal trust okay so she filed the lawsuit and\nThey're waiting now her argument is that she never really gave away the property and there was really some kind of a constructive trust that was formed I Love it right yeah\nAnd and so this is the arguments that she makes and the court proceedings go on and she dies\nOr the before the answer so she dies before the answers so that's why the kids the two daughters are in the meeting with me she dies before the answer then the answer comes and guess what she won\nYeah so the money was forced to come out of the escrow account and the judge ordered the return of the money and so now the money did get put back into her account 'cause it was as if she didn't give it away and so all the other money all the proceeds now is back in her state ...\nSounds like a win because she really didn't obviously she well she was going through the the the the lawsuit she changed her will and made sure she just inherited that yes son so she really didn't want to son to get even one third of the proceeds\nSuccessful you think but\nSo it turns out also that she never went to the nursing home so there was no worry about Medicaid leans from the nursing home except she was on the community mass health for a very very long time to the tune of about two hundred and Twenty one thousand dollars a long time\nSo during her life community mass health had paid and now there is a lean on her state for the two hundred and Twenty one thousand dollars of mass health claims that she fought so hard\nTo have this asset put back in her name because she died in ... and her name yeah bullshit falling again about the argument why yeah so now we're telling her name yeah and so because it's in her name now there's a lean on the property and they're wondering can I\nDo anything now yeah I don't think so right 'cause it's cash you won't\nEven be able to negotiate a settlement because that's all they're right and they're going to say just take it and this is where as state recovery comes in and takes the money whereas had they left it the way it was with this life estate arrangement at least worst case scenario the sun would have got one third\nOf the proceeds the two daughters would have gotten their one third each\nAt least and that would have been no probate assets so there would have been no as state\nOf every and so mass health would not have been paid you cannot even make this I'm telling you this is one of the top ten\nYou must have been salivating in that way\nTo use this real life story I mean I feel bad for the people that's not the the point and I explained it I'm going to do this just to help other people not necessarily give away the property and reserve life a state\nThis is a real life situation right don't do that if you really want to reserve life estate cars you liked that feeling then put the remainder interest in one of these irrevocably trust and move forward ... and that way you won't have any of these\nProblems you know what folks don't be Todd's next real life story educate yourself get your plan in place you need to have an iron clad uh stay planned and this guy will show you what must be in your trust in sixteen\nDifferent trust provisions that absolutely must not\nBe in your trust it will also show you how these operate on a day to day basis because when you hear the word ear evil about it is not as scary as it seems you still have the flexibility\nTo

WMGK when you went to the local news\nGood morning I'm more of the WICK news update over voters will decide next month whether to approve additional funding for a new town hall ballot at their meeting this past Tuesday is look when voted to put a request for one with three million additional funds on November thirteenth spiritual town meeting weren't\nAnd sandwich which we will have some events we all may be selling them or at least like you know where you can get them we don't have a design yet could use somebody being a citizen design that would be wonderful\nIf you're very crude when our children are listening this morning we need a button yes All right we're buttoned design and later yes and there will be an award or prize for having your button chosen guy\nAnd the buttons or ten dollars ten dollars ... okay and as I remember they go very fast one cigarette author yes so we will help you for telling people that the buttons were out for you know the program is now under new leadership new people are you making any changes\nNot really we did have a few discussions that are meeting about meetings about maybe having it started to ourselves and involving some programming but it just seems like it works best the way they printed originally from four to nine and we'd like to keep the same template so that people have what they're used to and that they're not disappointed in the program that the only\n... teams that we made is because I've lost Venus I've had to stretch the program on a little bit we're hoping that we have a transportation to get down to the sandhill school\nIs needed and then we will be having performance down at the sand hills school as well as in town\nAnd we just picked up a wonderful little venue is that what was the ... the um the small one on ... and we've actually pick that up\nAs a venue and we haven't been plans for now because right now I'm just letting all the you know I just wanted this afternoon [laughter] so I'm excited about that and I'm thinking about maybe having the children's programs down there\nAnd working with that so that even if you go out and you've enjoyed the\nThe performers at the beginning of the evening as you head towards Sean pong for the fireworks and there'll be children's programming there that might keep her children entertained while they're waiting I'm very garden and I've also have the with a pirate museum coming\nThey're going to bring an excavation and design a pirate flag\nTo first night so that that my my idea is that the children well see the ferry garden first and then as they are roaming through they will hear some kind of Scott all and it will be the pirates rating the ferry garden and stealing their special things that they have\nThen they'll go over to the pirate museum display and they will be excavating what the pirates of hidden from the fairies in a while that sounds like fun I think\nYeah well they ... or times are going to have to be there [laughter] anywhere between four and eight ... down though\nYou are always heard all wonderful parade and\nReferred to as the tone of giant what does that mean\nThe giants are some at first the giants are the barge\nElectric fried statues that you see on the side of the road on the road and six six days they are designed by Michael ... hopefully I said his name correctly has not again I Apologize\nI'm he is also created some puppets for the parade cell is just in the in the storage area about two weeks ago with the former woman who was in charge of first night Denise diverse she has been wonderful and helping me answering any questions that I may have calming nurse [laughter]\nSo there's ... there's a sea turtle there is some starfish and it's kind of an under the sea\nProgram of walking toward Sean ... to have the fireworks go off and they sit literally sit on your shoulders so needs some volunteers because some of them seem to be a little bit heavy so if you're tall and if you're interested in carrying ... around\nOn your bat but that seems electrified and moving his hands because their puppets come on down\nYou're absolutely if you're drawing also strong shoulders [laughter] so the parade is one of the highlights there's this tool to come to mind the parade and the fireworks and a total ... to ... what what's in the parade\nOn the parade involves having again the giants as they walked through town also involves having children may be some younger children and some teens making as much noise as they possibly can because it's New Year's eve\nWhich is why it's traditionally known as the revelers parade said they're welcoming and meet New Year's scaring off any bad ghost or demons that might be around wanting to ruin your next year\nAnd then they they walked through town they walk from the wing school down to ... I Believe\nI haven't gotten this far but I Believe in previous years they have a little presentation than I can and go as often as a countdown of lights that leads us to happy new year um this year\nI'm hoping to incorporate a town picture just like to Adam does like Joe said just a cat um does um it could be an issue because it will be dark but I'm also going to is there should be a lot of light around that we could get people and if not we'll make it another time I think that um does it on New Year's morning\nI'm not sure though you're right is managed morning start still so people when they line up to see the parade they're going to see the giants are going to see the\nKids are making noise boiled but it'll be hard to get them to make noise Oh yes oh they're just don't like to make noise at all there is a very quiet\nSo that gives will remain a lot of noise or their costumes of any kind of the gives you a ... like strings around their hubs or [laughter] we\nHave for the ... for the for that evening we have um some of the times that light up there's some laser light up\nUm I Believe there's even some fairy winds and I I'm going to get more I I mean these are left over from last year so they can use those if they wish to have a cost him on I Would not discourage that\nBy any means I think it would be fun to have cost as your with your with other one question what yet or hopefully it won't be as cold as it was last\nYear I Hope not know the other thing that you and I talked about was the fact that there will be food trucks there and we need some food truck you folks do you know anybody that has a food ... would like to come down and take part in the first one sandwich so talk about the food virtually have lined up\nUm I don't I haven't really heard back from anybody yet earn I've I've contacted a few of them I did happen in ... contact them on friday evening so that could do I haven't heard from yet\nI have talked to Cape Cod coffee there were there last year he said that he would like to come but he was not a hundred percent sure that he wasn't already booked\nA honestly if you have a ... check just email me and I will get you in there and say I think it's important in and and it was a simulated to me that it's important to have warned food that people can eat so that they're feeling nourished and their bodies stay warm\nRight because as you say is is four to nine so it's going right through the winter would be good for\nAlso the churches are putting on and I'm On food and to be honest I Apologize to St john's in the first church I Can't remember what you served\nBut I Believe it was a soup of some kind of one of the churches and there there was one food and coffee and just those or supplements the food trucks\nSo as as you start to see the big picture spread out talk about the performers usually go to a lot of wind up\nI have a lot of people lined up because first night sandwich was\nCancelled and we picked it up I have been calling people and asking them back and many of them are if they're not already booked which a couple of them were and I was very disappointed if they're not I read a book that are coming um a couple of people that are returning to first night salmon sandwich\nAre the bart Weissman trail excellent the kings ...

radio Ninety five on your wife DJ\nSpectrum our weekly public affairs program at I hearts of media Cape Cod where we take a closer look at the issues events than people affecting the tape hands now Doug Bernie [noise]\nGood morning and welcome to spectrum in this segment of the program\nWe're going to be talking about mass higher and the Cape and islands career center now that may be a relatively new name for you formally it was the Cape and islands workforce development board and the executive director David Augustine ours here with us this morning to talk a little bit about\nWhat he does and how you folks can take advantage of what you do well dug in to see a great to see you\nDelighted to be here today well let's start out by talking about for so many years it was the Cape and islands workforce investment board yeah and that was always kind of a mystery\nAs to what to seize vestments or hide I totally agree that that's why we change it to development board because whenever I Would meet people out in the community they asked me well what do you do and I said what the workforce investment board and immediately they thought I was in a financial services of course yeah so we made the switch to workforce development board a couple of years ago because\nThat was the term that was used in the new legislation for the workforce system so the feds re did their legislation that's when we joined them as a workforce development board and I thought they made a lot of sense\nBut now the state of Massachusetts has decided to re branded the entire state in the workforce development system across the state to this mass higher brand which in many ways does make sense\nIssued held businesses if they're moving around the state or individuals who are moving around the state to be able to identify our system is seek the services that we offer which\nFor individuals include counseling and any number of areas that lead to employment\nFor businesses we help businesses for free all by the way for free or more time for free prepaid with your tax dollars okay we held businesses to find the human resources that they need to continue or in business so we do deal with both sides of the equation and\nThe fact the matter is that what kind of the one of the best kept secrets in the country or our system is\nSix hundred and forty workforce sports across the United states every area of the country has a workforce board and we all provides similar services and that we have a resource room where we help individuals that are career center on what used to be called crew opportunity ... weddings outweigh what is now called the mass higher\nCape and islands career center yeah so we offer a resource room to help individuals and the job search we offer workshops and lots of activity including individual one on one counseling if people are qualified for that\nAs well as I mentioned before the direct services to businesses who are seeking to hire individual so in a lot of ways we should be impervious to the\nNormal ups and downs of the political spirit because we help individuals who are out of work seeking work and we also held businesses so you'd think that both the Democrats or Republicans would love us but we get no love from anybody\nExcept for the person that you helped get a job a\nLot of love there absolutely so if someone listening this morning is been out of work for a while maybe they've given up they check the want ads every Sunday but they'll see anything they can come to you folks right because you're kind of a broad spectrum center for someone whose\nJob hunting yeah a career center a provides a wide range of services to individuals and quite frankly ... anyone who is laid off or\nIs trying to collect unemployment insurance is directed to come to a career center before they received any checks so they can take a career center seminar which explains to them all the activities and benefits for being a member of a career center so that they can get the help that can lead to a employment\nWhen we talk about unemployment numbers on the Cape and they're certainly not very high ... years ago I've heard people say well that doesn't take into effect all those people out there who have given up hunting for jobs and\nThat's true when they calculate unemployed first of all unemployment is not hard number unemployment is calculated through a survey and it's pretty good survey I\nA few years ago I was included in survey which are kind of enjoyed and they did it for three or four weeks\nThen they didn't call me for another couple of weeks and then they came back again to see what the opposition was up\nAt one of the cheap questions is are you working or are you looking for work and if you're not looking for work you're not counted as one of the unemployed individuals so um that is true and and those numbers are decreasing now as individuals are hearing\nThat the economy in general is generating a lot of jobs from a lot of people flooded individuals who might have been discouraged before are less so discouraged now and are coming back to the workforce in quite large numbers of matter of fact nationally that's the phenomenon\nHere on the Cape we have this seasonal economy that we hear so much about that hasn't changed well I Would\nSay that has not changed I've been doing this job for Eighteen years and in those Eighteen years I can tell you it has changed\nI think that the upper Cape ... sandwich area\nAs well as Mitt Cape area are much more a year on economy than they were when I first started here yes the hospitality industry is still seasonal to an extent but there are a lot more other businesses here that take up a lot of slack when you get to Orleans and down Cape\nThat definitely is the traditional seated on the economy right on people who choose to live in that region that's the lifestyle that they're seeking the er that's how they enjoy living with that to good lifestyle for them so\nI think that in general it's more of a year on a ... but the seasonal economy has the same issues that they've had since time immemorial\nThe seasonal businesses have had difficulty attracting employees\nSince I was Eighteen years old six years to be sixteen years old and my God they went to Martha's Vineyard to work every member back but I hear you\nOwe it to the Martha's Vineyard to work in the hospitality industry and so back then and that was in the Nineteen sixties the a lot of a high school and college kids that made up the bulk of the seasonal workforce but\nFor a number of reasons that sauce was less available to businesses and they switched a lot to foreign workers to age to be employees and Jay one visa or employees\nThere are a lot of issues in trying to bring in those employees now they're caught up in this whole war show anti immigration right intimate nationally\nAnd so it's more difficult to do that and employers really are having a lot of difficulty in our region and trying to maintain that seasonal workforce I Know back in ...\nBring there was a lot of concern about getting enough workers the J ones are going to be okay but the uh age to be we're not at one point you know the chamber of Congress was trying to focus on people in Puerto Rico that needed a job they're not immigrants\nExactly exactly they they don't need any are spending a year to you guys are they just need to show up yeah we worked with chamber on that matter of fact I was in Puerto Rico about three years ago\nAnd try to come back and work with some of our other counsellors within the career center to see how well we can match up individuals looking for work with the businesses needs to be pretty straightforward process\nIt really is I Am as I should have been what went through it at one point for a little bit and are always found that everybody down there at the curb fraternities was very helpful and very concerned and uh it\nUp because I think there's a stigma attached when somebody is unemployed\nAnd there there may be a little bit older adult or something and they they they feel embarrassed to go in and and try to look for help\nPeople still think it's the unemployment office exactly yeah and most people are shocked when they come into our center when there's no uh no bars on the windows and little clerk sitting there handing out checks we don't do that anymore checks get sent in the mail nobody comes to us to get a check\nOn but if they do come in they'll have a there's a nice reception area some unwelcome some ask them what their needs are um and then we get them to a someone who can help them and whether it in and we have different kind of\n... not really levels anymore because we've we've tried to eliminate that stuff which which are a trial by whatever the services that someone needs to be tried to get them to that\nSo for example so someone came in and we're a had been out of work for several years I'm not have a skill that they could depend on um [noise]\nWe that person would probably wind up with the individual ... pretty quickly um who would work with them to develop either training plan or some other approach to get them a back to work\nOn other individuals who may be a probably more like yourself who may be a little computer literate um who have ah some skills\nWe bring them into a resource room where you have telephones fax machines copy machines and computers of free all for free so that you can use these in your job search so if you need to do a resume\nOr ... and not only do you do a resume but we have people there who were critique your resume and help you to make sure that it's excellent [noise] um\nYou take out workshops which are designed to provide a wide range of skills to job seekers such as interviewing techniques and a lot of other skills that um that will help people to be able to land a job that they want [noise]\nAnd uh and so people can spend as little as much time and then environment as they choose to as they're trying to ah find a job\n[noise] and of course that's the the message we want to get out today is that if you are looking for a job if you have been out of work for a while don't give up and don't feel that you're the only one there is no stigma attached to this is coming in and asking for some help\nAbsolutely it's a it's what we do in and we're happy to do it uh\nAnd you're right there ... there shouldn't be a stigma but unfortunately there is there is um but I I can\nGuarantee without fear of being contradicted I can I can to say that anyone who come into a career center will be more than pleasantly surprised at the environments that they will be um where on north St yeah\nAnd uh it's a brand new building a it's a it was designed to be I actually designed to be office condos [noise] um yeah so we have large uh areas where of\nWho we provoke where people can use our ah\nVarious means in their job search to assist them so I'm I so I Would encourage any individuals who are looking forward to stop and to the career center introduce themselves um and to use all of all you have to register to be a member that's it you just have to register to be a member\nUm and then you can use it all is said their businesses though we asked him to register as a user the career center which they can do on line for business they don't even have to go to the career center only have to do is make the contact on line so we'll get back to them and assess their needs and do everything that we can't meet their needs\nLiving in a mood talking about mass higher and that\nMay be a new name to you formally the Cape and islands workforce\nDevelopment board um but his match higher\nThat change was made so that the word higher\nWould be great in there and you know that if you're looking for a job that's a good place to go to David you have any closing thoughts for people that you'd like people to take away from this program\n[noise] um I Would say just that\nUh that that\nYou were not your father's unemployment office or your grandfather's unemployment office you know\nI I collected unemployment Nineteen Seventy eight when the first um energy crisis hit ... I'm In a lie I was I live in Fall River and they were literally literally lines around the block as the unemployment office I I collected and then it was not a very ...\nVery pleasant experience [laughter]\nThis is not what we have now we have someplace where us our reason for being is to help individuals land jobs and businesses to be able to meet the human resource needs so I'm so any conceptions that you have\nThat uh might keep you from coming in I Would just say you know just setting aside for a minute come in and uh I I Know people are charged up when they work with us because\nAs we treat them with dignity and respect and we provide them with a level of service that uh that we can be proud of and I think most of those that the individuals who are receiving help from us are proud of it also\nOutstanding so ladies and gentlemen were talking about the mass higher Cape and islands career center three Seventy two north St in Hyannis and if you've been out of work\nIf you just gotten out of work if you just starting to look for a job maybe you're got to college and you're looking for a job of the mass higher Cape and islands career center is really the place to go there very friendly and they will help you find something and they won't make you feel like\nYou're a second class citizen of any guy and\nSo David I thank you David Augustine of is the executive director of mass higher Cape and islands career center and I really appreciate your coming in and I hope you'll come back again like Mark thanks very much Doug it's been a pleasure to be able to talk about our cursing and that brings\nTo the end of the segment of the spectrum thank you for joining us this morning I'm ...\n[noise] it's just made another edition of the award winning

well get quite a bit of a\nOkay well so there's a power it's\nOkay so if we're looking to do some shade house plants you have a couple up you have a lot of different options I'm One of the the easier ones uh to get started with would maybe be a ... or a ferns are taught those\nThey come in or they have a a white with white and green leave for a yellow Lee and green leaf a friend you could do like some of the Boston ferns are in some different types of ferns see to be growing in the you know less like if you will\nUm a lot of\nThose you can put into like a a hanging basket or you can keep in tune pot you could also a if you're looking for bigger maybe like house plant type\nYou could use um [noise] it's called the snake plant\nIt's it's not a lot doesn't flower but it you know it's a nice little house plant\nOr you could also use like a different ... you could use [noise] guess dad corn fern for some shady areas\nI think I think a few of those you could use a staggering friend would be more of a hanging\nUm\nLet's see those it just released name a few of those are really some of the easier ones to do\nIn the house or if you're looking for sunny you could always go with like a palm or a um had discussed or one at a a nice leafy type plant as a fig leaf AIG\nHas really big leaves on it or you can get them in Bush former tree farms those would take more son um but as you said you don't you know you have more of the of the shade you'd have to have it hanging from the sky light\nOn how this is just a couple that you could do I like to go with ... because I've seen ... just take off in a corner where it's not getting a lot of sun and just send out shoots are both ways and kind of wrap around that the you know the top of a room that type of thing so I Know it's

[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to the ball parents gardening club the phone number here is eight five six zero four to six one\nBefore the break we were talking with Alex from New Hampshire\nOr she has the second question but I wanted her to hang tight so we can get to it so alley what was your second question\nOkay well\nI cut down there like at the beginning of September ... like crazy I don't know whether it\nWell see you could cut dead heads and get rid of the the flowers are that you know Mother Nature they're not going to do ...\nNo I wouldn't at this time the best time to be pruning a rose is is the beginning of April or may be the both the middle of April I'm okay\nFor the longest time my father would always say that when the red Sox came back to Boston to play a real uh so like the spring training games when they actually just started playing a so easily around April fifteenth April twentieth around that time is when you would have to have a\nGood time to do\nWell in September of what you did was you helped rejuvenated a little bit and get a second bloom out of it\nUh so I Would assume that you know that was beneficial for it it's not a bad thing I Would proven roses a few times especially if you're trying to shape them trying to get them to you know get into the area that you want you they're too big they are too small you know number of different things\nWould have liked to see you do is you could cut those flowers off a once they're\nThey've gone by again Mother Nature tonight might be doing her way of ruining for you\nBut I still get rid of those those um\nFlowers that are spent or dead they're not going to help benefit the plant at all and they're probably going to just turn black and look I'm ... and look on slightly so I Would get rid of those\nAnd plan on around Thanksgiving putting either salt marsh hay or mulch around the roses about twelve inches wide twelve inches high around get to keep the plant insulated for winter\nUnder the same thing is I think\nYeah so one of the reasons why you wait and I as I said for that I Dream as you don't want mice or wrote in ... to\nGo into the plant right now he basically be Kate are creating a mouse hotel right now you'd be putting a straw that have plants to eat in the water from it to eat or to drink so it's basically they wouldn't want to leave\nBecause of that while you wait a little bit I go to your go to your garden center if you're going to get salt marsh hay to do it go to your garden center now and get it and just keep it for later\nOn when it comes time around Thanksgiving a lot of local garden centers that type of place are more worried or a more thinking about like poinsettias Christmas trees Reeves that type of thing\nThey might not have the salt marsh hey at that time so that's why you get it now you keep it till later and then you use it around Thanksgiving to really protect the plant or like I said you could use mulch on the rose is\nA that would that would work as well and the great thing about the salt marsh hey is there is no weed seeds in it\nSo you're not putting any weeds into the garden around it either from that\nAlright thank you so much\nAnd thank you one last thing you would want to do on the roses after any of the cuts that you did and you can do this around Thanksgiving is sprayed some ... proof on those dams where the the cuts work to keep the moisture in for the winter\nOK you could do the same thing on the high drain just a for any of those cuts like I was saying it's definitely a benefit to help it\nUh you don't see it on every label my father's been talking about it for ... years upon years doing it and there's been a lot of success stories by doing that you know if you're doing it for your evergreens that are around it it's not going to harm me by doing it on the roses or the ...\nAll right okay thank you so much\nRight alley thank you so much for the phone call and good luck with the era hide range

I've heard different things about the stands ... not to take them out when you clean it out on\nA well so if the ends on the type of dreams that you have um [noise] one of the does it have like a really blew was it a big blossom was a small\nIt was kind of small ... has learned tremendous\nThat could just be based on the winter how winter the winter that we had really affected a lot of high drain just uh they what they had done was with that\n... that February thaw it really affected the plants and made them think it was starting to be springs and then we had nor'easter after nor Easter and that actually really hurt the plants and did some damage to it\n[noise] it seems like you might have either like a Nico blue ... uh [noise]\nExcuse me [noise] or like a a\nKid you at least leave that could be a twist and shout there's also maybe a Nantucket blew that you have which will be around one\nThose guys a lot of them they will bloom on old would what that means is last year stems so that's why a lot of the blues you don't want to cut the stems back\nNot especially at this point in time what you want to kind of do is wait in the spring you're going to notice is going to be sticks you know like All right I can deal with the sticks were a little bit then it's going to take some time and all of a sudden it could be like All right why isn't everything growing ... ... what do I do\nYou really want to wait till you see where the growth is coming from the growth will start to pop up and re fill some of those sticks once you really see about half the plane coming through you'll be able to get rid of some of it's just that the sticks that are there because those aren't going to produce any leaves or flowers this year\nSo the double ruining is done usually the best time to ... any of the hydro ranges right after flowers so if you're looking to do you know to really shape and kind of back some\nYou would do it right after flowers in the summer okay for you know or depending upon the color\nIt could be later if it's white the other thing that you would take a look at is maybe I'll see if it's a some of the endless summer high drain just some of the and the summer I during this will actually growing old and new would wear so you could cut them back in the spring and still get blossoms\nMay be hard to tell what I'm you know which varieties you have what maybe suggest doing is that takes a couple of pictures of the leaves and the stems and bringing them into a local garden center and just seeing if they might know\nOr which ones they are to help you determine where when and where you can ...\nUm that would be the easiest way to figure it out but it's the yes if\nIf there are blooms on it right now you know leftover blooms you can cut those off you don't want to leave the blooms the blossoms on them during the winter because it's just gonna way that the plant down\nIn was a you know if you get heavy snow or anything along those lines it could end up doing damage to the plant so you could cut those back at this point\nUh if you're worried about the root system and and the lower base of the plant which you can do around Thanksgiving\nIs up put salt marsh hey around the base of it about twelve inches up twelve inches around the base just to really help protect that during the winter\n[laughter] any of the exposed a branches that you've cut the flowers off of you can spray some of the will stop on top of that to really help with the anti ... to help with the wind by using this anti ...\nSays a couple of things you can do to help benefits you going forward or for next year hoping that the winter isn't the same as we had this past year here\n[laughter] very good okay that's some good advice center I look at too much with the thing is I just had to wait and see a um how they respond to\nYes definitely I think that it has something to do with the weather what you can do in the spring is a fertilize it with a ten ten ten an all purpose fertilizer usually on a ten ten ten you can do it about every um [noise]\nSix weeks so you'll be able to do it three or four times during the season you could also start off early like him you know beginning of April\nYou could use a super phosphate so the heavy metal number of times it'll be like zero eight teams zero zero forty four zero\nThey use that as like a balloon booster it helps the root system develop more blooms but you need to do it earlier in the spring so it has time during the season to relocate through the plant and get those blossom so that could help you in the spring as well and continuing on with the ten ten ten during the growing season [noise]\nVery good I appreciate your advice thank you [noise] ... thank you for the phone call and good luck [noise]\nThe phone

back to the phone lines are Nathan who's up next to\nPaul in Cape Cod Paul welcome to the ballpark garden club how can we help you\nHey how're you doing I'm I'm gonna have a question about elephant ears and if I can or how do I win\nOkay you can winter rise elephant ear you can bring them in a usually a with the elephant year you want to um [noise] the frost to hit them just a little bit do that work for you where it starts to um\n[noise] you know die back a little bit and that's when you would start to dig it dig the plant up um you want to you\nWhen you dig it up you want to get a bunch of the root\nSystem as possible so that so that\nWhen you when you over winter it it's not just the ball that self again ... you want to make sure that uh you're getting a bunch of it with\nThe soil so the best way to do it cut the stems wants to ... to about six inches okay that you're going to send you going to take the the the plant that the tumor itself and uh take it out of the ground\nAllow it to dry out a little bit and what I mean dry out is let some of that soil fall off so that you're bringing it back down to the tube or not you know not a\nPot like type plant does that makes sense yeah okay so then\nYou're going to want to once it's dried out and all the soils gone out you're going to want to actually wet it um you know get it wet and by and put it into a box of um or or just something that you can cover with peat moss and soil that type usually peat moss because peat moss will keep the water in longer\nI'm into the ground into the sees me into the box\nBut you don't want the water you don't want it to like stay wet you want it just to be damp at first a to stick in there you want to check it every couple of weeks and see if any of the roots of rotted or if and if there's any rot in there that type of things\nBut you want the ... the ball the tumor itself to actually have a dorm and see a period\nOr the dorm and see periods usually a couple of months I'm you know two to two to three months so we're talking all of November December January ... you're probably gonna wanna keep the dorm and a little bit longer obviously 'cause in January even on the Cape we're still cold and have some uh\nUh frozen ground yeah but you do want to add water here in there to that container that you've stored in because you want the roots to absorb the water but it's just not as often as you would if it were in the ground or in a container outside so that's why I Would say suggest maybe every two weeks taking a look at it\nIf you find rot in there on some of the roots get rid of that route area that is rotted\nOr because it's just going to the rock could grow up to the rest of the plant that's why you want to keep it damp\nBut not too moist or being too wet could really affect it but you could definitely bring it in a I'm I'm not sure where you're on the Cape if you've had frost yet or a heavy for us it's really gotten those leaves cut back\nOr or gotten them back but you in the future a week or two you're probably going to have something that'll hits ya\nYeah no they still look pretty pretty healthy so\nYes it waiting till Mother Nature does her way of uh of pruning if you will be okay but by that over ... that's the best way to do it\nOkay so I'm just straight Pete Pete myself a in a box\nYeah peat moss would be fine ah because peat moss ... will retain water a little bit more for it will allow you to go those longer periods of time like that two week period\n[laughter] okay but it's it's going to retain the water and such a way that's not going to be just water sitting there she don't want to you know put holes or something along those in the in the soil you don't want to just just soil so you can take like a spray bottle and missed the soil\nOr so that it can absorb into that and stay that way like I said you're going to ... you want to check it every couple of weeks if it nice if you need to check it every four weeks that's fine too it's just if you're concerned that you overly you put too much water and that's why I Would check every two weeks\nOkay and where should that go like in the basement\nIt can go in the basement or I'm into like a garage that's going to stay the temperatures you want him to really be in between the forties and fifties\nSo basement might be the best way you don't want them to have to warm a of a temperature you know sixties seventies and you don't want them to get frozen as a frozen cut effect them for a long term\nOkay All right All right great thank you very much no problem\nGood luck with those in uh hopefully you have those bumps for years to come back you think's\nThe phone number here is eight five five six six zero four to six one again eight five five six

I'm trying to I was wondering here does it have powdery mildew okay so potted rose I'm Sorry I'm so the pot it rose the best way to do it as maybe keep it underneath like a porch or keep it up against the side of a house\nWhere it's going to get some sort of protection\nAnd then for the winter cover around it with either mulch or salt marsh hay\nAnd usually do that around Thanksgiving with that but those are what the covering a mulch or or salt marsh hey that way you're not inviting you know a rodents or insects that type of thing to live into that area and if you ...\nNo I understand okay so if you take the pot and put it up against the house or underneath a I'm a porch and then put the the salt marsh hanging around it\nSo that it protects the pot and keeps the temperature\nConsistent so instead of the the pot being above ground at the root systems above the ground so when the ground free when outside is freezing the roots are going to freeze 'em", "show_name": "Ed Lambert in the Morning", "year": "2018", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "21"}
