twenty twenty four\nIncluding probably Kmart now the future Kmart is tricky anyway because Sears went down is came are going to follow\nYou know then you're going to have a ghost town over there but

in a sense of wire and tax fraud charges this investigation\nWas politically motivated by my opponents\nUsed a PowerPoint presentation to try and pick apart the indictment federal prosecutors said Korea the youngest mayor ever elected in Fall River defrauded investors in his ... to pay for his political campaign and a lavish lifestyle\nAnd you heard Korea I mean there ... down in Fall River he said it's politically motivated he\nSaid I'm going to fight it and he said what about innocent until proven guilty and the more and more he talks and there was a really rally yesterday afternoon about it the more and more they uh they talked about a ... ... you know says again and again and again\nI ain't going anywhere I Will continue to everyday show you how hard of a war how hard working your mayor the mayor of the city of Fall River is and I will not resign [noise]\nThey had another rally was maybe three dozen people showed up at another rally booming I'm In telling them you know step down resign I Will not resign he said I'm going to be going on and on and on I'm going to fight this it's all about fake news it's politically motivated and it goes on and on and not\nA he said that he said they came out with a PowerPoint trying to address all the concerns from the feds I'm not sure he did but this is what he said\nSix days after I was informed that we need to fix it no one whole nine months before I knew of an investigation I engaged in a formal letter within a ... do you fix all concerns\n[noise] um and I once again I mean those are those are the charges that are these are federal charge that eight or nine different counts and um\nThey said he persuaded the people over a course of four years a company he founded to invest in the company they need to front of them a of a you know three hundred and sixty three hundred and Seventy thousand dollars he took\nA two thirds of that and just put a tour of his own lifestyle and his running for mayor and so it's cetera et cetera is twenty four years old and he was elected mayor of the city of Fall River\nUm [noise] ... is a a um [noise]\nCape Verde in a from a by the uh uh his heritage Korea and um\nAnyway persuaded the people to vote for him they got it and now he's twenty six years old and he's under federal indictment he's out on a ten thousand dollar bond I Believe it's been great it's not that much\nBut it's

River\nTold him to get outta here to resign William what's good for Fall River is to get you out a year while this indictment is going on in Korea said no I'm not going anywhere so the town council last night we are going to vote on it and they put it off for a week\nThey kicked the can down the road until next Tuesday night when they have another town council meeting them to decide what they're going to do with the guy\nRight so that's the bottom line\nOf a of what's happening in in the city of a river he said none of this was a a ... none of this uh was is true the investigation was politically motivated it happened before I was mayor I fixed the problems I address the concerns\nAnd there was an an accounting stuff and not IRS or anything like that so we'll see what

heading up right towards the United states now they've got to go through what if they're under and they got to go through Guatemala\nTo get up here and\nUh they've had a couple of incidents over the last couple of days trying to stop them or the vice president is talking about is the president is talking about it\nAnd the president of the United states said basically we've informed Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador if they lower their citizens are this Journey Through the airport is up to the United states with the intention venturing our country illegally\nI Will stop all payments to them now stop now now that got the attention of Guatemala and Honduras\n[noise] I think we give Honduras as far as quote aid or close to two hundred million dollars a year like a hundred and eighty million two hundred million dollars a year and that goes to the country\nWhere it goes after we give it to the country I've no idea\nBut you you would suggest you would think that possibly whether you're talking about Honduras or Guatemala El Salvador needing that do to help them but you'd say that for some of it probably goes to Greece somebody's bombs all over the place down there but anyways the president said either you\nKnock it off in Guatemala\nTalking about the president and then vice president Mike Pence said the same thing he spoke to the Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales you said you've got to keep your people in your country and take care of him and help 'em out getting a job whatever it might be we give you a hell of a lot of money\nNo more aid at all unless you can stop this talking about the president of the countries down there\n\nNow there's a lot there's a lot of international politics going on because uh you know whatever Honduras might be a and looking at us in in in summing it snows a little bit saying hey we'll get China to help us\nYou know we let may Beijing wants some recognition and the Central American countries because of the alignment with Taiwan he goes on and on it's all Mets messed up type of stuff but it's very simple as far as the United states' concern but let me just say this\nWhen you're talking about Guatemala and when you're talking about Honduras El Salvador not many people from bellies really want to come up here but the borders right there in Mexico\nAnd in order to get here in the United states remember the trains that went through Mexico remember the coyote windfall that happened not too many years ago well if you've had three thousand people right and then we did we stopped him just recently to are they going to go through all the way through Mexico to get here\nAt some point in time someone's going to say to Mexico\nNo trains in Mexico stop them in Mexico like they did last time some of them stayed there but some still came to the to our border they got a hell of a long way to go before they get to the U.
