going on congratulations you guys have a good time five oh wait seven seven five nine nine eight five are toll free phone number is one a day day WICK Ninety five one\nMy prediction by the way mad tonight with the red Sox and Yankees game after the terrible terrible showing picturing a showing on Saturday with the red Sox losing to the Yankees yes terrible but predictable yeah predictable my prediction tonight is it's going to be two to one after the game okay\nIn that it's got to be Yankee Stadium is going to be a two to one to the one who are just going to be to to want if I if I say it's gonna be Yankees I'd put all my money on the Yankees as okay now that's that's a good way to hedge it right but it does somebody will be doing one after the fact that is correct [laughter] hopefully\nBut I don't I think the red Sox gave us a heck of a regular season I everybody cheering I don't think they've got to get through the division ...\nMiserable and it's been miserable all season they've been able to hit their way out of their issues all season long an egg until October and maybe you don't get the hitting one night and you can go see what you got on Saturday\nSo this is a problem and it's going to be a problem as they continue on where you saw David Price getting pulled some man in his early in the game with a second I think it was the second inning so ... and his confidence has gone you can use the rest of the postseason it's over for him\nWhen he making about eight hundred million dollars contract or something like\nA he was a thirty million a year pitcher so I don't know how I think they're still three or four years left on the deal learned to opt into it but it's it's complicated it's a lot of money for nothing in in the post\nA lot of money and how can you know what is the owner of bothers me everybody is you've got these pictures pitchers they they're making you know tons of do\nAnd all of a sudden their confidence goes now you're talking about get up there and throw the bleep and ball All right that's all you got to do well ... I'm Sorry my kind of pulled after I don't know how many hits on many home runs into any and my confidence was screw your confidence get out there buck up and play ball\nYeah we can't the calendar flipped through October and he turns into a puddle so it's just amazing how predictable at was the really was you know what a shame yeah so you have a Nathan have all these and I who you are acquired during the season he used to pitch for the Yankees\nSo I don't know what to expect from that and we'll see what happens at this point I have I've absolutely no expectations for the pitching if they don't allow five or six runs in these next few games here I Would consider that a uh when\nI have a feeling the Yankees are going to take the first to the right there in Yankee Stadium well then it's over that and it's over it's a it's a three to one in a ...\nIt's the only theory in which the home team didn't win both a home game yeah so the Yankees right now actually have the advantage the next to being there and of course you know if they win the two it's it you don't come back to Fenway so you have to hope for at least this way just to survive over their Yankee's won display here they got it\nThey got it after we dumped it\nSo frustrating another frustrating seeing another season where you should have gone farther than you will by\nThat I said that I mean when are they gonna when are they going to crash when when does their uh their season they're unbelievable season of wins and losses and under the name one hundred and eight wins which is amazing and here they come down to the the last uh the five games that they just need three out of five to get to get further on and they can't even do the\nPost season ... they can do in October\nA well good luck to him tonight I don't think I think the Yankees going to end up taking it that's all there is to it\nWell I'm willing to a wait and see what happens I guess but I don't have a lot of confidence to say the least well I put my money on the Yankees yeah no question well they have to hit their added in Red Sox have to hit their way through the divisional series here apparently so\nNow will say well that's going on that's tonight by the way the third game is tonight around what seven fifty seven thirty seven forty seven ...\nOr ... games on a Cape Cod sports radio Ninety six three a little earlier than that about seven hours earlier they can do that too is probably ways all day every game for if I wouldn't be at all surprised yeah after the Bruins game\nFive oh wait seven seven five oh by the way I just want to a man can you keep track of a tropical storm Michael forests please they got to\nA tropical storm Michael's can turn into a hurricane everybody it's down passing through cause a male right now and ... ... has got a warning out that it looks like it's going to this a tropical storm right now or is going to have at least coastal flooding it may be more\nAlong the west coast of Florida you know for all the people to go down to the Naples or south enables all the way up to Anna Maria island\nAh once again tropical storm Michael could turn into the hurricane they're going to get regardless of just it just stays at fifty or Seventy miles an hour they're still going to get an awful lot of coastal flooding all the way up ... possibly into Tampa Bay also so you're going all the way up the coast or pass Sarasota\nInto Tampa saint bay I mean Tampa saint Pete into Tampa Bay so the west coast of Florida is going to get hit with something I don't know what an how's that going to screw up red tide and all of the they've had so many problems down in Florida an awful lot of our friends out there the head down to Florida I mean on the west coast now it's red tides over on the east coast\nIt's a a double whammy for Florida I got to tell you right now I'm we don't own a home down in Florida and I don't think I'd want to at this stage of the game I think if you went down to a any word down in Florida right now and then you get a hell of a deal on a house\n[noise] specially it's near the water\n... yuck but anyway tropical storm Michael coming through so I keep an eyeball on it or will we
