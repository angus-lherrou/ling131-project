H. P. financial and our retirement road map podcast you can you can subscribe to it\nAnd you're listening to all of our past shows current and past\nAh for you know maybe if someone I Know it sounds bad if someone's that sounds like desperate right given that someone has to listen to us maritime hopefully we provided a few good I guess here and there [laughter] so anyways key for that being said what was your number one takeaway on today's show\nAs part of our process and our retirement planning a program here we focus on the back end of it which is legacy planning and I know attorney McManus touched quite a bit on it earlier\nHow important it is to work with someone understands you know your state and what you've created who's dealing with a couple this past\nWeek they came into our office they had just created in state plan and they had been where there were they were working with another advisor and they took their state plan C advisor in the visor one didn't know you know what the estate planning was how was executed or how to execute it and then to how to fund that a state plan so it's so important to work with\nPeople that are knowledgeable in all facets of retirement and not just investments reply keys how about yourself and just to say on that same theme of diversification you know we talk about tax diversification planning diversification kind of want to keep talking about and then also or investment diversification you know in the air this align when I read from a report that we had recently\nDiversifying globally implies an investor's portfolio may not be the best performing relative to anyone markets but it also means means it may not be the worst performing\nIn other words when you have a diversified portfolio it it doesn't you know it's not the best performing in a bowl was not the worst performing an affair and that is extremely important as you enter retirement and that's where we see all the time or at the first meeting with our clients I let them know hey\nWe think it's okay to reduce your outside a little bit meaning maybe in a really good year you're only going to make twenty percent and not thirty percent\nBut in the trade off maybe in a really bad you're you're only going to lose ten percent instead of thirty percent or whatever the numbers are so we feel like it's for folks that come to us\nYou know we're going to mix different um portfolios and different instruments you know both marketing non market to try to get our clients the best overall risk adjusted return but most of what we're dealing with is trying to take on a little bit less volatility as you get closer to retirement in in more poorly in retirement\nAnd my final take away is the story of Stephen Liz [noise]\nAnd I know they came into her office in a while back and their clients but when they first came in\nThinking about that he was four weeks from retiring in retiring for the you know he did not want to go back to work trust me and his wife list did not want him to ever have to go back to work they want it to be able to enjoy retirement\nThey advise for twenty something years and there are retiring and for weeks and there was NO PLAN in place they were just if that's the only plan was yeah we'll send you money when you need it there was no written out plan\nAnd they were at the point where they had said one point five million and they had enough as long as they didn't take a big ...\nAnd so I think it might be Warren Buffett I'm not sure who I heard this call from but I Love it and that's it's crazy\nTo risk of what you have in order to obtain or you don't you think about that I I this is what I tell a lot of people coming to our office as of late 'cause that's what people are doing they're risking money to try to get from one million to two million or two million to three million but don't even need to get to that level to ... to have a comfortable retirement so it's an it's crazy to risk what you have\nIn order to get where you don't need so with Stephen Liz they came in we built them a obviously a plan that gave them a cash flow that they needed to cover their goals and dreams which for them was to get her motor home\nAnd travel you know travel around the country and different parts of the world during retirement and then have enough to cover the bills that was their main dream\nAnd so if you haven't taken care of your dream planning or an overall plan or you're not sure if you're retiring and the next three to five years and you have there's NO PLAN in place from where you're incomes going to come from one of the tax Irma's occasions as there is an estate plan\nAll these things that have to be thought about retirement he could vantage of what we've done this or we rebuild our from around

Y. segment if you will\nYeah and you know if you think about that two hundred and Seventy five thousand I think you said the average person will spend on those healthcare costs\nEven if you are in a more reasonable nursing homes here and it's ten thousand dollars a month and I'm only picking that up because it's easy math for me to you know what they're using them as high as sixteen grand a month here in Massachusetts so\nAt a hundred and twenty thousand plus per year how quickly are your assets going to be wiped out if you and your spouse or go into a nursing home or you or your spouse we had we do certainly do have clients were both positive have ended up in the air and it's it's it's not on site but it can happen\nBut I don't have to be the same time it could be one and then another Clinton leaving and I got a plan for\nBoth and you know what a lot of people don't do their planning in advance and maybe we can just kind of remind folks Todd that what we mean when we talk about doing advanced planning which is what's outlined in this guide in terms of timelines\nShore well if you're going to do your advanced planning it's still the five year rule and it's good to bring that up occasionally because I'm Still getting people out there who will tell me oh I heard it's going to be seven I I heard it's going to be ten yeah\nYou know I haven't heard that lately folks I Know there was a bill many years ago where they propose that I'm pretty sure it's dead in committee and I'm not trying to scare people but five years are still five years mhm and and I would hurry I Would get my ball rolling\nAnd what we're talking about putting in these trust when we talk about funding the trial is I mean your your primary residence as a no brainer but there are assets that can't be protected right in the ...\nThat's true and so what you're not going to put in these trust would be things like IRAs four oh one case\nAny kind of a retirement account that requires minimum distributions to come out or that is not taxed yet ... and the reason is you can't put them in because if you reach in to pull them out\nYou have an income taxable event ... so you're not going to take five hundred thousand dollars out of your Ira and put it in a trust and give the government forty percent right you just won't do it so that's money you live on first\nAnd that but you spend down for us because that money is going to be continued to be at risk and expensive\nTo live on it that's why it's there that's why you saved it put the other assets in the real estate the vacation home the rental property your taxable investment accounts put those in the trust and and I think that's important and and um are these the kinds of things that we were talking about right not just how to crawl around\nHis stuff is in the guy but I don't really find you know how to fund the trust what type of assets go in there what type of acids don't go in there you know there is there's a whole there's a couple of pages about\nProblematic trust provision so for folks who are out there that already have a trust this is a good sanity check for them to say wait a minute I have this paragraph or I have this paragraph you don't want to find out when you're going into the nursing home that you have a troublesome trust\nRight so look at the different kinds of paragraphs that are in there and and you know what we can talk about funding and that's certainly important I think the lay person who might not have a trust or who might have trust on already might not understand what to look for in the document I think this these paragraphs will help you\nThey'll they'll they'll stand out when yeah getting through yours and folks if you haven't done your document planning yet right\nIf you if you read this you'll see what to look for in the document draft that the attorney\nGives ... it's a great guideline it's a great starting point to educate yourself on how these trust operate on a day to day basis all of these wary wary causes that are included in a lot of trust that just don't hold up\nTodd does this for a living day in and day out he is your subject matter expert folks and he has

back on the legal exchange with Todd let ski\nTime now for Wall Street we can review a look back at the markets performance last week here's Susan Powers and Michael Armstrong\nLikely just entered the last quarter of the year and investments often associate the month of October with poor stock market returns how are things looking for this year\nYeah you know you write October's oftentimes singled out for poor performance and that mainly has to do with some of the particularly severe stock market crashes we've seen in the past\nYou know it's negative sentiment reflects the historic crash the Nineteen twenty nine eighty seven and then of course most recently in October of two thousand eight when the Dow collapsed the full Eighteen percent in a week\nWhich by the way was the single worst weaken doubt history going all the way back in Ninety One you know in addition the ads and volatile October months back in Seventy eight Seventy nine in Nineteen eighty nine all of which adds this negative October sentiment\nSo I'm sure some of this is coincidence is there anything different about twenty teen though\nYou know there is I mainly that we're in a midterm election year and that changes a lot you know if you look back to Nineteen fifty they're Seventeen different mid term election years and you'll find that the Dow averaged a three point one percent gain in those specific mid term October months\nIn fact of the Seventeen election years twelve of them ended with a positive stock market return you're taking this a bit further mid term elections seemed to be a positive indicator for the stock market over the next three quarters the nine months stretch from October before a midterm election and then June after the election is produced average returns of twenty point four percent of the doubt\nAnd Twenty one point one percent for the S. and P. five hundred and that goes straight back to Nineteen forty nine so we all know the past performance can be used for future results but I Would pump the brakes if you associate October with only negative market returns produce history does tell us otherwise\nThanks make those if you have questions about the markets the economy or your portfolio please visit us that Armstrong advisory group dot com\nYou've been listening to Wall Street we can review with Michael Armstrong no back to the legal exchange with ... and Susan ... hours\nListening to the legal exchange and it's done for us when we're done we'll answer your questions about anything and everything that included in the big blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan followers\nBack to I'd have a few questions from listeners for you first question comes from David in Framingham mass in David writes my father has been in a in a nursing home in on Medicaid for the past year and I've been maintaining his home by paying the taxes utilities and maintenance\nFor swimming houses and his name\nAnd dad's name I guess us pay ya I don't want to do anything to jeopardize his Medicaid eligibility but I cannot afford to keep doing this and the house is worth around five hundred thousand what am I an option [noise]\nWow [noise] that's a that's a nice size house I'm well here you go folks let's let's explain let's delve into this a question a little deeper\nA first of all you know the the first thing that comes to my mind is you know how did that get eligible for Medicaid when he has a house right\nRemember folks on past shows we have spoken about how a home is a non accountable last as long as is located in mass and you're single and check the box that I intend to return home\nAnd it's under eight hundred and fifty roughly eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars of assets of value mhm he's there so folks that's a message to all of us to how he's on Medicaid even though he has this home\nSo for all of you who have not done planning a that is at least a way of still getting on Medicaid so I I\nI get that he's also absolutely right that have as a single person\n[noise] somebody's got to pay the maintenance and upkeep of that house right keep the heat on well that's the kids ... kids I I don't know what your financial options are but let me give you a little motivate motivate motivation here and that would be\nIf she passes away\nAnd you get the house you can have a five hundred thousand dollar home with no mortgage right and with a step up and basis so you could actually sell this for five hundred thousand dollars in have zero\nZero capital gains tax and zero estate tax mhm federal and state so it is a big win right even if I had to get a mortgage now or a home equity line of credit just to pay a little bit so sometimes you need to understand that I could take out a he lock on my own home get a tax deduction\nAnd use this money in and sit in a in a bucket just to make these you know what does it cost to maintain that house ten grand a year I don't know\nBetween taxes depending on where it is yeah taxes and keep the tail and he's on and so that's probably high so so that's one option that's when I was your mortgage out on his own home so that he can pay\nYeah the ... the only other option and that's the one I'm leaning towards the only other option here folks would be to sell the house which you absolutely can do and if you sell the house or you could you could take the money or probably get there might be attacked from ... number one\nCause if you sell it and dad gets a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar capital gains exclusion there might be more than two hundred and fifty thousand of gain built into the house right so you might have a capital gains tax liability don't know how to run those numbers\nSaid even at that though Todd now dad's got a big bucket calf\nShe's going to be booted off Medicaid unless you can either buy on Medicaid annuity your throat into a pool trust mhm so not a great option right outlawing keep it how else could you keep it\nYou could rent it okay so if you rent it out now you'll have the money you need\nTo pay the bills because while that will be rental income for dad yeah income is treated differently than an asset so renting it is not going to cause him to come off Medicaid\nAnd let's say you rent it you get to use the rent dad gets to use the rent to pay all the bills and only the\nExcess rent would end up going to the nursing home\nAnd you don't care because that somebody else's money right and now the child the child's ability to borrow or pay for this property is gone mhm it will be maintained especially with no debt you know it will be maintained by the rent mhm you would definitely be able to generate enough rent\nTo maintain the property with excess rent going to the nursing home to pay a bill\nAnd that will help to reduce the amount of the leaned it's been placed on that home 'cause it's he's qualify for Medicaid so that\nWell help you in the end as well so good point Susan what Susan's talking about there is that even though this house for a single person is non accountable\nIs ... ... so that means whatever amount of money the state is paying\nOn behalf of dad in this case\nIs a lean on the house and so if we have Social Security of two thousand going to the nursing home and now we can pick up a thousand a month extra on the rent yeah the net rent mhm now there's three thousand dollars a month going so the amount the state is paying drops from four to three\nRight and so the lean is less I say four to three because for pay on Medicaid is about six mhm so that's a great 'cause that's where I mean when I Would do or here or rent it David so rent that out down like a way to guys\nFolks if you would like to not have to worry about this last minute ... that you have to do with your assets you know you're planning in advance\nTodd has written a guide for all of you it's designing an income on your income only ... trust and it is the type of trust you need if you want to protect those assets from those long term care expenses\nGet your free copy right now by calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine or visit our website legal exchange show dot com or you can download your free copy\nTaught our last question comes from Brian in ... with math and Brian writes my father died in a nursing home and twenty Seventeen while receiving medicate\nAnd the state contacted me with a bill for his nursing home care can they make me pay the bill he gave me is home seven years before he went into a nursing home and only held the life a state other than that he didn't own anything the bill was around sixty five thousand do I need to pay this\nWhat they're saying is well two things one since you have the power to a point to a charity which is really the big deal here\nThat somehow you whether you move into the charity a charitable nursing home or not and remember lots of nursing homes could be charities mhm in Massachusetts so they're saying\nWhether you actually have moved into the nursing home that is a charity or not you could\nEnd because you could therefore you could be in a nursing home that is a charitable nursing home and then appoint the principle of the trust through your power of appointment to the charity nursing home that you're in\nAnd then that nursing home would somehow use that money to pay your nursing home bill\nAnd therefore now there's a circumstance that allows the principal to come out of the trust and benefit the don't or violating the any circumstances tests saying that the assets are now available\nTo the tone or from the trust therefore all the assets and the trust her accountable\nSeems logical [noise] no no no it does not does not [laughter] and and interestingly enough\nOne of these decisions said yeah yeah we like that and in fact we're going to deny the Medicaid application on that ground and say that you are now denied Medicaid the essence of the trust accountable go away\n[noise] so we're going to have to do something about that but nevertheless again not my case but one that that came about mhm\n[noise] five days later another fair hearing officer exactly the opposite result and as you might imagine I think it's the other a fair hearing officer being correct and I'm going to explain that to you and why the difference in a minute\nAnd you know what folks you need to make sure that your trust is drafted properly in order to have it work\nHow do you know how to properly you don't you are a layperson but fortunately for you\nTo odds are expert here he went to law school and he's put his knowledge in writing for you he has drafted a brand new guy that really outlines all of the important language that your eerie vocal trust must have as well as an maybe more importantly the problematic\nTrust provisions you want to make sure that your trust is not ab he's also included quite a lot of information about\nHow these trust operate on a day to day basis as well call right now for your free copy of Todd's designing an income only ... trust guide\nEight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine or visit our website legal exchange show dot com download your guy download our podcast and submit your questions\nFor Todd [noise] so why is the difference again I'm going to try and keep it as non technical as I can well a couple of things one\nArgument really is understanding the definition of a limited power of appointment mhm K which is what this is you are limited don't or to the ability to a point to a charity but\nThe definition itself is that a power of appointment is not a property interest so you don't own any thing\nNumber one and the definition says that you cannot exercise to power\nIn any way in which you would benefit directly from the exercise of the power mhm so even if they were to say you're going to put it on some kind of a condition we're going to condition this distribution to the charity only if the charity uses it to pay for my care\nWell then you could not exercise that power to that charity right because it would benefit you and that would be a violation of the definition itself\nWhich is technically fraudulent right and in violation of your own power you breach in your own duty\nI thought there was a big case that came down with this earlier this year and that kind of put this issue to rest wasn't there something that\nThere was a Supreme Court case that addressed it as a possibility to look at applying the any circumstances test it didn't rule on it it said maybe mass health should consider this as an option\nDidn't rule on it just seems to me these they're hearing officers operating a cone of silence that themselves they tore something around things right and you know there's more that can be done here right so in this case you also have the very definition the essence the Internal Revenue code that says\nWhat is a five oh one C. three charity\nThese or how you get the dust shirt on your income tax return if you give it to a charity well when you read the definition of\nCharity under five oh one C. three which is an Internal Revenue code section it says that you are absolutely not allowed to give to a charity\nIf you do give to a charity the essence of a charity

Coley was\nUm stimulated to flower by a certain number of hours of daylight and sure enough I looked it up and I was correct\nThat uh what stimulates this into flowering Karen\nIs to have at least six weeks of long nights okay so normally if if you're going to a normal thing you would have them in a room in a sunny window butter room where the lights are not on at night\nAnd the natural shortening of the days particularly if there's not a street light out there shining and the window\nWill have them start to come into bloom in early spring now if you want to hurry them along and start them into bloom earlier in the winter time\nMake sure that they are like your poinsettias that you might be trying to bring back into flour make sure that they are getting for teen our night starting now All right so bring them in a\n... put a box over the top of it or put them in a closet at four o'clock in the afternoon and then bring that\nOut of the closet at eight o'clock in the morning so that they have a really nice long Dark Knight\nAnd that can you know they need about six weeks of that and after you give them six weeks of those fourteen hour nights\nThen start to fertilize as well and put them in a brighter location\nAnd start to fertilize them and you might even need a if you if you're trying to hurry up this cycle you might even put a grow light on them for you know a few hours or at the end of the day one ... you take them through that fourteen hours of\nDarkness so you can either do it naturally as I say in a room that doesn't have artificial light or you can play with it a little bit give them at least six weeks a fourteen hour nights and then you know\nBring the sign on bring the sunshine out All right let's go to the phones and talk to sue who's calling from ... good morning sue\nMorning um I just have a quick question last spring I planted\nUpper spruce and they're probably\nAlmost two feet high\nProblem is there in a very exposed place and I wonder if there's anything I should do before the winter\nNo you should not well the only thing that you should do before winter is if it's a hasn't rained in a week or as long as you're able to you know get some water on them and then you know put a bucket or two of water on them a once a week if it hasn't rained\nSo that you know and I you know right now of course the ground is pretty well saturated because we had some good rain falls recently right\nSo you know from now on just kind of look if next week it doesn't rain at all you know what a bucket of water on them um or or you know run the hosts on them for a while if your house is still on so that they go into the winter as hydrated as possible but frankly these are not plants that are\nAre hugely prone to wind\nDamage okay that's what I yeah yeah what they're more prone to believe it or not is might damage spruce spider bites or the number one you know attack or a dwarf Alberta spruce so and sprayed with\nNot not routinely but what you do want to do is just keep your eyes on them they don't get screwed spider mites in the winter so you don't have to think about it over the winter but next season keep your eyes on them and if\nIf they start to look like they're either yellow wing or ... or you know just don't have have places on them that are not looking very healthy then you might have a spider my problem so okay so what should I use that as\nYou couldn't you couldn't use something might decide that you can get it a garden center bona fide makes an organic when um [noise] and uh I and horticulture\nOr butterfly garden stopping at SARS and tell them what plants you can't live without because right now they are planning on what unique plans they are going to grow for you next year\nOpen at ten Twenty one sandwich road in Selma yeah I

eight\nUntil tend to be precise five zero eight seven seven five nine nine eight five let's talk to Bob who's calling from Nantucket morning Bob\nGood morning feel what's happening so\nMany of those were good this year and then at least for me they were they were actually\nGood good but uh but ashore grew up in determinant evade oh yep and like my question is I have a lot of green tomatoes yeah I'm just wondering if I had\nYou know I'm caught them back a little bit ... a month ago or with those guys would I have a similar I bring on a\n[noise] well you might you might have a little bit in that if the plant is I'm no longer putting attention into its growth and more flowers than the existing tomatoes would probably get a ripe for a little faster and I'm a little larger you so you might have\nA little bit but would you too I'm a huge extent I don't know that's hard to say\nBecause it only so much of it depends upon the temperature air air temperature you know and as well as sunshine the the number of sunny days and if you think about it we had a fair number of a gray kinda drizzly days in September\nAnd\nThat I think delays the ripening more than anything else so\nI just it just seemed to many green than are never going to go anywhere [noise] yeah well pick\nThe largest ones and put them in a tiny window sill because they will ripened a little bit\nAnd you you know and if you're and if you're the uh uh chutney or or pickle relish person you can chop them up and make pickle relish her chutney out of them\nRight what about the apple [noise] what about them what will show I've written for Apple close by and uh\nYeah I Know that that's it that's because fruit gives off ethylene gas\nBut the problem you know with that and that does work with some things in terms of development ethylene gas they\nThey tend to develop faster but if you think about it a tomato is a fruit so it's also giving off ethylene gas so you don't need to do it with tomatoes that you know it's more sunshine ... the light will help with it All right\nAll right well I'm going to try it next year if you're on\nSo yeah if you if you still have their budgets and you know what I Try it on some of the plants and not on a couple of the others and so that you can compare right\nAbsolutely that it'd be it'd be fun to have additional data so I look forward to do you're letting me know okay\nLike all you want here no matter what\nExcellent I like [laughter] take care of Bob how's it going to have a great fault by by I like people who call me once a year no matter\nWhat let's talk to know who's calling from ... good morning no\nHigh there I feel I Am well how are you\nA question about Life Love by uh-huh it's on my yeah it is a big plant your super heavy now live in\nA while and I definitely want it in\nBut when I just don't know how it how far is that if yeah I Know what I'm like\nYeah what what kind of a container is it in well\nYou know what actually built getting myself it sounds crazy I mean all the only thing that big enough I thought okay well it ... that structure itself and you tell us on the bad\nYeah I think you might have to dig it up and put it in a smaller container okay yeah which I let you can do you know people um [noise]\nUm [noise] I remember ... what were dot and Charles his last name dot and Charles where I'm master gardeners\nThat I knew about Twenty years ago who specialized in they just loved passion flowers\nAnd they grow them in their basement in hanging baskets right and so with a with a ordinary hanging basket they would have the divine growing out of and trailing down and all so um you could of what you'll want to do is is cut it back and I would probably do it fairly soon\nAnd and I would cut his back and I dig it up and put it in a pot that you can manage right\nAnd then bring it inside and and but you're going to have to keep it in a place with like these are not a plant that you can throw in the basement and forget all winter right so you're going to have to put it in a sunny window\nAnd um you know and and give it as much light as possible and it's going to you know it will suffer a little bit at first because you know you know because of the digging it up than transplanting it but uh\nJust to be sure not to fertilize right away don't start to fertilize it until you know sometime late January\nOf ... like if you could you tell me about eleven or maybe even well how can I I I\nKind of down to three or four feet tall ... exactly what I Need a good job right type shaded no you're most welcome have a wonderful weekend Bob\nWho is a on the phone from South Dennis hold on we'll get\nTo after the break but we do need to take a break because this is news radio Ninety five Wu ... [noise]\nLive in our locker green\nGreen [noise] Mm\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News I'm On over there on the Senate just hours away from a confirmation vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh ABC Stephanie Ramos on Capitol Hill where just enough senators say they are yes vote senators\nAnd invasive so there we go um [noise]\nIt's uh we do need to be aware of what we plant certainly and many of these plants that are both aggressive and invasive are no longer able to be sold here in Massachusetts like the bitter sweet and the burning Bush and the bar Barry let's\nGo back to the phones and talk to Bob who is calling from South Dennis ... morning Bob\nGood morning seal off about a year and a half ago I planted five or ... Cyprus trees in a row okay about about six feet on center at four of them are growing like crazy for doing really really good the grain and they're washing growing\nAnd one of one of them is just kind of sitting there\nAnd hardly doing anything doesn't look like it's dying mhm\nBut it's not it's not like the other guys right and they they were all the same size and we have been well and yet and thoughts on that\nUm first of all I'd asked myself what is different about that location is it getting less sunlight for example or is it getting less water I mean those are the two that would make a ... not grow would be not enough sun ... or less water\n[noise] so I Would if I were you look at you know the amount of sunlight there and whether it's shady or and if it is that's not a good spot for Leland you know um and I would also add value wait if they're all on an irrigation system for example maybe you're assuming that it's getting the same amount of water and it's not [noise]\nSo that's number one number two\nAh I think about what might be going on underground if they're all getting the same amount of water and they're all getting the same amount of sunlight then it's probably something that's happening at root level\nOf whether the soil is more compact there for example so that the roots can't get established just faster and and we always have to remember Bob with plants what goes on below the ground is reflected up above so if a plant can't easily grow\nA big root system than the top isn't going to get back [noise] so you know it's interesting\nFor four of them are are like in the political the open field yeah the one that's not doing much is right off the edge of a patio\n[noise] well lender wrong case right off the edge of a patio first of all that probably is more compact right\nBecause it was a quip meant used to you know my build the house and this and that the other thing um and I don't know it also could be if it's right off the edge of a patio first of all that's not a great place for ... do you really wanted a a\nSomething that's close to your patio that's going to get thirty feet wide and eighty feet tall\nOh probably [laughter]\nSo so maybe it's a good thing that plant is is not performing that well but um the other thing that might be influencing it frankly you might have a soil ph tests done because if it's if it's near a patio and and any sort of stone dust was\nUsed for a as a base for that patio the ph might be fairly alkaline and these plants like slightly acidic soil so oh that's another thing but if it's if it's close to a patio you don't want to we went there anyway these are huge huge plants\nI'll have to uh we really think that a little bit yeah actually we\nWe we put them in as a screen from our neighbor's house and unfortunately that that one particular point\nUh does having having something here between us and the next house is probably important so it's\nGoing to be in power yeah I mean and you should start sharing all of them fairly quickly you know taking the tips off because as I say these plants get thirty feet wide and an eighty feet tall and they do it pretty quickly\nQuickly and so if you if you if you want if if they are in a place where you need to keep them more narrow you need to start sharing them before they get to pick\nYou should start sharing them immediately by just taking off even six inches off the outside on a regular basis and maybe leave the leader for a while and and don't clip the leader until they get you know\nTen or Fifteen feet tall and then you can kind of slow it down by clipping the leader but these days are really large plants\nTo equip them all we're trying to get it like a wall there we we want them to\nSo yeah you wouldn't have would click hashed out if you want to do them hedge by all means shared them every year but as I said don't share the leader until they're starting to get to the height where you want to slow it down\nThe animal and and you can never stop these from growing completely you're never going to freeze them in their tracks but you can slow them down and once they start to get really big you might even have to share them twice a year what what's the leader\nIs that the ... leader is the very the is a good question it's it's the branch that goes straight up right in the center and that's what makes the plant kind of go up and and to its its characteristic height\nAnd every time you clip that anytime you clip any branch on these anytime you share plant you get to forming so you don't want to clip the leader too early but um but you do want to start sharing these plants pretty soon to keep them ... got\nIt got it I have about ... ... a little bit of that around them\nThat you certainly can I mean accomplice to come and nowhere is good for any plant would probably be better for ... than fertilizer would be you don't want these plans to grow any faster than they're already going to grow and grow right but I had already you're gonna\nGet there will be you know in in five to eight years you might be in trouble with these plants in terms of size but I've just sharing them a little help\nYeah okay oh a ... a Yahoo set on high drain just because I don't\nCare how you can use composting cow manure on just about any plant\nGrace yeah OK yeah sail thank you so much I appreciate your call you every weekend but not to buy\nBuy All right let's see let's talk to fill who's calling from Nantucket good morning Phil\nGood morning still I have a couple of callers on\nTom little oh cabbage is a\nCouple of years old when my mother is still alive but um I was home in teaching it just the beginning of September and I\nBought a to school or just a decorative cabbage is yeah and I planted them and mother in law and there's just so beautiful and the lively and mother and I got up ... o'clock in the morning to go out and look at them again and they were still beautiful while they were\n[laughter] at the theoretical but at a rhythm for multiple I could even get\nOh and they had themselves a nice salad huh\nYeah or maybe it was the year ... maybe not a good\nWell I Am now and then it could have been what Chuck if it's absolutely gone that's either a would check or a deer\nRight down to the absolute ...\nYeah that's a little lady yeah that's ... yeah\nBut I've had a I have had a couple of times when I left\nIn the beginning of September but to go down to Caroline in a life and\nI plan to at least two kinds of oriental bok choy and what the I'm blanking on the name of the other one that in the grocery store or the one that goes up the ... the book joy I planted them on the day\nI was leaving and came back yeah yeah there's there's always going to grow in like\nYeah yeah those are all here didn't eat um well I'm Glad\nThat's good because um those those are are really good cold hardy plants and we will frequently in September plant I'm a ... choice it's sometimes called in the garden because it is so cold tolerant that you can be harvesting it you know even into New Years\nAnd I just for the call the war broke if they're ... they're like we do [laughter] the average is likely to go pretty quickly could\nBe could be you know you just don't know what the thing about Bambi feel is that\nAt morning Seattle Thank you so much for your great show in the morning I really enjoy it can I have a question about something you just said about uranium and yeah and I'm wintering them yeah\nUm you said ticket cutting from the jury any um does that mean you don't usually well what I did last year and it it worked well but not all that great yeah it's I just bought the whole plant\nYeah and you can certainly do that All right you can bring the whole plant in and put it in a sunny window and it'll flower for awhile and it'll get bigger and with that method um the advantage of that method Beth is that\nYou can bring it in now and then some time you know in the course of the winter oftentimes people do it in January ... then you take cutting Z\nAnd then you not only can take more cutting ... at your leisure but the other advantage to that is at the same time that you're taking cutting that original plan is getting cut back\nThe the main problem with just bringing the plant in keeping it all winter and then putting it out is they tend to get pretty long and legacy right yeah\nAnd if you're that long and legacy um then you know in order to uh not have a long and like a plant you can either take cutting and start out fresh every year\nOr you can do a combination of taking those cutting and then you'll have some smaller fresh plans and at that same time your original plant gets cut back so that it stays fuller and Bush era and shorter\nOkay so I when I was thinking of doing this year because it got so lucky last year yeah was take that like when I brought it in like in a couple of weeks then cut it but I should really\nI Would wait and do it in January and the reason is when you're bringing it in its already has to adjust to lower light situation yeah and if you add the additional stress of cutting it back which means the plan is going to try and replace what his last\nBut then it's trying to replace what is lost in the darkest time of the year and then it's going to get even leaner ... because it's the darkest time of the year\nOkay okay so it's good if I don't yeah bring it in but but do try taking cutting because they're really really easy to route and this was the easiest plant to to propagate from cutting Z\nAnd then you have new fresh ones that you can then put enough fresh pot with fresh soil and it's going to be a better plan to any way for you\nOkay great health one more quick question yeah\nI have\nLived lack\nButterfly Bush and I'm broke share in that I Would like to back\nOkay that that's not a quick question because on one of these is a different plant so I'll talk about that when we come back from the break alright perfect ... and last time I flipped on hold and when we come back we'll talk about ... butterfly Bush and Rosa Sharon pruning I'm seal for an hour and this was news radio Ninety five
