that somebody confidence in their message would reach out to a critical media the way truck routinely does and the way Jeff deal routinely does Jeff deal doesn't just call it ...\nIt gives interviews to NPR Boston Globe reporters you name the progressive\nJournalist in ... he talks to them you know and what what guys like Jeff deal if they get out or Trump speak it out at is that you can't win over women voters by just waving abortion on demand in free birth control in front of the bases anymore if you want to win over a woman voter court more money in her pocket put her husband back\nTo work you know order stones back to work you know that's ... reasonable message\nAnd and that's the type of thing that's resonating with the with voters even in a blue state of Massachusetts Ronnie and when she comes out and says about raising taxes and\nYou know what we've got to do is we got back ah we got to get more right and what we're ruining the democracy\n... all of those things to say something but it doesn't mean anything and I think the voters of women voters and the voters no matter if they're Massachusetts or from Michigan or taking a hard look at what the quote messages and trying and trying to understand what it is because I don't see it\nI mean that was a reasonable respectful non group throwing interview with Jeff deal Jeff deal is not a coup thrower like these

yeah its personality but it goes to issues and it goes to be able to get things done I think just set up a couple of times when you're talking about a Tip O'Neill and you're talking about Reagan either talking about the years when we had people here that would actually work with other people\nAnd you know it's it's it's an refreshing rather than just combative and angry all the time and

they're bullies All right it's not being fair to her you know it's the same type of crap that goes on even more\nSo if it's the to me it's it's talking about the issues anything Ronnie said it I think Jeff deal Senate talk to me about the issues talked to me about what you're going to do for Massachusetts and our economy tell me what experience you're bringing to the table for other areas too\nIf you're a good senator remain a good senator and ... and and don't run for president just because somebody started a pat on the back three or four years ago about what a great socialist and progressive

Cape Cod that churches Catholic churches last week they are asked everybody to announce this on Sunday that this Thursday is national bring your Bible to school week\n\nAnd the uh the letter went out I don't know how many have you heard about it\nBut\nFirst off let me say this mad I'm going to ask you see is later today or later this morning you can reach the superintendent of schools let's say for Barnes Noble\nYou know and uh and ask the superintendent or how the schools are going to react to this quote national or a re bring your Bible to school day\nAnd ... are there any you know because I think people need to know if the schools are going to go along with\nThis or not some national bring your Bible to school day\nThe letter went out to all the churches say would you please announced the event encouraged the young people in your church to participate\n\nSo that I can identify with other Christians in their schools and provide an opportunity to share the loving hope of the gospel of Jesus Christ and I'm saying to myself whoa what how are the school's going to react to this\nLiberty chalk board said that over over half a million people are young kids did it last year and they're expecting tens of thousands more this year\n\nAnd I don't know if the kids across the Cape are going to participate in this event or not\n\nBut sincerely Diane thank you and uh God Bless you as a minister to our children of your of your congregations letter they sent out to the churches\nLiberty chalk board\nAnd I was sort of hit by this a little bit because national bring your Bible to school day October forth they say is an event sponsored by focus on the family\nFor students all over this country\nThey said hundreds of thousands of students are going to celebrate religious freedom and shared God's help with their friends by taking a similar action simple action bring your Bible to school\nI said to myself okay but number one I got to tell you I don't know how many kids have a viable number one\nI mean seriously when I was a kid growing up or you know I ...\nI I remember my mom and dad had a big Bible I don't think we you know maybe we had a little ... you know hand held Bible I I don't know\n\nI Know we had ... we had because I went to you know\nParochial schools we had a cat it gives them and brought it home that much maybe\nI did\nBut I don't know about bringing this Bible to school thing and that and I'm Wondering how the schools are set up for it number one and number two how many of your parents out there would want to have your child bring a Bible to school\n\nAnd the uh the question that they that they have on on the on the the focus on the family is that\nIt's awesome that we live in a country where we still have religious freedoms in where students have a First Amendment right to bring their Bible to school\n\nThey said but the sad fact is a lot of parents and students don't know this\n\nThey said this is a visual celebration this coming Thursday of students religious freedom rides and a reminder that they have the freedom to talk about God\n\nI didn't realize that so if you're a parent or if you're someone that in your church on Sunday or whenever you heard about this or maybe they didn't read the letter from the from the ... but I don't know\nBut I was a ... and I appreciate Diane and everybody else at liberty chalk Ford bring bring it to my attention again and they say it's a way for students to understand their rights and to know that they're not alone\nJoining thousands of other students all across the nation they're proclaiming their belief in God and religious freedom\n\nWhat's gonna happen I mean I don't know I'm ... you know Matt tried to get that super and a superintendent on but and we'll talk to him tomorrow about it but I'm sure that's a protocol in schools about oh sure you can bring your Bible to school but you can't bring it up I mean there's got to be something because can you imagine the hue and cry from the others that don't have bibles\nLet's go to ... good morning you're an ex TK how you doing Bob\nGreat at it more than my daughter is eleven years old and a lot of ... well\nIf I was going to happen overnight or or I certainly under any Bible she at three by the fact\nThat my ex your bibles was pretty cool because interact if you can get on the website and follow along and then they give you different I complete about what you read\nOn line and and your Bible and then\nA couple of years ago my daughter asked me a daddy can I have a plan\nIf I just like yours which the leather bound James version you know\nWith my name is scripted on the front cover so we went out and he got it out for Christmas Day she loves it so I Will say that we get one more thing first grade over and the army and she wanted it in her get your Bible I got an outback teacher\nThat the school isn't any place where a Bible can you please refrain from spending with it\nAlthough I wrote it but that's exactly my point Bob in and trying to find out how schools are going to deal with this so\nI wrote it I wrote a car you know back to the teacher stating that we have freedom of religion in this society and with the first amendment is not freedom from religion so that will be sending Jerry Bible\nRegard and nothing happened after the fed up and it goes because we're told\nBob that students are right you can simply burn you can choose your level of involvement shouldn't skin ... just bring their Bible to school they can read it during free time if they are your studio\nOr whatever and they said that there do problem with them talking to with other kids about what they're doing why they brought their Bible to school interest I look at a great day Craig's\nBook took it easy a there are other things in there that go against the grain I think of of today's secular a feeling\nThey said you know that if you ... you know go on line you can go to all sorts of stuff like free speech tools you can go concert the conversation cards to get free posters you can get a T shirt sticker with designs are there's several phone videos with students can watch with their friends if you want
