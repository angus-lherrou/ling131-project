quiet don't put the arm on me now to get out and\n[laughter] All right there is other six fifty nine and we're going to the end of ...\nOf northern Florida is it is a heads up there and ah maybe Louisiana get a little bit but the main surge is going to hit a\nThe whole Florida Panhandle and uh they're preparing for right now and uh the governor is is talking about it too but this is what ABC rap about the rain and flooding and it's not just the in the northern part but the the western coast is going to get hit to\nFlorida governor Rick Scott says hurricane Michael could pack winds of up to a hundred twenty miles an hour and some places could see a foot or more of rain which means Saudi and will be a major issue President Trump in Florida to address a police convention says\nWe're all prepared and hopefully it won't be as bad as if you look\nAt this looking dangerous in Florida as well as in the Carolinas where area still coping with the floods caused by Hurricane Florence last month could see up to eight more inches of rain over the weekend\nYou know they can't uh I mean if that happens is is things swings up because the hurricane is it's going north towards the uh the Gulf Coast right now of ah the panhandle of Florida it usually the tracking of from what I can understand will swing to the north east\nUh once it makes landfall and then that's going to a possibly hit the Carolinas with an awful lot of maybe not a hurricane but at least tropical storm rains coming in that they don't need right now\nBut that's a that's what's going on it's not going to it's going to affect the west coast of Florida but as I said yesterday\nAn awful lot of your head on down to the Naples in Port Charlotte and ah Venice area in Sarasota are probably going to get high winds and some are high surges but not an awful lot but the governor Rick Scott down there says this is a big boy\nMe be clear that said Michael is a monster storm and the forecast getting getting more dangerous\nYeah and he said now is that what they're doing is they're making plans um you know all along the coast of the panhandle and they're talking about sandbags the talking about what a trailer parks down there\nAre and they're trying to get the in boats little but I mean we're talking about the small boats too because you know that Irish Riviera down there a redneck Riviera as they call it in some places an awful lot of stuff could get hit\nThree days of food three days water makes sure you've got all your medications or get ready now if you think you might have to evacuate and do your evacuation plans if you think they use a shelter find out where it is\nYeah because you got to do it now if you know of anybody down there I mean we have good friends that don't that don't live up in the panhandle but then lived down in the Port Charlotte area\nAnd they're going to get in wind and rain and one of the things I don't know how this is going I Know that the the governor said that he's already is he taking the the National Guard out or is he going to do it\nUntil like the ... to twelve hundred and fifty troops for storm response because the for the national guard has more than four thousand more guard members available for deployment and activation\nOkay so he's got he's got some ready to go it's going to be a major hit and it's going to be a it's not just the tropical storm them it could be the the major hurricane going up there\nBut a good luck to every I don't know but that's what this is going to do to the red tide the red tide along the the uh western coast of Florida is horrendously bad\nAnd it's not go over to the east coast and they're talking about the possibility of billions of dollars lost with tourism homeowners are houses going up for sale because of the red tide it's awful if you've never experienced the red tide down in Florida it's not what we get up here at all\nThe red tide down there is airborne it's water I mean it's in the water dead fish and and everything going up on the shore it's awful but the ... to breathe the air anybody that's got any respiratory problems at all your goal around coughing coughing coughing because airborne and\nAnd are wearing ... even wearing masks people down there where the mask inside their houses it's so bad if you're relatively close close to the shore so maybe this will dissipate it maybe it won't but it's a it's a major problem that they're having right now\nFlorida's been getting hit role Rick Scott's been busy along with the Carolinas to\nSome as the president said when he was down there addressing the police chief saying make sure that you understand what the warnings are and be prepared for this with the president said as hurricane Michael news landfall\nWe're working with state and local officials in Florida that take all necessary precautions and we urge all residents to be prepared at to heed local officials\nWhich means I mean I don't know what you're going to do once again it's a it's getting prepared for it you can watch it on TV I mean some of the things that we are going on with the preparedness of this or you can pull it up on line or watch TV for some of the stuff but it's uh it's pretty ... this is one of those things and it's fast moving right now\nIt's not going to stall like it did in the Carolinas they don't think but fast moving also means you've got to get your ducks in a row today\nOr yesterday they said the gas lines people you know getting ... trying to get your gas filled up on your cars all of that so good luck to the people down there and for all of\nView that out there that live or vacation down there or as the president said heed the warnings and and good luck and see how it goes a friend of ours\n[noise] it was a doctor um goes down there he and his family go down there all the time\nAnd uh and and uh they love it that whole area down there ... eastern west of uh Pensacola a beautiful territory beautiful beaches and a lot of uh\nLike I said a lot of people living along the shore so be careful and then of course he got you know right next door for heaven's sakes he got the Louisiana and an although ... everything that's such a low lying areas that within type a storm surge and are coming up it's gonna it's gonna be a tough anyway\nThat's what's going on they're bracing for that quote unquote monster hurricane that couldn't uh since it's straight strengthening right now over the Gulf of Mexico heading on up and it's probably going to uh and I haven't heard the weather for the weekend up here\nBut I wouldn't be at all surprised when that thing swings over to the northeast and then heads out that we're going to get some of that\n... a counter clockwise or wind and rain probably coming up in the later in the weaker the weekend so be prepared to at least know that that that's a if if in fact that happens the way they think it is on the track then\nWe're going to get to some after effect of this over the weekend\nAnyway I'm not a meteorologist semi\nNow but I'm a for what it's worth even I don't know this is nuts\nThere are only because of the hurricane but they're saying we're supposed to get rain Thursday and friday this week so yeah that's the residual hurricanes I'm not quite the weekend but certainly the end of the ... the end of the rain right\nNow and maybe we'll have a nice weekend

going to be different than a than any other event of such magnitude and then went on to apologize to the family\nOr because of what they went through at the hands of the um Senate Judiciary committee

five WMGK\nWhat I'm Stephanie on the evacuation orders\nI he did pretty well considering it was basically three on one\nYeah oh yeah I mean I'm not surprised\nYeah I mean I felt really bad I think anybody watching that debate walked away with and this is ridiculous that it was\n... it was ... versus Haley versus the moderator it was it was a ... there were questions where I'm completely biased any ... they were asking him about offshore drilling and\n... it was like what are they talking about why are they not asking him gravel questions about what is the role of the of the attorney general it just was it was all over the place and uh so ... you know I think you should sponsored debate between banned them in Hailey\nShe wouldn't come on he's got on that he's yelling they've done the liberal debate why can't they have a conservative moderator\nWell the ... that they they got a couple of more coming up right or at least I think they do because we are to have a couple of more coming up yeah yeah\nI don't know I I got to tell you I'll I'll I'm having Jay McMahon on a more really is welcome to come on herself\nAnd we can talk about the the real questions that are going on right now rather than three to against one or three against one against J McMahon you know that's what's ... that's the problem with our state though highly I mean it's not just our state but we are the the bluest of the blue you can't get someone who's impartial up there as being the moderator\nYou can't and and ... and Jay is a is an underdog coming in because of uh because of who she is and and getting the word out of I mean she thinks herself as a legislator rather than the attorney general but it is to try to get fairness in the states sometimes you just wrecked your your brain you know how do you do it\nWell yeah and then also using the the the office as an active as a sheet of role you know she's not an attorney general she's an activist general yeah and that she spent most of your time doing the Trump Administration um because what she's got the Trump arrangements syndrome\nOf she can't believe he won and so therefore we're going to try to overturn and um\nIt's it's it's unbelievable so I I was just I felt really bad for J I didn't think it was a fair debate for him and I'm hoping that the the next couple of debates will will be even better\nOne of the things that and and this is a I don't feel bad for Jay are the reason I'm saying that is J's been around the block he knows what he's doing he's very very well prepared and he and he knows what who he's up against with the with the league and the ... and the crowd\nAll right he is going to do better in the next debate heat it's not that they didn't do good in this debate just he was caught blindsided almost with the the support that everybody was giving Healy and not being a\nA trying to be objective with Jay McMahon that's all\nWell this is another um that Democrats over a plane they hand once again okay let's have a fair debate I think people when they watch it will say oh well well it was ... versus three other out three people\nYeah I mean that but once again the voters we got to get the vote out the vote and I don't care whether you're how you're registered whatever you got to do you got to get the vote out because I think that there's going to be an awful lot of discussion of why we should get new faces in including getting rid of a are having more Healy move on you know\nIt's it's not that difficult decision to make\nSo you've heard about the New England report on ice the past week\nYes I did and and uh and you know you know what really bothers me about that is that no one else was going to be talking about the ice report that came out what really ice is all about how they have pointed the finger on the local uh you know the neighborhood sweeps they're conducting they blaming the ...\nSecond point is that you know what everybody well fortunately in the past and and what we were\nOn the other side confused cooperation but we try to avoid any shaken the armor\nAnd and we were done done taking that I'm a Lindsey Graham ah some of the other uh [noise] I'll look into

out with its first electronic device to bear this name brand which is called portal\nIt's a device portal is a way for more than two billion users of or a Facebook to chat with one another without having to fuss with cameras are controls or anything like that\nIt's a a it's a a thing portal is the thing that you open up your homes to the Internet it's got a camera sold by the company with a track record of you know private whatever it might be my phobia is this forget about portal\nWhich is the Facebook equivalent of whatever the hell it is I don't know\nI I don't want to be on camera\nI

guy the little thing\nThat could be read it could be recording you're listening to everything we're saying how do we know so we got paranoid and took that thing and it's it's by by that along with face time that along with this portal for Facebook people you get portal board all and they all of a sudden they're in your house twenty four seven you want that\nAnd face but go say promises okay Matt that they're not going to listen to or view or keep the contents of any video call saying that the uh portal camera won't use facial recognition or identify people in the video calls\nYeah right

listen to Chuck Schumer oh they want to be inclusive alright look here's the deal All right we're putting up at Christmas lights in the house around the house\nThe problems they have in this Pennsylvania town is the fact that they are they've had these Christmas lights on or a you know public property forever and the day they only light up at night crossing the star stars of stars stars across as a problem or you're not inclusive\n\nIt's been for decades the star has been up every single day they light up right after Thanksgiving right through the Christmas holidays and that's in jeopardy right now because\nOf people say no okay fine say no I'm sitting in a public ... take this take the crossing the star alright if they're in the park there's somebody lives right next door put it up on their house or up on their lawn go right ahead and for the guy to say\nThis [laughter] when I when I heard with all due respect he said everybody around here is a Christian there aren't any Jews or any Muslims you know what that's not the point\nAnd whether there are or not whether they're around here or not he said nobody around here is Jewish knowing around near as Muslim doesn't that's not the point the point is people are gonna get ticked off when you throw something quote unquote religious on public land\nThe cross realizes what it what it is it's religious but why is everybody so touchy on it is beyond me but you got to be inclusive okay so remember that the next time you come up with a Democrat when they don't want to be inclusive about anything [laughter]\nJust
