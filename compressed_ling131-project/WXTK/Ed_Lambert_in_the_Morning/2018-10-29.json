are saying probably the greatest baseball team or in a in modern time the Boston Red Sox\nAs what it sounds I celebrating your teams win close to three thousand miles away from home [noise]\nI see a Red Sox fan so we're here in LA to witness it deems fourth world series when since two thousand full on\nIt was Boston first baseman the tears taking the series MVP award after scoring three runs out of home runs in the final game\nIt was a it was amazing I uh didn't make it as well as with all of these games I didn't make it through the end is forget about a a\nA friday night and I was going to say in Fayetteville thirty now running for that one no but my brother did and I don't know how he\nHe he dragged himself through Saturday finally got some nuts and sleep time then watched it Saturday Night and that some sleep time on Sunday and then finally I watched last night but a God Bless you mad for staying up through ah some of these games are it's amazing\nTo me things really ruin your sleep cycle but I ... when the team gets this fire you really have a choice I Know of cases\nI Know but a great win last night I I thought it was a great start to the ball game of I mean there were two to one and the first inning and lights on may you know just maybe that might be the uh the and scored two ah but then the the Red Sox came back and with the home runs and the\nAnd a steep ears getting the MVP amazing ah ah you know really an amazing turnout for sort of a a a you know parents never gave up these sort of a\nA one of those guys have been around for a while never gave up and I came out the hero in the in the last night's game against the against the Dodgers\nYeah and it's really it was one of those series that ... the turning point should have been at Eighteen inning game for the Dodgers and the following night data for nothing lead against the red Sox\nAnd the red Sox came back and fought against the you know the adversity that Steve fears talks about and talking to you know giving the um I I guess the er the mindset of the Dodgers and now give me a ... point that very late inning when\nAnd it didn't end up being the case of the red Sox going back and winning that game and then yesterday us or a foregone conclusion that point I was a little surprised the fears actually got the MVP afterward David Price did I mean David Price if you want to talk about you know redemption is pretty much in essence of what it was in his career pitching in the postseason\nWell this is what Alex ... had to say about uh about Dave Price to as a leader\nIs one of the leaders in the club I was a great team may he cares about them is always paying attention to details and plan to to\nTo help them to improve uh from my daughter to cruise to name you know he's always and they are both fans ah he's looking at film of hitters Hispanic than just the one that's going on or feel is a complete player\n[noise] you know and they're talking about Dave Dave price uh he's he should have won the award for finally delivering you know more than anything else and taking a look at the series of how he did and that we fought back and how he came in last night and um and pulled what he did do six or seven innings\nSeven innings last night saying that his first start in the series game too but\nUh he was a he had faced a adversity uh different play at different times he was mocked for an awful lot of people in Boston because of not delivering and the huge contract that he made but uh came through and uh and the red Sox are now uh you know the ... by\nThe way how many they would they have won all eight plus eleven hundred Nineteen wins or in twenty Eighteen right and a including the post season and uh it's a it's one of those things I was reading something this morning about the red Sox everyone\nThat some people are saying is one of the best the best teams they've seen or in the recent history how do you feel about them\nSo I think I'd two thousand and seven still stands out for a lot of people including myself because you had that team was just act you know you had Josh back on that team that was the height of his career that was the biggest and\nIn in that that World Series wasn't competitive between them and Colorado it really was and so this one even though it was only five games the games were pretty close you only really the first two felt like a guy out of hand for the Dodgers quicker\nBy these games in LA we're all pretty close you know aside from what happens late in the final two so yeah I mean this this turns into one of those discussions on greatest scenes of all the time\nI again I still lean towards those seven but this is still a very good team and really the problems were with the bullpen which were lights out all of a sudden once the playoffs started their lights out because throughout the ... season it was their biggest weakness\nAnd at certain points could have been their biggest demise in this at this point in the world series or before up to this point so you know I credit some of the guys and that both and especially Joe Kelly I don't know what happened he just certainly figure it out mentally and all of a sudden that was it\nBecause all these guys on the team and the ... starting pitchers both and we all know that they have the talent and that stuff is just about getting it across you know mentally or they can come through and pitching big spots in big moments\nAnd the scene usually hit their way out of trouble all season so see them Wayne close games into when high leverage situations\nUh that's all it took for me this was a great team\nGreat team and a a great season and uh I Know I'm going to catch some great from my from my brother for not staying up but the that's the way it is I said hey look I got to get up at Zero Dark thirty in the and hit the uh the radio and uh\nYou're kidding me you're not going to stay and watch it I mean they're going to wind and I said well you know it'd be nice rate if they didn't win last night and they're coming back to Boston how can you said that you know that type of thing yeah well you'd\nBe amazed what you can get done on four hours of sleep in him and now I Am\nNot anymore I mean you're in your mid twenties that's [laughter] that's different okay I got a lot more Jews basically what you're saying [laughter]\nRight five oh wait seven seven five nine nine eight five are toll free phone number one eight eight eight WICK Ninety five one let me just comment on on something that we're all hunkering down for an expecting the worst and that was the nor'easter that was coming up on Saturday\nNow where we were it was and I and I don't want to downplay because there's an awful lot of wind down in wealth late they were uh uh they're experiencing went up to Seventy miles an hour out in the islands\nBut for us in the mid Cape area was sort of a bust a relative to what we're expecting another nor'easter on Saturday a sure we had some rain sure

I guess and ask\nIf you don't have any other choice that's what you do it's a last resort I admit that um but at the end of it can be an effective planning to\nHave one of the things that are then I noticed in and maybe this is what you were wanting to talk about we used to get you know I don't know ... it seemed like two or three a week from different credit cards companies saying hey you been pre approved for this card you know give us a call etcetera etcetera yeah uh what's happening there\nThe two big companies are capital one and discover and their scaling back on their credit card issue with and that\nTo me if you you know you you hear about all the economy's going to slow next year it's going to ... year after\nThese credit card company that's what they study they they they really try to anticipate what's going to happen with worker wages they would\nLook at consumer debt and capital one is saying yeah we're going to scale back we're not going to issue as many credit card we're not going to go after as many consumers because we see in anticipate that you\nKnow the economy is probably going to be start to slow down in twenty Nineteen and by twenty twenty they're looking at twenty Twenty one is a time when they're worried about you know perhaps another recession and high rates of unemployment that's what kills a credit card companies because if you say you're carrying a five thousand dollar balance and you lose your job\nIs pretty good chance you're not going to make that payment that's right that's right and that's what\nThey fall so the\nFact that these two companies\nUh you know we are ... are slowing down that that tells you as a consumer ... okay can you hear a lot of economists prognosticators to what what a thing but they don't have any skin in the game this is the company it's got their money at stake right and their stock price a steak and their job is to protect the company\nOr the end they're pulling back a little bit so I thought that

I Will be back after this news\nIs just until when\nNews breaks out we break in WICK West Germany God and I ... radio station news radio Ninety five ... gay\nHairs the latest from NBC News I'm Jim Ryan see eleven victims of the attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue remembered at a vigil last night here's ABC's ...\nAnd then you have town meeting and basically that's those two categories the executive branch your border select them and and your town meeting as the legislative branch\nSo as the executive branch my my duties are pretty well defined in the shot or and I think it's kind of funny that my opponent will mention from time to time that\nUm I Do too much or I'm a two hands on\nAnd if he took time to read the child and he would see that I'm actually responsible and not me personally but obviously the county commissioners are actually responsible for all the employees in the county and we are responsible for the direction in which the county has gone ahead\nAnd uh we do set the policies now we do have the authority\nTo hire an administrator which we have done by the way under my leadership we've probably had a jak units\nAnd he handles the day to day interaction with the ah employees but all the employees are hired in in ironically fired by the county commissioners and again\nJust the stress the fact that I Do think it's pretty clear and the charter that of the county commissioners are responsible for the direction of the county\n... do you feel that the county commissioners are and and as you said uh in the charter are are um are responsible for the direction that the uh the county goes in orange county goes and\nUh do you think there's a I'm a I'm a synergy between you and the assembly of delegates of how this is supposed to be run and whose final decision I Know it's the executive committee final decision of how it's run\nBut how does the assembly of delegates get in there and say hey hey county commissioners or we don't like which would marry patch that we don't like what Leo Leo does we don't like what what Ron does and uh and change things around a little bit how does that work\nWell it's difficult um once again I think the towns have it a little easier 'cause ... town meetings come together once a year or sometimes they'll call a special town meeting they might have to a year or we have town meeting every uh twice a month you know it's the first Wednesday and the second one's a third Wednesday of the month\nSo I'm the again the legislative bodies are duties are really spelled out in the charter and there are some suddenly delegates members that think that they uh they're the ones that are responsible for the direction of the county I get into that and and it's just I'm Sorry but it's just not true\nWhy ... why should we even care well I mean there's so many people out there now how many times have we said this earlier\nThat day you know you talk to eighty percent of the people Seventy percent of that they have no clue who they're a assembly of delegates is because it's an appointed you know they don't know what's going on why do we care about bars what county\nI think it's an important uh facet of to\nHave down here on the Cape um again at you know this is not a county government it's a regional government it was it was put together under its own chatter and really when you read the chatter again it refers to the fact that we're supposed to help the towns\nDo things across town borders and why is that not logical and commonsense thing and I'm break it down to the simplest things when when when my town an hour which wants to buy sand unsolved\nCan you imagine how much the town of ... which would pay for an insult to have it delivered down there every winter if there was one town some guy off in up in Plymouth would have to come down here with tractor trailer just deliver it to our which isn't that smart and to have all the towns combined together\nThrough one purchasing department the county and purchased\nHundreds if not thousands of yards of sand and salt so that every single town can get a cheaper price\nThat's the most simplest basic example when you talk about what county government should be doing\nI don't I Believe the county government it was really put together to once again service the town's indirectly it helps the taxpayers\nBut that's where I Would put there and the towns need to use the county more they need to be aware of the services that currently provides\nAnd there's hundreds of them well Fifteen or twenty decent\nOnes I Know some say maybe too many five all eight seven seven five nine nine eight five are toll free phone number is one eight eight eight WICK Ninety five one All right so we got that this is what the county does this is what the uh uh commissioners do this is what the assembly of delegates do this with jak units does on a day to day basis\nI Will receive different things they belong to the county you're funded by\nThree ah basically there are three sources of funding one is the registry of deeds every time you go in and you register a deed whether you're buying selling a house or even when you're houses getting foreclosed on so in a bad real estate market there ah deeds being registered\nThe county gets a portion of that excise tax paid at the registry of beads\nWe also assess the town's directly and in your tax bill\nThere is included in that county tax the so it's not specific on your tax bill you can't see it but if you pay a thousand dollars\nIn the cell phone Brian together but admitted and a half

Ga is agricultural\nA a land that has been given tax breaks if if it's held in agricultural use yesterday\nOkay um it's a it's a really long question well first of all thank you for your question and thank you for being involved in in agriculture as far as affordable housing goes you know I I personally believe that we created the ah affordability of homes here on the Cape ourselves through our local zoning\nMost towns went from you know five thousand square foot zoning lots to uh some of them to wake her and for anyone to perceive that you're going to be able to build a house on a two acre lot that's affordable for someone to a live here on the Cape work here on the Cape is uh is pretty far fetched\nAnd capping those landfills we cannot build a house on them because they have a a a membrane if you will the caps the old trash\nHowever we did discover that we can put solar rays on them and I think that particular situation is an excellent used for solar arrays the other thing I just want to say about solar I think it's a market that is changing so rapidly and we have to keep up with it because I'm a big advocate for\nA not roof panels but actually roof in itself the actual roofing apiece itself\nA becoming a solar collectible that'll that'll happen it'll ... and the roads to you're going to watch us have parking lots that are going to have some kind of a of a Web being

able to weigh in on a lot of ideas and then we bring them forward for for a board vote in the board is supported a lot of stuff and I'm\nThe county government there's nothing really wrong with the structure of it uh it was basically the the people in the seats and right now we are moving forward we again have excellent well working relationship with my fellow commissioners and all the staff and I'm proud to say that\nI think what's happened in county government Leo and and under the directions of the county commissioners us German and others is more much more transparency and understanding what's going on with county government whereas before we couldn't get that information\nAbsolutely not even the assembly of delegates wasn't even getting the the information you know we had a unbelievable situation would bond issues of where we had authorizations for bonding and the staff wasn't going off on every time somebody would ask that couldn't even get any information and that's

I made a running for you know just representing a party or myself\nUm I have to represent a hundred and Seventy thousand people and I think um that I've I've done that I've tried to be fair tried to work across the aisle to be effective to have influence on issues that are important to this region and I that's you know [noise]\nYou know it it's simply a matter of respecting people and be careful how you say things because I've always had this once you burn a bridge it's hard to build it back and I know it's difficult\nIn politics 'cause you know people are very um [noise] you know a very tense about it but you have to be mindful because it is I've had people that were my enemies I mean where I enemies on one issue that end up being my allies on another that's what happens when you've been around as long as I have\nWhat are the issues are that would say you aside from a a other state senators are Democrats or you know the that you said you have to in some cases you have to find a certain level of consensus\nWhat if you find that there is no level where you can find consensus a dental work for you\nKnow that that's ... ... yeah happens all the time it's on the ... you don't find Ken's it's being able to work to it and how you do it\nSo at the end of the day you're going to you may disagree on an issue um but you know you have to when you disagree you have to do it in a way that you know it's almost like we agree to disagree and you share your you know what you believe and why you believe it or you know I'd\nBe being a small business owner I have a very different perspective than those people who are you know who have you know see government is the answer to everything and I as a as a small business owner I Am about entrepreneurial is mom about allowing people individual liberties and rights to be able to do or what they want to do and not have government control it and so\nUm you know there are times you just going to disagree but you can do it in a way that in my in my mind as you can you can share your opinion and\nHave a respectful conversation I see where you're coming from but this is how I feel and that's what I've tried to do is you know it's\nA it's not I'm right and you are wrong it's using that way this is how I think and that's and there's plenty of times that I don't just say that I disagree with the uh the Democratic legislature but I Do it in a way that you know from my perspective has been to share my opinion and then\nKnow I I I Swear to God I was talking to Jim whale and he feels the same way that that you do and that's why I said I'd never make a good politician because I'd stand there and say what the hell are you talking about I don't know what you thought you know that type of thing\nWell you know we we all have different we have different gifts different things that we do um you know Tim and I have a lot of the same personality you know he he he and I had the privilege of going or this or this past year to Kentucky where we were a part of a a a a\nCity council of state governments vent and it was really called toll fellows program and I got to know him really well known him for years you know for years but I got to really know him well there and we do have the same philosophy about trying to be effective up on because you know\n[noise] what about the polarization that we see more and more never mind just here on in the uh\nLocally but the polarization that we see on the state level or the polarization that we see on the on the federal level of coming out I mean a lot of people have different than a lot of different ideas and some are very very strong and their beliefs and feelings\nAt some point in time where do we go over the edge\nWell this is what you're seeing happening now and I ... and I think I don't think you see it as much here I mean you look at\nThe governor who's a Republican in the ... most predominantly democratic state in the nation\nAnd yet he's been able to get things done and he's you don't see that polarization I you know this democratic legislature has allowed the governor to really lead and ... you know make a difference and things are going well here and I I think he's you know he understands that they have to work with him and he has to work with them\nYou know it's one of those things that are all a share of Cummings or a a share of Hodgkin's or anybody else wanted to do is to be able to access the daddy database to find out who this guy is or who this person is that's all you know as they are being held in the in the county complex\nYou know and I I I Know sheriff Cummings personally I Know sharp McDonald personally these people love immigrants does it mean to you know they love me I think [laughter] but I'm just saying they appreciate what immigrants are but they also understand it's about law and order it's about people following the laws\nUm and that's really the concern here and so um you know my experience you know Jim Jim uses that judiciously and he uses it for the public safety and protection of this beautiful area that\nWe live in and that's what I don't get on the other side or we'll get a we don't have the money to do it we're not\nYou know we're not tasked to do this although it's a federal law\nOr where ISIS and homeland security\nAh it's not fair that the list or they're not going to report to criminals because they're afraid all the BS it's out there about reporting criminals because they're afraid if you're here legally and you see something going wrong you're not going to\nSay well I Can't I'm not going to say anything because they're going to come after me you're here legally what's ... what's the big deal you know and they don't get\nYeah people want to come to America why because we have law and order because we have a set of rules that operate that allows for opportunities ... you know we have a as a system in place to protect people and that's why they want to be here and and certainly I Want to encourage that but I I you know I I don't want to encourage Laos is\nWe're talking of any team and said oh he's running for state Senate reelection the state Senate We're going to take a break
