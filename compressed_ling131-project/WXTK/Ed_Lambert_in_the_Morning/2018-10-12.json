C. stuff that's been happening for I don't know how many years and a half and then when they get into the college end of it I think the government needs to start thinking about killing some of these public funds that are going into some of these colleges are not behaving themselves um maybe the the the cities that\nAre introducing a property taxes and some of these colleges that are running for freebies and uh and and I think they've we've only got to get a handle on it because these are the kids that are going to be running the country down again I'm looking at the long view\nI think that a number one in in looking at a higher education college level property taxes\nUm I think that yes All right I think that if you're a public school you should be ah for every ... across the board you should be paying property taxes as a college\nNumber to a political correctness I think is is it's too late by the time you get to college but yeah I agree with you that what is going on in the in the elementary middle and high schools is in in the formative years especially\nIs way off the deep end and I I I cringe when I hear about your six year old there first grader or going off the deep end because of merry Christmas versus happy holidays what a shame that ah that teacher whomever that teacher might have been is is getting that into the kids' minds rather than saying\nWell no you guys say merry Christmas at home that's terrific merry Christmas a Regina in our whatever her name might be right Haley wondering what a terrible thing yeah and it happens all the time to\nYeah it is absolutely um you know and one of my daughters actually taught public school and she just couldn't take it anymore she and she she got out of it and she's working at a private school now\nYou know I don't think I heard a lot of how I Am a I mean just Halloween alone I mean I Know I Am so sorry\nNot forget it's certainly not like it is when we grew up I can I can assure you that but you know what it's our job really to get this thing back back on track and we've got the right president and the you know so I'm really I I couldn't be more happy\nGood enough thanks for the call by the August break amid Lambert what's going on in the newsroom or Doug what's\nFun live entertainment food and always stirs shocking rural part of the deep end you will is taking place this weekend in willfully details on that story and more coming up I'm Doug Bernie news radio Ninety five ...\nThis audio is for your review and not for broadcast Internet posting or distribution to other ... copy of the air quality origin on his property by aren't menial Washington DC\nTalked about hills introducing new Medicaid claims in Virginia and helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more in line to go family care dot com that's family care dot com ... three three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from up to my health\nYou know on one paid for by the coalition peace will\nTake command of your digital world winter can commandos show Sunday afternoons and one one news radio Ninety five ...\nOn the phone on a\n... right back to the phones to Centerville hey pat how you doing this morning\nWell I Am really concerned okay very I'm very concerned about the transmission power cable that they want to build a quaint little beach area I think it's been very little discussion in the town of Barnes Noble about this\nAnd it has a lot of impact not only in Nantucket Sound in our beautiful beaches but it's going to go to a densely populated neighborhoods there's talk of power station in Hyannis in another substation somewhere else in West orange football it's all very Lucy go see\nIt has not been thought out there's a lot of concern about radiation\nComing out of this cable this has never been done in the United states\nFor well when will he well he was like whoa wait a guinea pig no we're not pat\nNo we're not the guinea pig their cable lines coming in and a lot of different areas the cable line because they're\nComing from industrial turbine out in the ocean\nThere's there's now now OK okay the the line coming in and remind the radiation coming in ... beach is a lot better than coming in and Louis Bayard that's number one right number two the John Burns was already made a deal\nSomething you don't hear every day in the oval office\nHe might not have expected to have a crazy mother Kanye West the\nPresident's reaction I'll tell you what that was pretty impressive [noise] [noise]\nI'm In one CNN commentator said the Kanye West is a good example of negroes who can't read 'em\n\nAnd and uh Tucker Carlson I Believe it was Tucker or last night was saying that how can you say the N word like that and get away with it uh and I'm scratching my head a little bit because maybe I'm behind times but negro was not the N. word everybody talks about\n\nAnd I know that that I'm a ...
