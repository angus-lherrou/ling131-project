to ... facility next door that you can get on to medicate right we're going to last minute plan and even if you've done no advanced planning to save assets for the healthy spouse as I explained yeah\nWhat about that three hundred thousand dollars that's sitting in that continuing care retirement community that initial deposit to get in that's really your money and is it going to cause you are in eligibility for Medicaid purposes\nOr the answer would be no really rising way but it's no or the ...\nAs long as the community spouses living in that unit\nThat money is not available to come out you can't take that money out of there the facility won't let you let you well you're living there it only comes out when you leave the first\nOr you leave and you're not coming back right then you could get the amount back less ten percent there's some requirement that they pay for things and stuff so\nThen that money would be brief freed up so as long as a community sponsors living there I

paragraph I Want to talk about looks like it's from the results of a fair hearing just from February twenty teens and it's entitled the right to potential future income what is that about [noise]\nOh yeah this this is a very this is a very complicated one or to talk about and it it really deals with I like to put you on the spot that it was just it's not that we can explain that it's just that it becomes a very complicated one for for radio\nOr it deals with a paragraph that talks about you know paying out money to like for a trustee who is serving as trustee oh a on there and and if you're going to continue to serve as trusting where if you're a now unable to serve as trustee mhm right\nShould they be able to project forward\nThe ability say well look your life expectancy is ex even though you can serve here's the amount of money that you could have earned\nGoing forward you can't do that okay you can't\nProject forward and there's statutory regulations that prevent you from projecting forward you know just say look it's now an impossibility to serve as trustee because you are in the nursing home you created the trust and you're not competent anymore so it's just an impossibility and therefore you can't project forward\nThey try to project backwards but while you were serving they could say what would you have received yeah and this amount would be considered council but so what if it turns out to be a small amount of money at the end of the day anyway mhm\nDon't worry so much about the fact that maybe you did serve as trustee so you figure out what the amount is and you you would pay it out in a small\nAnd a lot of clients out there Todd they're concerned that their kids are going to be put out if they're serving as trustee there kids actually can be compensated as because they are serving as trustee correct\nOh yes absolutely so that's what we normally do we have the kid service trust and they are entitled to get compensation folks don't get jump up and down about this one either I can tell you that most\nOf them don't take it no right why would they take it number one it's just money that's coming out of one pocket going into another pocket they usually don't take it\nAnd real quickly before we stopped Todd for the for the show there's information in here about an issue with having clauses about the right to pay the donor as estate taxes and kind of final costs and here so in Asia\nThat other than the right one right so you know I I don't want any paragraph in a trust that deals with the ability to pay debts ... of the donor or like there's one that this this one said oh we could pay all the debts of your last illness and\nAh you know funeral costs in a state of Minnesota ration costs while\nThe court came back and said and this particular case\nWell debts of your last illness you're alive that could be a nursing home cost right right and so if a nursing home costs as a debt that we're allowed to use principle to pay that debt than to me I see that clear connection of\nMoney in the trust principal and the trust being used to pay a nursing home 'cause that could be my last illness mhm which is in a nursing home right so we don't want powers and the trust that allow the payment of debts of the ... hour\nPeriod and then our trust we actually as I said earlier we prohibit the trust from lending money\nTo the donor or absolutely not allowed\nYou know what folks taught is included sixteen of these problematic clauses that should not be included in your trust\nHow are you supposed to know what should and should not be there refer to ... guy he is our subject matter expert this is a comprehensive guy that shows you what must in what must not be included in that area vocal trust so that when the state

for any [noise]\nGood morning and welcome to spectrum in the segment of the program we're going to be talking about the chat um\nMusic club now some of you may say isn't the same as a general corral no it's not\nIt's a completely different organization and I am just learning about them and so I thought maybe today folks we could learn together as we talk with Barbara Read who's the president and Carol Maloof who's the program chairman would the Jetta music club welcome nice to have you here thank you for having\nUs now this is a special year for you folks twentieth anniversary [noise]\nYes that's right Twenty years ago well tell us a little bit about that how did the club get formed and what was the thing that\nActually I'm Ruth McHenry train in Murray Williams enmity kick or three presidents of Chatham got together and decided they would love to have a club that had just classical music they were all perform as\nMany as a singer and both Murray and Bruce her keyboard people and so they sent out a letter to about maybe\nTwenty people the very beginning of April in Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd on the eleventh of April seven o'clock in the evening a Sunday we had our first get together where people signed up that we're going to be interested in belonging to the club club is mainly\nAbout having meetings monthly pretty much monthly in members' homes and the format is to come say hello a little bit of networking what's news around town what what's going to be performance so foot by members and then maybe three segments of performance\nEach about ten to Fifteen minutes long and then food and talking [laughter]\nAnd those first meetings um people signed up to have them and their homes and we started in September of Nineteen Ninety nine this monthly meetings how many folks are him quote no now we have one hundred and twenty two when you really are all singers no no\nWe have um we have thirty eight so low performing members\nAnd that does or singers or we have a wonderful cellist we have several pianists wherever Leon kenner wonderful float and then we have about forty two corals and this and when I say forty to some of us who sings solos also see\nA curious Barbara how did you become involved\nOh years ago actually I was recovering from breast cancer\nAnd I needed to sing again being someone who sings for my not for my living but for the joy of it and having been trained so I came to the chatter music club because I heard about it and thought I needed to feed my soul again and be a part of\nMusic musical endeavors so it was a marvelous things quite a long time ago so I haven't been in the club for the full twenty but those Fifteen Years have been marvelous so I enjoyed it every minute of it and became more and more involved and music\nIs very viewing proved\nIt totally I I Can't tell you the kind of late just kind of feeling I had\nHim being back to it I mean I've always song but it was coming back to it after a very difficult time in my life and then people like Carol in so many of the music club members who are just amazingly supportive of one another and joining this club is for all\nWe have listeners we have performers but there is no fear and you're performing because we are not\nCritical of one another there isn't a lot of ego\nIt's totally supportive so you can go into a meeting and you can have a piece that you're not a hundred percent sure you can do well and you can perform that peace and people will say this was great\nThis was the way you could do this right now we can just help one another so the support is marvelous and our goal in the music club is to perpetuate classical music through performance\nAnd through education and training and scholarship program so we want to keep classical music alive in the community and that's one of the reasons we do a freefall concert someone at the concert that we just performed\nA it was free to the public and it's just so important that people of all socioeconomic area can come and hear classical music\nWe come into weekly ... was the last Sunday but ah do you have other countries of the type of people can go to\nAnd we can we have meetings and in fact in our November eleventh meeting there'll be a keyboard performance it's not open to the public but if you want to become a member then it's your valuable to come but we do have another public concert in may on the nineteenth and it will be called la vida ...\n[laughter] oh French music and a ... or ... will be challenging for anybody who doesn't speak French well it'll be wonderful of\nCourse we have notes and we have some will be an English and those are two when you have French composers the music sign an English of wants to throw also I think another thing too important about the Columbus did not all professional musicians [laughter]\nWe have amateurs as well and we're happy to have them perform and have the opportunity to get up the whole meeting for about Fifteen minutes\nAnd singer play whatever it is it gives them an opportunity to express themselves with classical music into a group or a non non judgmental happy very supportive of one of our members play\nThe ukulele and she's performing this fall and he he's just this delightful individual any place in classical music and but it's just marvelous to see him come out now and beginning to perform whereas before he was in\nThe background of very good very good I play the guitar but I'd stay on the back of a whole new uh now I'm interested to know why did you decide the drunk should be classical\nWell we are not part of the triumvirate started [laughter] I just think it's because they had to focus our classical music and also there are all kinds of organizations for the ... and several others who do populist things I thought that was their main interest and there wasn't such an organization and we're very unique\nSo um and plus you know you\nGo to the symphony and we all have gray hair or non gray hair because of a bottle\nBut when you go to the library or [laughter] or or there is no hair but you go to the symphony\nAnd it's a sea of gray and we want young people to come and actually so does the symphony and they are working very hard and Joe Maher she was working very hard with the corral and so many other organizations to bring young people into it which is why are scholarship program is there\nAnd over the years we've given thirty three thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars in this past Twenty years\nWhich is maybe a bit modest compared to some organizations but for us it's very exciting and we have encouraged these young musicians and then they can become a member\nOf our organization at no charge and in fact these young members are performing with us now so they'd and going off to college have experience and have comments and in fact we're recording this next concert\nWill have a YouTube site for the chatter music club and our next concert in may will also be a featured on a huge are YouTube site so we'll link that to our website and if I can give you our website is certainly a gym it's WWW dot\nLast concert that we had to make people kept coming up to us and saying we had no idea there's so much talent\nIn this area of the small towns with this much talent you know why haven't we known before about you and it's just a gradual process of making people aware that there's this so many people have gifts to share\nThat's why I'm the fall free concert is so important to us to open the doors to people who are normally our ticket prices are twenty five dollars which is not a lot you know for a classical things can\nAnd but to have the door open free come in and hear something it's it's very interesting the people who come there and we we\nDo want to acknowledge our gratitude to the chat and cultural council who gave us a grant for the fall concert this year and has done seek out some some ... some ah contributions from grants and the area so that we can do these kinds of things to be able to afford to\nPut on a free concert because of course we're a five oh one C. three nonprofit and we just bring it in and it goes right out but we are all volunteers though we do not pay ourselves for anything this is strictly for the love of\nMusic knowing our dues are only twenty five dollars extra or day for a couple so we're not exactly flush [laughter] it's just it's just to bring people we're not we're not about making money we're giving money and giving ... let's talk about the\nVolunteers you can use volunteers I'm sure most any done with all the various things I'm looking at your schedule and she's all kinds of things going on\nYou really do and we do we seek the volunteers really through membership so when people join us again many of those people are listeners so they do things like help with receptions and you know pass out the programs are sure take tickets things like that\nAnd we have a wonderful man and our group who we actually want to shout out to ... I'm Marty labor who's\nBeen ill for a while and he's been our treasure and our website update her and she is an example of his wife\nLoved in these the club and labor and she passed away and he promised her\nHe would be with us until he ... really the heart and he would he would volunteer and do that and\nHe has just been so wonderful to do that for us and that's what people in the club do so the volunteers or just the people who are members who are non performers do all these kinds of things for us to adjudicate ... you know um or like set up a a a place for us to have scholarship auditions and other things so\nThat's something that probably folks I don't know if you've got this earlier in the program ladies and gentlemen but you do not have to be musical to join the shot music correct\nYou have to be someone who enjoys music I Would say particularly classical but folks if you're thinking this morning you'd like to be associated with an outstanding musical group\nThe Jetta music club would be the the club to look into a niche Chatham music club dot org\nThat's right just to see yet sat 'em up music\nClub out or you know we talk briefly above the scholarships let's get into that a little more deeply um because you're probably heading toward the time of the year before too long when you're going to be advertising for people who need a scholarship ... tell us about the program and how people can apply\nThe program started back in two thousand and one that's when the first scholarship was given and back then it was just a small some and they win or happen today a cellist Lisa pendergast and uh she has gone on and really we start advertising in January for this\nAnd match into who is just marvelous for of our club he and ...

ah\nThe theme today is really been not getting the guard and ready for winter and starting to get stuff inside a so [noise]\nBut yeah I answer in any other type of questions you need to uh lawns a garden that type of thing go right back into the lines are Nathan who's up next cheery and Massachusetts Jerry welcome to the ... garden clubs how can we help you\nHear so thank you very much for being here um I have two questions one is about Rosa\nSharon [noise] they have come up with a vertical parents want and I noticed that the data centers that is loaded with she has and I'm Wondering if I'm playing those sees they would come true to the average for ...\nUm [noise] and my second question is if I was struck dreams are truly I'm going to bloom farming issues even though you have a bad winter [noise]\nStarted so we can start with the first question in regards the roses Sharon I'm so [noise]\nThe scenes that are coming out of them they don't always come up true to the plant it's not it it's it's\nIt's a little bit harder than that um you know they you might have a a few that do come out of it but you have to go through that door messy period for those seeds you have to get the seeds out clean them\nOr get them get them into the dormant period or take them inside put them in a a you know soak them in water maybe for a couple of days of the jobs or um some water\nThan what you need to do is get a damn paper towel and put the seeds in between them\nGet a couple and then from there put them actually into the refrigerator they need a dormant period um maybe like a month or so maybe a couple of months\nTo really get I'm going for you are from there you could actually start seat in the ... in like a basement or in an area where you get from a rural light that type of thing [noise] um you can do that\nBut as I said you know a lot of these seeds are modified and I'm not modified but in a in a laboratory they make sure that they're crossed in such a way\nTo get those colors for you you're not guaranteed to get all the same that came up by ... it's a it's a pretty good shot that you could get some ah so hopefully you know you can try it that way\nWhat do you think the percentage would be of being cruel to their parents [noise]\nUh I Would have to look up high in some of my books to see like a percentage of it um I don't want to give you wrong information I um you know I don't want to say fifty percent um when it could be less than that and I almost think or do you like\nOne in ten clan\nMaybe maybe too intense or you know one in five which would be the same um it possibly um second one is right to\nWork my effort to do that because when you think about it if you're going to go through all this and then the plant actually is going to be small and then you have to wait a couple of years grit to bloom you're going to go through a lot just to just buy them you know\nYeah no I mean you definitely could um but you know it's one of those things to try to\nTry to see how it works see if it does go forward 'cause you know eventually or you could do it with some other plants or there's no like mistaken gardening really just trying to see what you can do a ... it's not going to take up a lot of um time and effort\nOn it a lot of you know when they're sitting in the water you forget about 'em for a couple of days when they go in the refrigerator or you put them in like a Ziploc bag put them in the side you leave him there for a couple of months and it's like forgetting about 'em as well so\nYou know it's up to you and really how you want to do but I I couldn't put a a percentage on it without really dive in deep into some of the books that I have um I don't want to give the wrong percentage I'm no false hope if you will um but there is a shot for it to happen um if you if you follow a few steps it really could\nYeah I have found in the past that when I have a good cook in a regular road Sharon and I take from the during and plant them in different places they turn out to be white there's a high frequency of wind up [noise] also gotten up I drank a very light and you know what I mean\nIt's almost it's it's almost like that white you know if that ... to it but it's it's it's still got a little bit of that white to it\nYeah well okay well and for a year like I might do it just just to find out what happens you know\nYeah I mean it can't hurt it's\nNot you know you already have the seeds I already have all the the the stuff it's you know just might as well try it\nYeah I'm hoping that it will stay vertical to these these have been bred to be much more vertical then yep spreading out why so that is a characteristic I Would like you know\nYeah I mean I Would try to take as many sees as possible um because there are there are going to be times where you know the seat not all the seeds are going to make it through that door messy periods and the more seeds you have the better or for that and you know try it from there\nBut what about just putting them in a pot and hide you know you put\nI'm In a pot and you put them in the ground in the hot and then I'll put a label on them and just leave him out there over the winter and then ... springs the crowd I mean they they don't like we've around me out to the point and you know\nWell so what what you could do is I'd still do that I'm cleaning them out dipping them in water and letting them sit and water for a few days\nYeah I don't want to make them work if you put them in water you gonna get fungus on them or they might sprout\nWell so the water law will get in there they might sprout and that's why you would want to do it in the house but if you're going to be doing it outside or you know you can just put the seeds and you know it's it's worth a shot at you have you on that and say you have a fifty fifty shot if it lives or if it dies\nUm so I can give you that percentage on it um\nBut I you know if you're if you're trying to really get an established by doing that you could do it inside or outside really up to you on how you want to do it uh but it is it is worth a shot in my opinion\nOkay how about the blue struck I'm a high dreams are\nSo the blue struck I Dream job you shouldn't have blooms every year but it really just depends on the winter\nThis past winter that we had really do some damage to tons of different ...\n\nLittle comfort when

gap in the middle I'm On I'm filming too that it seems like a gap because it's so tall that\nIt hung over what can I Do\nSo um [noise] now the the the it is an individual plants in the middle that are like that or is it just part of the main plant\nThe whole name plant the whole plant and in the center it it's like it it's flattened out yeah and also should I wait till spring to take any action um take part of it out\nSo you know the the ... it's it's usually a doing some printing now but the major pruning is done in um like July a job why are they so that\nIs kind of could you do it yes but you might not have as great of a um [noise]\nThe end result by doing some of that now I'm back you know it's [noise]\nWhen they so what I Would try to do is ... once everything has turned brown or the you know once it's really died back you can cut the plant back to about six to twelve inches from the ground okay well that might be a way to get that center backed\nOff for you but what I Want you to do to add to it is maybe get some ah some pine needles or maybe some a salt marsh hey\n[laughter] and put that on top of the the ... talked daisy don't do it right now I Want the ground to freeze I Want it to be it's going to be closer to like Thanksgiving\nThat's when usually I usually with air quotes 'cause you never know when New England yes I'm usually that's when the grounds frozen\n'em and you can really start to do it or send us um and my father said this and it's it's something to really think about if you start to put something like that down now the other environment that are in the air the rodents those types of things that are trying to find somewhere to over winter are going to just go\nInto that little area that you've created for them it's kind of like a a hotel for the most got food water shelter they don't have to go anywhere so that's why the reasons why you want to wait until the ground freezes okay that being said\nI wouldn't go to a local garden center now and get some either salt marsh hay or you can even use straw\nBut straw has some weed seeds in it so it's not always the best to be put him in the garden I'm okay right but get it now and have it for later because around Thanksgiving there's a lot of things that other than salt march ... that are are are thought of at a local garden center you know Christmas trees are starting to come out\nI got your poinsettias inside all your your your flowering inside they're not really thinking about outside\nSo am I getting that now you definitely have it for later or like I said you some pine needles um a lot of evergreen a pines at this time are starting to shed from the inside out she could use some of those just collect them and keep 'em to the side for later\nUm those are a couple of days just to give you extra um extra help\nFor that and then you know in the spring make sure you um you uncovered them\nA round early April so that is not covered when the warmer sun starts to hit and it doesn't take away from some of the green of the planet doesn't affect it [laughter] so at that point that's when it starts to get more of the green bugs that starts to get better for you know get ready for summer\nAt that point that's when you want to fertilize them I was like flower tone and going forward the real heavy ... um is is in July\nNot like heavy for him but you know your plant could have grown to about two feet tall is that point in July you really want to cut them back to about twelve inches and twelve inches wide gonna that's really going to shape them\nAnd now I'm getting you know the lounge ago wider state thicker and fuller and that's kind of what you're looking to do since that center was taken away and eventually it'll just get bigger and better um and I believe\nI Want to say it's every three to five years you should be splitting the plants as it is\nA depending upon how long your plants have been a in the ground she might want to split them a little bit that way what it does it help rejuvenate them as well and you can start giving them out to your son like you you did previously or friends and neighbors that type of thing\nI think great but it's usually it's usually about three to five years you should be ... um [noise] splitting them or to allow them to get bigger each year\nGreat great thank you very much tactic thank you very much\nGayle thank you for

that I got a dead after nine feet of it [noise] I said enough is enough and I loved off [noise] [noise] I think the first three feet of green [noise] from that planned it wasn't doing too well with I don't think the other she was giving up that far\nAnd so um I stuck to that uh that piece that I took off into some ... soil and um it held its own for about three months there were only about four or five leaves on it and I plucked off all the ones that were good [noise]\nSo I'm getting dangerously close to the point where there'll be no leaves no photosynthesis so I'm about a week ago I noticed that um [noise] uh the rest of the remainder of the leaves are starting to yellow\nAnd I've got to leave now that I just I I dread plucking off and I'm just wondering if I could do anything for this small plants that are stuck in the pie\nSo I'd like to see you do is actually a take a look at the soil that's their\nUm grab it grab the ... the plant out of the pot and see how it's going inside there see if you're seem I'm circling roots or if it's just really loose and they're also before you do that kind of feel and and see if it's just too wet inside the plant let's see what's going on there\nSometimes the root system can start to ... a little bit and that could cause that\nUm that would be that'd be step one\nOn so you're saying pull the plant out of the soil no don't pull it out of the soil you can have it in a pot right now right yeah yeah and it's pretty moist\nSo let it dry out a little bit because when you do pull the plant out when it's wet the soil could crumble what I'd like to see you if you can is pull the plant a little bit and just see how the root system is going underneath there like on the outside edges of the soil [noise] so I don't have\nThat much time to establish the\n... well three months you you you'd be surprised sometimes on some of these okay [noise]\nUm but I ... I just getting an idea of what's in the soil how it is because if it's too wet down there you could be robbing the roots and that could be causing everything out there you want to urge you want it to dry out just a little bit in between each watering you don't want it to consistently stay wet\nUm because you know when that happens the roots just stay wet in moist with the soil around them and keep some compact in there and it's slowly could end up ... you know those are the ... to the to the main stem the more likely that the plant is going to ... D fully lose everything\nSo it's it's it's a little bit of taking a look at that the ...\nAnd there is that ah\nThat'll help somebody as low release that would work okay one the other way you could do is just grab the stem a little bit and pull up just a little bit I'm not talking to rip it out pull\nUp to see how the roots react do they hold in does it just really moved just by barely touching it is it really moves just by barely touching it then it's probably being over watered and it has some roots development issues\nWith that um you're keeping an inside you could almost use\nLike a ten ten ten an all purpose fertilizer I they have 'em in liquid form that you could really give that to the plant and give it a little bit something else the tent the middle number on there is going to help with Ruth development and I think that should help you with this\nUm it's just\nI think something else is going on I think it might be just too wet um consistently", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ed Lambert in the Morning", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "14"}
