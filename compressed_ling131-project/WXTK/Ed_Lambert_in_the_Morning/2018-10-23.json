vicious violent American\nI used to have a bad feeling about it I don't know what it is I mean I just I have a bad feeling about the Dodgers I think they're really good team I think they're playing better than they were during the regular season for sure during this postseason they've been pretty good\nAnd even though the red Sox are better than them in many areas maybe not starting pitching but just about every other area I just don't love the match up for them I don't so and you know the red Sox have won the past three World Series they made and they'd been dominant in them so\nThere's no real reason to think this way I just the feeling feeling really yeah\nWell I mean it's one of those things that came through the playoffs and and uh\nAnd killed a Texans and in and out in Texas and in sweeping the last three and this is going to be this is a two three to write write this to here in Boston than three uh in the ... left coast and then two more here in Boston it's needed\nBut this is the best out of a best out of seven and a we'll see how they do it would be wonderful if they could sweep both games here in Boston to begin with it would really be a leg up I have a feeling that they're going to be able to split here in Boston\nI Do too and you know I I'm surprised at how many people think this is going to be a five game or reliable gosh I don't think so I think it's going to be a fight no matter what even if the red Sox do when like I Hope they do I'm just saying like I I just think that this is going to be a fight I don't think this is going to be a series that ends in either direction for five game I think we're at least getting six at us\nAnd and also the weather is going to have something to do with it I'm not sure whether it's cold and I'm not sure whether the rain is going to stick around or or a blowout\nWatching the uh the weather last night and it was sort of up in the air fifty fifty whether or not it's going to be a missing or rainy or or whatever for tonight's game but that's going to make a difference when they were everybody was practicing in the cold yesterday and we'll see how that plays out because it may have something to do with ... may not\nWell in his differing style so when you go out west it's obviously going to be warmer but you don't have the d._a. ... how does it balance out\nYou know that's the case so you put your da ... you put your you put your ... or something like that that's what you do\nWell that's the ... playing second base which I hate that idea first of all because I think first you're going to lose defense there no matter what I mean ... second base as far as I Know since he was in the minor leagues\nSo to put him in the world series at second base and this isn't third base where you pretty much have one job where you're fielding and throwing in potentially covering the bag second base I mean you're you're you're involved in double flavor involved and stealing bases you're involved in a lot more I Would put them on third but that's me right well I don't think he's ever played there that's the ones they should\nLeave and how come on I mean what I mean how many baseball players do you know I write for the first is the only one where it takes a little bit different but\nSecond or third I mean come on you can do change those short less not shortstop but I'm going to exert\nIf I'm Mallory core I personally don't want to mess around with my middle in the old line I ... I think you need ... runs are going to be easy to combine all the red Sox have been making it look easy but there's going to come a point where they're going to have to either manufacturer prevent runs\nAnd if you have ... playing second base and someone steals a base because he's not a position where someone is safe at second because he wasn't in the right position for a double play\nAnd I ended up costing than a game well gee that's a great decision I think we're in a look back at that and kill them for if that's the case\nYeah yeah well we'll see what happens game on tonight I don't know why they started at nine minutes after eight o'clock eight or nine what the heck is the significance of that everybody\nWas going to be delayed regardless so I think that's where they're building in the delay but it doesn't matter it's going to be passed that eight Fifteen\nUp with James Taylor during the national anthem I don't know he's done a lot of conscious that than with maybe it isn't I mean I Know but I mean James Taylor during the national anthem\nI mean I don't know I'm ... I'm ... you know James I liked it and James Taylor great and I like to hear and sing but it's just out of the ordinary I think to have some you know a James Taylor sing the national anthem rather than someone else I don't maybe it's me\nAnd it's since he's not as relevant as they used to be as you\nKnow buddy no he's not you know but uh I don't see\nA he's not as relevant maybe ... maybe that's why he's managers and everybody else put them up their nose\nAnd we that's tonight and uh for the red Sox are mega millions coming into the get the uh uh first game tonight\nOr an awful lot going on I got best picnic coming in after nine o'clock um we got a whole bunch of things to talk about this one I just got very very quickly and I've got to talk to Liz Dunn liquor and more about this\nHave you noticed that in everybody out there maybe you don't have you noticed that that Tito\nIs the vodka of choice seems like every where under the sun\nCheetos walk why\nI mean remember it used to be grey goes and then it was a oh I don't know it goes down the line about all the different vodka now every time you turn around someone is saying Tito knows me knows you gotta G does Cheetos\nHow did that catch on like that ever added ... just a phase\nNon mall I think he does pays for a lot of their signage in their advertising so they get the word out there it's a good product but you're right it's a it's a chain it's\nJust a I got to ask was about that yeah I mean what's going on with ... ... ... I\nI think they're spending heavily in the advertising department that'd be my gut reaction to that well okay have you thought back to the red Sox you saw a lot in the Astros event or their their entire I think it was their their right field a section was that the Tito section or something like that\nSo I remember seeing it on TV too and yeah the words out there for a while and then they jacked up prices back up because of it so there you go there\nFor a while you get a deal it if you're buying a handle of Cheetos you'd get a ... you know twenty five twenty six by us right now and now it's back up to thirty or whatever it might be I don't know the gotcha coming right\nRegardless of what Elizabeth Warren thinks about our jobs\nFive oh wait sevens oh by the way I just want to throw this out there I got an email that I was looking at an early this morning when I came in at Zero Dark thirty in the email has a whole bunch of stuff on it about Elizabeth Warren and the DNA did you know that her first husband\nGuy by the name of Jim Warren\nWas involved with setting up the whole DNA testing things and that the guy she had do her DNA testing out of California was also part of that company\nAnd I said to myself wait a minute went with her ex husband her first husband was involved in setting up to twenty four and me or whatever it as an other DNA testing and that this guy that she got to do her DNA test was part of that whole situation\nI said I didn't know that did you get a check it out a little bit further I met ... time for the seven thirty news I'll be back this report is sponsored by wall greens\nAlong the way the local news\nMorning I'm well Perkins with this WICK news update an antiquated man has been sentenced to two and a half years in jail after he pled guilty to charges related to selling cocaine on the island\nThe Enquirer and mirror reports thirty six year old Martin to your radio was initially indicted by eight Nantucket County grand jury but his case was transferred to bust the superior court\nWhere he was charged with several cubs up possessing illegal drugs in three counts of distributing cocaine the gay but islands district attorney's office requested the two and a half year sentence along with three years of probation to run concurrently\nCheer radio will serve his time at the box will county correctional facility had likely be deported after serving his sentence\nIn September yard with police received information from the heart which police department that sexual assault of a child had taken place in your within two thousand Thirteen and two thousand fourteen or with police conducted an investigation with the assistance of special investigator some the Cape and islands children's ... advocacy center\nWhich led to the issuance of an arrest warrant for thirty five year old bread in Bedford of Dennis\nOctober Eighteenth you are with police patrol officers track down and the rest of Bedford at his job and south you are but he was charged and he was arraigned and possible district court on more charges of rape of a child with force in indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen and he's currently being held in custody on ten thousand dollars cash bail\nStarting a small business man keeping it going is a huge\nTraveled in Cape Cod young professionals partnering with author partnership for all to support businesses and start ups across the Cape region Lauren Barker is the executive director of the C.

authority WICK west you're much Cape Cod and I urge radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK oh\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm kind of ...\nDemands for answers from the president of turkey this morning and the death of reportage smokers should give the Saudi conflict it'd be the ... panel instant both as president or to one lead out some of the facts and the case this morning\nIt depends on the hospital where in the hospital\nOkay so did your job change when you went to the post ... up from where you were up on the floor\nUm yes and no ... at the bedside okay but I have um critical patients you know and I have less of them okay\nThen ended up um yeah so up on the floors and then that search floors at Cape Cod hospital it is a five to one ratio of five patients to one nurse regardless it's five to one\nI'm In critical care it is one to one or two to one depending on the acuity if the patient\nHow voting just changed those ratios\nLoading yes is\nWhat it does is it looks at each specialty each floor\nAnd remember although we are here right now on Cape Cod it's not just about Cape Cod hospital Cape Cod healthcare it's about every single hospital in the state of Massachusetts or that you get the same care whether you're on TALK to the hospital or out in Berkshire medical center\nBut what it does now as a medical surgical floor which you would go for say pneumonia or post op surgery\nUm it would change that you would have one nurse and take care of no more than four patients\nWho are right now which one to five with us on this would be one before\nIt would be one to four however on the second and third shift it can be anywhere from five to eight well\nIt ... it depends I mean currently currently yeah so I'm currently it changes and that can change any day according to the manager according to the staffing it there's no\nSet limit now as to anything it it has so many variables so many moving parts so in our\nIdea in this thing that is vital to patient safety and that's how this started that we saw decline invasion safety Twenty years ago and it has certainly just kept going the patience of today are sick\nYou don't get in the hospital unless you're really sick you go into the hospital for nursing care and that's what this was all about that we wanted to provide the best nursing care and we give good if you're looking just to Cape Cod hospital right now we give good care but it's on the backs of our nurses and\nIt is we can miss so many little things that can save the patient complications we have I'm not enough time to do patients discharges which is vital\nUm we have many patients I'm Ree admitted within thirty days the mandatory overtime is out of control it's one of the highest um\nHospitals that use mandatory overtime which is against the law by the way\nUm and so it would change drastically all departments the emergency room obstetrics I'm a ... everything the psych center so um it was and it's all about the patient's safety and all the studies support what we're saying\n... you said that a bill and critical care or it's one to one that's not going to try to drink no it's not going to be one zero no we're wondering after one\nNo no and actually I'm being at the hospital as long as I was the last two years um I just couldn't take the five to one ratio on the floor any further\nUm so I tried to get into the icy and multiple times because I knew that I could have more time with my patients because they had a a limit a maximum of how many patients I could care for\n'em so I was unable to get in the I see because of the hours that they were offering which was fine and it just didn't sit with my family um but the hospital had offered a training program\nIn recovering in the ... so I jumped out at even though it meant shifting my hours at that but it was what I needed to continue to be a nurse at the bedside\nSounds like you guys got a beef with the ah ... different levels of management whether they'd be nurse management for management a hospital management or whatever suddenly you got to be for me I'm ...\nI have a beef with management because they say they have conversations I'm about\n... and um the patients that are in the hospital um they have conversations but it's not what the bedside nurses they mean every day in an office amongst themselves amongst through so yes they do not in real time have conversations with the nurses at the bedside\nThis law would make it possible for the nurses to take back the control so that they would have some flexibility and I'm ability\nTo say yes my patients are safe I could take an extra patient or no I have a patient that is now not doing well and I need a less patient so it's very flexible the law is very flexible and puts the control of the patients\nBack in the hands of the nurses and out of the office in the ministry has\nRefused to have been a nurse for forty six years when did you see things changing where you have the call about how many patients you could you could handle and got out of hand it was up to Twenty years ago you're talking about Nineteen Ninety eight when all of a sudden the the us at the fan on this thing and you guys could in the air\nPretty much we started 'em up at the mess nurses association and all of us who are staff nurses who are involved in in the union\nStarted to see a change of deterioration and I can remember having a huge discussion about using the word quality versus safety because you didn't we wanted to sound the alarm but you certainly didn't want to scare people\nAs far as my personal practice\nI was fortunate enough to just almost Thirty years working the intensive care unit so I usually took no more than two patients except when I floated and when I floated out to the regular floors I could see what was going on and see what was needed\nThen when I was became chair the union at Cape Cod hospital\nYou get to hear from all the nurses all the problems going on we have unsafe staffing forms that we read and the conditions of the patience is so different I remember years ago someone saying that\nYou're going to hospitals will now become a mini intensive care units so and I would go no I don't see how that could happen\nAnd sure enough that is exactly what's happened there are multiple medication drips intervene strips that are on the regular floors that have to be closely monitored almost every single patient and that hospital is on a heart monitor that also has to be closely monitored\nUm there are there's one floor that carries I'm a respiratory ventilator to help people says that never used to happen and there are many other hospitals that have it's routine to have these meds and the ventilator is on the floor\nTwenty three thousand members of the Massachusetts nurses association although we do represent Seventy percent of the acute care hospitals is definitely no union I've been hearing that from day one\nIt is all about patient safety and being able to do our jobs to take care of patients as we all became nurses to do it has nothing to do with unions\nI'm going to take a quick break for the nine thirty news I
