that\nYou know everyone is saying look we don't we don't deny that maybe something happened to the to the doctor\nOr to the professor ... you know everybody's saying that she may she probably had at some point in our time was accosted or whatever it was a rubbed against or or whatever but the the thing about it is the total ... and what she says and what she doesn't say and by the way if you read the Mitchell Report\nI mean that that that comes up and and then you can read it on line I asked the guy yesterday late ... who came to kept coming at me and ... you know the the lives of death by a

Democrats\nBy Diane fi and all the damn Democrats used her\nAnd she's much of a victim now the process has anybody however when I hear that her lawyers right or else ticked off that the FBI has an investigated enough\nThen I say okay when when does it stop being political\nSo the president in any way last night as down in Mississippi just south of Memphis, Tennessee and he ah ah he had a

know you might not like president Donald Trump you might think that his he's too or whatever the word might be fill in the blanks for you\nBut you know when when he says things like that that we say to you know I don't believe Dianne Feinstein as far as I get thrower nor her staff they know exactly what they did with that letter\nThat wasn't supposed to get leaked anybody\nCome on\nAnd she said the ad I'm all about body language it speaks volumes check out some of the online commentaries of the body language concerning Dr Ford\nOr how about the new ex boyfriend and how she helped a friend with a polygraph well you know the ex boyfriend gee said that that's exactly what happened if that's the case then it's a ... face ally one of the many inconsistencies at the Mitchell Report have by the way\nIn Adams said we really going to be asked to believe that a person is traumatized for life because they were held down momentarily at a at a high school parties thirty six years ago\nWhatever happened to rub some dirt on and get back and play the game and um this is a sexual assault accusing a sexual assault and yes it can be very traumatic\nBut didn't happen when she said it happened that\nWe don't know and what the FBI is out there trying to do is trying to interview enough people including\nAll right judge his friend judge and they finished that up too\nBut it said that they're

of today\nOf what the FBI is going to review come up with on a report they're not going to reveal anything they're going to give it to the president President will give to the committee we may never see what was in that report because I don't think the public has a right necessarily to see it\n\nBecause that report as tall as that was asked for by flake that the president of the greed too and gave it to the FBI that's not necessarily public knowledge\n\nSo what we're going to have maybe find out in the future it wasn't enough it didn't do enough\nAnd right now I mean the Democrats on the
