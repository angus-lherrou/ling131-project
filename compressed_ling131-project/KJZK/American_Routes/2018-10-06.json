Madison is here from ... central you got an update porous will I Do we have somebody that we'd like to thank come and this this pledges his honor of Dave recon the bridge and it comes from our friends

yeah [laughter] so [laughter] and you were first vinyl have you ever bought a new bite on that and I I've been trying to get one but I had to get a vital and where to play a little by little [laughter]\nGive us a call right now and support border radio support the bridge as support all the programming you here on this radio station as we've explained a few times in the past we get a base amount of\nBudget every year from Arizona western college which keeps the lights on a phase most of the salaries of the full time employees we also get a grant from the corporation for public broadcasting and uh that's about ten or twelve percent of our budget but the bulk of our budget especially for pain for programming is from listeners just like you\nAnd it's really important we got some seed money from the college from an innovation fund grad to start this border radio project and to create the border radio internship program but that seed money has kind of a sprouted and been harvested already so are we really need a new infusion of support and\nNow we're turning to list there's like you to help make it possible that we continue this wonderful experiment call us at eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to that's eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to to show your support for border radio and community radio\nAnd this uh eclectic mix of music that you hear on this radio dial everyday again that number's eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to ... you can pledge securely online it\nEighty dot org is so easy to give and there's a lot of reasons you may choose to it could be the fact that we are providing an opportunity for voices you've never heard before for songs that you've never heard before that we're encouraging people to learn our interns to learn more about radio more about\nThe music and frankly more about communication and um we are crossing borders here as much as the show implies you can cross that border that barrier may be making that first call it's so easy you know your phone's in your hand\nYou're looking at right now okay move off a snapshot we walk with them so\nRight and and and flip over to the radio FX and joined us there or the tune in and out or you could even listen to his online or radio ac dot org but I'm also take a moment to ah give us a call ... eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine two numbers do so\nNow runs the how how has so how does border radio internship fit into your academic plans or is it even harder because it reflect your academic goals\nAnd added to it I'm a theater major so at least for me being a native Spanish speaker I tend to speak really really fast sometimes to the point where no one understands me or even I don't understand my\n... year as an intern for for border radio has taught me just slow down and listen to what I'm saying and my diction has come in and very nicely but let me tell you look at it a lot at least on my side that's\nGreat well we're glad to be able to offer that opportunity to other students here at Arizona western college and uh and it's been two for me it's been a real blast working with the students and uh and uh it's kind of reinvigorated my my love for what we do hear a border radio who's our next artist going to be\nHard that's what it's going to be burnt orange switched fast but not with ... just your original songs\nAre there you go here's all Bruno Mars beer Saturday morning\n[noise] [noise]\nNo\nWe're still\n\nUm\nHad a chance to\nShow you\n[noise]\n\nHere [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] oh my gosh man\n\nHad a chance\nStay in\nBed [noise]\nSure you know\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThat do we not only just to pick the music out and play for you but we also give you our perspective on it and maybe sometimes some fun facts or some background information and I think that makes it more interesting than we are a a noncommercial educational radio station and we take that a that a\nDesignation to heart because we try to uh be uh you know Lou informative about the music and not just to have a computer generated ... college right now so it's valuable to you when you call eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to ... from our development team with an update ... central\nYeah I'm One of the updates I'd like to give them is that we'd like to hear from you right now about right now Vicky through has been getting an education and all the newest artists\nOn the scene of the people that uh maybe she'd never heard of and so that's one of the things that I appreciate about border radio is that sometimes I Do hear about art is new and old that ah I have never heard of before so if you appreciate that you learn something new this morning on board or radio give us a call at eight seven seven eight three ...\nTwo because our funding model is a little interesting so essentially we have some based funding from Arizona western college to keep the lights on and keeps a everything running and then we have additional funding a small amount from the corporation for public broadcasting but\nThen the difference that you make right now that listeners support is helping to find our student internship program which is a relatively new program for us although it it goes back to our roots when this station was founded in Nineteen Seventy it started as a student training facility and we kind of\nHave gone back and forth from that model over the last almost fifty years and we're really proud that we were able to come back to that modeled as here I think to funding from our listeners and as sea grant from Arizona western colleges innovation fund so if you want to make sure that this project continues that we continue to have a place for students to come and\nAnd learn and as the rent and said earlier this hour about you know I'm being part of your academic mix with your theater background\nAnd being able to help students get that like up to have that next point in their career their path or journey please give us a call and make sure continue to be here at eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to any contribution of any amount\nWill help make that call that budget supported eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to that's eight seven seven\nEight three eight by tonight to just give you a little more contacts or the difference between the way the station started in the way we're doing it now are back in the day when a uncle Bob as we all call him I started this radio station out students would have to take a class\nThe broadcasting class in order to get a chance to be on the radio so in a sense the students had to pay for the opportunity to be on the radio we decided to turn that on its head and we're actually paying the student interns\nAnd more accurate and I think that only makes sense because a lot of our students have to go a long way to get here\nAnd uh so I I at least want to cover their gas\nSo I gave us a call right now I'm at a snow that does this model\nOf a giving students opportunity to learn about radio and also giving them an opportunity to teach us about their perspective on the world and on music or that that's valuable to your calls at eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to that eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to\nFrom anywhere call us at eight seven seven eight three eight five to ... early on line at border radio ac dot\nOrg now I'd like to encourage you to become a day sponsor with a fifty dollar contribution and for that you can get ten announcements on the day of your choice to recognize a birthday or an anniversary or some other special thing in your life and I'm a rent I don't know if you know that's about me but I celebrate international baking day every year\nAnd that is up I'm going to join you from [laughter]\nSo uh if that's one of those things you can't have international making day that's mine but if you would like to celebrate something random on the calendar please give us a call with a fifty dollar contribution at eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to so I'm\nAll right that is there something interesting that move due to pick some songs in the next set\nUm Internet said like I was asked before my first downloaded coming up with Michael Jackson oh God\nActually the next song it has an artist at one of my closest friends she showed it to me to lead and I've been thankful to her and then the last one is one of my other friends favorite bands and mine also so that's why they're and they're\nAll right so we up next we got a medley I imagined dragons and college together with thunder and or\nA ... a song of the phone title at least is intriguing to me it's called young dumb and broke [laughter] [noise]\n\n\nI mean in\nOur in our new thing you knew your own so high you know [noise] um so\nDo you see only dumb movies do\nWhile we belong to a young young I'm known a young young I'm young I'm a young mom guys [noise]\n\n\nI was\nDreaming big every one of my own\nTo ... I Would make the phone [noise]\n\nI mean I'm retired [laughter] they\n\nWe have so much I think we argue that a new stadium or um you know\nLike the main thing that you read the new guy in the back you\n\n\n\nDon't\nKnow all you know on the phone\n\nHe already has been very hot [laughter]\n\nI mean the the\nThe [noise]\nI mean\nYeah ...\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[laughter] [laughter]\n[laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "American Routes", "city": "Kingman", "day": "06"}
