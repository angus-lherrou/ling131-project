doing\nRemarkable things in their own communities and beyond we've been doing this ever since we started back in Nineteen Ninety One cause it's both bundle learn new stuff and we all need some good news occasionally so we have been providing that service of all these years and here comes held on to tell you about all this week we'll\nYou Nick Patty limerick has been with us I'm Sharon each town before but she continues to expand her role both here in Colorado and in the larger community in and out of academia\nShe is among many other things and American historian and author a lecture and the teacher she's currently a professor at the University of Colorado\nHe taught at Harvard and Yale she's been awarded a MacArthur Fellowship she's the author of the landmark book titled the legacy of conquest and she's recently become the state historian of Colorado pretty impressive huh [noise]\n[noise] he's\nAlso really fine so please welcome back to eat town Patty limerick\n[noise]\nPatty will come back to you it is so excellent to be here thank you\nYou're here I think because it feels like a good time to sort of step back and think about history there are some wacky things going on unprecedented things in some ways but as an historian I suspect\nThere are really not that many things that are totally unprecedented for example we seem to be in a to Z about immigration certainly in this part of the country in the western part of the United states that's nothing new right maybe you could remind our listeners about who the immigrants are around\nHere that's going to take quite a long time [laughter] do we have several days go through that well obviously there were some folks who are but here for very long haul and Indian people and I don't know that I Would\nHave them in that category and they were certainly mobile and dynamic and not frozen in place waiting for white folks to show up so they made a lot of activity going on before our our people that just called in that came into the picture goodness gracious people came from every imaginable starting point on the planet\nJust name a place and the California gold rush but certainly one of those kinds of occasions where everybody showed up but before that the Spanish Empire the French trap hers the Russians the British so people did come from every starting point on the planet\nAnd the people coming into western\nNorth America from every starting point spent a lot more time talking with each other trading with each other\nBut I have to say this sleeping with each other well pro creating as what we've had ... earlier guess as a good faith or so and so they did all of that a lot more than they spent fighting injuring killing each\nOther and including the learning languages and sharing the ability to communicate and yeah and\nEvery significant transaction and western American history\nThe key figure in many of those was the interpreter the translator those are figures that any kind of occasion between Indian people in and white people are sometimes between tribes they are almost unwritten about an unnoticed in western American history and the importance of translators and interpreters has not gone away\nBut it speaks to another kind of translation which is the sort of been transit giants and the fear and the interest in learning about other cultures and other countries and other languages and so on just a bridge between these two camps one that's sort of\nFearful and and I'm not sure what the fears about is their fear the newcomers won't assimilate or won't communicator won't fit in or the bill what's the fuel\nIn western history on some occasions it might be easier to\nMove our minds in the direction of the fearful\nI'm going to go when white workers in California after the gold rush to California with such a sense of opportunity that they were going to go to this place and wonderful things would happen by the time they got there in Eighteen seventies the opportunities were really very constrained and they found themselves as wage workers for railroad companies and it was a\nTerrible twist on high expectations and deep disappointment\nBecause those jobs were taken by Chinese view that's the\nThing is that they found themselves constrained and their opportunity they could have directed that rage at the company's at the employers are could they could have found escaped and indeed that turned out to be the easier path\nA motion to say the Chinese must go\nThey had understandable sense that they had\nTried something they had taken wrists if they'd been there Twenty years earlier for the gold rush they might have had something to come of that so people experiencing frustration despair and not having the moment the desire the guidance the patients that inquiry to say what's going on here\nWhat happened to me it's very tempting to say it's those guys yeah then that's kind of what's going on right\nHey you and gives you just to do and you're listening to eat him I'm sure with Patti limerick\nI Want to ask you about this opportunity you have is a professor\nBecause you come in contact with young people all the time and yet you've got this long view as an historian so you've got this great sort of a perspective where you can see the sort of both sides of what's really going on and many people are in one or the other camp so tell me what's on the minds of your students these days what are they concerned out\nThey certainly are thinking about environmental issues they certainly are thinking about climate change and water allocation and adjustments to drought and scarcity um depending on their circumstances they may be thinking about wild land\nWhole bunch of issues energy good haven't got the very big ... big thing for them and with immigration I Know that this last semester what I just thought is that I Am through talking about education just for the soul not that I ever did much of that but we were just flat out and saying we're teaching your skills that will get you the jobs that you want\nAnd that turned out to be really good because teaching them to write better didn't instantly please them out [noise]\nBut we could say and we had many people to back us up on that this will make a difference in your getting jobs and retain jobs and so on so I guess that might have been doing that just to say I understand anxiety over careers and jobs\nAnd I want to have my students as quick as possible so they never have to think who's the scapegoat that kept me from getting what I Want it yeah\nThat's that's a lovely sort of full circle to our our little time together Patty thank you thank you thanks once\nAgain [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nTo our listeners if you want to find out more about ... is it our weather and he found out a large\nFor you to take a moment and send us your feedback and comments about this segment or the shell in general you can connect with is through Twitter or Facebook or you can also write to us the old fashioned way and box nine to five four in Boulder, Colorado made over three [noise]\n\nFacts they're good we like them so we've got more music coming up from the ... and a little while right now I Want to tell you about our next guest willy watch them grow up in the finger lakes region of New York\nKinda around Watkins Glen and then in around ... he saw bands like horse flies in the high would string band and Donald the buffalo when he was a kid\nAnd in the midst of a serious or old time seeing these fans would sometimes combine old string band music was drums and electric guitars and and create something that was both hypnotic and very dense the ball and a kind of contemporary\nReally want to welcome to each town\n\nPush a destructive singer did you decide at some point that you were going to sing I sing I Know [laughter]\n[noise] well\nI got the Boulder I thought I\n\nAnd I noticed around here\nIt's sort of came natural I started listening to Neil Young at a pretty early age he sang real high so those are the first songs I learned needle and the damage done and Pocahontas and hey hey my so uh it's sort of where I started out I didn't know any different\nI mentioned the music scene in Ithaca New York and it's a remarkably vibrant music scene and that part of the world that most people aren't aware of trying to think of you go into those shows you know with a horse flies\nSocialize big inspiration for me um my dad was a music fan late in play anything but he was an avid listener and music lover or he's from Ireland and he's a big fan of of old traditional federal music and everything so she\nIntroduced me into that stuff when he saw that I was into Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan and that spoke he's seen he took me out around town and we went to some Irish pubs and I also went to a a horse flies shows and I saw richest earned and Judy Hyman and Judy was just kind of does his head bang saying when she plays in her eyes roll back into\nHer head [noise] um and I thought that was the coolest thing like\n[noise]\nThe not every teenager gets to that experience of big collision of the\nTwo worlds like head banging you know electric trance music and ... you know it all came together right there [laughter] and I mentioned your early ban and I'm assuming that was probably you know my guess is that you would have been trying to emulate that sounded\nSo absolutely yeah and ... were a big influence on that band it's funny that you mentioned that no one knows about the funniest game on a scale that name was actually a game that we made up filed\nSo it started with snow when snowballs or maybe ice blocks and he just staying in a circle and throw something in the air and hope it doesn't hit you [noise]\nUm [noise] that was that was the one hand a lot of way out in the good too yeah\n\nWe should mention that the music scene is both a an antidote to enter a reflection of the fact that the weather is pretty rough and a half ago so I think people get to spend a lot of time in the wintertime practicing\nAbsolutely it's like eight months of the winter yeah yeah yeah\nIt's a trip and so it must have been amazing experience when the early incarnation of old crow medicine show got together and you got some buddies you had some good spirits and shared interests and you decided\nTo travel yeah well do I met those guys catching critter they came up from the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia there from National Guard\nYou got the rest of the guys together and we went to Canada play street corners ended up in Ottawa for a while right and we couldn't get across the border because they wouldn't let us so we need to go to the mohawk reservation to get across your part of his old immigration\nCoverage [noise] so I was thinking about back there um\nAnd so the first day an audible we played at the farmer's market and they made a hundred Canadian dollars so we yeah we thought we would just keep on going wow yeah\nWow [noise] wow\nAnd that story about the the ... meeting Doc Watson in Boone North Carolina that's just a legend that couldn't have been scripted more generous bleak for you\nGot zero one of those right place right time things that was the story of that band any good things that happened sort of came from just being in the right place at the right time\nTo many things so you rode that wave you played big venues plan on the grand Ole Opry doing the whole thing yeah and then struck out on your own do miss the infrastructure having people help you carry stuff and set stuff up until your instrument\nNow that's a little you know [laughter] I got these heavy guitar case is going to be her mind the shoulders I'm way too important for\nThat [laughter] [noise]\nIt's also interesting because not everybody has been in a band can do this whole thing\nI didn't know I could do it and I did I think I could yeah I was still used to being in the band and being in a band was was what I'd always wanted yeah having that camaraderie and Adam gang guys yeah there was a learning curve for sure and I was so scared\nBut I just took a few shows like being up there on stage and having people tell me that it was good yeah it gave me the confidence I needed to go on you know\nWell I think you've chosen well you've captured something that I think is is a just a remarkable sale great great energy to those songs so congratulations banking appreciate well let's get back to where you could\nWell come back [noise] [noise] I don't\nThink an old song I heard on a Memphis jug band ... well no actually I heard the Grateful Dead do at first and then years later realized that they didn't write that saw\nThe whole\n[noise]\n\nMan\nWhen people do they
