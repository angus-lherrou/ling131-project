education to understand your mom was music or just a music\nTeacher yeah she was she was no longer but um yeah she wasn't my piano teacher though which I think it was both of our decisions and for the best or move saved our relationship for sure\n[laughter] um and and I've videos of you playing kind of a remarkable should their auto are saying well the auto\nI first came across it was actually also my mother and given her a lot of credit and the interview but I'm On my love you and uh [laughter] she found it was a\nNeighbor of ours selling at a garage sale and then I started researching our hearts and others and I realized there was this amazing history of really incredible strong women and females songwriters performers to play the ought to hurt people in the Carter sisters and Dolly Parton than even contemporary musicians like PG Harvey so\nFrom there I just started getting really into the Internet I got deep into ...\nAnd ah [laughter] I found a lot healthier and yes and uh you might not very\nHigh demand so alone by demand you can get pretty cheap\nWay to look at the only one out there buying those I think\nI Am the only one in the market for ... yeah yeah I had me on on line let me know if I was\nI was impressed by the fact that you could actually kind of maintain the court changes with the bars on the thing while strolling and then using your other hand to hit ... almost like a hammer dulcimer yeah it was amazing technique I'd never seen anybody do that before\nThat one in particular is called the piano at and it's part of a whole group of what we're kind of considered parlor instruments at the turn over the last century that never really quite took off nobody really knew what to do with them or where they belong to like the glass harmonica yeah and I I guess I just feel that if they need for those because I was never really quite where I fit in here [laughter]\nSo how did you figure out how to play it\nI just made it out there you\nKnow Youtube video there's definitely some\nVery strangely transcribed sheet music for all sorts of um hymns and uh I guess what would be kind of standards at this point but there's definitely no um yeah no YouTube sadly for that long ago\nAnd and I mentioned the oldies station that your mother like listen to those old songwriters did that shape you I think as a great person\nInstantly it right away it was like wow there's potential here now and then I had the idea I could go once a year twice a year and\nI wrote a letter to a hundred friends and a couple of thousand dollars came in which is sixty thousand rubies and I started going every year and then eventually I Will eleven months a year\nWow so that first group of hundred friends supported it and then you share the results of your efforts and then that group started writing to their friends is that what happened\nWriting talking ten percent of my daughters are children from schools around the world and uh it just kind of grew from there\nAnd it's still going yeah do you still just go to India where do you go\nNow we've all over Asia we've been to Africa in the middle east but it's mostly Asia Tibet a Afghanistan Pakistan\nVietnam the Philippines well over sometimes is not money it might be taking them to a clinic right or some resources or something like that but I tell them this is not charity I'm going to help you and then you're going to do whatever you can to pass it on to help someone else and I\nHad to literally hundreds of stories one would be quickly uh a fisherman in Indonesia after the tsunami\nAnd he said I have nothing to give I lost my family I've lost my boat I've lost my home\nI said do you ever have extra fish he said sure uh throw them away I said okay I'll buy you a boat will get you to materials to build a house and you promised me that when you have extra says she'll go your way to get away and I came back and actually met him a year later and he was doing it\nWhile well amazing and so this was all funded by this or the word of mouth contributions from prince how big are the donations have bigger the contributions usually\nA about a hundred dollars a often around the holidays but all year round it comes in the smallest was fifty cents from a little boy that we actually could do something with more and up from there\nYeah and is it a pretty lean organization does most of the money go to the you know to benefit these various communities around the world it's eighty five percent ... percent which is huge yeah yeah and then the rest just to run it yeah\nAnd when did you start to Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty nine was that day that you actually had the opportunity to help that woman and he writes right so how many people think you've actually out
