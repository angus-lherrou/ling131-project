there are a lot of people\nMake the case and they work hard to educate those who still do not believe there's a problem\nWell against this week Jeff ... is an award winning filmmaker known for among other accomplishments his work on the powerful documentary called Chasing Ice a multi year chronicle of our planet is rapidly melting glaciers\nAnd recently she has a new team took a look beneath the ocean to produce his latest project chasing coral a feature film that follows a team of adventures as they go about documenting the demise of the coral reefs throughout the globe\nAnd what the impact of the death of those ... is on the rest of the environment and just here to tell us more so please join me now and welcoming known and filmmaker and longtime friend Jeff Orlando [noise]\n\nFor allows ski will come to eat down good to have you here yeah really awesome being here thank you congratulations on your success certainly um you know Chasing Ice do really will open a lot of eyes to just the impacts of of a human activity on the climate on the planet\nWhat helped you I can imagine Buddha helps you kind of turn your attention to the ocean I'm chasing has come out\nAt Sundance and then we released that film and uh we just spent a couple of years really supporting the outreach wanting to share the film to ... talk about our story talk about what we saw and it was in that process that we met a guy named Richard fevers his background was an advertising are really avid passionate scuba diver and photographer\nAnd when we met he was just showing me photographs and stories of what was happening beneath the surface stuff that I didn't know anything about it you know we worked on Chasing Ice I thought I knew everything that was to know about climate change and then meeting Richard in hearing about the ocean story it was like a completely new chapter light bulb went off\nAnd which is you know as you had this technological challenge where you had to have these time lapse cameras in these impervious condemns parked all over the frigid Arctic every corner of the world you started out in this path with a similar endeavor ride underwater Kenya and lapse cameras yeah I think one of the challenges with this issue is that it's\nHard for most people throughout their head around 'cause\nClimate change is inherently invisible if we're talking about changing molecules in the atmosphere so how do you see the consequences how do you see what that actually means in both projects are teams are really trying to document those changes to make them visual\nHow can you actually see the changes happening in the ocean and so we sort of gotten accustomed to figuring out how to make new camera equipment and design a new methods for capturing stuff that are happening in ways that people don't normally see you know and like Jack johnson you started out in a why\nThere was a ...\nWith no longer around the elevator and Joe\n... my bonding and a\nHour to do that in the city in Manhattan ... mama upon you know we're not only be deemed\n...\nAll I can get you know\nMan in the\nTo read ...\nChanges story land you in no time to get a little too young when\nYears in all the time or a job for a short and and then you Tom O'Brien\nHere and she's been ...\n\n[noise] camera [noise]\nWelcome thinking so glad to hear any uh did you start out singing inquires if I get that right yeah and um and then you got to a break early on getting in a musical theater yeah\nExactly yeah I was I always thing and I I actually wrote songs when I was a kid that I I don't have any recording I've I Wish I did um but yeah then I got it the musical theater yeah\nWhen you were held eleven eleven like ups amazed by just the list of credit so TV shows and don't you know a lot of stuff\nDo that but not anymore I'm full time musician\nSo tell me about moving to Toronto when you got there was there or by Britain and welcoming music scene when you are decided that that's what you were going to do\nYeah I was so lucky I moved to turn out I think in two thousand and two\nAnd two thousand and three two thousand and four was the big explosion in Toronto in Canadian music so like arcade fire broken social scene all these bans and so many others knew there was a very open spirit of like anyone can be in a band just go play music and so I started playing bands\nSo you don't remember any of those you know when you were a little kid I Wish I did do you think it was the same stuff 'cause you have this lovely narrative style that's not too concerned we're driving you're just you're they're like little short stories lovely really good writing is that's always been the way you sort of conceived songs\n[noise] no actually when I first started writing songs I didn't know how to play guitar and I was writing songs on my computer I had like a music recording software and I was like looping sounds\nAnd making towns and sort of playing things and then I'd start seeing your top yeah and then a few years later I got rid of the computer and started writing songs with a guitar and that's when I kind of hit on the narrative\nSongwriting and using words because I just I Love words and I love singing word and I love singing words that I haven't heard in a song before you know and just seeing how many things I can put in songs that I've never heard and\nThere's lots of telephone and your songs oh interesting yeah there's lots of people calling each other up yes [laughter]\nAnd I'm sure as soon it'll all be texting it'll all be texting yeah it doesn't sound as poetic um\nLet me let me just also ask you um ... the the weather station is that a name that just came naturally to I Can't help but notice that we've got our mutual friend or a fuse bombers yeah we've got a Dallas screen who's sitting in color and we got\nBy ... and all kinds of people seem to have names that are their name even if they're one person yeah\nI think I have to blame that on Toronto circuit two thousand and five or so when I first started playing music and recording music and I had my my space stage and I was going to put my music up I'm On my space page\nI didn't know anyone who use their name like to use your name was like this super bogus like just not cool thing to do so everyone had these monitors and so I I did too and now of course we're all like why\nAre we just use her name but you know it is an evocative names that I I still can stand\nBut yeah the ... and it's a strangely consistent with our theme this week so we yeah\nWell listen I'm Glad you're here I'm really enjoying yourself
