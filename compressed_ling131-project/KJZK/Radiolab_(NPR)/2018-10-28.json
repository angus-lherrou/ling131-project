Wilkes great Arizona is from all across our state\nI Want you to tell our listeners about ... what makes you unique and why are you renting thank you so much for that you have a great background you right back to that much yeah\nYeah I'm a native of Arizona born and raised here and you know it's kind of great love for the community my wife's also a native of Arizona we've chosen to to raise our family here because Arizona is such a great place to live it's a great place to raise a family\nThat's a great place to grow a business to retire and recreate we just love love the states I'm sure it's the same reason why all your listeners have chosen to Arizona they're home you know and so we've gotten strong ties to the community I Want to make sure we make sure\nA safe or a a strong a free country a free state to a great state for many generations to come you know he's got a got five boys and girls or my wife and I our the parents of nine children that that keeps us very busy and that I certainly\nEnjoy having having a big family but it also gives me a perspective about you know the future I Want to make sure that the the future that each of our our children and their children\nContinues to be a great future\nA future full of prosperity and opportunity or years to come first just a little bit about about my background I'm In my personal life I've also served in in public office before I've served in the state legislature I was first elected in two thousand ten\n... and in the legislature I focused on fiscal issues making sure that we have fiscal responsibility keep our tax burden as alive as possible and I was a strong proponent for the right to lie and the second amendment\nI'm I've got to approving a record of also got a record on the corporation commission as you mentioned I was appointed the commission in October of last year and I've been serving for a year now all of the commission and I've been striving to to serve in a way that is with the highest\nLevels of ethics and integrity\nHighest standards I'm advocating for policies increase of ... I'm a building and trash parents at the commission and also working to reduce our utility rates and looking forward to address in each of those those questions but uh but when it gets to your question about me and I also go to\nA background and finance I've got an MBA and years of experience in the private sector analyzing complex financial statement\nWas for parents may well for service at a corporation commission\nWell you know I was interested in one of the things that I thought how you do almost from the very beginning and that was jumping behind a and support what Bob Burns was doing and the corporation commission about asking a PS helping their books I thought that was interesting so apparently you had been following that\nUm yeah white absolutely\nAbsolutely you know I I think that you know ... some great work at the commission yeah you know and and I was happy to support a ham invite voiced support for the first day he's led to try and increase accountability and transparency I'm that's critical on the public's guy have that confidence that the\nCommission is unduly influenced by the utilities that we regulate\nYeah yeah no that's that's exactly right and of course I think you know everybody wants to see fair treatment or\nOn the corporation commission I mean nobody wants to the utilities go away but we ... we do want to see fair a reasonable actions from the corporation commission to protect the the consumers\nUm and we're all you know rate payers this brings up another thing I just want to say I'm One of the things that I I really don't like to see a is and this is just my opinion only been I think there's probably a lot of agreement out there um\nWhy in the world ... is this a Republican and Democrat issue you know a corporation commission on election it should not be because it's all about repairs whether it's water whether it's electricity utilities whether it is\nA corporations that are trying to form in the state of these are not these are not you know political issue just saying [laughter]\nExcuse even non partisan issues you know and I'll give you one example\nUm you know just this week I was meeting with representatives from from heard ya RG right it's an organization that you know I've value or the opportunity to hear from uh-huh and we have a lot of common ground on the issues at the commission notwithstanding the fact that they are getting outside of utility issues support\nIssues that are far different from the issues that I supported uh-huh in public policy issues that while I Would consider liberal issues are Democrat issues or why I've been a conservative Republican but at the mission\nThey're issue is ensuring that we have affordable rates yet and that's an issue that I support you know as a as a conservative that something that that I think is absolutely appropriate\nFor the commission to be advocating well asking to ensure that we have proper oversight or utilities so we can have affordable rates and safe and reliable public services\nYeah and freedom of choice you know ... you know energy choice and so yeah no I think I think I just wanted to bring that up and I wanted to get your take on that I think there's an awful lot of us consumers in this state that are electric and electricity consumers and we need to have that electricity and we want to have that\nSupport for Prescott public radio is provided by\n... and Keith Kendall at the frame and I and the arts store both in the heart of historic press get the same and I had to twenty west girlie street provide high quality ... and picture framing from family photos to works of art you'll also find a fine art gallery featuring local artists\nOr at five thirty seven north ... is a phone line hearts store offering to

the art\nStore in downtown Prescott find them on line at Prescott art store dot com [noise]\nOkay we are back I Am Lucy Mason here on Arizona energy cross roads and we were visiting with commissioner Justin Olson is a candidate for that same position suggestion you're in the last throes of this campaign and your rent it rang everywhere\nAnd so tell me about how's it going and what do you want to achieve if you are elected\nYeah absolutely thank you for that question you know first of all it is going great you know I'm just really enjoying the campaigning and really getting a great response from the voters as I'm Out there talking about my record of\nOf independence of transparency of advocating for the rate payers best interest in reducing utility rates are more than a hundred and Ninety million dollars annually in response to\nFederal tax reform are providing the proper oversight I\nAm troubled utilities that far too often previously or overlooked and neglected so it's a record that I'm proud of his record that I'm happy to share with the voters that's being well received\nAnd when it comes to what I Hope to accomplish in the first hundred days of of another term\nYou know there there are three things that come to mind certainly first and foremost is to continue to to seek information from all over the groups that have information to provide for consideration for the commission such as some of the groups I mentioned in your group as sweep per west resource alliance\nReal ... and and so on it and so forth an advocacy groups consumer groups\nAs solar industry in getting information from from those that do both rooftop solar those that do utility grid solar gathering all the information that I can to inform the policy positions that I Will support at the corporation commission\nIn addition to that you know I you know I've mentioned as we mentioned it than previous segment retail competition you know I think that this is something that the commission needs to look at it it's going to occupy a significant\nAmount of the commission's time to forgive value wait all of the data that is available to us you know we've got some great examples in in Texas where retail competition has been in place for quite some time but we can we can evaluate how has it worked what's worked what's what's gone wrong\nWell we have learned and we can learn from them you know I mean absolutely we don't have to make the same mistakes [laughter]\nAbsolutely where where where they went wrong and enacted policies that help the repair them we can avoid that you know where that data clearly demonstrate that that some policy was beneficial to repair\nAnd then we ought to pursue that I'm looking forward to continuing that that conversation like I mentioned you know I've called for the commission to consider this issue uh-huh yeah\nAnd then lastly you know I I I think a continual amount of our attention\nOr will be a Johnston utilities and I know this may seem somewhat remote from your listeners are in your part of the states as it's out on the stand and valley but I think that it is important to all Arizona consumers\nTo recognize that the commission is providing the proper unnecessary oversight\nOver ...\nUtilities yeah and so that's what I look forward to do and making sure that we have that proper\nWell I'll tell you what I'm from an outsider's point of view a and looking at the commissioners I think the commissioners are going to have a huge um responsibility honestly to the rate payers to to really really get into what you mentioned earlier and that is retail competition I\nI mean it's it's a natural for corporate interests not to want to utility interest not to want that competition that they're a monopoly but the but the point is that if we're going to move the state forward um\nWe're gonna have to really evaluate\nAnd ... and and and looking at it as a positive pointed point of view about how we can gracefully maybe not but gracefully bring in the renewable energy industries and there are so many of them um and how does that\nReflect on the revenues back to the legislature you know and how we can actually fund education and other issues that we have in the states that are so so big\nRight now we can continue to rely on tourism and so I think that that's a big um responsibility of the corporation commissioners and um and I you know I Would look to you\nI'm as to how to organize as you might you know if you if you're elected you might be\nOn the organization of how you move for maybe you're the one that calls for a workshop what do you think\nYou know I I Am absolutely happy to to take that lead\nI'm like I said it's certainly not supported a ... and and ... and ... specified of that position already you know in the docket of the corporation commission and I think it found that we that we need to evaluate the best interest of the right bears and we should pursue it\nYeah yeah I'm interested into and what you're hearing from around the state um you know how to how do people feel I Am\nAs you're listening to folks how do people feel about ah bringing in these new industries all of them yeah 'cause I mean it's not just solar panels on a roof it's commercial and utility scale and you know I have all the associated battery so all of it you know how do they feel about this\nYou know I I think people are excited about the future you know I think there's a real potential\nFor significant change in the ... the way things have operated in gaining our our power and and that change will arrive when the technology\nIs available that makes the the the storage of our solar energy much more cost efficient and and I expected it will be available in the very likely in the near term but certainly I ... in the long term\nI when it arrives than we can significantly drive up the amount of our solar energy that his powering the demand on the grid and because we will not be limited to only the times when the sun is shining mhm that future and\nThose ... technological breakthroughs yeah bringing down the cost of stories are things that I think people are excited about excited for future\nYeah well we know you know we've been around at all you know we've been in business which you have and I have and you know many of our listeners are we've got ranchers down in our listening area you know they're all concerned about you know how we can\nMove the state forward and what does the economy look like in the future and what are the industries that are going to make sense for us you know and so I think you know I think you're you're absolutely on track with that\nUm and I think are more importantly I think our citizenry is on track I think they understand\nA with that collective wisdom Ohio where we ought to be going I just need to say thank you so much adjusting for joining us today we are flat out at a time or we wish you well and go forth\nThank you so much for having me it's been it's been my pleasure\nFolks thanks so much for joining us today I Am Lucy Mason here on Arizona energy cross roads and we've been visiting with commissioner Justin often does a candidate for the corporation commission again thanks so much for joining us come and join us again next week by by\nArizona energy crossroads is produced is a public service by come with the communications in partnership with public radio and the Arizona community radio\nSaturday Sunday\n[noise]\nHi this is Dave minor your host for radio unleashed joined me as we run wild a beautiful field of every week we put our nose to the ground searching the best thing music mixes him under appreciated little bones and play you some of your candy\nIt's radio on tonight at age right here on how big radio eighty nine point five FM kj Prescott valley and Ninety point one F. K. Jay Z has\n[noise]\nBeen coming up next to this week's edition of American radio journal would host Lohmann Henry\n... [noise]\nNorth Carolina to Washington New York to Hawaii this is American radio journal on this edition the Trump administration's efforts at cutting federal regulations have saved American businesses billions of dollars Ken Cuccinelli up freedomworks is here to talk about just how much\nAnd so you have Ted Cruz and Texas Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee Martha ... in Arizona and Dean Heller in\nNevada and at one point in time all of those look like they could get lost I think Ted Cruz's now safely going to get reelected barring some unforeseen disaster I think the same thing can be said about Marsha Blackburn\nAnd then in Arizona and Nevada I think that the Republican candidates there are slowly pulling away of a Democrat in Arizona here since cinema has just a disastrous\nLast couple of weeks she was a recorded on tape calling or Arizona a meth lab\nAnd a few other things so that is looking better and better for Republicans and so's Nevada so if you assume all of those are are safe then that means that Republicans are playing a fence going into election day and so [noise]\nOf I think is North Dakota that on is getting almost to the point of ridiculous of how safe that is for Republicans and then after that you've got a couple of races like Missouri Indiana\nAnd Florida that are very very close I Would say Missouri is probably the next likely to go for Republicans in Indiana and Florida\nSo right there that's four\nSeats and then you've got Montana in West Virginia that are tightening that the Republicans could pick up as well so then you've got six now I think it would be an extreme long shot if Republicans picked up all six seats but if they did the majority would go from fifty one to fifty seven\nAnd boy that would be a huge ... defeat of the Democrats and their agenda in might incite a lot of introspection on the Democrats part that they were able to lose all the seats when Trump\nBecame such a polarizing figure and yet he was still able to help\nPick up all those seats so it'll be a remarkable thing to watch on ... on election day but I Do think that things are definitely going in the Republicans' favor\nOne state we haven't really talked about is Mississippi unusual circumstance there to US Senate seats up but both you think are safely Republican\nRoger Wicker is up for reelection and he he's kind of been saved the entire cycle the other one Thad Cochran was the incumbent but he resigned due to poor health the governor appointed a Cindy Hyde Smith\nI think she was the ag commissioner for the state she's the first woman senator from Mississippi ever she has been surveying for several months now she's obviously running for reelection and she's got the support of the party of course and big establishment money like the chamber of commerce Chris McDaniel who almost defeated\nThad Cochran back in twenty fourteen\nHas attempted to challenge Cindy Hyde Smith for that seat but his campaign has been plagued by incompetence ...\nAnd a lack of fund raising and other things so he's just not going to be competitive so yes both of those Mississippi seats are safe and they're safe in Republican hands\nWell let's talk also a little bit more about Florida there you have the governor the Republican governor of Florida Rick Scott running against the Democrat incumbent how has\nThe recent hurricane they're impacted that raised ... governors have to deal with the aftermath of hurricane\nYeah it's it's an interesting dynamic when Rick Scott first got into the race he immediately went on a on a media blitz\nAnd spent millions and millions of dollars in fact I think Florida is the most expensive Senate race right now and that's due in large part because of his own spending\nRick Scott spending and he was able to create a fairly sizeable lead in the polling but Bill Nelson\nHas fought back and has tightened the race\nTo where it's now basically a coin flip what's interesting here though is it because of the hurricanes Rick Scott has had to somewhat suspend his campaign in order to provide the leadership that he needs to provide as governor of of the state to get the state through that hurricane and and the aftermath but that\nRole of being governor in the aftermath of that hurricane has provided him with a lot of our media and it has revealed itself that he is a good leader and he he he has handled things well so far so it's not like he has this\nHas harmed his ability in the Senate race but as I said before the race his\nNeck and neck it's fifty fifty and I don't think we're going to truly know who the winner has until election day\nLet's talk now for a minute or two about the house of representatives everything that you've talked about very rosy for Republicans in the Senate could be a little bit odd this year they won chamber might go one way and the other the other way are Democrats still favored to take control of the house of representatives\nThey are and I think right now the question is is how big is at\nThat margin of control going to be for the Democrats I think if Republicans have their way or if it's a very good night for Republicans there's a small chance of Republicans could keep the majority but what's more likely is that they will lose the majority but Democrats only have a single digit majority of their own\nAndy Roddick the club for

W. W. dot club for growth or\nAnd if they like what they see they can join for free\n... at the club for growth Andy thank you again for being here thanks for having me alone they aren't going to make news headlines about two key cases involving constitutional rights will be hurt by\nOr in November we get details now from Eric Boehm of reason magazine I folks I'm Eric day with reason magazine thanks for joining us on this edition of American radio journal know guess for me this week instead of just taking a solo look at\nThese two important but maybe somewhat under the radar cases that will be in front of the Supreme Court session that really lacks a lot of high drama not a lot of really major cases that could reshape major laws around the country\nBasically nothing about guns or abortion or gay wedding cakes on the docket for this session but there are these two important criminal justice cases one of them Tim's the Indiana\nAnd the other gamble the United\nStates and let's start with that one gamble the U.S will be heard by the justices on December fence that oral arguments\nAnd looks at stake here is something called the separate sovereign loophole in the Fifth Amendment now that sounds very complicated or legal easy but it's actually pretty straightforward most people are probably pretty familiar with the idea of double jeopardy the idea that\nYou cannot be tried and convicted twice for the same crime but there is this the strange loophole that effectively allows you to be both tried and convicted\nAt the state level and the federal level for the same crime and parents Marquez gamble fell right into that loophole a few years ago he was convicted in two thousand eight of second degree robbery and as a condition of that conviction I he was prohibited from owning a firearm\nUnder both state and federal law now in twenty Fifteen gamble was pulled over by the cops for having a boss the tail light\nThey searched his car and they found a hand gun in the car so he ended up being convicted of unlawfully possessing a firearm and he was convicted both by the state of Alabama and by the federal government he won't be released from prison until February of twenty twenty that is three years later than if he had only been convicted at the state level\nNow gamble has appeal is federal conviction on the grounds that he was being punished twice for the same crime which of course the Fifth Amendment explicitly forbids unfortunately for gamble\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that the same behavior actually can be punished under both federal and state law without violating the ban on double jeopardy because the state and the federal government are two distinct\nSovereign but this doctrine of separate sovereign really has a a bit of dubious legal history to it at first arose in Eighteen fifty two case that had to do with fugitive slaves and then it was upheld by the court in a prohibition era K. C. U. S. V. lands\nAnd both of those rulings are kind of looked down on nowadays as having been poorly ...\nSo this case matters because there's been a push to federalize so many crimes in recent decades and that means there's now really significant overlap between state and federal offense is and that creates more opportunities for multiple convictions based on the same actions\nThat redundancy seems to conflict with the intent behind the double jeopardy clause in the Fifth Amendment and it also makes it harder for states and the federal government is that appropriate penalties since neither really knows what the other will do or if the other will even seek out an additional conviction for the same crime\nSo a victory for gamble in this case could mean tossing out a long standing but poorly conceived\nSupreme Court precedent or at least potentially limiting its use and that that would protect defendants\nFrom facing cereal prosecutions for the same crime and ultimately increased liberty and and be a significant reform to America's criminal justice system so that's one case to keep your eye on I think the other important criminal justice case in front of the court this session comes out of Indiana the cases came to the Indiana\nSo what's at stake here is the eighth amendment's prohibition against excessive fines and the question of whether that", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Kingman", "day": "28"}
