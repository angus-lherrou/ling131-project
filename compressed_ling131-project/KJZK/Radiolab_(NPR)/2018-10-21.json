{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KJZK", "content": "I Am really excited about this campaign cycle and I am looking forward to getting back to the commission [noise]\n... well you must have some ideas about what you're observing over the years and um and I think our listeners would be interested or you kind of have an insider's perspective on what's going on right now in this campaign urine actually what's been going on for the years since you left\nCan you give us some uh thoughts about what you've noticed\nWell I'm miss Lucy I Am down the commission the corruption commission oh\nAnd it's just unfortunate that you know I had to of it that you know give it that name but you know when I was at the commission I saw corruption firsthand I tried to call it out\nAnd uh people just aren't listening and I think these last six years have been an eye opener for the state of Arizona and how things are\nBeing run down at the commission and unfortunately the commission was created to protect rate payers the consumers of the state\nAnd ah it has actually flip the switch and they are protecting the big monopoly so [noise] that that it's a huge concern for me that there are no real some advocates that the commission\nYou know I'm Wondering if you were following the and I'm assuming that you did\nA following the case over the last two years um that was a solar a began as a solar settlement so solar agreement with a P. S. and M. and and it was worked out over several different mind several months um\nWhere there was an agreement that was that was reached and we all agreed that we would not do a um [noise]\nTry to try to interfere with that without agreement in any way\nAnd I'm no initiatives no backstabbing no you know trying to tear the agreement apart um\nWithout everybody else being at the table which was really fair and um and so we held onto that we held up that agreement [noise] um but the problem is that not too long I think it was like ah like the next month after\nAfter the new rates went into effect which was a four percent increase in the rate of ... a PS customers\nUm and we were being told and I'm a I'm an atheist customers so I can say we\nWere being told that would be you know five or six dollar increase in our in our monthly bill well ride right away it turned out to be so much more than that some people were seeing a twenty dollar increase some people were saying you know a fifty dollar increase in my account and then I just found out this week uh\nHad a fifty percent increase ... with no extra usage or no more usage\nSo there was some some some real you know clumsy things that were happening with the rates right after that settlement agreement and that rate increase went into effect and I'm just wondering if you had heard anything about that and if that was something on your mind\nIt is on my mind and you know I have I sit and listen to people as I Am traveling across the state and I hear about how\nUm much there um bills have not just double triple but in some cases quadrupled\nAnd you know I have it on numerous occasions if to commission and and I do understand settlement agreement settlement agreement coming fit you know people come to the table and they sit on Greece on disagree with your walk out of that room there is an agreement to write\nA but in this case I think clearly there needs to be a forty dashed to fifty two now that's a state statute that allows the commission\nAre any one commissioner\nTo write a letter to the docket and say hey maybe we made a mistake\nWe had no clue that a PS was going to come up with a new way of ... to my service there are a lot of issues that are\nCannot entwined into this recent rape case\nAnd I think that they really need to reopen it and take a look at it see what mistakes were made because the new feeling structure is not a good structured it it is that is just knew it is not the same structure that they had prior to this rape case [noise]\nAh so you can't compare this year last year to the year before\nWhen I notice to what I heard from from my accounting okay he's a numbers person and so he's very ...\nThis bill to last month's bill to you know last year's build the same month and what he saw was that there were brand new fees that were put on the bill\nNow the electorate doesn't understand the bill anyway and uh so it's like well I Need electricity so I'm just going to go ahead and pay the bill\nAnd that's that's that's what we're stuck with\nSo um anyway I just wanted to bring that up a Sandra I Know that you're following along with all this I think we're going to go ahead and take a little break right now and then we'll come back\nAnd um and get into the the issues and we can kind of pick up from here to if you would like a phone call that with us we're visiting with Senator Kennedy who is who was a former Arizona State corporation commissioner and she will be back with me in just a little bit stay with us [noise]\n\nSupport for this public radio station is promoted by these Kingman underwriters support for ... public radio is provided by\n...

it's an exhausting time and just for our listeners benefit or people in it we all need to understand something that I think you know we don't pay attention to in the in the beginning stages of an election year\nBut candidates for these big possessions start a year and a half to maybe even a year and two thirds or to ... years in advance of you know collecting trying to raise money to get your campaign organized get your people in place and then and then\nEven after that which takes months\nUh then you're on the road and you're going everywhere and in in a statewide campaign it is an enormous task and it's exhausting so we appreciate you Sandra for putting putting yourself out there again but tell us about what you're thinking about for it or if you are if you are elected 'em\nAnd we wish you luck for that um what are your your um insurance for the first hundred days\nWell I Want to start off day one a sign subpoenaed to get a PS you know kind of go with\nTo open up their books

some issues in the last\nTwo years\nUm they got two million dollars from the legislature to implement a new a computerized system ah which included\nNew software and so forth to make it easy for those who\nWhether they are found him for a new business a new foundation mhm those who use it on a daily basis [noise] there there were issues that were discovered wants its new um\nSoftware had been implemented and you know I kinda got caught up in it too I was trying to start a new foundation and I found out do extradited services which takes seven days\nWell it actually took three almost four months before I got my documentation\nThat my goodness and it was really surprised\nMe and I'm just asking questions about what was going on and discovering that you know there were a lot of bugs in the system they had to hire an outside farm to come in and take questions and you know it can uh put the current\nAt the commission haven't gotten a raise in\nOver a decade so does that affect morale sure um I looked at the budget just for this year there's no mention of races for the staff huh we we've got to do some things to keep\nThe staff even interested in\nComing to work getting the job done\nTalking\nIt's making sure that their complaints are heard from the time to complain if given all the way to the end of you know completing\nOut and getting a you know somewhat of an answer to the individual who's making that complaint those issues that I think need to come to the forefront and I really want to bring them to the forefront you know we've got a I say we like um they\nThere are nearly small water companies and I don't think that those a lot of companies get the kind of attention that they need a we've got a lot of company right now in southern Arizona\nThat happened at a rate increase\nHasn't had new equipment adds an add any great any quick and Seventeen years flu Seventeen Celtic mission doesn't know whether or not they're functioning but that company now approached\nThe commission and they want a thousand percent rate increase [laughter]\nTalking about all community\nBoy now and it's just gonna devastate company in ...\nIn southern Arizona though those ... want to get back and talk about and I want to be a voice for the people\nMhm well there is a voice um we have a we have ... the residential utility consumer organization\nThey are there to defend and back up and help a consumers as well and see the the utilities from the consumer point of view along with a corporation commission how are they helping oh what the issues do you think\nYou know I was trying to read through the ... just last night\nAnd I have not seen anything where a real cold is our has made any comments or statements and it may be a little early 'cause I'm this company just came to the commission and\nI Believe next week they're gonna I'm hearing the visual probably start taking comments on it mhm\nBut I'm just praying and hoping that you know there will be a voice and I'm hoping that it is not me which you know the case will probably voted on next year [laughter]\nBut be there to speak on behalf of the race pairs of that water\nWell I'll tell you with Sandra we are out of time but I I Hope that um you know I\nHave a yes or no question for you to answer and and that is do you want to take in both sides do you I mean you're not just against utilities

radio [noise]\nFrom Illinois to Vermont Mississippi do taxes this is American radio journal on the news in Congress is broken and it can't fix itself so is it time for a convention of stage to provide a constitutional but\nMark Meckler from prevention of space is here with details [noise]\nControl of Congress next month likely will do so with a very slim majority how will that affect the legislatures ability to govern\nAndy ... of the club for growth is here with the real story the national debt has another new high should remain concerned airing Boehm of reason magazine\nTalks with Brian ... of the Manhattan Institute and Democrats are approaching the mid term elections with very different strategies in urban and rural districts\nDr ... from the center for vision and values at Rome's City College has an American radio journal commentary\nLooming Henry and welcome to American radio journal the constitution of\nThe United states can be changed by amendment or via a convention of states since Congress will probably not reform itself the convention route is more likely to yield results\nMark Meckler is president and founder of convention of the states\nAnd convention estates action\nIs here to explain how a convention would work and why it is needed mark welcome to American radio journal mark when we talk about a convention of states it's probably a process that most Americans are not familiar with so tell us what is a convention of states\nYeah you're right it's something we've never done before in our history it's found an article five of the United States Constitution it was literally put there two days before the end of the convention in Seventeen eight seven and it's put their this idea of the state's getting together and convention put there\nFor the very purpose of pushing back against federal overreach and what it is is a process whereby\nTwo thirds of the states now thirty four states can get together\nColic convention it together and convention and discuss ideas\nFor restraining federal overreach and specifically the application we're pursuing right now which has already been passed in twelve states calls for physical restraints on the federal government term limits on the federal government that would include Congress the courts and the bureaucracy and ultimately I think the most important scope and jurisdiction restraints\nAre you finding that the current system the way that it is structured mark particularly with Congress with a lack of term limits and no real limits on power are we finding of this isn't working as well as it did in the early days of the republic\nIn the real reason is is needed is then you referred to structurally broken the structure of government in the United states of America so the structure was set up correctly I think it worked beautifully for the first hundred years and then we started to break that structure\nSo we now need structural reforms and the only way to get structural reforms is by calling a convention and imposing do structural reforms one great example is terminal and it's simply used to be imposed by people people rotated in office they didn't serve for thirty thirty five years in Congress or in the Senate\nAnd so we didn't need term limits now we do need term was when the founders created the Supreme Court for example the Supreme Court the justices average age of appointment was forty seven average life expectancy was fifty four\nThey didn't expect jurors to serve Thirty years on the United States Supreme court so we broken the system in some pretty fundamental ways that need to be repaired structurally those things aren't going to be repaired by elections\nWhat about the process by which we have amended their constitutions numerous times throughout the centuries starting with the bill of rights where you go amendment by them and is that just to laborious process to try to get this type of systemic change that you're talking about well\nI don't think it's that it's so much more laborious the issue is what we're looking at is controlling the federal government if you look at the process the the other process for proposing amendments amendments half the proposed by Congress so we're talking about is\nCongress needs its wings clipped Congress needs balanced budget imposed on at Congress needs term limits imposed on it they will never propose those sorts of them and so it would take two thirds of both houses to propose it try to imagine a time when two thirds of both houses of Congress propose a balanced budget amendment term limits that's just not going to happen\nTo grind things to a halt and for the past Twenty years these factions have been adamant\nAbout advancing their agenda because they promised it and leadership ends up screwing in all of them because they don't want the government shut down or they have to about two they're K Street masters [noise] they have to do all these things\nAgain this is all speculation on my part but I can envision and maybe this is naive on my part I can envision a scenario where these factions tampered down their desires as long as it means that they can voice their opinion\nAnd that they are given for time\nAnd space to offer up their ideas have them the liberated and in the public\nAnd then a ... I don't know what that world looks like we've been in such a dysfunctional state of mind for the past twenty Thirty years that is kind of hard to imagine but perhaps\nIs what happened so I'd be interested to hear other possible scenarios but that one seems like the most likely one\nIt is very interesting it will continue to be so and then we had President Trump on top of all of this right now it's really sort of a mix the whole ... a little bit more in any event that we're going to have a lot to talk about it as we head into the election in the years ahead with Andy Ross from the club for growth and the a bit about the club\nYou bad the ... a membership organization out of Washington DC but we have over two hundred and fifty thousand members from all across the country from all fifty states in the union or United because we believe in economic liberty if your listeners are interested they can go to our website at W.

big jump in the national debt has caused warning bells to go off very Boehm of reason magazine takes a look up the causes and effects of this problem with Brian read all of the Manhattan Institute\nWell the federal government spends more money than it takes then that's not exactly news to anyone who's been paying attention to politics for you know the last Twenty years or so what is news is what the Treasury Department reported\nThis week on Monday the Treasury Department saying that this fiscal year twenty Eighteen budget deficit that the deficit for this fiscal year that\nEnded on September thirtieth was seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars that is the largest federal budget deficit in a single year since twenty twelve it's right in the first time of the Obama administration ... band with reason magazine thanks for joining us on this edition of American radio journal\nMy guest today is Brian Reed all he is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and he's also a long time Republican congressional aide he worked with Senator Rob Portman of Ohio for years and he also crafted the deficit reduction plan\nFor the twenty twelve a Romney campaign so Brian has been thinking about and writing about and talking about budgets in budget evidence for a long time and we appreciate him stopping by the show Brian thanks for being here\nThank you the budget deficit for the year that ended on September thirtieth Brian seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars that's the largest twenty twelve break these numbers downpours what's driving that big deficit increase that we saw over the last twelve months\nThe interesting thing about the rising during a time of economic prosperity which typically don't see in the last couple of years have gone from four hundred and thirty nine billion or the way to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion\nDeficit in the past year is mostly to the tax cuts which cost about a hundred and sixty four billion dollars if you include the interest\nAnd fix the over they raise the spending half for defense and non defense discretionary spending that was about a hundred and forty six billion with those two policies that would have been closer to four hundred billion push it up to seven Seventy nine\nI just had rain we don't usually see big jumps in the deficit during times of of relative peace and prosperity we're on course right now\nFor a deficit that will exceed a trillion dollars by the end of the current fiscal year the twenty Nineteen fiscal year so this problem is not going away in fact it's only getting bigger compare what's happening right now\nTo the federal budget to where we were saying in twenty ten through twenty twelve years where we were we had that deficit up around a trillion dollars even just over a trillion dollars how is it different now versus that\nWe've had at that point four trillion dollars in two thousand and with a lot of hysteria around the country and a lot of concerns that brought the Tea Party differences there was one point four trillion dollar deficits temporary revolt very the production and when the recession went away\nWhen down by itself a Congress that a little bit of tax hikes a little bit of spending cuts the stimulus spending again and\nIt dropped by the difference now is that moving forward is primarily going to be the result of Social Security and Medicare Seventy four million retiring baby boomers and rising healthcare costs\nThat's temporary that's not going away as a matter of fact it is ten years under current policy baseline that assumes\nCurrent trends continue we're looking at a deficit of who currently in a year or even three trillion increase rise and that will be from Social Security and Medicare\nSo you have a kind of a combination of factors working here you've got the short term factors the tax cuts\nThe spending hikes then you've got the long term factors those entitlement costs that you talked about we're talking with Brian Reed all he is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute\nAnd he's the author of a paper that is just out this week Bryan we should plug this is titled a comprehensive budget plan to revert a debt crisis you can find that at the Manhattan Institute website Manhattan Institute dot org and Brian ... is the author of that piece that looks at us\nDeficit that we're facing today but really the white scary numbers that we're going to be facing in five or ten years if\nPolicymakers in DC don't get serious about dealing with is Brian tell us a little bit about what that sort of fiscal sue now me that is that it's coming for us in the next ten years if we don't sit up and and look at this trillion dollar deficit and and do something about it today\nThe numbers are staggering over the long term it's hard to put it into words because it almost sounds like monopoly money when you say this and the national debt right now ... trillion dollars over the next Thirty years Social Security and Medicare short one hundred trillion dollars\nIncluding interest over Thirty years the numbers are too big to even imagine what it really means is that you don't want to pay benefits for Social Security and Medicare\nWe would have to double\nDouble X rays double your family's tax rates double rolled back to Washington to double shifts to pay for the rams we've already we're not even taking into account already forty dollars agenda doubling axis ... from\nThere are a lot of details are in the paper here Brian and uh I Would encourage our listeners to check out the longer version of this interview that we have running it reason dot com right now but that you can get all the details there you can read the paper invited their opinion about the minute or so we have left here Brian what is the basic formula here to avoid\nThis coming debt crisis that America could be facing in the next day in the next decade or so\nWe need a Congress to actually come together on Iran to plan mostly been spending but access to be on the table to plan that I learned that crisis would have the policies\nFactors twenty twenty three\nSo that we ought to get people to start negotiating stop start enacting it and get it because the longer we wait the former rises by trillions so the problem isn't going away and it's time to address\nThese high on the program and it's probably because I'm able to\nSay really really big problem it could mean a as Brian said that it could mean the doubling of all the taxes that you currently pay to the federal government just to pay the existing debt in the system as a big problem we're not going to solve it must be start talking about it so at least we've got people like Brian Reed all out there who are talking about uh Brian thanks for taking time to be here on the show thank you\nAnd again that is Brian Reed all he is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute former Republican policy wonk on the hill as well you can check out his paper on the coming deck Rice's that Manhattan Institute dot org check out our coverage of the budget deficit and what needs to be done to address and you can also find a longer interview with Brian
