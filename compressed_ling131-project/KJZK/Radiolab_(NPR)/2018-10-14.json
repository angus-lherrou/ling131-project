{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KJZK", "content": "The question was the um [noise] I started out in a two thousand six and I read a couple of books about climate change in about coal big hole by Jeff Goodell which is a very well known book\nAnd I had heard through some activists friends that there were plans on the books to build another hundred and fifty new coal plants and another breed of coal plant called clean coal clean coal and yet [noise]\nAnd so a woman that I happened to meet at a PC hearing 'cause I Want to make a statement at the at the time I was living in Colorado I should say I lived in ah Arizona from Nineteen Seventy nine to two thousand one and then two thousand nine to twenty Thirteen\nBut at the time or two thousand six I was in Colorado and ah I met a woman who's ... became my mentor in fact she lived in Prescott for many years her name is Lesley Gloucester\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of listeners know her so Leslie took me under her wing and a said well excel energy wants to build a clean coal plant here um we're going to fight it so I said okay sure [noise]\nSo I signed up to be the expert on clean coal even though at the time I really didn't know a megawatt from a cat [laughter] so I immersed myself in clean coal\nAnd I learned from a woman named Carol overland who's a real character a truck driver turned attorney with a three legged dog and I went up to red wing Minnesota defense three days with her learning about clean coal\nAnd one of the most interesting things that happened was that\nAnd it's sort of tells a story about clean coal\nAt the time\nA former excel executive who who left excel to make their own company\nWould want it to build the plant so therefore excel and Minnesota would have had to buy the purchase power from that plant will because those plants were pretty unknown and pretty expensive the power would have been a very high\nExpense for excel they would have made no profit on that electricity because they would have had to buy the output from the clean coal plant\nMade no profit and they knew it was expensive so they filed testimony in the Minnesota PUC saying this is a terrible idea it's it's awful\nBut meanwhile in Colorado because they're trying to build a clean coal plant there that they own\nAnd they could put in rate base and make a profit from their pushing clean coal so low and behold we introduced this testimony from Minnesota in Colorado and we say hey look what excel doing\nTheir thing in in Minnesota they're saying it's terrible and in Colorado they're saying it's great what's going on here\nSo we were able over the course of a few months to provide enough information to the public utilities commission in Colorado that they had real doubts and you could just tell from their statements that they had doubts and so in October of that year our first filing I think was in around march\nBy October of that year I excel energy had withdrawn their plans for clean coal plant\n[noise] even though they got I think it was a hundred and twenty million through Ken Salazar who was then US Senator and Colorado former attorney general Colorado [noise] and so the ... the kids were Greece and so we were a basically able to stop the plant will then in\nIn August a few months earlier I got a call from Paul Newman\nAnd Paul Newman was a corporation commissioner of the time Paul is on the coaches county\nFor her supervisor uh-huh and I had somehow never met Paul even though I worked in Arizona politics starting with working for Utah in eighty six and the state legislature as an intern in law intern went to a a few law school but I never met Paul and So Paul said hey they're\nTrying to build a clean coal plant\nIn ... in Cochise County outside of busy\nSo I flew down here at my own expense to Arizona\nAnd we talk to people and they were so smart it was like throwing a match in a dry fields and those retired IBM executive they remember this woman named Ellen the author\nWho is as smart as a whip they took it and ran with it and that clean coal plant never went anywhere in Arizona well how did you get involved in solar what happens there will solar was first I've worked on coal for about two years\nThen Leslie and I would still working in Colorado [noise] she said Nancy I'll take cold 'cause she's quite an expert you take natural gas so I took dance for gas and I don't have and to natural gas for a number of years and then slowly\nAlso got involved in the solar docket in Colorado now the time I sort of got into Colorado ... into solar it was about eight bucks a watt [noise]\nAnd so she'll get\nIt kind of go down down down down down at my husband at the time Andy barred well who's a dear friend and we still work on energy policy together he\nHouse and so I watched Andy do this through solar PV an solar hot water and started to understand the potential mhm and then just watching the costs go down\nBut I didn't really get my solar education until I came back to Arizona and two thousand nine mhm [noise]\nThat was a that coincides nicely with of much of the work that I was doing in the legislature now you went and became you became staff on the Arizona corporation commission um when did that have well\nI wasn't actually staff and it's hard for people to understand that I was a policy advisor and so\nBecause policy advisors and the commissioners in Arizona has fiduciary\nRelationship and actually this is due to a U.S Supreme Court case I mean Arizona State Supreme Court case where there was foul play going on corruption and basically the the policy advisor and the commissioner pointed their fingers each other it with him that was him\nAnd the court said no you will fiduciary relationship and if one of you break the law the other view breaks the law so I was paused policy advisor and we were more like a judge's office where it was me Paul and we had to look at wonderful admin gal\nNow at that time was Paul involved with a with solar issues were what was Chris mazes commissioner a involved with that\nChristmas is a commissioner and it was wonderful to work with are brilliant hardworking woman um and uh so we were lucky because Chris was there yeah because Christmas paving the way horses amendments would come out and I would run to the printer and get them\nYeah [laughter] okay well now see we have to take a little break here listeners you are listening to me was the Mason the executive director of the Arizona solar energy Industries Association here on Arizona energy cross roads and we're talking with Nancy ... an energy consultant we'll be right back\nStay [noise]\nSupport for this public radio station is provided by these can underwriters support for profit

G. S. Navajos generating station and four corners so let me tell a story about four corners because it's it's jaw dropping [noise]\nWell when I was at the commission working for commissioner on human\nSouthern California Edison\nWas forced to divest it's interest in the four corners plant\nAnd the reason was because in two thousand six hundred Arnold Schwarzenegger they passed a very progressive forward thinking law that said hey California utilities you can't buy power from\nCoal plants anymore you can't ... year contract as soon as your contract runs out that's it and so Southern California Edison was forced to divest of their share of that power plant okay so initially the number floated around with like a PS it's going to buy it for like four hundred million well the actual\nRight that would be reduced to cheer that would be a reason that a grocery store for it yes\nAnd so we have never lived up to our commercial potential ever\nIn fake hardly any states are and so the utilities are basically taking over\nYou know you see this also in other states like Colorado where they're trying to squish distributed generation and just go full tilt into utility scale so that they can own everything has it not only with out here now why is that you know because they want to own all the assets and if we want to talk\nYou know let's pull in a little discussion of what's going on in Nevada where with a very little money in twenty sixteen they had a ballot initiative to de regulate Nevada oh I Know and I would love\nTo see that happen here I think what the initiative is actually trying to go there\nUh that we have gathering signatures right now as speaking of the market that ... that you just mentioned Nancy\nThere have been several poles over the last decade that have asked the question of our citizens across the state would you support solar on your roof um and how do you feel about solar in general and it's an\nEvery single poll is eighty two to eight eighty seven percent of the general public\nRegardless of political affiliation want solar in this state it doesn't take rocket science to look out your window and see the sun two hundred and Ninety six average I mean average days a year of sun uh and be able to control your ability to control your your ... your utility bill\nSo I mean you know it this is not rocket science\nNo it's it's a no brainer back when I was working for Paul we got a P has to do what's called a deliberative poll oh and I learned about that from a guy named Ron layer\nWho was the chair of the Colorado commission and basically it cost about eight hundred thousand if I remember right and so it\nTo a PS took a sampling of people I think it might have been about two hundred people or something and they paid them because it was took place over a couple of days the atomic Phoenix and said hotel I Believe in the bottom line was they ask people a bunch of questions about energy and electricity do you like solar do you like cold blah blah blah\nThen they spent a few days educating people about that and the numbers were astounding yes they were staggering as all these people who said yes we think cold okay once they learned about it you\nKnow they want it clean energy and even back then Lucy that I forget exactly what the number was but it was jaw dropping yeah and to mentioned something a little bit further that you talked about\nThe deregulation ballot initiative in in Nevada\nIt won by Seventy two percent they were outspent some huge unbelievable amount tend to want a hundred to one and the reason was because the corporations in Nevada\nSwitch a data center MGM a bunch of hotels they want to clean energy so they went to the commission and they said we want clean energy and the commission any till they said well okay but you have to pay an exit fee one of them was eighty three million I remember [laughter] and so basically\nThey did about industry to deregulate and when you look at states like Arizona Nevada Colorado I Would say any state\nThat has lots of really low cost wind and low cost solar and that is Arizona Nevada New Mexico Utah Colorado\nTheir their ... their their prime for that why not all the people who want the free market Gary peers commissioner carry pierce is now under indictment you know in in ... in trial for bribery and fraud\nUm you know they talked about the free market all the time that's happened free markets\nHas a free market [noise] you know I I Love this uh we have obviously got to have you back Nancy\nUh there is so much more to talk about ... and ... and it includes pole and where we're going it includes the four corners area that is a New Mexico but supplies electricity to Arizona and it includes all of the utilities and the rates and\nThe market that wants to have solar desperately wants to have solar but right now we're in an election season where there are initiatives and there are\nConcerns and the utilities are fighting hard and yes they should be available to do that and I have the ability to do that but it's time to\nRecognize the technology that's there for the market Nancy thank you so much for joining us folks thank you for joining us here on Arizona energy crossroads I Am Lucy Mason saying come join us again next week by by [noise]\nArizona energy across races produces a public service my problem with communication in partnership with public radio and the result of community radio [noise]\nI'm drawing a Saturday or Sunday on Iran [noise]\n[noise]\nOh this is the butter heroes from radio

associate justice of the Supreme Court tennis confirmation process has energized Republican voters\nAhead of the mid term elections and the rights of the club for growth is here with the real story the United nations is out with yet another alarmist climate report very ... and run Bailey of reason magazine explore possible policy responses to the report on the hard fought battle\nOver the confirmation of justice Brett Kavanaugh marked a new low in public discourse\nFrank Ryan us MC retired has an American radio journal commentary [noise]\nI'm Alone in Henry and welcome to American radio journal\nThe economic good news continued with release of September ... unemployment statistics which found the nation's unemployment rate at its lowest level since the Nineteen sixties here do story through the numbers is John Tammany John ... is director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks\nJohn welcome back to American radio journal John the unemployment numbers are out for the month of September and once again it would appear that the economy has yielded a love number of unemployed the lowest perhaps in decades so tell us a little bit about that\nIt's got to be remembered that economies are just people and people naturally grow their naturally trying to better their situation the only way they can't is if a natural barriers are putting their place usually have the tax regulatory trade tariffs and an unstable money variety and so I think it's a fairly\nStrong signal that while President Trump isn't perfect in terms of economic policy in particular on the trade front overall his policies have been rather benign and to some degree pro growth and would that people\nIn the economy just naturally migrated to better and better jobs and more and more people have come off the sidelines to get to work and so it's very positive sign\nIn terms of the growing economy and job opportunities are we seeing this just in certain groups of people or is this extending across all economic classes and all demographics classes\nEverything that I've read has so far indicated that this is a very deep economic rally as it's hitting people of at all levels of the economic spectrum from from the high end of earnings too low you're hearing about a\nSmaller businesses and or a service businesses that are really struggling to find good workers right now just given given the high demand for them so it sounds like it's as is always the case a growing economy to generally lifts all boats and we're seeing that happen right here\nIn terms of the job openings and what appears to be a growing lack of qualified employees is this a factor that could possibly hold this economic expansion down going forward the fact there aren't enough qualified workers out there now for the jobs available\nI don't think so and and my example is myself I come from I guess you'd call generation X. people who graduated in the late eighties throughout the nineties most of us\nDidn't grow up with Internet or anything related to the Internet\nAnd this includes people with pre existing conditions making sure that they get health insurance now of course the GOP is villain eyes saying oh they want to keep sick people sick but the truth is is that pre existing conditions\nDoes come with a cost when you ask voters if\nPeople should be covered per for pre existing conditions they overwhelmingly say yes but then when you complete that sentence and you say well do you support people being covered for pre existing conditions\nIf you knew that everybody else has to pay higher premiums to pay for that coverage than support collapses now that's a difficult message for Republicans to communicate in thirty second TV ads versus Democrats who can\nEasily create a message in thirty seconds saying that Republicans are evil for not wanting\nPeople with pre existing conditions to be covered by insurance now Republican solutions to this there are several and they are very good ideas at\nGetting people covered with insurance who have pre existing conditions but the ... the Democrat version is through just mere government\nGovernment through Obamacare will mandate\nThat insurance cover the insurance companies cover pre existing conditions there is no other way for premiums to stay low if you if the government forces that mandate it forces premiums to go high which is why you see that happening with Obamacare\nEndear off at the club for growth and Andy a couple of words about the club\nYou bet the club for growth as a membership organization out of Washington DC but we have over a quarter of a million members from all across the country from all walks of life from all fifty states in the union if your listeners are interested they can go to our website uh WWW dot club for growth dot org and if they like what they see they can join for free\nAndy Ross at the club for growth Andy again thank you for being here things around me alone with the United nations continues to beat the climate change drama and has come up with yet another report designed to back up its political views\nHere to take a look out the report and what the us responds might be our Eric Boehm and run Bailey of reason magazine\nEarlier this week the United nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change issue day news special report and report that the un secretary general has described as an ear splitting wake up call to the world the concerns that we are running out of time the report has\nA set off another media frenzy surrounding global warming and climate change mostly focused on just how bad things could get and how quickly\nBut what is under covered is exactly what's in the report the proposals that range from the unlikely to the economically devastating ... with reason magazine\nThanks for joining us on this edition of American radio journal my guest today is Ron Bailey he's a friend of the show and I had him on several times before he's also a colleague of mine he's the science correspondent for reason magazine and he spent the last several days digging through this new report\nAnd he has a piece of reason dot com right now you can check it out how big of a deal is an extra degree of global warming so we will asking that question and some other received today Ron thanks for taking some time and being here on the show\nThough I Would agree with you again\nAlways glad to have you here on of course and I also mentioned that you are the author of the book the end of doom\nEnvironmental renewal and the twenty first century and that is appropriate or not just to plug your book here on the show but that's appropriate because there's a lot of doom and gloom surrounding this new un report this new climate report that looks at just how quickly we are we're going to hit and surpass that\nSupposedly crucial one point five degrees Celsius threshold so tell us a little bit about what's in this un report\nWell the new report is called global warming of one point five degrees centigrade and it was actually part of the process from the Paris Agreement that climate change where the PCs have the governmental panel on climate change\nWas invited or instructed to come up with scenarios of what would it be like or what would it take to keep the cleric from warming by one point five degrees centigrade above create industrial levels of temperatures\nAnd this report has just come out and basically it says that is it has to be a crash program it sparked upon now crossing\nAt least forty five trillion dollars between now and twenty thirty five were basically transform the economy from using fossil fuels to almost everything but when the solar power with energy efficiency on top of it otherwise all kinds of dire horrible consequences will follow what\nShould we make Ron of this one point five degrees Celsius threshold how significant is that number is is that actually\nA real tipping point for is that something that I give us some kind of latched onto to use as a as more of a political trigger here how seriously we take that number and and what sort of things have to be done even just theoretically to to avoid surpassing that threshold\nWhat changes as any of the agreement under the Paris\nClimate accord is basically the world should try to avoid going above ... degrees centigrade this is the most or the county and thresholds much power I guess a little bit of background the planet has warmed by about quite nine degrees Celsius but then the record since the late Nineteen centuries\nAnd so they basically trying to say we only has one six degrees Celsius on average temperatures could roll Irish temperatures to go up before we reached this threat hole at one point five degrees Celsius what they need in order to do that but they calculate is is that we'd have to cut off your own use five twenty\nThirty twenty thirty forty five percent and be completely weaned off of all fossil fuels oil coal and natural gas by twenty Christie that is a huge transformation and do something or he's has has rations every second place in our entire history of the world\nThey didn't try to come up with some pathways as they call us and how you might achieve that and their their takeaway message is is that initially you'd have to start spending two point four million dollars per year or two twenty thirty\nGet close to the way that there is a background last year the international Energy Agency\nRecorded that for all energy investment for for years twenty six thing I'm not at one point seven trillion and that was just barely three three hundred billion in renewable so what they're calling for is essentially scale you have extended his arm and new rules by ten power for revenge\nAnd and look if if we could stop using a dirty fossil fuels tomorrow with with no negative consequences it All right if we could just shut them off and replace them all with green energy tomorrow I think everybody would be fine with that I don't think anybody is really committed to fossil fuels as I as a concept right\nBut the reality is that there are serious economic consequences to making this transition because fossil fuel or are cheaper and more plentiful than most of the alternatives that we have we're talking with Ron Bailey he's the science correspondent for\nReason magazine and the author of the book the end of doom environmental renewal and the twenty first century around just about a minute or so left here but let's I I I'm just curious for your thoughts on\nLet's assume that that manmade global warming is actually a real thing what is the proper way to combat it in your mind\nA slow gradual weaning away from fossil fuels over time there are ways of doing it and there are a lot that pathway and but the basic things to do with the figure out how to invest\nIn research and development would come up with a new energy sources that are in fact paper but one of the interesting things I found is that\nThere is a terrible thing and it's just like now that could hurt looking for their goals are and that is clear power and they basically dismiss it\nAnd I find that very puzzling because we know that there are we to say that like the rule and yet they just go rally for complicated perfectly when I got to think about that we get Martin on to do is dot around ... or so from a panel and and rent generation\nWindmills what you wanted to create or the outcome will do that so\nYeah of course out compete them without having to spend lots of subsidies and tax credits and all of that on those uh those other forms we are unfortunately were not there yet Ron Bailey from reason magazine thanks so much for taking some time to be near today\nThe rise again\nAnd again that is Ron bail he's the science correspondent for reason magazine you can check out his latest piece for us at ... dot com how big of a deal is an extra half of degree of global warming find
