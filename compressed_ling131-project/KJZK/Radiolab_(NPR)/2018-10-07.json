Arizona energy solar energy [noise] Arizona solar energy Industries Association and this is Arizona energy crossroads where we talk about the policies economic and technology and the twenty first century energy marketplace\nToday we're going to be visiting with commissioner Justin Olson who is also a candidate\nFor election to the Arizona Arizona corporation commission commissioner Olson thank you so much for joining us today\nWell thank you so much for having me Lucy it's a pleasure to be here you know this is just a really interesting time for you I'm sure [laughter] with it it certainly is this campaign and and\nYou're already a commissioner but you are trying to get reelected\nUh to that position\nI'm now let's talk about this let's talk about your background and then at at at some point after we hear about you and you know just tell us about who you are and your family and your education and how you got to know you were a legislator so\nLet's talk about your background and then we'll go into that legislature and the appointment that by the governor to see\nX. yeah absolutely well thank you for having me and think for the opportunity to share with your listeners a little bit about myself\nI'm you know I'm a native of Arizona I got deep roots here in in our community great love for our state and and certainly want to see a a bright and prosperous future for the great state of Arizona\nI'm born and raised in Arizona and I'm raising my family here and my wife and I are are the parents of of nine children and I'm very honored to\nBe able to raise a wonderful young children I look forward to the wonderful things that I I Hope they might be able to do and and their lifetimes\nBut um you know as far as my background that are prepared me for service and the corporation commission it varies between my professional experience by legislative experience I can mention as well as some of my education I got to\nAn education a public school education here in Arizona I went to\nPublic schools uh for high school\nI graduated from the issue and I got my MBA and finance I from the w._b. carry school of business at at ASU which was a a high quality education I value\nA significantly as preparing me well for service both in the private sector and in the public sector at the legislature and at the corporation commission you know a little bit of a doubt my private sector experience I mean I work as a tax manager and the private sector of I've done that for\nFor many years and that experience has been very um effective it helping me to understand exactly how the policies are enacted a legislature as well as in Congress affect the businesses and the real world and I feel like that's helped to keep me keep me grounded in in the real economy to see what\nTo solar energy and and so that's what I'm very excited about is the fact that\nThe solar energy production has now become cost competitive with our traditional energy generation sources right so that's something that's that's a very very exciting and now the next step the next phase of the next generation of progress\nI look forward to is the the reduction and the cost of storage because what we've arrived at now\nAct that solar energy is the least cost approach of generating electricity while the sun is shining unfortunately the sun is shining a lot of days in Arizona\nBut there are times of the year when clouds might covered those solar panels and then certainly want to sort of fades are beyond the horizon than you do not to have that opportunity to generate that solar electricity and and folks still have a means for energy even after the sun has gone down and so\nAs the cost of storage falls then the ability for solar to provide that energy even after the sun has gone down or when the clouds are covering the panels becomes more cost competitive as well so I I expect that\nThe amount of solar energy in our energy portfolio will continue to grow as we continue to see these technological breakthroughs in energy storage and that will lead to a a a significant benefit for repairs and for the environment and for folks that work in these industries as well\nYou know and speaking for the solar industry I can just tell you that that\nUh all of us are wanting to find ways to be able to work with the utilities um\nIt just it's just not going to be a singular ... you know utility in a district is going to be a serving electricity energy in the future and um and so that is going to be people that want to be independent um you know I'm One\nUm I'll just confess I'm an independent from a from the utility a or maybe work in conjunction with the utility and the grid but the the the advancements that are being made so quickly is going to\nEnd the technologies are going to be highly affecting your job at the corporation commission and I'm as a candidate um uh you know I'm just wondering how your your your focusing on that\n[noise] you know that's a great great question I you know I I think that the the fact that these technologies have been disruptive technologies is is certainly an important factor and\nThat's part of the debate that serve as we as we develop a storage technologies that their cost competitive with traditional energy generation methods\nThen that is going to change the way that the the grid operates and so that is an important question that's before the commission our we've got to ensure that\nThat the direction that our energy portfolio goes\nIs one that makes sense with the technology that is available so that we can have both sustainable energy and also sustainable rates for the rate payers though a lot of this will be led by where the technology goes mhm\n[noise] I I completely agree and I'm I'm concerned right now about the rights that they had been going up\nFrom the utilities um\nI Will tell you that I'm In the next segment I really look forward to your response on on the initiatives that are out there in this campaign right now so that folks let's take a break right now I Am Lucy Mason here on Arizona energy cross roads and we're visiting with commissioner Justin Olson we will be right back

appreciate your staying\nTalking to the corporation commission or just an old than I Am Lucy Mason here on Arizona energy crossroads I'm Still commissioner how do you feel about um your job as and and your responsibilities at the corporation commission and how that's going\nYou know I I've I feel that these responsibilities and a half of the corporation commission are are vitally important and it's been a real honor to serve\nArizona's on the commission you know when governor do see a point in me to the commission just eight months ago as very honored by what he said when he said that you know the number one priority that he hasn't feeling this vacancy is to ensure that he feels the vacancy\nWith someone who will serve with the highest standards of ethics and integrity and that's been my my number one priority and my service at the commission\nIn addition to that I've also to strive to ensure that the policies that we adopted the commission or policies that will protect the rate payer and also ensure that we have reliable unsafe public services\nAnd I was very honored to lead the effort to require utilities to reduce their rates\nIn response to the tax reform that Congress passed in DC just last year\nAs a result of that tax reform our utilities are paying a significantly lower amount of corporate income taxes and so as a tax manager and a private sector I start quickly recognize that this is an opportunity for those utilities to reduce their rates\nAnd pass that savings on to the rate payers as a result of these efforts on a lot of the commission rate payers are paying a hundred and sixty five million dollars last annually and that amount will continue to grow into the future something I'm very excited\nAbout that is exciting um and and that is an important thing I think uh most news media folks don't pick up a so I'm really glad that you're able to talk about that here\nIn uh at tax reduction that turns into a reduced rate from the utilities is extremely important you're talking about rate reduction I'm sure with all the utilities right now now\nThe corporation commission is a little bit different in its structure just if you could just take a minute and talk about what you can do a there's a lot of rules a lot of rules within the corporate income and where if you're in a docket where you're discussing assert re case um\nWhat happens to the public\nUh how how does that were just really quickly if you could uh Justin\nYeah it's a great question because we are caused by judicial body we are subject to some restrictions recount pre charge at case when you to wait until all of the facts have been presented to us in a hearing an open meeting and then at that time that the commission is ready to rules and we make a determination on what the facts\nLead us to to rule and feel that time that the commission rules we are limited in what we can say specifically regarding cases that are pending before the commission not any different than a judge would be limited in his ability to speak openly about an opinion on a case that's pending before\nThe court I Know as a as a a lobbyist right now I'm for the Arizona solar energy Industries Association I Know that there are things that I Would like to talk to commissioners about and I cannot because you're in an open docket and so that goes for consumers to write\nTo to a large extent now we're we're limited and the substantive conversation is that we can have regarding issues\nThat are pending before the commission and I think that's just to protect the integrity of the ultimate ruling that the commission will provide and to ensure that the commission or does not have to recuse himself or herself or for having prejudged the\nCase you know and I think it's important to have the time to be able to work with staff that's completely politically neutral to find out the facts\nAnd be able to present them to you and for you to ask the questions the appropriate question so staff as they investigate these ... these cases so I just wanted to make sure that our listeners understood that I'm All right well and are remaining time there's a couple of\nAnd also to uh exclude China and the only way China could have actually joined west to agree to concession on I. P. protection and\nOn a state owned enterprises a lot of the things that we claim we want to see from China\nOr the president was true from TTP and advance threatened if we drove from NAFTA and so here we are today\nSo we have this new NAFTA new trade agreement and there was a perception at least that the old NAFTA was unfair to the United states of course the president made this a big part of his campaign and twenty sixteen so bottom line here ... is this an improvement on the old NAFTA\nThey're small improvements for sure I mean this is a deal that was over twenty year old\nSo it it happened before the rise of e commerce and things like this it needed modernization some of a deal some of this they'll ... says and that's a good thing I mean there are some as I said the uh the slight opening up the dairy market for Canada\nWhat it does is that it increases the threshold for sale and stuff through the Internet for individuals for it to be a duty free it used to be very very low and so that's that's a good thing but that balance like that that bag of that side as it is probably worse than that good things are getting better get\nA base find ways not the mascot pre President Trump I knew they tried that for you have to look at\nNow realistically we were in a world where there was a potential otherwise stressful withdraw from NAFTA was a potential of the difficulty to find a resolution that extreme chaos and uncertainty and that on the uncertainties that left dead yeah we can't meant\nThat fact that they're the ... and making things a little worse but\nAt the end their reality whether it be Ghost Ship all different industries but it's great to rock the boat for their worst and now we can hope for\nAt least a more peaceful environment\nWhile at the very least another items checked off of the to do list that we have been talking with ... who is a senior research fellow with the Mercator center that at George Mason university and burning tell us a little bit about the Mercator center also where folks and go to read your writings on this and other subjects\nThe American Center for market research center based at George Mason university and were non part is that and we do economic stuff like we started with regular I had a long time ago and\nWe are at ... or you can read all my stuff there but I I the creators colon I'm syndicated creators I I like at the corner\nAnd I also write a column for a reason magazine and sometimes I write for the New York times\nVeronique the root of the Mercator center Veronique thanks as always for being here thank you for having me\nAt the offices of the club for growth in Washington DC Andy Roth is keeping an eye on US Senate races in key congressional races all across the country and we're going to take an update one month before election as to where things stand Andy good\nTo have you here thanks ...\nLet's talk first about the U.S Senate it's been it's been an interesting couple of weeks for the Senate Republicans have a little bit of an advantage by virtue of the map you might want to just give us a bit of an overview on that and then we can talk about how things are going in the individual states\nYou're right the Republicans do have an advantage right off the bat thoroughly defending eight seats or nine seats rather and the Democrats are defending twenty six so just right off the bat there that are in good shape plus at least ten Democrat ... seats that are up for reelection\nTrump won and some of them Trump won big time like West Virginia and North Dakota\nSo the Republicans are definitely in the driver's seat now there's a lot of money involved and there's a lot of spending involved and there's a lot of good candidates that were recruited involved so it is making the situation a little bit more difficult for Republicans\nThey have a fifty one forty nine advantage in the Senate which is very slim the best guess right now is that perhaps they'll pick up one or two seats but I could easily see them picking up more than that or\nHaving the ... election be a complete wash where nobody wins or loses net seats and I could even see Democrats picking up a net one or two seats so it's getting married\nSo a month out nothing is settled and the situation's going to remain volatile right up until election day let's talk first of all in the in terms of all these democratic seats that are up\nWhich states are finding that their incumbent democratic US Senators are the most vulnerable and perhaps subject to losing to a Republican challenger\nI think first and foremost a you have to look at North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp is the Democrat there she's trying to portray herself as a moderate but it's just not working and as I mentioned before the Trump won there by\nDouble digits I don't even know what the number is but it's it's large it's north of uh twenty points maybe even thirty it's quickly becoming non competitive now\nWith thirty days things could change but that's\nLooking tougher and tougher for Democrats to pick it up\nThere is that the prediction markets where you can bet on who's going to win that race and those numbers are very insightful just as much as a whole numbers are\nAnd uh right now the prediction markets are giving Heidi Heitkamp ... twenty six percent chance of winning that district so I I think she's done barring any major changes\nAfter that I think you can see Claire McCaskill in Missouri losing I think you could see Joe Donnelly in Indiana losing and maybe a couple of others so right off the bat you're you're down about three seats if you're lucky\nRepublicans have to defend a few seats themselves namely Arizona where Jeff Flake is retiring Ted Cruz in Texas who is facing ... basically the the number one celebrity candidate that Democrats have this year and then Marsha Blackburn and Dean Heller in Tennessee in Nevada respect to\nRespectfully each if the elections were held the day I think that Ted Cruz would win the Democrat has a lot of bad news coming out recently about a DUI\nAbout making some derogatory comments about women\nIn a few other things so I think crews could most likely win plus it's taxes so I think he's got a bill to advantage in Tennessee I think a Marsha Blackburn should survive that re she's the Republican but in Arizona and Nevada\nI think it's very possible that that the Republicans could lose so they lose those two seats but they pick up a two or three seats with Heitkamp McCaskill maybe Donnelly and maybe one or two others then you're looking at what I mentioned before which is probably about a plus one plus two pickup for Republicans\nWhat about Joe mansion and also the race in Florida is getting quite competitive is not\nYeah with mansion right after the GOP primary Patrick Morsi was declared winner there the polls quickly tightened but mansion his proved himself to be a very squishy when it comes to defining his ideological mornings so he's portraying himself as an independent\nHe says he's not necessarily friends with Trump but that that they talk and that that doesn't always agree with them but sometimes he does he get he gives all of this politician speak a rhetoric\nThat for now has passed the vide a lot of voters the prediction market that I mentioned earlier they have mansion winning was seven Seventy five percent chance of winning and the polls are kind of reflecting that as well so I I think he's\nRight now if the election were held today I think he'd win but you do have thirty days left and let me mention also that Trump is going to be spending a lot of time on the road going to these various states and campaigning for the Republican so things are things are definitely heating up they're ... they're not certainly cooling down\nLet's talk just very briefly about the United States House of representatives obviously we can't get into all the different races that are going on but just from the the mile high view of it Democrats need to pick up what about twenty three twenty four seats is one of the markets and the prediction markets saying about that\nYou're right I think it is twenty three seats and\nIt's clearly going in the Democrats' direction I think that right now the the prediction markets show that the Democrats have about sixty five sixty eight percent chance of of controlling the house the question though is by what margin because just I ... and all the different races\nIt could be that they pick up like twenty five or twenty six seats so then you're only talking about two or three seed advantage which is nothing\nIn the house because you're going to have a lot of Democrats from very conservative districts\nWho might not be inclined to follow polo see and the liberal San Francisco agenda that their spouse and so if they do have a majority with a that slum of a margin they may not be able to get\nTo do anything with their agenda which would be remarkable and let me also mention the Kavanaugh saying that Kavanaugh's nomination has sparked some enthusiasm among Republican voters now it's unclear", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Kingman",
