blame gardening in mountain is different than what they can tip tricks garden sharp guaranteed to make your garden more beautiful than ever now for better advice that mark ... year has Mandalay\nAndme welcome to this week's edition of the mountain gardeners this is your host Ken Lane here talking about the landscapes of northern Arizona and we are into probably the best planting season\nOf the entire year everyone wants to plant in spring and and that's a good time you got a lot of choices and spring but it's the hardest time for the mountains is high elevation\nOr were you when it's dry heat prevailing southwest when I Do my gosh new tender new growth heavy clay soil you're almost better off waiting until the monsoons hit\nA in July sometime because then you've got the humidity up that prevailing southwest wind is done yes you get some hail and some others stormy things that happened with the monsoon pattern possibly not every time\nA but but at least the humidity it's just it's easier on the plant plants have leased out by then and they've hardened off the tender new leaf is more sensitive than a heart and stick and\nA more mature leaf of summer and then fall this is one plants absurd to hibernate all plants start to hibernate some start to bloom so you're seeing snap dragons\nThey love the fall they start celebrating by blooming pansies kale snap a mom's a ... a year perennials our echinacea is uh\nAre what is that ... burning Bush and I am are maples and they're just there's this season for fall where some plants just go well look the cooler dates I Love the bright days and they prefer to be planted\nNow this is when this is the only time you'll find certain plants at the garden center so right now we're unloading but this is all garden centers all all the higher elevations actually probably all garden centers\nWhere shipping plants now through the end of October is our goal especially if the colder climates we need to predict what the winter inventory needs to be how much a world where we sell through winter and so we bring all of that plant in\nAll the all the um perennials shrubs trees we bring him in now so that we can harden those things off acclimate\nThem to our cycle of going cold and so they go through the winter months and they are now you can take it in January and December and February which which we do plant year round I mean we have\nOur planting crews are putting plants in the ground every month of the year landscapers come in there planting twelve months out of the year\nAs long as the ground is not frozen we're planting but you need a plant\nThat has been acclimated or used to our climate if it's used to that freeze thaw cycle single planet right in your yard be perfectly fine and so you're seeing this buildup of inventory right now at your local garden center where whether it's Kingman\nTo pine top to pay send to Sedona camp Verde or Prescott\nWe're all kind of building up our image tore and as you're going to front load a lot of it with your evergreen stuff because it looks so good even in winter and this is when ... most people most ever Granger planted\nNow through march that that's when that's his peak window and so we're building that we're having more than ... you've got more choices as a consumer\nWhen you had your local garden center and an ... shop forever grains let's say it's a big spruce are you on a big a maple whatever it is you're you're you've got more choices now and they're larger sized\nSo we're trying to bring in uh for for us as the water's Kurds and or in Prescott, Arizona this is just us\nUm we are looking for big evergreens that are in containers that are easier to move around easy to bring into your house and decorate and then take out of your house and planting the landscape for\nLiving Christmas trees man that's a that's a tradition many we sell more living trees than we do cut trees in the month of December because we've planned out we've we've got enough to get through and we showed them off and quite honestly I'd rather have people planted treaty then\nCut one down and use it throw it away I think that could be that might be considered wasteful and its way better than a plastic thing you got from China\n... leaders Arizona Cyprus juniper as a ... I mean you can go down the list a lot of things you're not used to 'cause we're warmer you've got more options to play with you can grow everything you grew in the mid west\nAnd a whole lot more you can plant them now and then you'll just have to remember starting November about you'll be watering about twice a twice a month is how how often your water just spot check the hose out water give it a deep joke and you're done\nIf you don't do that we can get very dry years where there's not enough moisture to keep the plants happy will get a real cold cycle and we get what's called a winter burner winter kill the tops of the plants will be lost because ... there's not enough moisture in those in the structure of those plants to keep them\n... the anti freeze moving up and down the structure that plant just by spot treating spot watering a couple of times a month that takes all that pressure off and so you'll get root grow from now through the end of the year that's that's the benefit that's why you're plant in in the mid west or here\nUh you get some route growth and then you also get a second set of rules growth next spring ... after that flush your gross so you get a stronger plant before next summer and so you get more growth of bigger plant just better it yes to answer your question yes I'm ... I'm Sorry\nFor good but I you know I I Know a lot of people don't think about winter watering enter into a central and I know it's like beating a dead horse because we talk about it all the time yeah but I get customers all the time going what happened only half my ... I'm On my ... you know\nYeah they they forget to winter water 'cause they turn the irrigation off in November\nAnd then they haven't been watered all winter they turn it back on in April and then they over water like compensate will catch up now there is no catching up with plants when you when you don't water your puppy dog\nFor all winter and it falls over dead you can't give it water now to revive it it just it's too late you need these are living breathing things you want to there's a fine line there but just real sporadic doesn't take a lot just takes every couple of weeks pick a nice day you want some fresh air go\nWas a lot of the plants right up definitely okay\nAnd so Susan was planting moms and other perennials and her raised bed yeah she sounds some white fat roaming looking things\nNow can you put it like that where every day [laughter] that's great that's perfect actually yeah you've got grubs\nThey're highly active right now so grubs are high up in the soil and they're\nFeeding and they're trying to fatten up\nBefore they hibernate they'll go down real deep in the soil and so they live off of roots of plants and so this is extremely serious I mean I Can't put that enough\nYou have an issue and those fats will will definitely suffer will be stressed and could easily die if not corrected so if you're digging around the soil and you see some white worms those are grabs a most of our issues in the mountains of Arizona because it's so dry\nAre are the insects for where the moisture is where the moisture in the soil or it's in the trunk of the trees it's in the structure of the plants the bugs are in the plants us while we have such problems the bark beetle Flathead bore it's all in the trunks of trees and then grubs in the ground\nAnd so it's really the killing we've got a grub killers called\nKiller on this that's what's just sprinkle it on like a fertilizer water than whites them out an application will take you through you know next spring so once they're done kind of thing so yeah they're very important I Would do not just those few moms you just planted I Would do that entire bed\nAnd I might even test they test all just to look for other areas because it's such a problem here they they attack plans by the hundreds so yeah serious grub killer ... grubs\nAnd even go in your containers ... was it last year we were had this beautiful um [noise]\n... not ... yeah the Oprah and it was just started looking ugly and I'm like well the problem with that thing and went to the kind of look at it and touched it and it fell out of the pot rude neuro roots yeah so it can happen anywhere pots raised beds trees shreds it's something to\nKeep their a Beagle larva so the Beatles ... black beetles up flower roam around they're laying eggs and things and so the exit hatched now\nAnd now they're actively grow and these are this year's grubs you're seeing and so they'll tripled in size before next spring though a so they'll they'll eat actively through mid December\nThen they'll go real deep as the ground gets cold the hibernate down there and then they'll come back up and eat your spring roots and then your plants blow over in the when you wonder what happens to your who grow\nSaid sorts looking terrible you pull up no roots left grass will get big brown spots and um those are all grub issues and need to be dealt with it serious grip killer be right back with ... and the mountain gardeners\nListening to the mountains are nervous Ken Lay on her and water very center in France get cancer and then we bring it can be found at water garden Centre located Eighteen Fifteen times brings rather impressive\nAnd we believe shopping nursery destination not\nWaters garden center now some things that I did personally in my own personal gardens at my house now here's the garden center at the house\nIs right before that storm hit last week\nUh I fertilized everything in the landscape this is truly the most important feeding of the entire year now you can do it any time of the month of October\nI was just simply taking advantage of the rain that was coming so I get that food on the ground and then in the ground to me is actually the rain would would dissolve ... wash it into the ground the plants can start to pick that up it'll do two things if you do it earlier in October rather\nThan waiting till things are truly dormant\nMaybe you do it now you can actually change the ph of the soil if you're using the right food now\nI'll go into that in a bit ah how far a deep through I Want to go with this\nUh what what I Do is I put my own food it's it's got cotton seed meal and some sulfur and you you're putting that on the ground now\nWould that sold for ... will actually lower the ph of the soil you're changing not just fertilizing the plants you're changing the ph the structure of the chemistry of the soil around the plants so it makes it more acidic\nWhat that does for you that brings the color out it there'll be intense or orange intense or purple more intense reds showing up by ... earlier rather than later some of your your your red maples they aren't read it all your red ash it's not\nIt's not purple or read at all your your your your yellow\nAnd that's all because the ph ph creeps up to a certain level that the colors lost your fragrance\nAre some things like roses us and we were fluff your cup flower things ... ... your mom's don't have the same your panties want the same fragrances that they're ... they're noted for it if your uh lied lax\nHaven't bloomed the last couple of years the only reason that is is because they are fertilizer starving and so when a plant can't it doesn't have enough food to access\nIt will negate the flowers are just go I Can't spend any energy on the flowers I just have to keep my full of july's cause I'm worried about starving to death and so that's that's indication you need to fertilize and for those bring blooming plants\nYou really need to fertilize now in the fall it's using that food to form that bud through winter to show off next spring that's why it's so important\nSo if you did this is we're we're we have very heavy clay soils very alkaline water and not much top soils you this is the super important this is more important here in the mountains of Arizona than probably\nAny place else in the country\nAnd it has to do because of our clay soil the other has has to do with our monsoon rains pick up what little bit of tops all we have and it flush it washes it or\nOr has it float downstream and so you'll see these beautiful like against Kirkland creek or ... you'll see these beautiful big washes with thick topsoil because all the mountains there soils actually washed down into these\nFilthy or ... or basins so especially the rich tops you get no soil\nYou know soil equals no food no food equals no flowers into fertilized more often so you'll find in the mountains of Arizona you're going to have to fertilize I say at least three times a year evergreens for Easter if you'd say thinking holidays this is one where you probably do want to\nPull over if you tuned in and you're driving down the road get now's the time pulled over\nBought that pen and paper I get that cell phone app notes here we got him a fertilize three times a year most of my landscape evergreens for and here are the holidays that I use as markers Easter is my\nIs my spring feeding fourth of July independence day is my summer feeding because it's right before the the rains hit that point and then Halloween\nDefinitely yes so ah they ornamental pair would you turn that into the big tree list or we have our lady to\nSay it's a shade tree but it's a thirty thirty five foot tree and compared to a hundred foot uh uh ponderosa\nRedwood a cotton wood uh willow nah not to that site switched to step down from that but it's a good for most yard especially the new homes it's like the perfect sized tree that backyard dean some shade and the patio or the ornamental pairs they're perfect\nAnd they are the nice thing about them is that white spring blossoms yeah nice green leaves and they're one of the last ones to actually turn color um in that fall season so you're getting your your leans kind of stay on a little bit longer you get a longer season from them\nI Would say that for all the fruit trees may ornamental or regular fruiting trees so you're starting to see what the cherries and things some some color on him the crab apples have some that Warren G read and write a those are all great choices the bread for pair ornamental pairs Cleveland I'm rich ...\nThere's a lot of different ornamental pairs they don't form pairs they formed there just flowers without the fruit tickets spring flowers but around\nHaven't even started showing color you may be another month they'll start showing some color and their stunning rich red meat deep fire engine like I Want the lights on fire engine red that's the color of that tree\nYeah very pretty and if you're medium country they would say the re wood ash is absolutely gorgeous there's flame maples too for a small trees lots of color trees come in and check them out\nAnd it's time to plant trees so go for it so the fall color starting to show up and come in and pick up the leaves off the ground there for either in color so here waters garden center be right back with more on the mountain gardeners\nYou've been listening to the mountains are nervous Ken my honor of water to garden center in France getting isn't it during the week Frank can be found at water garden\nCentre located Eighteen Fifteen nine springs road ... and we believe you would never\nA drink that water starts center\nAll right let's just see if I can share go deeper into this tree thing leads to his onto 'em\nWhat kinds of trees can you grow your what what the school from small to medium to large and I'll focused mainly on the leafy thanks so much fruit trees that fruit trees I'll just mentioned that real quick yes we grow exceptional fruits\nWe don't grow any citrus or avocados that's more or less southern Cal desert kind of thing but here we do grow exceptional apples pairs harvest has been tremendous Egypt oh my gosh cherries cherries gross\n... of the mountains here is are they really do well um I Would say apricot nectar Marines actually will grow in your backyard and there are so fruitful only takes one tree and you're done\nUh plums oh my gosh look best plums you ever tasted coming out of your own backyard this this is your time to plant those\nAnd so those are your fruits that you can grow what you're looking for those kinds of trees are killing hours you want a minimum absolute bottom line minimum you want six hundred to six hundred and fifty chilling hours on that Tagalog she tell you\nA late bloomer how late blooming it's going to be what we want is a lot of chilling hours so that's what that is with fruit trees is needs um\nAny so many nights a cold before it triggers it's bloom and so a desert variety might have two hundred the chilling hours it needs some cold but not very much so it's blooming by February January up and even at the higher elevations appearances got enough chilling hours to bloom\nThat's more for the desert so low altitude a kind of stuff here we want a minimum apples I'm looking for apples that need at least nine hundred thousand eleven hundred killing our so they're not going to bloom until the end of April\nMay before they start waking up so I get them out of that risk to frostbite then we're hitting our our last prostate usually and noble and like you can get a a apricot the biggest mistake ever anyone ever makes planting in the mountains so planting apricot ... desert variety\nAnd so they're blooming and February oh my gosh first of march will our last prostate sure in Prescott his Mother's Day that's the first week of may you get two months\nOf exposure to possible frost so what's likely to get in a an apricot a desert variety apricot virtually none the tree is not affected at all it's the fruit when does it blooms set fruit and if that flower or fruit gets it gets frozen it dies then the fruit falls off\nThe tree doesn't die but the fruit will shrivel up and fall off\nSo you want we've got a children heart cots tilt an apricot they had eight hundred chilling hours they're getting you out there getting real close to that last frost date so you have\nMuch more consistent fruiting and that type of apricot that the point being I don't I don't want to go any deeper than that\nDo your homework know who you're buying it from what variety and how many chilling hours it needs and minimum are six six hundred and fifty hours even that slow I Would say seven eight hundred is what I Would do for my own self\nI wouldn't go any lower than that but you'll find all kinds of stuff in the mountains you just find all kinds of this desert influence coming at you know a lot of folks plant the wrong variety of fruit tree especially if you're shopping at the big boxes they're bringing the the ... percent that every one of my stores and all of Arizona\nSo from no gala to Flagstaff and pine up everything in between you've got the same variety of desert fruit tree it doesn't grow anyway get embarrassed by what I see other folks selling their garden centers\nFor here fruit trees so if you're talking about smaller trees in general just ornamental trees not fruit trees ornamental\nOr you've got red buds we're famous for red buds a western red bud grows wild eastern red ... thinks it grows wild here they just do really well crab apples are have the show ... all of the fruiting spring trees\nA you've got right now is a service Barry or or what is that what's a botanical on that anyway there's a wild cherry a choked teary kind of thing that grows wild here it doesn't form a cherry it's got a white flour and spring but it's beautiful orange and read the colors and the fall of the year\nDoes it's a smaller tree you'll see a tree just ruling wild\nA white out in the wild and that's usually that that that type of cherry a purple leaves plum of course is probably the most almost over done of all of the trees but a lot of folks come from green that country and I've never seen a purple tree you know I Want all ...\nNot ... I saw a little bit so good but a lot of it's a good one to enter mix from a design standpoint puts spots of purple with your greens and things and and it looks good\nI'd say the same thing with your purple birch uh you're purple cherries there's several trees a purple foliage on them there's even a purple red but of all things forest pansy read but\nVery interesting big heart shaped leaf but the foliage is purple\nSo that that's another small leap your medium sized trees I Would really we're getting into some definition but I always say ...\nYou you California folks you love gained goes they do really well here very long lived one of the most ancient of all trees we see ... in\nUh from millions of years ago you can you can have one of those in your backyard they're still growing today and stunning ah Aspen gold color they are just starting to show their fault color a very pretty leaf to it\nI Would I Would put in that same ... I'm a category ash from Arizona ash which is a native ... which I Can't tell the difference between the two ... Arizona\nI suspect command interchangeably\nBut it's a good and medium size hearty robust a tree that turns gold in the in the in the fall of the year\nVery pretty shape to them then the rate would ashes much larger than that gets up maybe thirty five forty feet tall they're really ancient commitment thirty ... mid thirties is kind of realistic for re would ask famous words purple\nSolid purple color and lollipop shaped head to it is real pretty\nFormal looking tree dance dance shade and the last one I put in that medium sized will be locusts golden locus or shape master locust\nIt's filtered son have smaller leave for those of you up on a on a hilltop\nAnd you just don't like raking leaves at all you know hard core mid western folks I moved to Arizona never to rank again I gave away my rake when I moved here and I'm not breaking again go with a locus\nIt's got a small leaf and it just blows away just I don't know where they go they just blow away and you know Rick where's the sycamore sleep you're going to rake every single one of those leaves up no matter where a soda and you're going to get those little balls like just fall down in the spring it's just it's kind of a\nIt's a big gigantic tree but not so\nWith with the other to the game goes the locus asked her ... smaller least easier to maintain a less less ... less trashy and great fall color your golden locus comes out in spring has gold", "show_name": "Brian Kilmeade & Friends", "year": "2018", "city": "Kingman", "day": "06"}
