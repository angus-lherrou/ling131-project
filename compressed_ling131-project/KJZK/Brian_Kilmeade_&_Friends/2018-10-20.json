current insurance guaranteed to make your garden more beautiful than ever now or fatter and by that markets lovely stuff in your house Mandalay\nWill come to this week's edition of the mountain gardener wow it has been a changing week this has been what happened to summer I went from summer to winter just like that so uh it it's been moist actually\nThe planting the digging this oil is easy to work with than ever the maples have turned the Asher beautiful purple you're starting to see all the fall color is showing up in the mountains of Arizona and this is also\nThe time that you want to plant those things if you if you're from\nThe desert the south where you just don't see a lot of that that northern or mid western fall color or the mountains of Arizona fall color and you want a beautiful new aspens or new maple or new Asher new\nUh this is the best season for planting does for choosing those because you've got a tremendous selection at the garden centers it's also a good time in that as the plants turn this magical fall color\nThey also start to read to the root for the next month or so so that that's really what you want plant and then have it start rooting right away if you're planting now though I mean this kind of weather we've had this week it doesn't always happen that way sometimes we'll get dry spells through winter\nIf we get a dry spell you need to supplement water that new planning that goes for anything that's been planted this year really so don't turn that system off next month for talking\nTo three or four or five weeks from now a year Lance Huber is going to go I've got to shut down the system and then expect plans to go for the next five months with no water you may have to drag the hose out what or by hand especially if you're going to plant that beautiful new\nColorado spruce or new Austrian pine or a new maple you'll want to a wider that to keep it healthy it's going to foreign those new routes hairs but then if that ground gets crusty and dry it just bone dry those new routes\nCan be shriveled up and so you'll lose that growth you would have it would have been such a benefit to have that additional six eight ten inches of a root grow this fall doubled down on that next spring and by next summer you've got a\nSuper hearty super healthy can take on the heat take the wind take the whatever summers got for us it'll take it 'cause you planted it in the fall this is a tremendous time to be planting we've also what you'll find is your garden centers are bumping up\nTheir their winter evergreen inventory 'cause we need to bring that him in ... now so we can acclimated and we're predicting how much image for when to sell to winter because once it really gets cold\nUm talk in the new year or so uh you know two thousand Nineteen ... your new year she does Nineteen\nYou can't start shipping plants into the mountains of Arizona then if they're truly dormant and just see us that is they've lost their leaves and you're bringing those are okay but if you're bringing more\nNamed dino are heavily bamboo or or red leaf a folk Kenya or silver Barry Eli Agnes could Tony as these broad leaf evergreens iffy\nAnd from a warmer climate into your market into your say flags set for White Mountains or prosecutor cottonwood wherever you're bringing those plants in and they go into this deep cold they're just not used to that yet you they're not acclimated\nSo we're trying to predict the computers tell us okay again you're going to sell three hundred and ... to ... between now and February fifteenth order that many were bringing them in now so that we can acclimate\nThem and that way the landscapers homeowners that are new to the area they can come in and still plant be confident that that plant is used to our climate used to our\nCold temperatures warm temperatures and they can planted with confidence so you'll see a a an increase\nIn the varieties and choices of evergreens at your nurseries right now it's a great time to plant also you'll see some big like this week I got some really big uh Colorado spruce pines these these big Christmas tree looking\nYou know central leaders whooping branches kind of plants detours theaters a red woods you know there's a there's a variety of sequoia that will actually grow\nIn the mountains Arizona we've got those in now\nAnd bigger sizes and you wouldn't be able to find other seasons in spring or summer of next year it's a good time the negative\nIf they're big they're heavy I mean it's ridiculous some of the soil I Can't believe or they're building houses right now it's crazy a fact I just had to put a Seventy pound\nJack hammer\nThe painting truck the thirty five pound or which is the normal cute see you know to just ... pop straight through a clay soils and things it wasn't hacking at the guys were begging for a bigger hammer\n... go for it get get the bigger the bigger impact hammer to a head on it to get to get the spades that really knocks out the clay soils ex away at the chipped away at that rock get it out of there\nIf you're having a big tree delivered to your house consider having your gardener your plants or your nursery plant it for you they'll have the tools hopefully\nThey're going to have the tools on the truck they're going to have the right to the ... the rate they know what size whole so with a big let's say it's a thirty five gallon a thirty five gallon spruce tree that thing is probably thirty inches wide the recall\nAnd about Eighteen Inches deep\nSo when you're planting that you'll want that whole debate about the same depth as the bucket about Eighteen twenty inch your ears testing the soil underneath to see if you think that soil will drain the or not so if you've dug enough holes in the mountains of Arizona you kind of get a feel you just know oh man at\nJackhammers bans bouncing off the bottom of that all the same never drain you were digging a big bath tub here if\nThat's a case will take the Jack hammer and try to fracture that soil underneath so we break it up so the water will start seeping into the next\nA bird feeders and we do for saucers underneath pots for their Glazer high fired their way less expensive and they'll silicone or they'll just set it on top of\nThat base that they had and windows the frost is all over they'll go back and swap it out and put their decorative base for in their growing next year I write\nMy next question is from my key pot I'm One of the southern ... million is the ultimate magnolia this year put it in a large pot his question is should he pulled it closer to his house under the overhang to protect it in the wintertime or keep it out where it in and I think you\nKeep it out where it is now what will happen is if you pulled that any of that border line stuff or if you just want it to be looking really good all the time doing I think about damage if you poll plants next year house it's amazing how much heat your house throws off especially the south side eastside\nAny any sunny side of your house is going to be more just reflect some heat and it retains at ... releases a at night if we go sub zero which we are not predicting this year\nBut you never know never believe the weatherman that's all they know if we go really really cold single digits zero degrees yeah pull it next to the house most years like we've got two of them they're planted in the in the ground but they're right there by the house we don't really think about um they're fine they always winter over there very old\nI think I think his would be equally as tough\nThe thing to watch your container since this is a container so I was like container questions\nMakes sure if you're gardening through winter that you water those plants if you get a a cold snap\nLet's say it's January and the weather is going to oh my God I was just going to be a big storm is going to be a cold wind people run to the grocery stores and they ended the shells and they go and they hunker down and they hibernate for a week or the storm passes or if you see that kind of event\nMakes sure that your watering your plants before the colds comes a hydrated plant will go\nI met her how cold 'cause it's got it's got it's moist so the antifreeze within the structure of that plant can move back and forth if it's a dry plans kind of counterintuitive\nIf it's dry you would think oh it'll stay warmer wetter ... it'll start shivering if it's wet no plans don't shiver only we do\nYou do hear you keep the that that moisture in that plant especially container plans because they dry out a little faster they drained a faster it's easy to grow and um because of all those factors but the you just want to make sure you moist and those those plants up so they can take that cold\nUm if you put them up against the house it takes a little pressure off but I on all of magnolias evergreen beautiful southern magnolia that takes the cold it takes the cold don't worry about it just keep it hydrated whiz that we're out of time we'll be right back with more on the mountain gardeners with cannot Lisa Lane\nListening to the mountains aren't nearly Ken Lay on her and brought her garden center in France get into that camp during the week bringing modern garden Centre located Eighteen Fifteen nine springs in Prescott [noise] and voters believe\nJohn precincts security come through\nNo fault is the absolute\nMost important feeding of the entire year this is if you're only going to feed once your landscape you should be doing it more than that but if you're only going to do it one time and then let the let the landscape starve the rest of the year this is the one you do not want to miss that I'd go over the different kinds of fertilizers\nAnd I'd start with fertilizer steak so is that some of the competitors are making the rounds making sure we're in the marketplace competitive some going out there's lots of fertilizer stakes these hard ... spikes that you couldn't drive into the ground and they're supposed to last year\n... don't use those stop selling those Twenty years ago and here's why\nIn the mountains of Arizona worry very alkaline water and and rocky soil that\nThat fertilizer steak will actually stay there for a year or more of this so it's it's a slow to release the problem is where are the main routes on your plants it's almost impossible to find out\nAnd so if you had a lot of top soil and that that bubble around that fertilizer steak were to permeate and seep and in a week away and and and actually fertilize a larger area of volume of soil it would be okay\nBut first of all they're expensive because of the number that you need to drive around a larger tree is just it's just difficult one doesn't do it you're going to need ten around a big Arizona cypress are big spruce or big maple need any more uh and then where do you play some\nYou'd be better off crushing that thing up\nAnd sprinkling that underneath the canopy or the drip line of that\nThat tree or that shrub then you would drive it in the ground because at least then to that granular that your ground up would would slowly permeate breakdown go to the soil the plant will pick it up and you've got the entire ah that tire radius or underneath that drip line fertilized properly\nThat's called a synthetic fertilizers these are\nChemical based up petroleum based typically Kim a fertilizers Scots and to me or does these these brand names or Arizona or several of them that are chemically base there they're they're made from petroleum your sprinkle those things around basically\nThey release when water had some go underground and then for life to plant that would be better than a bike 'cause at least you know where it's going to go the negative\nThey released too fast so within a month all that fertilizers pretty much been released with the reins gone into the soil and sometimes it's in a form to plant can receive sometimes it's not so ammonium ... sulfate is better in the summer ammonium nitrate are better than\nThe winter so sometimes plants can pick up a\nBoy I didn't want to go this deep into fertilizers but basically it's temperature related when it's cool\nThe plants can pick up certain kinds of food and they can't their summer foods so it's kind of like a burgers and dogs that's for a fourth of July weekend but I ain't gonna have that outside the yard when it's a you know twenty degrees out I've got to have steak potatoes or chicken soup\nAnd so really that's the benefit of an organic fertilizer or all natural so we make of it made it fertilizer years and years ago ... huge following go all purpose plant food\nNot a very original name but it's seven for for all natural the main ingredients are cutting seat meal which lowers the ph at the nitrogen source bird guano it is ... it's got kind of er nurse he smells Palo ties as easy as spread but smells are the because of those cuts the meal and\nThe the bird guano sulfur iron some other stuff so that's the scene greedy it as those organics breakdown they break down much slower over a very long period of time typically about\nThree months so it's not releasing all the food at once and so the plant can pick up more of that food than let's say an organic would just release all at once is picking up parts of it the rest of it is flushed away and gone\nThat's a synthetic an organic the plants can pick up virtually all of the fertilizer\nAnd use it so you get less waste ... longer a feeding than you would a synthetic I highly recommend using organic organic granular fertilizers for most of your plants out in the landscape is kind of like\nIt's like an antibiotic I mean it's going to make the plant hearty healthy it's like chicken soup for the soul that's what an organic fertilizer is set in the in the fall of the year if you've not done that I cannot emphasize\nThis enough the benefits for the mountains and it's because\nYou folks in the mid west you poor folks\nFrom the mid west you just don't you eight foot of topsoil you no longer have\nWe've got eight millimeters if any\nTopsoil and your landscape and then we we put this fabric over top of the soil and then we put rock on it to make sure no organics ever get down into the soil again you're going to have to fertilize more often up in the mountains of Arizona just because our soils we just don't have a lot of top soil\nSo you need that's where the nutrients are held you have to fertilize it more often so I suggest to three times a year minimum four times if you if you have a lot of evergreens\nUh it'd be Easter did you think holidays Easter fourth of July and Halloween that's when you fertilized New Years for lots of color was Bruce ... pines and then uh\nI Would say for your your native evergreens they would greatly benefit from fertilizing with an all purpose plant food and anything that stressed also give it soil activate or this is like a this is truly the antibiotic for for plants things that are stressed by\nOf scale on your opinion pines bark beetle on your ponderosa's they're greatly going to benefit from the food and the ... better way deeper on that subject and I wanted for one segment but hey now you're an expert be right back\nUp and listening to the mountains are nervous Ken my honor I'm waters garden center in France get isn't it can during the week Frank can be found at water garden\nCentre located eight and ... springs road impressed [noise] [noise]\nWe believe these are in danger we can save the\nWater's garden and we are back on the mounting gardeners your host can land I this is one of the beauties of having a garden center here in northern Arizona is especially in Prescott we kept the most interesting people that live here and they come in they shopped plants and you get to talk and tell them and you go well\nThat's a great story we have to capture that on air and so I've got two gentlemen a John Murphy and Daniel Blake who are\nLocals they're here to one of us that got this great garden vision great garden projects going and I thought you would take an interest in that as well so welcome John welcome Daniel glad you're here in the studio thanks for having us I guess so so now this is the make one hundred healthy foundation now that caught my year\nIn a in a time when you're jalapeno peppers are coming out of Mexico with ... all over 'em and then you put them into Safeway or fries or costs wherever and they can kill you and this happens two or three times a year\nThis is becoming a problem the Mac massive agriculture your goal is bringing local are absolutely we want people to bring back the art of\nBackyard gardening mogul gardening and why it's so important to get your nutrition from food that you can control it strikes really not just a luxury anymore and the whole idea of backyard gardening\nWas a big thing back in World War two victory gardens were patriotic duty Bush went away and now we have forty percent obesity so or make one hundred healthy foundation mission\nIs to help fellow Americans grow one million organic vegetable gardens over the next five years and we're kicking off right here in ... lakes Prescott right here I was one of us\nAre there many of these things don't have usually that's New York city or Chicago or supplies so now you've also got so so they make one hundred healthy foundation has got this goal but then you partnered up with Daniel Blake which is an old friend we've been going back decades I Know I Know he's a gardener\nAnd I know Daniel you have traveled the world helping people farm better smarter wrote me a third world countries that's been your passion now you're back home and your partner with John you're going to share that expertise with is how does that partnership work\nWell can uh when I got the opportunity to leave the country was always because there was a great need there were children that were sick and they needed to have better food so I had an opportunity to go down and teach now I Want to do it here local so that's perfect so now you're just set up\nAnd then you're going to bring expertise that'd be like you even smarter than I Am as far as gardening or you can make things he could make that microphone you start to put it in the dirt you're going to help folks here and help us to start growing our own foods here\nHere locally that's right what do you do that and gardener backyard garden yeah so how what give us tease me what what's what's something that maybe we can do in our own backyards a lister\nOver ... king men are flat could use right now\nIt would maybe make their game their guard game a little better well can I get a closer to the soil and I started digging the soil with a digging fork and I start adding organic matter to it and gypsum and other minerals to make it alive so what kind of organic struck horse manure\nUse chicken coop used gypsum or fertilizer or what ... what do you dig in would that fork and what happens when you hit a Boulder\nI dig around that movie [laughter]\nI was just hearing earlier or the ... with the audience we just bought a Seventy pound hammer for the for the planting truck because the rocks are becoming their like growing or the where people are building are on rock piles more and more seems like there's less soil there it's hard to grow things throughout the soil\nWhile I Would add gypsum is important because uh all the nutrients piggyback onto the gypsum and to the calcium to get into the plants they gotta have the calcium and that I write form of calcium for Arizona soils and then I add organic matter and then I started adding a nitrogen and phosphorus potassium\nAnd I work that soil get close to it I had an air to the soil\nSo is this square foot gardening or is this row gardening or how what would you prefer if you want to maximize I say I've got a back yard and I'm only going to have a hundred square feet of ten by ten area raised bed goes up by don't have any other soil elsewhere so I made it out of timbers or black or whatever how ... how would you\nWhat would be the formula to make that go\nFor um you know foreign well let's just saves him that would\nNot want to use the native soil 'cause that's not good stuff\nIs all that is true some of it isn't very good but then some of it is different parts of Prescott have clay and most people don't like to dig and clay clay holds your nutrient veteran hold your water longer truth so I got to do there is admired panic matter to it and that kind of makes it sweet and healthy\nGotcha and what's your favorite plant to grow what's the most uh see your third world country you're helping where have you helped grow or help third world community is\nEat better Mexico believes a nurse in Africa gotcha well okay so to countenance [laughter] that's pretty good and growing pardon the pun now you go into third this this is not there were there were third world but\nYou're here in America helping us growth smarter that's right what was the main crops that they like to grow their\nSo rice and beans or or what are they mainly doing they grew every vegetable you can imagine that ... ... of gotcha\nOkay not just tomatoes yeah whole or I was thinking peppers or something like that there's a spicy pepper that I Love and Mexico so good [laughter] so we've got an event foundation coming up yet Daniels going to share some of these tidbits of of\nWhat do we need to to to do\nTo grow better ... tell us about the foundation and you've got some events coming up in November and October your ... your first garden up at all happening started really happening\nAnd and just to touch on the way Daniel and I got together\nI had this big vision to help bring backyard gardens get people healthier and then I met this guy the gardener of destiny and so it's like a you know higher power thing so how this has evolved is we do have our events on veterans' day\nOr it's November twelfth at five thirty PM at the club at Prescott lakes it's our first kickoff victory garden kick off as a gala event Daniels the keynote we have Dr Steven Brown who lives in Prescott lakes who talks about why you should get your nutrition from foods rather than supplements\nAnd I'll be talking about longevity I'm known as your make one hundred healthy

is to grow one million\nOrganic victory gardens across the country and we're going to bring backyard gardens that we're going to teach the next generation of ah gardeners how to be able to plant and grow their own foods\nIs is great for an evening event at Prescott lakes yes if you don't live in ... lakes it's all ... says it leaks and I'll be there that's perfect we're also on a so they now you're going to go\nThe sound of that has a bike eating right or not supplements such right by the right eat clue less healthy or you go then you've got to entertainment and what was the third guy there was another for\nDr Steven Brand much he's a renowned orthopedic surgeon he wrote a book called complex medicine simple wisdom\nAnd he'd have people come and want to have knee replacement hip
