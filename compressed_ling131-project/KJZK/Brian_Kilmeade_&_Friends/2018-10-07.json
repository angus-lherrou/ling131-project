beautiful than have now are fatter and by that mark thoughtfully plugged in your house Mandalay [noise]\nEnd welcome to this week's edition of the mountain gardeners this is your host Ken Lane here talking about the landscapes of northern Arizona and we are into probably the best planting season\nOf the entire year everyone wants to plant in spring and and that's a good time you got a lot of choices and spring but it's the hardest time for the mountains is high elevation\nOr were you when it's dry the prevailing southwest window my gosh new tender new growth heavy clay soil you're almost better off\nWaiting until the monsoons hit a in July sometime because then you've got the humidity up that prevailing southwest wind is done yes you get some hail and some others stormy things that happened with the monsoon pattern possibly not every time\nA but but at least the humidity it's just it's easier on the plants the plants have leaf doubt by then and they've hardened off the tender new leaf is more sensitive than a heart and you know thick and\nA more mature relief of summer and then fall this is when plants absurd to hibernate 'em all plants started hibernate some start to bloom so you're seeing snap dragons\nThey love the fall they start celebrating by blooming pansies kale a snap\nA mom's a ... a year perennials our echinacea is\nA a ... year shrubs are\nWhat is that ... burning Bush and the ... and they're just there's this season for fall where some plants just go look up the cooler dates I Love the bright days and they prefer to be planted\nNow this is when this is the only time you'll find certain plant that the garden center so right now we're unloading but this is all garden centers all all the higher elevations actually probably all the garden centers\nWe're shipping plants now through the end of October is our goal especially if the colder climates we need to predict what the winter inventory needs to be how much a world where we sell through winter and so we bring all of that plant in\nAll the all the um perennials shrubs trees are we bringing now so that we can harden those things off acclimate\nThem to our cycle of going cold and so they go through the winter months\nAnd they are now you can take it in January and December and February which which we do play it year round I mean we have our planting crews are putting plants in the ground every month of the year landscapers come in there planting twelve months out of the year\nAs long as the ground is not frozen we're planting but you need a plant that has been acclimated or used to our climate if it's used to that freeze thaw cycle NGO planet right in your yard be perfectly fine\nAnd so you're seeing this buildup of inventory right now at your local garden center where whether it's Kingman to pine top to pace in Sedona camp Verde or Prescott we're all kind of building up\nAnd if you're going to front load a lot of it with your evergreen stuff because it looks so good even in winter and this is when people ... most people most ever Granger planted\nNow through march that that's when that's his peak window and so we're building that we're having more inventory with you've got more choices as a consumer when you have your local garden center\nAnd an ... shop forever grains let's say it's a big spruce are you on a big a maple whatever it is you're you're you've got more choices now and they're larger sized\nSo we're trying to bring in uh for for us as the water's guards that are in Prescott, Arizona this is just us\nAh we are looking for big evergreens that are in containers that are easier to move around easy to bring into your house and decorate and then take out of your house and plants and the landscape for\nLiving Christmas trees man so that's a tradition many we sell more living trees than we do cut trees in the month of December because we've planned out we've we've got enough to get through and we showed them off and quite honestly I'd rather have people plant a tree then cut one down use it throw it away\nI think that could be that might be considered wasteful and its way better than a plastic thing you got from China\nSo it's just kind of I've we we've that's our niche in the marketplace and so we\nWe grow and we purchase and we ship in the month of October to accommodate that why do they even get on that track I lose track you see how I Am anyway you're seeing this fall mixture of plants that your garden center\nThe crate Myrtle ... we're not going to order another one of those until next summer a rows of Sharon is not going to be ordered again until\nNext summer you better grab if you want to summer blooming thing they're starting to show some color now so they go there get that typically either orange or yellow kind of Aspen gold color if you want those if you want a blooming Russian sage view on a\nCell via Greg yeah autumn stage you better grab it now because it won't be at your local garden center here in ... with ... and other three four or five weeks\nSo then the evergreens will come into their will come into their place so could Tony ... named dean is and that kinda stuff so we'd been busy I mean my back\nKind of hurt [noise] from unloading hold the trucks but it's exciting to see the new materials coming in so it's kind of fun so and that's unique to a little bit more temperate climate you folks from the Midwest the east coast\nYou're you're kind of gone he's talking he's talking some foreign language to me it's Latin I have no idea what he's even saying because we've never planted before in the winter\nWhile you're not you're in you're in a warmer climate\nBecause it's so nice here year round I mean in January a week after major blizzard it's all melted off and his feeling good and you're outside you're taking a hike with in a in a in two layers you know and a vast you're not in the park you don't need those anymore uh for for if you're a garden center odor\nYeah they were ... they forget to winter water 'cause they turn the irrigation off in November and then\nThey haven't been watered all winter they turn it back on and April and then they over water like compensate all will catch up now there is no catching up with plants when you when you don't water your puppy dog for all winter\nAnd it falls over dead you can't give it water now to revive it it just just to let you need these are living breathing things you want to there's a fine line there but just real sporadic doesn't take a lot just takes every couple of weeks pick a nice day you want some fresh air go ... ... ... ... those auto plants up definitely\nOkay and so since then was planting moms and other perennials and her raised bed yeah she says some white fat roaming looking things\nThat you put it white that were me day [laughter] that's great that's perfect actually now you've got grubs they're highly active right now so grubs are high up in the soil and they are\nFeeding and they're trying to fatten up\nBefore they hibernate they'll go down real deep in the soil and so they live off of roots of plants and so this is extremely serious I mean I Can't put that enough\nYou have an issue and those fats will will definitely suffer will be stressed and could easily die if not corrected so if you're digging around the soil and you see some white worms those are grabs a most of our issues in the mountains of Arizona because it's so dry\nAre are the insects for where the moisture is with the moisture in the soil or it's in the trunk of the trees it's in the structure of the plants the bugs are in the plants us where we have such problems the bark beetle fled had ... in the trunks of trees and then grubs in the ground\nAnd so it's really to kill and we've got a grub killers called grub killer that's what's just sprinkle it on like a fertilizer water it in wipes them out an application will take you through\nYou know next spring so once done kind of thing so yeah they're very important I Would do not just those few moms you just planted I Would do that entire bed\nAnd I might even test they test\nOther areas because it's such a problem here they they attack plants by the hundreds so yes serious grub killer kills grubs\nAnd even go in your containers I remember yeah was it last year we were had this beautiful\nUm [noise] ... not ... yeah the Oprah and it was just started looking ugly and I'm like well the problem with that thing and went to the kind of look at it and touched it and it fell out of the pot rude neuro\nRoots yeah so it can happen anywhere pots raised beds trees shreds it was something\nTo keep their ... beetle larvae ah so the Beatles who's black beetles up flower roam around they're laying eggs and things and so the exit hatched now\nAnd now they're actively grow and these are this year's grubs you're seeing and so they'll tripled in size before next spring though so they'll they'll eat actively through mid December\nAnd they'll go real deep as the ground gets cold the hibernate down there and then they'll come back up and eat your spring roots\nAnd then your plants blow over in the when you wonder what happens to your who grow the said sorts looking terrible you pull up no roots left grass will get big brown spots and um those are all grub issues and need to be dealt with a serious grip killer be right back with ... and the mountain gardeners\nYou've been listening to the mountains are nervous can mind ... center in France getting into this camp during the week before he can be found at water garden\nCentre located eight and ... springs rather than ... and we believe and then\nNow some things that I did personally in my own personal gardens at my house not hear the garden center at the house\nIs right before that storm hit last week\nUh I I fertilized everything in the landscape this is truly the most important feeding of the entire year now you can do it any time of the month of October I Would just simply taking advantage of the rain that was coming so I get that food on the ground and then in the ground to me is actually the rain would would\nDissolve submitted wash it into the ground the plants can start to pick that up it'll do two things if you do it earlier in October rather than waiting till things are truly dorm it if you do it now you can actually change the ph of the soil if you're using the right food now\nI'll go into that in a bit ah how far are deeply I Want to go with this\nUh what what I Do is I put my own food it's it's got caught and seed meal and some sulfur and you're putting that on the ground now\nWould that sold for ... it will actually lower the ph of the soil you're changing not just fertilizing the plants you're changing the ph the structure of the chemistry of the soil around the plants so it makes it more acidic what that\nDoes for you that brings the color out it there'll be intense or orange intense or purple more intense reds showing up by ... earlier rather than later some of your your your red maples they aren't read at all your red ash it's not\nIt's not purple or read at all your your your your yellow and that's all because\nThe ph ph creeps up to a certain level the colors lost your fragrance what will disappear on some things like roses assume you're fluff your cup flower things ... ...\nYour mom's don't have the same you're paying these want the same fragrances that they're ... they're noted for it if your a lie lax\nHaven't bloomed the last couple of years the only reason that is is because they are fertilizer starving and so when a plant can't he doesn't have enough food to access\nIt will negate the flowers and just go I Can't spend any energy on the flowers I just have to keep my full of July of cause I'm worried about starving to death and so that's that's indication you need to fertilize and for those bring blooming plants\nYou really need to fertilize now in the fall it's using that food to form that bud through winter to show off next spring that's why it's so important\nSo if you did this as we we're we have very heavy clay soils very alkaline water and not much top soils you this is a super important this is more important here in the mountains of Arizona than probably\nAny place else in the country\nAnd it has to do because of our clay soil the other has has to do with our monsoon rains pick up what little bit of tops all we have and it flush it washes it or\nOr has it float downstream and so you'll see these beautiful like against Kirkland creek or ... you'll see these beautiful big washes with sick topsoil because all the mountains there soils actually washing down into these\n... or ... or basins so especially the rich tops you get no soil you know\nFood equals no flowers he'd fertilized more often so you'll find in the mountains of Arizona you're going to have to fertilize I say at least three times a year evergreens for Easter if you'd say thinking holidays this is one where you probably do want to pull over if you tuned in and you're driving down the road ... now's the time pulled over\nBought that pen and paper I get that cell phone app notes here we come uh fertilize three times a year most of my landscape evergreens for and here are the holidays that I use as markers Easter is my\nIs my spring feeding fourth of July independence day is my summer feeding 'cause it's right before the the rains hit that point and then Halloween\nOctober sometime in October you need to fertilize the landscapes especially for the sprinklers and my evergreens fertilize at the new year and so that keeps them green and lush and dark so they don't fade and get this winter closest that happens and so I encourage you and the and the most important of all\nOf those for feeding fall\nFall absolutely is without doubt\nThe number one this one you don't want to mess all those different kinds of foods a school for cover that I got a minute and a half year let's see if I can go deep how deep I can go [noise]\nI like organic foods I'm an organic guy we're an organic shots are our plants are organic our\nOur vegetables or non GMO our trees are all organic me everything is that's a big thing and the reason I Do that is that yes my customers like it\nBut mainly think it would have gardens in her own or after a lifetime of just spraying chemicals around and deal with chemicals what's the odds of you get into the into life without cancer about the rough\nAnd I'm going to have melanoma and stuff but I don't want internal stuff just because I was selling round up and metal by on and die as a non and all these other nasty things a lot of them off the market anymore I tried to organic\nAnd I find my customers appreciate that as well or at least their dogs do and they're birds do so we ... we got to organic fertilizer\nSo we spread that out it breaks down slower over the next three months the plants will absorb more and more of this food it changes the ph or lowers because we make it for us the mountains it actually has a lot of soul for and that lowers that ph changing the chemistry of the plankton take up more of that fertilizer\nBut this time of year the point being fertilize I took advantage of the rain but if you didn't just get it on there you don't have to work it in just get it on and Mother Nature will send us more moisture that will do all that work for you be right back\nAnd it's time to plant trees so go for it so the fall color starting to show up and come in and pick up the leaves off the ground there free there in color so here waters garden center be right back with more on the mountain gardeners\nListening to the mountains are nervous Ken Lay on her I'm watered garden center in France get into that camp during the week Frank can be found at water\nGarden Centre located eight and ... springs rather than ... and\nWe believe you're very she'd be\nAll right let's just see if I can share go deeper into this tree thing we was on to 'em what kinds of trees can you grow your what what let's go from small\nTo medium to large and I'll focused mainly on the leafy things not so much fruit trees are fruit trees I'll just mention that real quick yes we grow exceptional fruits we don't grow any citrus\nOr avocados that's more of the southern Cal desert kind of thing but here we do grow exceptional apples pairs harvest has been tremendous Egypt oh my gosh cherries cherries grows do well with the higher elevations of the mountains ears are they really do well\nUm I Would say apricot nectar Marines actually will grow in your backyard\nAnd there are so fruitful only takes one tree and you're done\nUh plums oh my gosh the best plums you've ever tasted coming out of your own backyard this this is your time to plant those\nAnd so those are your fruits that you can grow what you're looking for those kinds of trees are chilling hours you want a minimum absolute bottom line minimum you want six hundred to six hundred and fifty chilling hours on that Tagalog she tell you\nA late bloomer how late blooming it's going to be what we want is a lot of chilling hours so that what that is with fruit trees is needs um\nAny so many nights a cold before it triggers it's bloom and so a desert variety might have\nTwo hundred the chilling hours it needs some cold but not very much so it's blooming by February January up and even at the higher elevations up here at this got enough chilling hours to bloom that's more for the desert so low altitude a kind of stuff here we want a minimum apples\nI'm looking for apples that need at least\nNine hundred thousand eleven hundred chilling hours so they're not going to bloom until\nThe end of April May before they start waking up so I get them out of that risk to frostbite then we're hitting our our last frost date usually and noble and like you can get a a paper cuts the biggest mistake ever anyone ever makes planting in the mountains\nSo planting apricot ... desert variety and so they're blooming and fed\nFirst of march will our last frost state you're in Prescott his Mother's Day that's the first week of may you get two months\nOf exposure to possible frost so what's likely to get in a an apricot a desert variety apricot virtually nothing the tree is not affected at all it's the fruit when does it blooms set fruit and if that flower or fruit gets it gets frozen it dies ... the fruit falls off\nThe tree doesn't die but at the fruit will shrivel up and fall off so you want we've got a Chilton heart cots tilt an apricot they had eight hundred chilling hours they're getting you out there getting real close to that last frost date so you have\nMuch more consistent fruiting on that\nType of apricot that the point being I don't I don't want to go any deeper than that do your homework know who you're buying it from what variety and how many chilling hours it needs a minimum are six six hundred and fifty hours even that slow I Would say seven eight hundred is what I Would do for my own self\nI wouldn't go any lower than that but you'll find all kinds of stuff in the mountains you just find all kinds of this desert influence coming at just do a lot of folks plant the wrong variety of fruit tree especially if you're shopping at the big boxes they're bringing the the ... fifty every one of my stores and all of Arizona\nSo from no gal us to Flagstaff a pint of everything in between you've got the same variety of desert fruit tree that doesn't grow anyway get embarrassed by what I see other folks selling if their garden centers\nFor here fruit trees so if you're talking about smaller trees in general just ornamental trees ... fruit trees ornamental Z\nOr you've got red buds we're famous for red buds a western red bud grows wild eastern red breads thinks that grows wild here they just do really well crab apples are have the show ... all of the fruiting spring trees\nA you've got right now is a service very or or what is that what's a botanical on that he where there's a wild cherry a choked teary kind of thing that grows wild here it doesn't permit ... white flour and spring but it's beautiful orange and read the colors and the fall of the year\nDoes it's a smaller tree you'll see a tree just really wild a white out in the wild and that's usually that that that type of jury a purple leaves plum of course is probably the most almost over done to all of the trees but a lot of folks come from green that country and I've never seen a purple three go I Want all putting\nI saw a little bit is good but a lot of it it's a good one to enter mix from a design standpoints puts spots a purple with your greens and things and and it looks good\nI'd say the same thing with your purple birch uh you're purple cherries there's several trees a purple foliage on them there's even a purple red but of all things forest pansy read but\nVery interesting big heart shaped leaf but the foliage is purple\nSo that that's another small if you're a medium sized trees I Would really we're getting into some definition but I always say ...\nYou you California folks you love gained goes they do really well here very long lived one of the most ancient of all trees we see ... in the fall so record\nAre from millions of years ago you can you can have one of those in your backyard they're still growing today and stunning ah Aspen gold color they are just starting to show their fault color\nA very pretty leaf to it\nI Would I Would put in that same ... I'm a category Amish from Arizona ash which is a native to mid ... which I Can't tell the difference between the two ... Arizona\nI suspect command interchangeably\nBut it's a good medium sized hearty robust a tree that turns gold in the in the in the fall of the year very pretty shape to them then the re would ashes much larger than that gets up maybe thirty five\nForty feet tall they're really ancient commitment thirty ... mid thirties is kind of realistic\nFor re would ask is famous for its purple solid purple color and lollipop shaped head to it is real pretty formal looking tree dance dance shade and the last one I put in that medium size would be like a gold and locusts or shade master locust\nIt's filtered son have smaller leave for those of you up on a on a hilltop\nAnd you just don't like raking leaves at all you know hard core mid western folks I moved to Arizona never to rank again I gave away my rake when I moved here and I'm not breaking again go with a locust\nIt's got a small leaf and it just blows away just I don't know where they go they just blow away and you know breaking where's the sycamore sleep you're going to rake every single one of those leaves up no matter where a son and you're going to get those little balls like just fall down in the spring it's just it's kind of a ...\nTrey but not so with with the other the game goes the locus they asked her ... smaller least easier to maintain a less less ... less trashy and great fall color your golden locust comes out in spring as gold goes degree in the summer and then dropped off as gold and it blows away\nYou're really big trees these or I Want a shade tree I got some serious property I Want a big tree out here\nYou know those are going to be just mentioned sycamore that's a giant I wouldn't classify that as a fall colored tree they kind of go from green to brown and they don't they don't give up the leaves for a reason to drop a long time\nSo I I don't I wouldn't plant that one myself I sell them because there's such a popular treatment for myself I'd rather have a maple red maples he's a big thirty forty forty five foot trees classic maple leaf big red\nGorgeous red leaf and there are several varieties um Prescott blaze ... to ... I read a Acer a rubber him from the Midwest the classic Midwest rent it grows here as well and it takes our\nOur wind and our our clay soils does really well\nAnother one I Would say the PIN oak and red doped up piano grows wild up and groom creek the Bradshaw the men get so the the hilltop grows wild but it also growth lower elevations if you put her on a drip system very pretty classic maple leaf has he acorns so you're going to get some some acorns with that\nUh but that some people like that they're pretty to collect and add to poke breeze or whatever\nBut but oaks last they live forever I mean virtually mean hundreds and hundreds of years how they're going to live and they got that beautiful red fall color and then of course aspens\nAre eight paltry not very wide but very tall they go to the moon but grow only you know ten feet wide", "show_name": "Brian Kilmeade & Friends", "year": "2018", "city": "Kingman", "day": "07"}
