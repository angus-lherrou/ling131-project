gardening can lame gardening in the mountains is different this is Ken Ken ... guard insurance guaranteed to make your guard and more beautiful than have now are fatter and by that more closely in your house Mandalay\nAnd welcome you of tuned in to the mountain gardeners this is your host Ken Lay in doing this a lotta years together\nWe just share about uh the cycles what's going on in your landscape here in the mountains of Arizona and a lot of our current content the garden advice that we get at the higher elevations none of it's coming from here\nIt's beamed in through HGTV or east coast or mid west where most of the production of garden content comes from books written from there\nThat shows a radio that they're from over there of course that's where all the bodies are\nFrom Washington DC north to Boston to cook it over to to uh to to Chicago and all of a sudden you've got most of the countries people live there and if you're going to create a book you want to write for them not for\nThe how how many people live in northern Arizona\n... half million maybe and there's there's no one up here and so that's why we live here we get to be more secluded we can go into the forest and not have to bump into people\nSo we get some space we can breathe the elevation is just the air is cleaner brighter the pace is lower and that's why we love\nThe mountains of Arizona and so if we do get some garden content that's from Arizona it's usually from Phoenix or Tucson Tucson because our university agricultural school is you may go wild cats\nAnd all the bodies in all the students go to school ASU or or Phoenix metro area and so that's where the TV stations are and so you get these news outbreaks that to kind of a an IRS wants here's Republican senators prone your palm tree the second here palm tree in that and the content you know it's not for you\nIf you live up in the mountains\nSo we don't grow palm trees that we don't grow citrus up here we don't grow up ... we don't grow big fig trees we have some shrubs that are hard enough to grow here but not trees\nWhen we don't grow crate Myrtle trees we grow shrub is are there certain varieties that are hard year that that uh they can act more like a perennial if we do go sub zero really cold cold cold it'll never come back to the ground and they come back fresh every year\nFrom the ground like a perennial and so they never quite get up to ... and there's some over in the ... area there's some bigger ones over there so it's more but the southern folks they want I I don't want crab apples\nI don't want purple leaves plum I don't want flowering cherry trees I watch quite Myrtle trees\nAnd they just they just don't perform the cold depths them back\nIn the south you know Dallas uh east you can have beautiful but not not here and so we try to get that information out for that amount\nThe best advice I can give you right now\nIs don't give up on gardening it's still going to leave that irrigation on that even though we had a storm a couple of weeks ago\nYou still don't want to be watering them out once a week for ... plants these are things that have been on the ground for over a year a couple of years or so or more they've got a fully mature\nRoot structure if it's new you just planted it two three four six months ago this year\nAnd then you're probably watering that a couple times a week and I'm Talking trees and shrubs maybe binds the bigger rooted stuff ... if you're talking about pansies your your kale that new lettuce crop you just put in carrots ad that\nThat's a little different 'cause there's shallower rooted sea water mold more often but even now I'm I'm scaling back\nMy watering but I'm not turning it off and continue to nurture my plants this week I've given my some of my plants hair cut\nTheir just they've grown a lot they'd been happy they loved all the moisture been fertilizing well they're happy they're healthy that color is good they're almost too happy so I've got Eli Agnes up against the houses and under planting they're getting too big so I gave them a quick haircut none of full I didn't really you know lack of back in half\nI just the long run ... nip those off I hear a trim\nYou do most of your heavy pruning in the dead of winter you know January February march you wait till things are cold you don't want to prune too much here this is this is mainly for you desert folks tropical climate areas you folks from Hawaii\nA for from Cali California the the the southern Arizona folks you folks you want to hold off\nYou you are used to prone to roses back in November ... that's when we always do it don't do that here you'll blunder your way to failure\nIf you do that like keep that structure up on those plants as best you can cause that insulate the heart of that plant so if we go really cold and you never know with the mountains are going to deliver can be dry can be wet can be snowstorm after snowstorm could be\nWarm could be it just never know what it's going to be but you can't go wrong by leaving that structure intact so leave that alone then you're prone after the new year after the harshest in wait for a nice break day by\nBy Valentine's middle of February the weather's getting pretty nice at that point yeah we can have some frost yes we can get a snowstorm or two after that\nBut the weather's getting pretty nice you want to be outdoors at that point and that's when you want to start printing things 'cause you print or right before they start a elongated it started growing faster budding out\nUh so do late to printing now it was encroaching end of the walkway the patios a potato vines going crazy it just needed to be is crawling all over the patio and needs to be cut back and so we just trim a little bit I did fertilize before that storm I had a couple of weeks ago I fertilized everything\nWell here's another is is that rose question from Catherine in a kind of goes along with that whole ... says she has a bunch of roses that are showing significant powder emailed that question is do I treat it or just let it go because we're close to the end of this is\nOh no we're not close to the end of the season there's a lot of season left\nOur roses were in bud through December I mean you had red buds on their kid they weren't in bloom\nOr by ... through November they did so you got to every bit of a month to month and a half left so that what the powder emailed that you have can easily get\nCompletely out of control by the end of the year and\nThose disease things they like it cool nights right day so you're ... if it grew fast before wait till it cools down a little bit more of a grow even faster now you have to get on this\nAnd so I Would say spray it with the ... revitalize again leaf spot to stuff revitalize it's great it's a it's a hose and spray or how is it down and\nI Would do it more than once I Would do it to three times before the end of the year\nAnd then you're going to bring back roses in March that's when you're proven roses and the mountains you're going to clean up as much foliage as you can and against spray it again next spring after you're all done\nSpray it again with revitalizing and you'll probably come out next year with perfectly clean happy healthy roses but if left unchecked you'll have no due back on those things by April one\nOf the mill there will be you'll be fighting this thing all growing season next year so it definitely don't let it go come in and we can help you this is serious don't don't let it go it just 'cause you're tired of gardening [laughter] don't don't let the gardens go\nBecome even more burdensome next year because you didn't want to do something and he would be an experience of stuff into the expense of solution or ... yeah you're absolutely yeah\nOK next questions from Allen he had some ... and some argument grasses that he had the grounds for about three weeks the fear that I Am [noise] he had a dog around [laughter] I don't know if we heard this continue uh\nThey're kind of semi Doug them or to a\nKind of you know tamp them back in the ground whatever he wants to know what can you do or to maybe help them yeah so we\nMax he's he's been gone for a few years but when he was a puppy his ears are still flop and our ... we had a dog run which is huge had a patio coverage we parked our boat underneath there it had an orchard against the ... grapes were growing up by the time he got done\nTeasing [laughter] not one thing was left above one foot demean trees\nGrape vineyards nothing was left 'cause his teeth hurt so bad so dogs\nAt just how they are that's why we love them some time is or what to do right now put them back in the ground you did write you caught in the next day you're probably find the best thing you can do right now is we make a product called route and to grow its uh reading hormone\nLiquid you mix up in your water and Canada it basically it's route tone that white powder you dip cutting down and you you get them to root out\nOr we just liquefied it and so you pour this route and grow around that distress they are stressed\nIt help mitigate the stress helper to re route those broken roots and help with the full force new or a leaves coming out probably even before spring even before the end of of of this year arrived it probably have more roots and more leaves I'd give it route and grow\nEvery couple of weeks until you see it definitely stabilize it's happy we made it and I cut her off of all of that but that's ... grows your best defense\nUh right now for that kind of plant thanks so much folks will be right back with more can at least ... mountain gardeners\nListening to the mountains are nearly Ken my honor I'm waters garden center in ... during the week bringing modern garden Centre located Eighteen ... springs rather impressive [noise] and we believe\nYou're going to do with\nFresh ruined her waters garden center\nSo here's a little trick I learned down in ... I raised my family at least in I raise their kids in school valley little tiny ranch town fifty miles north of Prescott some between just before Kirkland\nThat area so it's it's in that area is beautiful ranch land we live right on Kirkland creek the kids could roam we are on ten acres surrounded by nothing but ranch we could see no one near our house and it was just concerning sometimes because kids would go you're going to wonder where they're at I've know I Wonder if they're safe I have no idea\nHow so but they always had max the German shepherd\nAnd Baja chocolate lab and wherever those kids went they were right there and so you always had confidence they were they would take to chase the cattle away or but then we had elk and we had deer stick lots of Wellstone had mountain lions and bears and everything else\nSo everything you could think of was there a pack rats or squirrels to rabbits to do everything was there and so I learned a few tricks and one I had the deer come in and they were peeling the bark off of\nMy walnut set a car pay people not to solve shared well not soon once you're seeing show up at the grocery store now all those nuts a great big wall but it was that we'd pecans and so the walnuts the the deer tick a fancy too and sometimes they'll do this to aspens sometimes I'll do this to any fruit tree\nEspecially apples and pears that's her favorite they'll go in and they'll rubbed their antlers on the bark and then they'll start peeling\nOff the bark underneath the bark certain trees taste very sweet and so after all the nutrients moisture and taste sweet taste underneath the bark this was very frustrating this woman that was quite large\nAnd I did not watch the dear to kill it or ... if they repeal off the bark too much\nWhat I did and this is not in any book you're not going to see this on any website this is just you and me talking over the airwaves and this one worked in my own backyard to keep the deer off\nI'm going how am I going to ... how am I going to do this what I did is is I took some burden heading ... following me with this some black\nPlastic burdening you know one inch squares you use it to cover fruit trees I had it it was right there when I Wonder if I loosely wrap this around the trunk and staple gun it to the bark\nAnd just let this this netting kind of float around this work where they were eating I Wonder if this would keep 'em off\nAnd boy did it ever work they didn't try to touch that thing once after I put that on there they just didn't know what to do this I didn't wrap it real tight I just loosely let it to three times around\nWhen around took virtually no netting staple gun ... what you think would hurt a tree but trees don't even feel that to their parents shaved off the rest\nAnd they never came back to that treat appeal the bark off I think that same exact technique could work for Apple's your aspens a willows or after ... woods there's certain things they really liked but if you've got deer\nAfter your trees trying to peel that bark off and don't let them do that because they can kill kill off that Trump\nI think it might even worked for porcupine since he seemed bark peeling off real low to the ground usually in the first foot or so there's a there's a porcupines that roam around\nOnly at night they're nocturnal they'll come and they'll just park sit right in front of a tree they love fruit trees and peel off the bark they'll do that to elves I've seen sometimes I'll get up and do the crotch the trio crawl the tree\nSit down on a main branch and just sit there and you'll see the bark peeled off right where this branches coming off\nIf you see that this is serious if the girl the tree they can actually kill it and so I think you do the same thing by ... ... ah just loosely very loosely wrapping that a ... bird netting around that probably ... probably any kind of netting would work just I didn't want it to be obvious\nI wanted it to blend in to the landscape so didn't look like oh what what do you do there what did you read the paper on his Trump what's going on and it looks funny the black\nYou hardly even see it doesn't even show up\nAnd so if you get a lot of peeling bark peeling off of that tree then you want to come in and talk to us we'll we'll show you how to clean it up cycle wound you want to clean it up\nYou can't really ... or so at ... or the staples into it but you can actually clean up the the the the wound spray it with some black printing paint and wrap it and that will basically help the trees you'll over keep the insects outta\nCuts are out of that one where the park was being peeled off we can help you that we can go deep with that because we see it so often\nAnd so that's that's something that happens I here's another little one I found I'm In my lawn I had little tiny cone shaped holes in the long ago what the heck is going on who is eating my lawn and so it was perfect little cones it'd be like a dozen of them\nOver this little section of the grass well what the heck is I've seen this in gardens so little tiny holes and almost looks like a\nI don't know how to describe it was just a cone shaped in the dirt\nAnd I found out that was skunk they were going after the grubs in my lawn and so they could smell that grow up they could they know where it is they take their little tiny paws\nBig open they make that little tiny cone shaped a an underground find the grab sip it up no true Mm yum hey where's another one so I had all these little dozens of little towns that have come back\nBut if we could show it off in the nursery people walking around the by the way the nursery looks unbelievable you and your team or just hung believable people suffer like all things and yeah so if we could maybe ... somehow think that through for next week Ken Lisa Lane and the mounting gardeners we'll be right back\nYou've been listening to the mountains are nervous Ken Lay on our modern garden center in France get camp during the week before he can be found at water garden Centre located Eighteen Fifteen times brings in Prescott and we believe picking vegetables the kid out in\nLet's talk about some plants\nThat are absolutely immune to to animal pressure so there's some that are more than others out plants adapt\nAs adept at over the generations and generations of plants for thousands and thousands of years have been adapting morphine they're putting in chemicals in their sap\nTo taste bad or so like you for be as no animal is ever going to mess with the euphoria it's related to appoint set up so you break up a point Senate branch you've seen this white Milky sap come out animals don't like that\nSome animals are like don't like a fuzzy textured leaf so as you look closely\nAt let's say sycamore you'll see the top of the leaf is green the bottom a leaf as white as white powder to it it does two things one when an animal eats that leads to get that white powder and its throat a kind of goes oh it's terrible\nIt's some water end it prevents that leave from perspiring\nSo it sooner dry climate we got a native sycamore that grows here so it's fifty percent more reduced a more efficient with water use and it keeps the animals off sycamore great animal resist a plant it's got this barked at peels and flakes that\nThe animals can't get to it can be an layer as easy to some plants are like that\nOf course if in doubt\nIf you walk through neighborhood and you've got tremendous heavily into problems or rabbits are everywhere or deer roam the streets at night if you got that walk huge walk to see what your neighbors have\nThe animals are just going to your yard there in every yard and they're roaming around Goliath Joe let's go over here are sort of knew over here\nAlso eat their yard and so you get to looking around and you'll see that the Alberta spruce there in every yard animals don't like it they don't eat that she put Alberta screws filter ammonia or or or Oregon grape or in every yard\nSo you can plant one in your yard and having no pressure from the same or heard that as roaming around\nOn your yard so you don't have you can plant with confidence that you're going to be okay with that I have used society garlic or IRBs sometimes I'll use a lavender Rosemary time\nAll oregano I'll actually plant that in my containers and hides the scent of the things they like so\nI had a ... a ... they they live for Kayla my gosh if you've got Catalina don't even bother with kale they're going to go after it no matter what you do up but some things you can plant you can hide descent who they can't find that with\nWith an herb I Love society garlic and so I plant some of those is pretty puts on his garlic you kind of sense to it and the animals they leave things alone in that pot in that container that part of the raised bed\nHouston techniques like that generally animals don't like herbs of any sorts of Rosemary does oh well up here lavender\nIf you're the only way you can kill lavender is if you water it too much it'll collapse you otherwise ignore it it just grows and grows beautiful evergreen\nPretty purple flowers is just a great plant a time I've got a time lawn rolling it's evergreen blooms in the summer is beautiful the animal and my dog's even like it they'll roll around they come in the house smelled like time yeah that's great [noise]\nUh so you could use some of those little techniques and tricks or use those plants actually a land scape with out in your own yard most of your natives so I well I Can't say that you're prickly pear handling a prickly pear\nOr sometimes ... as\nA legal pull up the market and eat the root out they don't they aren't they don't like to plant they just want the roof is a starch moisture you know the cat food source and so if you see that once they get Rudin they're fine but first the animals look at your yard they this is their home\nAnd they know when something is new in the yard and it's kinda like where's Waldo only they find the plant sort of all of their look it up there but there is something new there it is let's go check it out entire heard follow me we're going to check out this one New York oh they just one new fruit tree\nAnd they may or may not like it when you're going to check it out and they'll push and test and they got them through the side and see what's they might not even want the plant they just pick it up and throw it to the side go I Wonder what's done this whole why were they digging here why they put those plant here what's going on\nAnd so you got to train the day the herd of Halloween our deer or whatever it is at a train I'm going to listen guys you've seen that you've done it it's been here leave it alone moved to the neighbor's\nYard we've have had\nA you know you use herbs to hide the scent of certain things they like they are now starting to make herbal repellents actually smell like meant or clothes or\nOf Rosemary they make the oil use Brits the new plant that they might like with with this heavy scented or by\nAnd it's a repellent and so the animal stopper got hurt the guards that are making a ... and they make it in a in a A R T you ready to use liquid spray the folding laundry spray the ground with a written around\nAnd it keeps them out it's highly highly effective and again once once they get used to it and they just they realize yeah go over there every time I go over there it tastes like Rosemary I don't like Rosemary I'm going to go over the neighbor's yard he there's stuff\nThat you want to train them to go over there that over here not so good or just stuff you really don't like your favorite smorgasbord is over there and so you you can you can train\nHer to go elsewhere in the lead take the pressure off of yourself every once in awhile\nI I've got a wild land will come and yet that the whole herd I think it's just the big board will come in and rude around check things out a guy and he had he eats up a few pansies and dig things up and then leaves the damage isn't that\nAnd I can recover pretty well right now this is when they come in the pumpkins or right out front is decorations and they love pumpkins it's their favorite bang and so they'll come in and eat the pumpkins even tell where the Halloween a herd of have been up and down your street just by looking where the pumpkins had been destroyed\nAnd so you want to watch watch that one there's quite a few shrubs you can plant could Tony actors or at least is covered some of these\nUm a pirate Canada\nIs actually very very good this is one your grandparents grew but they ... because it was so tough\nIt grew fast as pretty berries and the fall orange or red it's pretty white flowers in the spring in animals don't eat it well there you go that's a good plan for the mountains of Arizona [noise]\nAh I Love myself Boston either the it's a native ... boss\nBoth the same exact thing I kinda prefer the color of Boston id kind of self clings up above stucco wall or something ... you can put those out there they're starting to show their red to fall color but animals they absolutely detest that particular plant again it's the taste they don't like that taste\nSo we've got some list here at the garden center that can help you got to have a Lena resist a list and we always used the word resist if we never use animal proof\n'cause some herds don't read the list and all kinds of nibble on things or things like deer we got a deer rabbit resistance list do you have a stomach much like cattle do as a double summer go there they eat it they digest and then it goes down further and they're eating their nibbling on stuff and before they realize oh yeah\nI don't even like this they've eaten half of your plant it's something they don't like it's the testable but they don't but they beat and have a ... a move onto the fruit trees I Love fruit trees they'll eat those so you kinda wanna sometimes if you plant a new thing and you're in the thick of\nYou're really in the thick of it you're right there butting up against the wild land interface used to have everything coming out of the forest to see what's up or you're on the golf course\nAnd you know rabbits are going to be everywhere it's like rabbits and snakes are all over the golf course\nI'm just get a repellent when you plant spray it right away don't wait for the damage you planted and no they're going to come check it out because they see what's new just Britain where they repels all are repellent kind of thing straight foliage when they come up and sniff it they go you\nKnow bull why\nWould they plant that that's\nGoing next door will eat to eat the neighbor's yard so you kind of want to teach those animals not to come here and eat your stuff", "show_name": "Brian Kilmeade & Friends", "year": "2018", "city": "Kingman", "day": "13"}
