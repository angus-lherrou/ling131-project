mixing some under appreciated a bone and play you some of your candy it's already on tonight it right here okay public radio\nEighty nine point five Aftab kj great Prescott valley Ninety pointed out that Kay Jay Z pass\n\nFrom Prescott public radio in Prescott looks following program\nUp into the mountains gardeners can lame gardening in mountain is different that's what they can typical tricks and garden sharp hadn't guaranteed to make your garden more beautiful than ever now for better advice that works locally welcome your host Dana Lane\nAnd welcome to this week's edition of the mountain gardeners your host Ken Lay and whereas you're talking about the landscapes of\nNorthern Arizona and it is beautiful my gosh just like this is what follows all about this is why we live in northern Arizona it's just been so beautiful you know your thought winter was here and then all of a sudden it's nice but yet\nWe call the Indian Summers or or you remember\nYou thought it was warm thought it was warm thought it was warm and then it got cold\nAnd then at one backup because that was a it was like this violent\nWarm and cold warm and cold and and the temperature would swing like\nForty degrees between daytime nighttime and and that's why the frost date the last frost date of spring at most to the elevations is going to be the first week in may you higher elevation folks in Flagstaff and paint up lakeside and at a Williams\nYou're you're going to be probably the end of may you folks on the lower elevations caught would camp Verde Sedona Kingman you're probably down towards the\nEnd of April but basically if you took mothers' day plus or minus a couple of weeks and they decide\nThat's our last frost it seems like in March we could we ... we get tricked into wanting to plant too early hours summer blooming things\nAnd so they get zipped the fruit trees get tricked into blooming too early and they get in zip to the fruit just taken especially if you're if you're planting the wrong varieties for the mountains so if you're painting a desert variety let's go to your big box store a big big\nCost go ... ... thing and and and they've got these fruit trees out in front and there are so tempting 'cause they're like fifty bucks off a great deal that\nThey're the wrong variety many many times they'll grow but don't ever bloom and fruit\nThat so that that's white timing is is is important and then also the variety is important right now we're into the fall blooming things I thought it would cover some of the things that should be planted right now things are best planted in the fall\nRight now if you see ...\nD you see a salon true or at your grocery store and they go to ... take this home and then then to plant it it will not grow outdoors from this point forward it'll you put it out there within a week dead\nThey're made for in doors or in tropical landscapes or or interior landscapes are made for has health plans kitchen seal thinks he I've even struggled growing base all in my window sill because if it touches that cold lasts in January and February it it does not like that\nIf you close a courting down in front of it and this between the pain and and that's and that curtain it will it gets too cold there it'll just keel over and die\nAnd so they're made to be where it's warm right now you can plant Rosemary you can plant lavender you time oregano so serious\nChives garlic ... there's a whole series of plant that love to be planted now your best parsley crop will be planted now through oh the end of November So\nYour best a lettuce spinach cauliflower brussel sprouts they're all planted now and you're harvesting those for\nThanksgiving dinner for Christmas dinner and they'll keep blooming or producing or you can harvest raped through winter I Would say if you're into kale healthy you know there's no more antioxidants then there was an kale or beef those are best planted now\nSo you get to work out four seasons the big mistake many people make when planting is they'll take that last cool season crop in may\nWe've got our last frost is only going to get nothing but warmer we quickly go from seventies beautiful everyone celebrating the spring season two Ninety it's just hot in the mountains and and those bringing blooming things don't like that equally\nIf you go plants right now the summer loving things things that love the heat\nWill the heat's pretty much gone at this point yes it's nice days\nBut there's a chill in the evening it and it comes down to nighttime temperatures for most of these plants and so this is when you do want to plant your cool season things let's talk flowers your your pansies love the cold and it's one of the biggest mistakes a lot of folks think their thumbs are are are black\n'cause they miss timed or missed judged wind a plant that crop of of pansies and so it it quickly ... it just falls over dead in the heat it's above eighty five degrees paying these they're not happy and there's no amount of water or said you can give him work to keep them alive\nThey love to be planted now the only thing that would be better if if your plants in about three weeks we get a light to know right on top of ... thanks giving they would absolutely celebrate that some plants like the cold\nSnap dragons are that way dusty Miller are that way viola as a ornamental kale there was actually edible ... which is very sweet very delicious my bosses watering thinking about like Lisa actually sprinkles ah she makes us to produce Scott was [noise]\nCut up kale that's so good at a soup all it's so good and then there's ornamental kale and it's just meant to be pretty and they're typically reds purple and white they're just gorgeous and of course the most famous of all of the fall perennials\nMoms or chrysanthemums\nThey love to be grown they love to be planted now and they'll keep coming back every year bigger and bigger and bigger it's my mom's I planned it ends up for a ... gallon I forget\nAnd now they're they've got to be have got to be two feet across their glorious they've set to they blossom twice they bloom late summer and now they're blooming again so that is really what you want to see out of those principles but it's about the timing sometimes it's not you\nThat has the garden issue sometimes just a nursery you're you're the advice you're getting and the timing you're getting the wrong variety or you're painting the right variety at the wrong time and it ended doesn't succeed or fail ... struggles and you're wondering what are they do wrong it wasn't you it was\nIt was you were sold the wrong bill of goods basically so that's why we're so big here at least our garden Centre of of garden information\nSo this is our fifty seven year uh being open\nA fifty seven seasons three fifty seven years we started in Nineteen sixty two is to do the math right pretty sure um that uh and and and our formula has always been be friendly be neighborly\nAnd neighbors we're just we're leaning across the fence we're just sharing the advice that you really worked in our backyard and if you do these things it will also work for you and your back yard and and if you teach someone how to garden they'll get the bill catch that bug\nAnd they want to do it more and if they're really good at it they'll start to tell it to their friends now now we've got the next neighbor leaning against the fence and sharing it with their with their neighbors and so ... and various social that way and so it's all about getting that timing right\nSo right now this is a tremendous time to be planting those fall perennials even if they're starting to fade let's say the hostages are out there right now hostages are great big route basically\nIt's it's a it's a flashy route\nAnd so this beautiful soft foliage comes up is a shade to plant in the mountains of Arizona with a very fragrant white flour\nUh they they just sit there and they hibernate the beautiful thing right now is they are a true perennial they're green foliage was will start to turn brown kind of a gold collar kind of a little lighter than than Aspen Goldman of butter yellow but kind of a bright gold color\nAnd as it said this that search the shriveled back and then then start to turn brown ... it'll just to hibernate\nBut while it's doing that there's tremendous route wrote that happens underneath that\nAnd so hostages tend to be kind of wimpy Morse sunny area if you plant them now\nTrump things okay Sarah from Chino says it seems like I still have a huge number a grasshopper yeah is it worth doing something about him right now are just wait on the Hugh yes\nDo something they're laying eggs like crazy don't let them do that to kill them off [laughter] so yeah this is a serious especially in Chino Paul then that whole valley for Curtis junction all the way up the valley it's just terrible so they\nGrow the size of like squirrels I mean there are huge and so they've got a ferocious appetite right now\nUh but the only way to really kill 'em as to spray them there's a spray here at the garden center\nSo they're close enough from Chino to to come in\nAnd we got a product called multi purpose insect spray put it in there hosing sprayer hose down to a barrier around your garden if you hit them they'll die and then also if they eat things they'll die and then it'll keep to repel them back\nAnd so they're less like the latest many eggs in your yard to late ... eggs out in your neighbor's yard that's the goal keep 'em over there don't let them in so next spring\nLate spring early summer about Mm June\nCome in and get some beach we got a an organic bait you could spread around that are really not come back but for now that doesn't work there to mature they're too aggressive a sprained with that multi purpose insect spray and they will you'll see dead carcasses all over the gardens that ... the next day\nCan at least Elaine and the mounting gardeners we'll be right back with more garden tips tricks and guarded by\nListening to the mountains are nervous Ken Lay on her and brought her garden center in France get during the week before he can be found at water garden\nCentre located Eighteen Fifteen times brings ... and we believe in the golden\nModest center I've got to tell you there's something really exciting going on\nIn Prescott here at least there's a lot going on in the mountains I mean there's a lot of gardening stuff going on this very exciting we will have those guest speakers on from seed saving to this one happens to be a make one hundred healthy dot org\nIt's a new foundation starting out they want to give people\nErnes eating fresh from your own backyard and then that creates longevity\nHealthiness a ... it's just it's just better teachers the next generation and they're having they want to plant a million gardens public gardens throughout the U.S\nA would then I forget the time for him that's quite ambitious they've got their very first gardens starting right here in Prescott Prescott lakes is going to plant their first garden I've got a big gala coming up that uh if even if you're not impressed her legs I think the whole community it within the\nArea is invited but it's a make one hundred healthy foundation Gallo charity event\nNovember twelfth it will be at the Prescott lakes clubhouse from five thirty eight that's November twelfth of thirty eight good friend of mine John Murphy is going to have started death a legendary gardener mean globally he works here has been a gardener locally for\nDecades but then travels globally to help\nThird world countries pharma better uh Daniel Blake will be sharing his guarded ISIS story during that and then Dr Steven Brown a complex medicine simple wisdom is just going over how to get longer better life to get a doctor\nA hardcore I mean like not just gardener farmer\nAnd then the foundation is going to be presenting this probably thirty date\nFrom November twelfth ... see I think that's a Monday that might even be Veterans Day and I should check on that hold on an era of the pull on my calendar basket yeah veterans' day right on veterans' day at five thirty Prescott legs or take a look at that I think you can get more\nAt a probably make one hundred healthy ... what does that make one hundred healthy dot com I'm pretty sure\nSo or I'll Try to post this on line our Facebook page or something so it's easier references so that's exciting to see what ambitious goals that's always impressive\nWhen I worked out I just tired of it too much of the business part of the family business and not enough gardening which is my passion I Love talking to gardeners I'll just go out and decompress and chit chat with gardeners\nAbout the gardens and what's going on the landscape and and I get to hear their stories and it is fascinating what people have done\nWith their lives just amazing and continue to go\nFor a continue to do in their lives anyway take a look at that river twelfth make one hundred and healthy dot com or just because it's a friend and I I like to rural gardening a million gardens that's impressive\nSo that's what's going on there one thing also uh make sure that the best thing you can do for your garden if we're talking edibles that you've had a plant like I just pulled the pumpkin\nThat they harvested the pumpkins giant pumpkins or each weighing forty fifty pounds a pretty big they're pretty impressive pulled them out and I saw some powdery mildew and nails and slugs underneath all of that foliage\nIt's important as you start to clean up dig up transfer as the plant start to fade especially your annual flowers and your annual vegetables they should be things like tomatoes squash cucumbers pumpkins of course\nAll those things that you're picking the fruit off of it did was diseased at all if it was struggling at all if you get holes if there's anything wrong don't come posed that\nGet it out of your yard you don't want that coming back next year and in fact in the next crop\nIn your ... ... square foot gardening that's a big reason why we tend to rotate crops\nSo you don't put potatoes and the same spot every year you don't put tomatoes or beets or let us in the same spot every year you want to rotate and put them in different spots in the yard so for me I Do I Do a raised bed is maybe a hundred and twenty square feet\nAnd then quite a number of container pots I probably have another forty fifty feet square feet of a container gardens base\nAnd so what I'll do is I'll take my container garden plants this year it was tomatoes\nAnd I put my tomato crop next year into my raised bed\nA crop uh last year this year I had squash and the raised bed I'll put those containers some always rotating my crop so if I happened to miss\nSome powdery motives spores or some sort of virus to get to Britain Illinois will till my tomatoes [noise] um I don't I don't want to stay in my ear to don't compost those I'll throw 'em away all of the city trash to take them away\nAnd then I'll Try to rotate crops so at some fresh soil to my gardens every year that little tricks to really be a\nA game changer as far as reducing the amount of of the issues I have to carry over from year to year I Would say that for your roses I'd say that if you saw a ... some sort of disease on your petunias I had a couple of materials that were glorious they faded I don't know if it was the cold\nIt's last week 'cause there there are ... there are tropical plants they don't like cold or if they just said it all the sudden because of disease either way of pulled them out this this week threw them in the trash 'cause I wasn't sure I didn't want to take the time to figure it out\nAnd I find them I pansies his panties they won't transfer from pansy to petunias will transfer petunias petunias who's just some insider church to help you clean up maintain and keep the color are going to keep the harvest going throughout the end of the year\nYou've been listening to the mountains are nervous can mine owner of water garden center and first get this camp during the week before he can be found at water garden Centre located ... springs road Prescott and we believe picking vegetables or get out in\nResearch Center All right we have Lisa waters land back in the studio just to share her opinions [laughter] and I have many more guarded by preferably you go down to the arrow it down\n[laughter] so anyway it was a welcome back to the studio glad to get that a a a different gardeners perspective on the guard and I think there's there's as many gardens out there is there are gardeners and so each each one has\nAn each individual personality in their gardens whether it's sterile it's dark and organized or wild and free and just a colorful or\nButterflies everywhere just everyone's got their own thing that makes them happy and that's that's a good style that's what that's what you should do it you don't read the book and do it has to be this way it has to be your way I mean you know there's some garden principles that really help\nBut to our gardens a front yard is definitely your thumb print hardcore and so people walk by and go to ...\nWe do a lot of flowers out front and a lot of color and today I Know it's like in my dogs and I went down a spot that I never really go down but we're avoiding another dog so they wouldn't be a rumble and\nI did a lot of front there was a house or let's just beautiful and a lot of moms this really pretty fall color that they had done and I was impressed you know that that kind of\nGardening is spread suits contagious so you'll notice that when one neighbor starts ... there's like a depressed like like nothing but like homeless lived on the street one neighbor asserts to guard and cut down the weeds organize and and then it inspires someone else and they start talking and then\nThere there'll be chilled they'll turn a color sooner so you'll see the same plant in the same neighborhood turning it different weeks maybe had a low seven to ten days difference\nBetween when the first one goes in the last one and so my maple maple ... have been beautiful in our neighborhood they've been around for rent I'm kind of jealous going to win his mind maple Glen charm color and it just just turn this week is starting to go\nAnd so it's not quite there another week and it will be full glorious read just beautiful it's a it's a Prescott blaze maple it just stunning I Am or maple\nHas turned color this week or the other name as flame a\nMaple it's kinda like a it's sort of reminds me of a Japanese maples got a small maple leaf\nSmall footprint small format typically comes in a multi stemmed format so a Japanese maples typically come in a single trunk with a miniature tree farm up to about ten twelve feet this one's typically as they shaped multi stem ... red maple\nThe reason that flame maple is hardy or better or better choice for the mountains of Arizona is at our elevation the sun is pretty intense and so it's too intense for most Japanese maples it's just hard for my\nSouthern folks to really understand Japanese maple grows and full sun\nIn a in Missouri it does not do that here it needs more protection needs more shade will last flame of maple which kind of has a similar look\nHe loves it just hit the hotter the better I mean planning out full sun surrounded with asphalt is happy happy happy\nAnd so it's and it's just turned ... the most intense read\nOf most of the maples I mean it's like fire engine red had fairy dust to watch it glow I mean it is that kind of intense\nAnother one that's all right behind that this kind of a shrub or taller shrub gets up about had higher so six maybe seven feet ... a little bit shorter than a flame maple but burning Bush burning Bush or it's a you on a bus\nOr is it botanical name but burning Bush is how we all reference it because it looks like the thing is on fire it's fire read maintenance is glowing red\nRight now the the stock we've got here in the nursery\nIt's got kind of a purple whew so it goes from from dark rich green\nWho is purple hue and then right before right after that it goes right read I mean like the the the cord like a red straw it's that\nColor I mean it's it is bright bright red or it's that color and it is a very hearty plant for the mountains it's a great time to plant I Would say this is your\nYou all timed to plant because you can see that color you see all hearty is gonna be it's gonna keep rooting out through the fall and then after that after the foliage drops because these are all deciduous plant deciduous means it sheds or leaves and has bright full color\nOr ever rains are going to be or conifer evergreens so it's kind of some some sort of cultural definition there get those out of the way out but you want of us has this most interesting bark\nIt it's not like appealing bark it's got these ... up and down the stems that are striking\nA they're beautiful to just cut off and bring it as a bundle I use them as a declaration on a on a table for Thanksgiving or Christmas for her to bow on 'em around a bit just they're very very unusual that those are one of the plants when I had to get my\nCertified nursery professional certification um this is pretty intense you got to know all your Latin names be able to identify a plant\nBy its with or without leaves one through one of these they threw a deciduous I mean no foliage on this plant burning Bush in this identification and yet ten plants that id you go down you've got to give the Latin name and the botanical name of that and the and the common name\nScott okay wow was pretty tricky I got I got 'em right I passed I Am certified I'm a professional uh but they threw into those and I'll never forget going I uh I remember that park this very distinctive once you take a close up look you go you'll never forget\nBut burning Bush is one of those plants have me every yards they have one for their fall color and now's the time the plant is typically there'll be in a two to five gallon size plant\nI should probably cover that to what sizes are best planted end when right now if you're planting and the autumn season now through the end of the year through throughout the new year it's better to plant a little bit larger root ball\nThat way if we do happen to get bitter cold all of a sudden in at the ground freezes bigger is better more insulated more routes or you'll get a larger route mass for next summer as well\nUh you you plant the smaller size of one gallons four inch the tiny sizes they're pure planting those typically in the spring of the year when their act just waking up and actively growing so now you're better off I mean this is this is your\nGrandparents so when you're on a smaller matter of fact well we'll just we'll kind of stick off budget will watch grows ... in his hardier that way\nThat's not correct planting technique the mountains of Arizona here you're really planting when it comes down to it a route thought about the size of the plant is how large is the root mass the larger the route and asked the more success you're going to have\nThis is really important for you folks that are are beers you love to travel you've got grandkids you just want to go see him and you're you're busy you love playing golf more than taking care of the yard or you love tennis or ... or whatever if you're busy inactive bigger is better 'cause it's it's a it's a deeper root\nSo it takes longer for that route mass to dry out a moisture content or to freeze a winter a continent winter freeze so bigger is better or when it comes to plants I Would say right now tremendous time to plant\nBut plants a little bit larger and then remember to water through the winter these plants because you're planting now it's going to grow maybe six to twelve inches a roots are those that soil around there can dry out we can have\nA bone dry winter we can have a very moist winter\nI recommend watering once you plant at least twice\nA month if we get a heavy snow or heavy rain you can cut one of those out but at least one deep watering per month through winter to keep that plant healthy and those new routes hairs moist supple and taken into moisture our ground really doesn't freeze I mean I think uh\nI think code for most of us say pace and\nPress get a little bit later for king when the lower elevations\nIs Eighteen Inches for water lines this is the ground is not going to freeze their electric convinced\nThe ground as it frees Eighteen Inches downloads pretty easy to Trenton Eighteen inch hole you folks Wisconsin you're used to eight foot frost lines wing code is water lines are buried sewer lines are buried eight feet under the ground I don't know how you do that that's crazy\nI mean here it's very light and we I've never I haven't seen a more than a six eight ... ever\nAnd then really most years at one maybe two inches a frosty ... plants right through it because it just doesn't it thaws during the day freezes at night so if you water keeps those plants that the roots supple and and growing and keep going be right back\nTo the mountains are nervous Ken my honor I'm waters garden center in France\nLet me bring in command that wider garden Centre located eight and ... springs in ... and\nI remember as though it was yesterday should we be open Sundays\nRevolution came after church social after the scholarship a friend was heading to the box store to get some plans because water's wasn't open Sunday was his own data garden that\nJust like it was yesterday\nWanders garden center it's open on Sunday from nine to five with experts ready to advise on this subject [noise]\nWaters garden center Eighteen Fifteen iron springs road\nHave you ever wondered what's inside a giant pumpkin\nWhat were you can find out so November third is next Saturday\nWe're going to open up a for a hundred and forty pound pumpkin are going to cut it right open and see what's inside there were some rumors that it's super slimy spooky slimy there's rumors that it's a double all like the walls or a foot thick that it's all slashed and knows seed\nThere's rumors that there's thousands of seed inside that are huge and then there's rumors that there's just a few dozen\nAnd so we're going to open this baby up it's looking good going to come see the punk and it's a beautiful specimen on display right in front of the parking lot here waters garden center\nBut we're promoting if every person that comes we'll get a seed like a dry out and then harvest and grow next summer so it's more of a summer plant doesn't like frosty plant those typically\nFirst weekend may maybe the last week in April depending on where you're at this mine mine grew several vines at least Fifteen feet long moved it says this monstrous plant they got to give us some space to take every bit of ten by ten space for one seat",
