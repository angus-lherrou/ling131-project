Flagstaff months park at Ninety One point three FM\nHi this is Dave letter your hosts for radio unlike joined me as the wilds of beautiful ... bones and play you some of your kid it's radio and make her die today right here on public radio\nMaybe nine point five Aftab kj Drake Prescott valley and not he pointed out that kj ...\n\nFrom ... public radio in Prescott looks following program [noise]\nUp into the mountains guard who can blame gardening in the mountains is different this would they can't tip trick garden shirt guaranteed you make your guards more beautiful than ever now for better advice that works awfully welcome your host candle a\n\nTo this week's edition of mountain gardener wow it has been a changing week this has been what happened to summer I went from summer to winter just like that\nSo uh it it's been voiced actually the planting the digging the soil is used to work with than ever the maple have turned the Asher beautiful purple you're starting this\nAll colors showing up in the mountains of Arizona and this is also the time that you want to plant those things if you if you're from\nThe desert the south where you just don't see a lot of that\nThat northern or mid western fall color or the mountains of Arizona fall color and you want a beautiful new aspirin or new maple or new Asher new uh this is the best season for planting those for choosing those 'cause you've got a tremendous selection\nAt the garden centers it's also a good time in that as the plants turn this magical fall color\nThey also start to read the root for the next month or so so that that's really what you want plant and then have it start rooting right away if you're painting now though I mean this kind of weather we've had this week it doesn't always happen that way sometimes we'll get dry spells through winter\nIf we get a dry spell you need to supplement water\nThat new planting it goes for anything that's been planted this year really so don't turn that system off next month for talking to three or four or five weeks from now a year landscape is going to go I'm going to shut down the system and then expect plans to go for the next five months with no water\nYou may have to drag the hose out what her by hand especially if you're gonna plant that beautiful new\nColorado spruce or new Austrian pine or a new maple you'll want to of water that to keep it healthy it's going to form those new routes hairs but then if that ground gets crusty and dry and just bone dry those new routes\nCan be shriveled up and so you'll lose that growth you would have it would have been such a benefit to have that additional six eight ten inches of a real growth this fall doubled down on that next spring and by next summer you've got a\nSuper hearty super healthy can take on the heat take the wind take the whatever summers got for us it'll take it because you planted it in the fall this is a tremendous time to be planting we've also what you'll find is your garden centers are bumping up\nTheir their winter evergreen inventory 'cause we need to bring that ... now\nSo we can acclimated and we're predicting how much in the tournament a self through winter because once it really gets cold um talk in the new year or so or you know two thousand Nineteen ... you know new year two thousand Nineteen\nYou can't start shipping plants into the mountains of Arizona then if they're truly dormant and to see us that is they've lost their leaves and you bring them those are okay but if you're bringing more\nNamed dino are heavily bamboo or or red leaf a folk Kenya or silver Barry Eli Agnes could Tony as these broad leaf evergreens if you bring those in from a warmer climate\nInto your market into your say flags set for White Mountains or prosecutor cottonwood wherever you're bringing those plants in and they go into this deep cold they're just not used to that yet\nYou they're not acclimated so we're trying to predict the computers tell us okay again you're going to sell three hundred rent a potential between now and February fifteenth order that many\nWere bringing them in now so that we can acclimate them and that way the landscapers homeowners that are new to the area they can come in and still plant be confident that that plant is used to our climate used to our\nCold temperatures warm temperatures and they can planted with confidence so you'll see a a an increase\nAnd the varieties and choices of evergreens at your nurseries right now it's a great time to plant also you'll see some big like this week I got some really big uh Colorado spruce pines these these big Christmas tree looking\nYou know central leaders whooping branches kind of plants detours cedars redwoods you know there's a there's a variety of sequoia that will actually grow\nIn the mountains of Arizona we've got those in now\nAnd bigger sizes and you wouldn't be able to find other seasons in spring or summer of next year it's a good time the negative if they're big they're heavy I mean it's ridiculous some of those soils\nI Can't believe or they're building houses right now it's crazy a fact I just had to put a Seventy pound\nJack hammer\nThe painting truck the thirty five pound or which is the normal cute see you know to just ... pop straight through a clay soils and things it wasn't hacking at\nThe guys were begging for a bigger hammer ... go for it get get the bigger the bigger impact hammer to a head on it to get to get the spade that really knocks out the clay soils backs away at the chips away at that rock gets it out of there\nIf you're having a big tree delivered to your house consider having your gardener your\nA plant it for you they'll have the tools hopefully\nThey're going to have the tools on the truck they're going to have the right to the gay bars the rate they know what size whole so with a big let's say it's a thirty five gallon a thirty five gallon spruce tree that thing is probably thirty inches wide the recall\nAnd about Eighteen Inches deep\nSo when you're planting that you'll want that whole to be about the same depth as the bucket about Eighteen twenty inch you're you're testing the soil underneath to see if you think that soil will drain the or not\nSo if you've dug enough holes in the mountains of Arizona you kind of get a feel you just know oh man that Jack Everett bans bouncing off the bottom of that whole the sale never drain you were digging a big bath tub here if\nThat's the case will take the Jack hammer and tried to fracture\nThat soil underneath so we break it up so the water will search seeping into the next\nSoil band underneath the roots that nutri you'll need someone that can make some calls like that and and you're going to a lot wider I'm going to be thirty and she's going to be sixty Seventy inch wide\nHole because the roots go sideways they don't go down and so you're digging his whole sideways and pulling out the junk the anything bigger than a golf ball\nOf of old roots rocks you'll find bricks\nTimbers is the builders trucked in buried in the front yard you want to pull all that stuff out so you're left with a screenwriter screened type of soil so now the roots can go through that then you want to men that steak it and get it go on there is a technique to planting the main thing the reason I\nDon't plan to larger plants in my own\nBackyard even though I Am very capable I Know what to do\nI meet the painting crew out there was cookies and tea and water and um how pop a chair and ... at this Great Hey guys what you do and how what you're doing this weekend I'll I'll converse with them but I'm not planning to because it's too heavy\nTo back surgeries\nThat can't feel my right foot it's hard to mountain bike with it 'cause it's kind of like going around I don't want to injure myself any more so I have anything over let's say a Fifteen gallon size plant I have to plan to do it\nAnd it's worth every time\nI mean that ... at our place everyone has a different way of of charging for that sometimes it's just the labor is that the guys power and throw the plant in the ground and leave so their prices pretty inexpensive hours includes everything\nSo we're throwing the ... the food the stakes the fertilizers the the root and grow into I mean everything more more time and the whole so half of that cost typically at at least the friends I hang out with their own garden centers\nThey are about half that price is going to be the product all the stuff it takes to plant it correctly and then the rest of it's going to be it just as expensive to roll guys and a truck and haven't bland and\nMake sure that your watering your plants before the colds comes a hydrated plant will go through that cold snap no matter how cold 'cause it's got it's got it's moist so the anti freeze within the structure of that plant can move back and forth if it's a dry plans kind of counter intuitive\nIf it's dry you would think oh it'll stay warmer wetter ... it'll start shivering if it's wet plants all shiver only we do\nYou do hear you keep the that that moisture in that plant especially container plans because they dry out a little faster they drained faster it's easy to grow and um because of all those factors but the you just want to make sure you moist and those those plants up so they can take that cold\nUm if you put them up against the house it takes a little pressure off but er an oath of magnolias evergreen beautiful southern magnolia that takes the cold it takes the cold don't worry about it just keep it hydrated whiz that we're out of time we'll be right back with more on the mountain gardeners with can Lisa Lane\nListening to the mountains are nervous can mine owner of water garden center in France get during the week Frank man modern garden Centre located Eighteen Fifteen nine springs rather than impressed and we believe in the golden\nNow fall is the absolute\nMost important feeding of the entire year this is if you're only going to feed once your landscape you should be doing it more than that but if you're only going to do it one time and then let the let the landscape starve the rest of the year this is the one you do not want to mess up that I'd go over the different kinds of fertilizers\nAnd I'd start with fertilizer steaks at some of the competitors are making the rounds making sure where in the marketplace competitive some going out there's lots of fertilizer stakes these hard ... spikes that you can drive into the ground and they're supposed to last year [noise]\nDon't use those stopped selling those Twenty years ago and here's why\nIn the mountains of Arizona worry very alkaline water and and rocky soil that that ...\nWe'll actually stay there for a year or more of this so it's it's slowed to release the problem is where are the main routes on your plants it's almost impossible to find out\nAnd so if you had a lot of top soil and that that bubble around that fertilizer steak were to permeate seep and in a week away and and and actually fertilize a larger area of volume of soil it would be okay\nBut first of all they're expensive because of the number that you need to drive around a larger tree it's just it's just difficult one doesn't do it you're going to need ten\nAround a big Arizona cypress are big spruce or a big maple need any more uh and then where do you play some you'd be better off crushing that thing up\nAnd sprinkling that underneath the canopy or the drip line of that\nThat tree or that shrub than you would to drive it in the ground because at least then the that's granular that your ground up would would slowly permeate breakdown go to the soil the plant will pick it up and you've got the entire ah that tire radius or underneath that drip line fertilized properly\nThat's called a synthetic fertilizers these are\nChemical based up petroleum based typically Kim a fertilizers as Scott's and somebody's or does these these brand names or Arizona there's several of them that are chemically based there they're they're made from petroleum you sprinkle those things around and basically\nThey released when water had some go into the ground and then fertilize the plant that would be better than a spike because at least you know where it's going to go the negative\nThey released too fast so within a month\nAll that fertilizers pretty much been released the reins gone into the soil and sometimes it's in a form to plant can receive sometimes it's not so ammonium ... sulfate is better in the summer ammonium nitrate are better than the winter so sometimes plants can pick up a\nBoy I didn't want to go this deep into fertilizers but basically it's temperature related when it's cool\nThe plants can pick up certain kinds of food and they can't their summer foods so it's kind of like a burgers and dogs that's for fourth of July weekend but I ain't going to have that outside in the yard when it's a you know twenty degrees out I'm going to have taken potatoes or chicken soup\nAnd so really that's the benefit of an organic fertilizer or all natural so we make of it made a fertilizer years and years ago ... huge following go all purpose plant food\nNot a very original name but it's seven for for all natural in the main ingredients are cutting seat meal which lowers the ph at the nitrogen source\nBird guano it it's ... it's got kind of an earthy smell is palate ties it's easy to spread but smells are the because of those cut and see meal and the and the bird guano sulfur iron some other stuff so that's the same greeted\nAs those organics breakdown they break down much slower\nOver a very long period of time typically about three months so it's not releasing all the food at once and so the plant can pick up more of that food than let's say an organic would just release all at once is picking up parts of it the rest of it as flushed\nAway and gone that's of synthetic an organic the plants can pick up virtually all of the fertilizer\nAnd use it so you get less waste ... longer a feeding than you would a synthetic I highly recommend using organic organic granular fertilizers for most of your plants out in the landscape it's kinda like\nIt's like an antibiotic me it's going to make the plant hearty healthy it's like chicken soup for the soul that's what an organic fertilizer is set in the in the fall of the year if you've not done that I cannot emphasize\nThis enough the benefits for the mountains and it's because\nYou folks in the mid west you poor folks\nFrom the mid west you just don't you\nEight foot of topsoil you no longer have\nWe've got eight millimeters if any topsoil and your landscape and then we we put this fabric over top of the soil and then we put rock on it to make sure no organics ever get down into the soil again you're going to have to fertilize more often\nUp in the mountains of Arizona but just because our soils we just don't have a lot of top soil\nSo you need that's where the nutrients are held you have to fertilize it more often so I suggest to three times a year minimum four times if you if you have a lot of evergreens\nUh it'd be Easter did you think of holidays Easter fourth of July and Halloween that's when you fertilize New Years for lots of Colorado spruce theater cedars pines and then uh\nI Would say for your your native evergreens they would greatly benefit from fertilizing with that all purpose plant food and anything that's dressed also\nOil activate or this is like a this is truly the antibiotic for for\nPlants things that are stressed by a scale on your opinion pines bark beetle on your ponderosa's they're greatly going to benefit from the food on the ... better way deeper on that subject and I wanted for one segment but hey now you're an expert be right back\nYou've been listening to the mountains are nervous can mine owner of water garden center in Prescott visitors can during the week before he can be found at water garden\nCentre located Eighteen Fifteen nine springs road in Prescott and we believe you're never\nA drink that water starts center\nAnd we are back in the studio was leave so water's lame she comes in and just um\nShares her garden tips so I share mine she serves hers and in the\nWhole show hopefully you get sort of you know three main points were always want to have three points that people could take away and using the gardens that week that would make a difference right now in their gardens and so I think it's a valuable to get leases opinion on everything\nAlways but also or not just kids and house in business but also the dogs and kids\n[laughter] and business and everything else and the garden I don't even know where I was going with the\nKind of rambling that's what I Do [laughter] that's what they do that or microphones in front of my face ramble though [noise] so anyway welcome back to the studio Lisa what kind of topic you got for us well I'm going to\nTalk about so we got trucks and this week so we've got a lot of our fresh evergreen shipments and so I was going to talk about that\nBut I wanted to do a quick little blurb on something else because we were um over a friend's house since last night and they're talking about oh you know their annual their petunias geranium starting to go and and the question was kind of put anything in that kind of put anything new in those pots for the winter time\nAnd I think sometimes we forget there are so many new people moving in and they're not used to the season out any of our our environment so yes the question is yes you can definitely put your pansies then you're ... has\nA snap dragons dusty male are just so many things that can go in right now and give you pretty pretty color throughout the whole winter season and they're tough they can handle\nThe cold yeah definitely and we've been changing hours out so the data mining looks terrible right now so it's not dead\nAnd I know Daniel you have traveled the world helping people farm better smarter for me it third world countries that's been your passion now you're back home and your partner with John you're going to share that expertise with is how does that\nPartnership work well can uh when I got the opportunity to leave the country was always because there was a great need there were children they were sick and they needed to have better food so I had an opportunity to go down and teach now I Want to do it here local so that's\nPerfect so now you're just set of gardens\nAnd then you're going to bring expertise that'd be like you even smarter than I Am as far as gardening or you can make things he could make that microphone you start to put it in the dirt you're going to help folks here and help us\nTo start growing our own foods here here locally that's right\nWhat do you do that little gardener backyard garden yeah so how would it give us tease me what what's what's something that maybe we can do in our own backyards lister over ... king men are flexing could use right now it would maybe make their game their garden game a little better\nWell can I get a closer to the soil and I started digging the soil with a digging fork and I start adding organic matter to it and gypsum and other minerals to make it alive so what kind of organic struck horse manure\nUse chicken coop used to summer fertilizer what what how what do you dig in would that fork and what happens when you hit a Boulder\nI dig around and move it [laughter]\nI was just sharing earlier or the ... with the audience we just bought a Seventy pound hammer for the for the planting truck because the rocks are becoming their like growing or the where people are building are on ... more and more seems like there's less soil there it's hard to grow things without the soil\nWhile I Would add a gypsum is important because uh\nAll the nutrients take it back onto the gypsum and to the calcium to get into the plants they got to have the calcium and that may right from calcium for Arizona soils and then I had organic matter and then I started adding a nitrogen and phosphorus potassium and I work that's loyal to get close to it I had an air to the soil\nSo is this square foot gardening or is this rogue gardening or how would you prefer if you want to maximize I say I've got a backyard and I'm only going to have a hundred square feet of ten by ten area raised bed\n'cause uh I don't have any other soil elsewhere so I made it out of tempers are blocked or whatever how well how would you what would be the formula to make that go for um you know for him but I well let's just say that and that would\nNot want to use the native soil 'cause that's not good stuff\nAnd that is true of some of it isn't very good but then some of it is so different parts of Prescott\nPeople don't like to dig and clay clay holds your nutrient better and hold your water longer truth so I got to do there is admired ... matter to it and that kind of makes sweet I'm healthy\nGotcha and what's your favorite plant grow what's the most of the your third world country you're helping wherever you helped grow or help third world communities\nEat better Mexico believes a nurse in Africa gotcha okay so to countenance [laughter] that's pretty good and growing pardon the pun now you're going to third this this is not there were third world but\nYou're here in America helping us grow smarter as right what was the main crops that they like to grow their\nSo rice and beans or or what are they mainly doing they grew every vegetable you can imagine yeah that's absolutely gotcha\nOkay not just tomatoes yeah whole or I was thinking peppers or something like that there is a spicy pepper that I Love and Mexico so good so we've got an event foundation
