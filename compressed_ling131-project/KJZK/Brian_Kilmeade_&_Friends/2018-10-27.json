that mark ... in your house Mandalay\nAnd welcome to this week's edition of\nThe mountain gardener this is your host Ken Lay and we're talking about the landscapes of northern Arizona and it is beautiful oh my gosh this is that this is what follows all about this is why we live in northern Arizona it's just been so beautiful you know your thought winter\nWas here and then all of a sudden it's nice to get\nThe call the Indian Summers or or you remember back last spring you thought it was warm thought it was warm than it was warm and then it got cold\nAnd then it won backup and it was ... it was like this\nViolent warm than cold\nWarm and cold and and the temperature would swing like forty degrees between daytime nighttime and and that's why the prostate the last frost date of spring at most of the elevation there's going to be that first week in may you higher elevation folks in Flagstaff and paint up lakeside and\nAt a Williams you're you're going to be probably the end of may you folks down lower elevations cotton wood camp Verde Sedona Kingman you're probably down towards the end of April but basically\nIf you took mothers' day plus or minus a couple of weeks and they decide\nThat sort of last frost it seems like in March we could we which we get tricked into wanting to plant too early our summer blooming things and so they get zipped the fruit trees get tricked into blooming too early and they get in zip to the fruit just taken\nEspecially if you're if you're planting the wrong varieties for the mountains so if you're planting a desert variety let's go to your big box store a big big cost go ... ... thing and and and they've got these fruit trees out in front and there are so tempting 'cause they're like fifty bucks oh that's a great deal ah\nThey're the wrong variety many many times they'll grow but they'll never bloom and fruit and so that that's why timing is is is important and then also the variety is important\nRight now we're into the fall blooming things I thought it would cover some of the things that should be planted right now things are best planted in the fall right now if you see ...\nDo you see a salon through a ... at your grocery store and it goes there is there take this home and then then to plant it it will not grow outdoors from this point forward it'll you put it out there within a week dead\nThey're made for in doors or in tropical landscapes or or interior landscapes are made for hours house plant kitchen seal things he I've even struggled growing ... in my window sill because if it touches that cold glass in January and February it it does not like that\nIf you close a courting down in front of it and is between the pain and and that's and that curtain it will it gets too cold there it'll just kill over and die\nAnd so there may be where it's warm right now you can\nPlant Rosemary you can plant lavender you time oregano salt series chives garlic ... there's a whole series of plants that love to be planted now your best parsley crop will be planted now through\nOh the end of November So\nYour best a lettuce spinach cauliflower Brussels sprouts they're all planted now and you're harvesting those for\nThanksgiving dinner for Christmas dinner and they'll keep blooming or producing or you can harvest rapes through winter I Would say if you're into ...\nThere's no more antioxidants than there was an kale or beets those are best planted now so you get to work out four seasons the big mistake many people make when planting is they'll take that last cool season crop in may\nWe've got our last frost is only going to get nothing but warmer we quickly go from seventies beautiful everyone celebrating the spring season two Ninety it's just hot in the mountains and and those spring blooming things don't like that\nEqually if you go plants right now the summer loving things things that love the heat will the heat's pretty much gone at this point yes it's nice days\nBut there's a chill in the evening it and it comes down to nighttime temperatures for most of these plants and so this is when you do want to plant your cool season things let's talk flowers you're you're paying these love the cold as one of the biggest mistakes a lot of folks think their thumbs are are are black\nBecause they missed timed or missed judged wind a plant that crop of of pansies and so it it quickly ... it just falls over dead in the heat it's above eighty five degrees pansies they're not happy and there's no amount of water or shade you give him work to keep them alive\nThey love to be painted now the only thing that would be better if if your plants in about three weeks we get a light snow right on top of ... thanks giving they would absolutely celebrate that some plants like the cold\nSnap dragons are that way dusty Miller are that way viola as a ornamental kale there was actually edible ... which is very sweet very delicious\nMy mouth watering thinking about like\nLisa actually sprinkles or she makes a stupid they Scott was freshly cut up\nKale that's so good in a suit oh it's so good and then there's ornamental kale it's just meant to be pretty and there are typically reds purple and white they're just gorgeous and of course the most famous of all of the fall perennials\nMoms or chrysanthemums\nThey love to be grown they love to be planted now and they'll keep coming back every year bigger and bigger and bigger it's my mom's I planted ends up for ... a gallon I forget\nAnd now they're they've got to be have got to be two feet across their glorious they've set to blossom twice they bloomed late summer and now they're blooming again so that just really what you want to see out of those principles but it's about the timing sometimes it's not you\nThat has the garden issue sometimes just the nursery you're you're the advice you're getting and the timing you're getting the wrong variety or you're planting the right variety at the wrong time and it and it doesn't succeed or fail ... struggles and you're wondering why did I Do wrong it wasn't you it was\nIt was you were sold the wrong bill of goods basically so that's why we're so big here at least our garden Centre of of garden information\n[noise] um yes too early I Would say like with some of ours I prone to back the spent flower heads because they look they they're blooming they're done they're starting to shut down there still green I as long as it got green foliage I Would leave the green foliage 'cause it concrete photosynthesis which\nUh takes all that starts with they they created it'll for next year's flower from\nThe green foliage let it go through that natural process don't cut back until they're brown is all perennials till they're brown cleaned them up\nI take some of the dead flowers is driving me crazy or drug ... back the edges so they're not as drew be but I Would keep most of that green foliage for another month to month and a half to the end of the year and then for sure we're done with this fall whether we're into winter cutting back take a lower to weed lack of it doesn't matter\nBut let them do their thing naturally through fault don't don't encouraged to don't don't rush things\nI noticed in the ... the gray areas but by the ... they're just looking guy\nJust turn those back a little bad yeah if they're not only Baquet\nOnce or twice already been fertilized and that's why the show has been so incredible\nI actually think they're worn out there just tired of blooming so much and they're waiting they want to fall but I'll leave that foliage on this Elvie as hell winter till the harshest winters over\nBecause at that folded trucks you protect the court the heart the core of that range plan to keep them healthy sure okay so don't be inpatient stole Russia that the folks from Palm Springs from southern Cal Phoenix Tucson they're in such a rush like oh is that everything done by the end of December\nWell here we wait until early February March before he really clean up and\nAnd rag heads and trim things okay\nSarah from Kenya says it seems like I still have a huge number of grasshoppers yeah is it worth doing something about him right now are just wait\nTill he's yes do something they're laying eggs like crazy don't let them do that to kill them off [laughter] uh so yeah this is serious especially in Chino Paul then that whole valley for corners\nWay up the valley it's just terrible so they grow the size of like squirrels I mean there are huge and so they've got a ferocious appetite right now\nUh but the only way to really kill 'em as to spray them there's a spray here at the garden center so they're close enough from Chino to to come in and we got a product called multi purpose insect spray put it in there hosing sprayer hose down a barrier around your garden if you hit them they'll die and then also if they eat things they'll die\nAnd then it'll keep a repel them back\nAnd so they're less likely latest many eggs in your yard delayed more eggs out in your neighbor's yard that's the goal keep 'em over there don't let them in so next spring late spring early summer about Mm June\nCome in and get some Bates we got a an organic bait you could spread around that are really not come back but for now that doesn't work there to mature they're too aggressive or spraying with that full purpose insect spray and they will you'll see dead carcasses all over the gardens that ... the next day\nCan at least Elaine and the mounting gardeners we'll be right back with more garden tip strict sand guarded by\nListening to the mountains aren't nearly can mine owner I'm water garden center in France get can during the week Frank can be found at water garden Centre located eight and ... canine springs rather ... and we believe you'll never\nA drink that water garden Centre\nI've got to tell you there's something really exciting going on\nIn Prescott here at least there's a lot going on in the mountains I mean there's a lot of gardening stuff going on this very exciting we've we all had those guest speakers on from seed saving to this one happens to be a make one hundred healthy dot org\nIt's a new foundation starting out they want to get people back into the gardens eating fresh from your own backyard and then that creates longevity healthiness\nUh it's it's just it's just better teachers the next generation and they're having they want to plant a million gardens public gardens throughout the U.S\nA would then I forget the timeframe that's quite ambitious they've got their very first garden starting right here in Prescott Prescott lakes is going to plant their first garden they've got a big gala coming up\nThat uh if even if you're not impressed her legs I think the whole community it within the\nArea is invited but it said make one hundred healthy foundation Gallo charity event\nNovember twelfth it will be at the Prescott lakes clubhouse from five thirty

five thirty Prescott lakes or take a look at that I think you can get more\nAt a probably make one hundred healthy felt what does that make one hundred healthy dot com I'm pretty sure\nSo or I'll Try to posted this on line our Facebook page or something so it's easier references so that's exciting to see what ambitious goals that's always impressive\nWhen I worked out I just tired of it too much of the business part of the family business and not enough gardening which is my passion I Love talking to gardeners I'll just go out and decompress and chit chat with gardeners about their gardens and what's going on the landscape and\nAnd I get to hear their stories and it is fascinating what people have done\nWith their lives just amazing and continue to go\nFor a continue to do in their lives anyway take a look at that river twelve make one hundred healthy dot com or just because it's a friend and I I like to rural gardening\nA million gardens that's impressive so that's what's going on there one thing also to make sure that the best thing you can do for your garden if we're talking edibles if you've had a plant like I just pulled the pumpkin\nThat they harvested the pumpkins giant pumpkins or each weighing forty fifty pounds a pretty big they're pretty impressive pulled them out and I saw some powdery mildew and nails and slugs underneath all of that foliage it's important as\nYou start to clean up dig up transfer as the plants start to fade especially your annual flowers and your annual vegetables they should be things like ...\nNumbers pumpkins of course of the things that you're picking the fruit off of it did was diseased at all if it was struggling at all if you get holes if there's anything wrong don't come post that\nGet it out or your yard you don't want that coming back next year and in fact in the next crop\nIn your ... ... square foot gardening that's a big reason why we tend to rotate crops\nSo you don't put potatoes and the same spot every year you don't put tomatoes are obese or let us in the same spot every year you want to rotate and put them in different spots in the yard so for me I Do I Do a raised bed is maybe a hundred and twenty square feet\nAnd then quite a number of container pots I probably have another forty fifty feet square feet of of container gardener space\nAnd so what I'll do is I'll take my container garden plants this year it was tomatoes\nAnd I put my tomato crop next year into my raised bed\nA crop uh last year this year I had squash and the raised bed I'll put those containers I'm always rotating crops so if I happen to miss\nSome powder emailed is spores or some sort of virus to get to Britain Illinois will tell my tomatoes\nUm I don't I don't want that to stay in my yard they don't come post those I'll throw 'em away all of the city trash to take them away and then I'll Try to rotate crops so at some fresh soil to my gardens every year that little tricks him to really be a\nA game changer as far as reducing the amount of of the issues I have to carry over from year to year I Would say that for your roses I'd say that if you saw a vision of some sort of disease on your petunias adds a couple of petunias that\nWere glorious they faded I don't know if it was the cold they got the full it's last week 'cause there there are ... there are tropical plants they don't like cold or if they just said it all the sudden because of disease either way it pulled him out this this week threw them in the trash because I wasn't sure I didn't want to take the time to figure it out\nAnd I planted my pansies his pansies that won't transferred from pansy to petunias will transfer petunias petunias who's to some insider tricks to help you clean up maintain and keep the color are going to keep the harvest going throughout the end of the year\nListening to the mountains are nervous Ken Lay on her water garden center in France get can during the week Frank ... water\nListening to the mountains are nervous Ken Lay on her I'm waters garden center in France get into that camp during the week Frank can be found at water garden Centre located Eighteen ... springs road Prescott and we believe are all too busy\nI Need to relax in the garden waters garden center\nYou're really starting to hit the peak of the fall color season right throughout the whole region\nUh we're we're hitting it right on so it it really looks good right now especially in that six to five thousand foot level\nYou folks in the higher elevations have been yogurt the groom creeks and the the highland pines you you've been in there for for probably a couple of weeks already we're just now hitting the stride it's a little bit lower elevations\nAnd you folks that you know thirty five hundred of five thousand foot level you'll be a couple of weeks after us so it just has this pulsating waved to put on your elevation and also noticed your neighborhood much of my ... and the house of fifty seven hundred feet\nA there is a very ... so there's probably go from six thousand to ... probably a five hundred foot elevation James routine the highest till a house and the lowest what you'll find is those folks that are on the south facing hills they're warmer\nAnd so the plants are a little slow words it turn color\nThose plants those houses are on the north facing north side there are a little bit cooler more shaded and so those trees those shrubs ... they'll start to pop the sort of turn color faster sooner\nThat's also an elevation change if you're near a washer dryer wash all that cold air in the evening settles in runs down that dry wash so those plants plan to closer to that\nLowes spot in the landscape they'll they'll be chilled they'll turn a color sooner so you'll see the same plant in the same neighborhood\nTurning it different weeks maybe ... ... seven to ten days difference\nBetween when the first one goes the last one and so my maple maple syrup and beautiful in our neighborhood they've been around for random kind of jealous going to win his mind maple Glen charm color and it just just turn this week is starting to go\nAnd so it's not quite there another week and it will be full glorious read just beautiful it's a it's a Prescott blaze maple just dining Ammar maple\nHas turned ... this week or the other name as flame maple it's kinda like a it's sort of reminds me of a Japanese\nMaples got a small maple leaf small footprint small format typically comes in a multi stemmed format so a Japanese maples typically coming a single truck with a miniature tree farm up to about ten twelve feet this one's typically as they should\nDamn red maple the reason that flame maple is hardy or better or better choice for the mountains of Arizona is at our elevation the sun is pretty intense and so it's too intense for most Japanese maples it's just hard for my\nSouthern folks to really understand Japanese maple grows and full sun\nIn a in Missouri it does not do that here it needs more protection needs more shade will last flame maple which kind of has a similar look he loves\nIt just hit the hotter the better I mean planning out full sun surrounded with asphalt is happy happy happy and so it's and it's just turned a the most intense read\nOf most of the maples man it's like fire engine red had fairy dust to watch it glow I mean it is that kind of intense\nAnother one that's right behind that this kind of a shrub a taller shrub gets up about had to hire so six maybe seven feet ... a little bit shorter than a flame maple but burning Bush burning Bush or you want him as\nA as a botanical name but burning Bush is how we all reference it because it looks like the thing is on fire it's fire read I mean it is glowing red\nRight now the stock we've got here in the nursery\nIt's got kind of a purple whew so it goes from from dark rich green purple hue and then right before right after that it goes right read I mean like the the cord like a red straw it's that\nColor I mean it's it is bright bright red or it's that color and it is a very hearty plant for the mountains it's a great time to plant I Would say this is your\nIdeal time to plant because you can see the color you see all hearty it's gonna be it's gonna keep rooting out through the fall and then after that after the foliage drops because these are all deciduous plants deciduous means it sheds or leaves and has bright fall color\nOr ever rains are going to be ... or ... or evergreens so it's kind of some some sort of cultural definition there get those out of the way out but you want to mess has this most interesting bark\nIt it's not like appealing bark it's got these ribs up and down the stems that are striking\nA they're beautiful to just cut off and bring it as a bundle I use them as a decoration a on a table for Thanksgiving or Christmas boat on around them they're just they're very very unusual that's those are one of the plants when they had to get my\nCertified nursery professional certification or this is pretty intense you know all your Latin names be able to identify a plant by its with or without leaves the true what it is it through a deciduous I mean no foliage on this plant\nBurning Bush in this identification that yet ten plants that id you go down you've got to give the last name and the botanical name of that and the and the common name Scott okay wow was pretty tricky\nI got I got 'em right I passed I Am certified professional uh but they threw into those and I'll never forget going I I remember that park this very distinctive\nOnce you take a close up look you go you'll never forget\nThe burning Bush is one of those plants of me ever yards they have one for their fall color and now's the time of you plant those typically there'll be in a two to five gallon size plant\nI should probably covered that to what sizes are best planted and when right now if you're planting the autumn season now through the end of the year through through and said new year it's better to plant a little bit larger root ball\nThat way if we do happen to get bitter cold all of a sudden in at the ground freezes bigger is better\nMore insulated more routes or you'll get a larger route mass for next summer as well\nUh you you plant the smaller size one gallons four inch the tiny sizes they're pure planting those typically in the spring of the year when they are just waking up and actively growing so now you're better off I mean this is this is your\nGrandparents so drawn out on a smaller matter of fact well we'll just we'll kind of stick off punted well watch grows hardier that way\nThat's not correct planting technique\nFrom the mountains of Arizona here you're really planting when it comes down to it a route sad about the size of the plant is how large is the root mass the larger the ... the more success you're going to have this is really important for you folks that are\nAre beers you love to travel you've got grandkids you just want to go see him and you're you're busy you love playing golf more than taking care of the yard a you love tennis or ... or whatever if you're busy inactive\nBigger is better 'cause it's it's a it's a deeper root\nSo it takes longer for that route mass to dry out a boisterous\nA winter a continent winter freeze so bigger is better or when it comes to plants I Would say right now tremendous time to plant\nBut planned a little bit larger and then remember to water through the winter these plants because you're painting now it's going to grow maybe six to twelve inches a roots\nAre those that soil around there can dry out we can have a bone dry winter we can have\nA very moist winter I recommend watering once you plant at least twice a month if we get a heavy snow or heavy rain you can cut one of those out but at least one deep watering per month through winter to keep that plant healthy and those new routes hairs moist supple and\nTaken in the moisture our ground really doesn't freeze I mean I think uh\nI think code for most of us say pace in\nPrescott a little bit later for king and the lower elevations is Eighteen Inches for\nWater lines this is the ground is not going to freeze their electric convinced\nThroughout doesn't freeze Eighteen Inches Dale it's pretty easy to Trenton Eighteen inch hole you folks Wisconsin you're used to eight foot ... mean code is water lines are buried sewer lines are buried eight feet under the ground I don't know how you do that that's crazy I mean here it's very light and we I've never I haven't seen it\nMore than six eight ... ever\nAnd then really most years at one maybe two inches of ... plants right through it 'cause it just doesn't get it thaws during the day freezes at night so if your water keeps those plants that the roots supple and and growing and keep going be right back\nTo the mountains are nervous can main honor I'm water garden center and first get into
