tricks and current insurance hadn't guaranteed you make your garden more beautiful than ever now for better by that works locally welcome your host candlelight\nAnd welcome you tuned in to the mountain gardeners this is your host Ken Lay in doing this a lotta years together\nWe just share about ah the cycles what's going on in your landscape here in the mountains of Arizona and a lot of our ... content the garden advice that we get at the higher elevations none of it's coming from here\nIt's deemed in through HGTV or east coast or mid west where most of the production of garden content comes from books written from there\nThat shows a radio that they're from over there of course that's where all the bodies are\nFrom Washington DC north to Boston to cook it over to to ah to to Chicago and all of a sudden you've got most of the countries people live there and if you're going to create a book you want to write for them not for\nThe how how many people live in northern Arizona\n... half million maybe and there's there's no one up here and so that's why we live here we get to be more secluded we can go into the forest and not have to bump into people\nSo we get some space we can breathe the elevation is just the air is cleaner break through the paces lower and that's why we love\nThe mountains of Arizona and so if we do get some garden content that's from Arizona it's usually from Phoenix or Tucson so Tucson because our university agricultural school is you may go wild cats\nAnd all the bodies in all the students go to school I asked you or or Phoenix metro area and so that's where the TV stations are and so you get these news outbreaks that to kind of a an IRS wants here's how Republican senators how to prune your palm tree the second year palm tree and that and the content you know it's not for you\nIf you live up in the mountains\nSo we don't grow palm trees that we don't grow citrus up here we don't grow avocados we don't grow big fig trees we have some shrubs that are hard enough to grow uber not trees\nAnd we don't grow crepe Myrtle trees we grow shrub ... there are certain varieties that are hard ear that that uh they can act more like a perennial if we do go sub zero really cold cold cold it'll never come back to the ground and they come back fresh every year\nFrom the ground like a perennial and so they never quite get up to size and there's some over in the ... area there's some bigger ones over there so it's more for the southern folks they want I I don't want crab apples I don't want purple leaves plum I don't want flowering cherry trees I Want quite Myrtle trees\nAnd they just they just don't perform the cold ... back\nIn the south you know Dallas guy ah east you can have beautiful but not not here and so we try to get that information out for the mountains of Arizona the best advice I can give you right now\nIs don't give up on gardening it's still going to leave that irrigation on even though we had a storm a couple of weeks ago\nYou still don't want to be watering them out once a week for his dad ... plants these are things that have been on the ground for over a year a couple of years or so or more they've got to fully mature root structure its its new you just planted it two three four six months ago this year\nThen you're probably watering that a couple times a week and I'm Talking trees and shrubs maybe vines the bigger rooted stuff ... if you're talking about pansies your your kale that new lettuce crop you just put in carrots that\nThat's a little different 'cause they're shallower rooted she water mold more often but even now I'm I'm scaling back\nMy watering but I'm not turning it off and continue to nurture\nMy plants this week I've given my some of my plants a hair cut their just they've grown a lot they've been happy they loved all the moisture urban fertilizing well they're happy they're healthy the color is good they're almost too happy so I've got Eli Agnes up against the houses and under planting they're getting too big\nSo I gave them a quick haircut none of full I didn't really you know lack of back in half\nI just the long run or is that gets nip those off a hair cut a trim\nYou do most of your heavy pruning and the dead of winter you know January February march you wait till things are cold to you don't want to prune too much here this is this is mainly for you desert folks tropical climate areas you folks from Hawaii\nOr for from Kelly California the southern Arizona folks you folks you want to hold off you are used to print of your roses back in November oh lord as we always do it don't do that here you'll blunder your way to failure\nIf you do that like keep that structure up on those plants as best you can cause ... insulate the heart of that plant so if we go really cold and you'd never\nGoing to deliver to be dry can be wet can be snowstorm after snowstorm could be warm could be it just never know what it's going to be but you can't go wrong by leaving that structure intact so leave that alone then you're prone after the new year after the harshest in wait for a nice break day by\nBy Valentine's middle of February the weather's getting pretty nice at that point yeah we can have some frost yes we can get a snowstorm or two after that\nBut the weather's getting pretty nice you want to be outdoors at that point and that's when you want to start printing things 'cause you print or right before they start a elongated it'll start growing faster budding out\nUh so do late printing now it was encroaching ended the walk with the patios my potato Weiner's going crazy it just needed to be just crawling all over the patio it needs to be cut back\nAnd so we just trend a little bit I did fertilize before that story made a couple of weeks ago I fertilized everything\nHere at the garden center I fertilized ... at the at the house I Want to make sure that food gets down in there some time in October you want to make sure that fertilizer you want to really put a ... a a nutrient rich fertilizer on the ground as the plants root there they're actively Rudy right now\nAs the leaves change they root out through the end of the year you could fertilized and you'll get a chubby or stronger sadder route to their heartier they hibernate to better\nAnd that's the foods are going to use to form the buds for next spring form new flower buds on your fruit trees new rose buds on your roses new strawberries new it's going to use that to form new growth to this is the most important feeding into the years in October\nSo I just took advantage those are two main things\nThat I've done a and then as my plants give up a system like tomatoes I no longer have a tomato in the ground\nI harvested from all they were done they were kind of they were just big overgrown and the production was there but it wasn't like it was two months ago man I could pick up enough of\nA cucumbers I Can't I just can't eat any more I don't want any more cucumbers this matinee so I just want okay that's enough that's put in some kale is that a lot of juice and kale I Love lettuce fresh out of the gardens oh it's so good melts watering thinking about it oh\nMan radishes you can put in now and no growth you just had a little bit of garden space a few seed and all of a sudden you got this beautiful crop of broccoli for Thanksgiving dinner ah brussel sprouts for Christmas dinner you can have that\nThe season there so long growing cycles so long here in the mountains and you just have to know what is my cycle so your cycle is in in March you've got all planting season of cool season things\nMothers' day typically he's all your summer things is when you put your tomatoes years any as your geraniums and\nTheir kind of semi Doug similar to that\nKind of you know tamp them back in the ground whatever he wants to know what can you do\nOr to me the help of yeah so we had a German Shepherd max he's he's been gone for a few years but when he was a puppy his ears are still flop and our ... we had a dog run which is huge at a patio\nCovered reporter boat underneath there it had an orchard against the ... grapes were growing up by the time he got done teasing [laughter] not one that thing was left above one foot I mean trees\nGrape vineyards nothing was left 'cause his teeth hurt so bad so dogs\nThat just how they are that's why we love them some time as a what to do right now put him back in the ground you did write you caught it the next day you're probably find\nThe best thing you can do right now is we make a product called route and to grow its uh reading hormone so liquid you mix up in your water and Canada it basically it's route tone that white powder you dip cutting in and you you get them to root out\nUh we just liquefied it and so you pour this route and grow around that distress they are stressed\nIt help mitigate the stress helped to re route those broken roots and help with the full force new or a leaves coming out probably even before spring even before the end of of of this year arrived it probably have more roots and more leaves I'd give it route and grow\nEvery couple of weeks until you see it definitely stabilized it's happy we made it and I cut it off of all of that but that's ... grows your best defense\nUh right now for that kind of plant thanks so much folks will be right back with more generally Selena ended up mountain gardeners\nListening to the mountains are nervous can mine owner of modern art center in France getting during the week before he can be found at water garden Centre located eight and ... springs rather than ... and\nWe believe Prince Harry\nPotter so here's a little trick I learned that in ... I raised my family at least in I've raised our kids in school belly little tiny ranch town fifty miles north of Prescott some between just prefer Kirkland that area so it's it's in that\nLand we live right on Kirkland creek the kids could roam we are on ten acres surrounded by nothing but ranch we could see no one near our house it's disconcerting sometimes 'cause kids would go and you're going to wonder where they're at you know I Wonder if they're safe I've no idea\nHow so but they always had max the German shepherd\nAnd Baja the chocolate lab and wherever those kids when they were right there and so you always had confidence they were they would take to chase the cattle away or but then we had elk and we had deer sick lots of Wellstone had mountain lions and bears and everything else\nSo everything you could think of was there a pack rats to squirrels to rabbits to do everything was there and so I learned a few tricks and one I had the deer come in and they were appealing to bark off of\nMy wall nuts I had a ... a soft shared well let's see once you're seeing show up at the grocery store now those nuts a great big walnut it was that we'd pecans and so the walnuts the the deer tick a fancy too and sometimes they'll do this to aspens sometimes I'll do this to any fruit tree\nEspecially apples and pears that's her favorite they'll go in and they'll rubbed their antlers on the bark and then they'll start peeling\nOff the bark underneath the bark certain trees taste very sweet and so after all that nutrient moisture and taste sweet taste underneath the bark this was very frustrating this woman that was quite large\nAnd I did not watch the dear to kill it or ... if they they peel off the bark too much\nWhat I did and this is not in any book you're not going to see this on any website is just you and me talking over the airwaves and this what worked in my own back yard to keep the deer off I'm going how am I going to keep how am I going to do this what I did is\nIs I took some burden netting ... following me with this some black\nPlastic burdening you know one inch squares you use it a cover fruit trees I had it it was right there when I Wonder if I loosely wrap this around the trunk and staple gun it to the park\nAnd just let this this netting kind of float around this work where they were eating I Wonder if this would keep 'em off\nAnd boy did it ever work they didn't try to touch that thing once after I put that on there I just didn't know what to do this I didn't wrap it real tight I just loosely led up to three times around\nWhen around took virtually no netting staple gun ... what you think would hurt a tree but trees don't even feel that to their parents shaved off the rest\nAnd they never came back to that treat appeal the bark off I think that same exact technique could work for Apple's your aspens willows there after ... woods are certain things they really like what if you've got deer pressure coming after your trees trying to peel that bark off don't let them do that\n'cause they can kill kill off that Trump\nI think it might even worked for porcupine so if you see bark peeling off real low to the ground usually in the first foot or so there's a there's a porcupines that roam around\nOnly at night they're nocturnal they'll come and they'll just park sit right in front of a tree they love fruit trees and peel off the bark they'll do that to a ... I've seen sometimes I'll get up and do the crotch the tree they'll crawl the tree sit down on a main branch and just sit there and you'll see the bark peeled off\nRight where this branch was coming off if you see that this is serious if they'd girl the tree they can actually kill it and so I think you do the same thing by ... ... ah just loosely very loosely wrapping that\nA ... bird netting around that probably deer netting probably any kind of netting would work just I didn't want it to be obvious\nI wanted it to blend in to the landscapes who didn't look like oh what what do you do there I did you read the paper on his Trump what's going on and it looks funny the black\nYou hardly even see it doesn't even show up\nAnd so if you get a lot of peeling bark peeling off of that tree then you want to come in and talk to us we'll we'll show you how to clean it up cycle wound\nYou want to clean it up you can't really ... or ... or the staples into but you can't actually clean up the the the the wound spray it with some black pruning paint and wrap it and that will they used to go to help the tree he'll over keep the insects out\nThat one where the park was being peeled off we can help you that we can go deep with that because we see it so often so that's that's something that happens I here's another little one I found I'm In my lawn\nI had little tiny cone shaped holes in the long ago what the heck is going on who is eating my lawn and so it was perfect little cones it'd be like a dozen of them over this little section of the grass when what the heck is I've seen this in gardens so little tiny holes almost looks like a\nI don't know how to describe it will just to ...\nAnd I found out that was skunk they were going after the grubs in my lawn and so they could smell that grew up where they could they know where it is I take their little tiny paws\nBig open they make that little tiny cone shaped a an underground find the grab sip it up to no true Mm yum hey where's another one\nSo I had all these all dozens of towns that have come back every night\nAnd make more of them I put a grub killer down over the lawn or that garden area killed off the lawns skunks didn't have a food source they went away and never Cosby problems again it's those kinds of things you need to adapt to in the mountains of Arizona we get more be right back\nYou've been listening to the mountains are nervous Ken Lay on her and water garden center in France getting cancer and then we bring it can be found at water garden Centre located Eighteen Fifteen times brings in Prescott borders believe John briefing security come through\nAnd we are back in the studio with Lisa waters lane she comes in just here's her garden her perspective on gardening we need a different perspective than mine\n[laughter] well I used to have that [laughter] so\nAt least one I just you know we've been married thirty two years going on thirty ... thirty thirty one point\nAnyway a long time worse hum so we dated to college we dated a long time so colored sweethearts but I Am the outgoing gregarious people people people more people can I talk to you can I talk to strangers no matter where you I'm a bomb on the street a\nHigh powered the president the United states I'll walk right up my name's good what'd you do and what\nAnd you are the complete and utter opposite is true and divert extraordinary or you're not going to talk to anyone till you are in your inner circle and then it's like nonstop friendship to nighttime customers all day will customers that's true\nBut then I get that you would talk to a lamp posts [laughter] probably true but only if I hadn't talked to anyone for a couple of days I Do talk on my head sometimes no I don't guess I Do [laughter] just kidding [laughter] I'm\nNot really any way we um whereas I gather and we garden together we have a we've had four kids together they're now all launched and so\nYou kind of run the garden center you are the general manager you order all the stuff I never look at farms or we'll go to um together but I don't look at the bail list I don't know what's coming in and we pre plan ahead of time on the budgets\nOf course if in doubt\nIf you walk through neighborhood and you've got tremendous heavily into problems or rabbits or everywhere or deer roam the streets at night if you got that walk huge walk see what's your neighbors have\nThe animals are just going to your yard there in every yard and they're roaming around Goliath Joe let's go over here and see what new over here also eat their yard and so you get to looking around and you'll see that the Alberta spruce\nThere in every yard animals don't like it they don't eat that she put Alberta spruce filter ammonia or or or Oregon grape or in every yard\nSo you can plant one in your yard and having no pressure from the same heard that as roaming around their yard will roam around your yard so you don't have you can plant with confidence that you're going to be okay with that I have used\nSociety garlic or IRBs sometimes I'll use a lavender Rosemary time\nAll oregano I'll actually plant that it might containers and hides the scent of the things they like so I had a ... a ... they they live for kale oh my gosh if you got Catalina don't even bother with kale they're going to go after it no matter what you do\nUp but some things you can plant you can hide the scent they can't find that with with an herb I loved society garlic and so I plant some of those pretty puts on his garlicky kind of sense to it and the animals they leave things alone in that pot in that container that part of the raised bed\nDecent techniques like that generally animals don't like herbs of any sorts of Rosemary does oh well up here lavender\nIs you can kill lavender is if you water it too much it'll collapse you otherwise ignore it it just grows and grows beautiful evergreen\nPretty purple flowers which is a great plant a time I've got a timer lawn rolling it's evergreen blooms in the summer is beautiful the and my dog's even like it they'll roll around they come in the house smelled like time yeah that's great [noise]\nUh so you can use some of those techniques and tricks or use those plants actually a land scape with out in your own yard most of your natives so I well I Can't say that you're prickly pear handling a prickly pear\nOr sometimes as young as\nAh the handling all pull up the market and eat the Rudolph they don't they aren't they don't like to plant they just want the route it's a starch moisture you know the cat food source and so if you see that once they get Rudin they're fine but first the animals look at your yard they this is their home\nAnd they know when something is new in the yard it's kinda like where's Waldo only they find the plants that of all of their look it up\nAnd it is let's go check it out entire heard follow me we're going to check out this one New York oh they just one new fruit tree\nAnd they may or may not like it when you're going to check it out and they'll push the test and dig up and throw it aside and see what's they may not even want the plant they just dig it up and throw it to the side go I Wonder what's done this whole why were they digging here why they put those plant here what's going on\nAnd so you got to train the day the herd of have a lane our deer or\nWhatever it is at a train them going out and I'll listen guys you've seen that you've done it has been here leave it alone moved to the neighbor's yard we have\nHad a you know you use herbs to hide the scent of certain things they like they are now starting to make herbal repellents actually smell like meant or clothes or\nOf Rosemary that make the oil's use Brits the new plant that they might like with with this heavy\nScented herb and it's a repellent and so the animals stopper got hurt the guards that are making a ... and they make it in a in a A R T you ready to use liquid spray the folding laundry spray the ground with a written around\nAnd it keeps them out it's highly highly effective and again once once they get used to it and they just they realize yeah go over there every time I go over there it tastes like Rosemary I don't like Rosemary I'm going to go over the neighbor's yard eat there's stuff\nThat you want to train them to go over there that over here not so good or just stuff you really don't like your favorite smorgasbord is\nOver there and so you you can you can train her to go elsewhere in the lead take the pressure off of yourself every once in awhile\nI I've got a wild land will come and yet that the whole herd I think it's just the big bore will come in and rude around check things out oh yeah yeah he eats up a few pansies and dig things up and then leaves the damage isn't that\nBut and I can recover pretty well right now this is when they come in the pumpkins or right out front as decorations and they love pumpkins it's their favorite thing and so they'll come in and eat the pumpkins even tell where the Halloween a herd of have been up and down your street just by looking where the pumpkins had been destroyed\nAnd so you want to watch watch that one there's quite a few shrubs you can plant could Tony actors are leases covered some of these\nUm a pirate Canada\nIs actually very very good this is one your grandparents grew but they group because it was so tough\nIt grew fast as pretty berries and the fall orange or red it's pretty white flowers in the spring and animals don't eat it well there you go that's a good plant for the mountains of Arizona [noise]\nAh I Love myself Boston either the it's a native of Boston Virginia ... they're both the same exact thing I kinda prefer the color of Boston id and self clings up above stucco wall or something ...\nYou can put those out there they're starting to show their red to fall color but animals they absolutely detest that particular plant again is the taste they don't like that taste\nSo he's got some list here at the garden center that can help you gotta have Alina reasons to list and we always use the word resist if we never use animal proof\n'cause some herds don't read the list and all kinds of nibble on things or things like deer we got a deer in rabbit resisted list do you have a stomach much like cattle do is at a double stomach go there they eat it they digest and then it goes down further and they're eating their nibbling on stuff and before they realize oh yeah\nI don't even like this they've eaten half of your plant it's something they don't like is testable but they don't but they beat and have it before the ... move onto the fruit trees I Love fruit trees elite those so you kinda wanna sometimes if you plant a new thing and you're in the thick of\nYou're really in the thick of it you're right there buttoned up against the wild land interface used to have everything coming out of the for us to see what's up or you're on the golf course\nAnd you know rabbits are going to be everywhere it's like rabbits and snakes are all over the golf course I'm just get a repellent when you plant spray it right away don't wait for the damage you've planted and no they're going to come check it out because they see what's new just Britain where they repels all are repellent\nKind of thing straight phones when they come up and sniff it they go yeah [laughter]\nAll why would they plant that that's\nGoing next door will eat to eat the neighbor's yard so you kind of want to teach those animals not to come here and eat your stuff\nOf course if you'd like to eat it everything likes to eat it so if you've got you got a strawberries everything's going to want rats are going to come I wanted to harvest strawberries if you've got a cucumber\nThe the goals are going to want to come in and eat your cucumbers if you've got basically any if you'd like to eat it lettuce kale broccoli cauliflower if you like to eat it you need to put some place where the other things can't get to it mainly animals more advice rested is\nListening to the mountains aren't nearly Ken Lay on her and brought her parents that are in France get into that camp during the week before he can be found that wider garden Centre located eight and ... springs ...\nAnd I remember as though it was yesterday [noise] should we be open on Sundays\nRevolution came after church social after the fellowship a friend was heading to the box store to get some plans because water's wasn't open Sunday was his own data garden that\nJust like it was yesterday\nWanders garden center it's open on Sunday from nine to five with experts ready to advise on this subject [noise]\nWaters garden said Eighteen Fifteen iron springs road\nOur largest load up evergreens for the year is coming next week so I don't I'm not sure what time are trying to lock that thing down but it's\nAll the mind all the spruce gorgeous Theodore cedars a beautiful red with the tallest tree on the courthouse lawn here in Prescott is redwood there's one in the back there might be two of them I Know one at least in the towers above\nThe elm tree is by at least forty fifty feet and it's just getting started\nAnd so that you can grow weed they just came in and you can you can plant that now this is the time\nBeautiful perfect shape of a Christmas tree but it's a red what his there's two varieties there's one that's not hard to hear there's one that's hardy for the mountains of Arizona we've got those two different sizes\nSo we're seeing this influx of lots of evergreens so the the ... or ... your true gardener counterfeiters those things are the needle that serves degree that's a kind of her", "show_name": "Brian Kilmeade & Friends", "year": "2018",
