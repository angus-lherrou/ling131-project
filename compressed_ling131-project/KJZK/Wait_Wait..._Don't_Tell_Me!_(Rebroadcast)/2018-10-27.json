all that story than you thought chatter for northern Arizona\nToday and she saw that we're talking with Sophie and we said well you're young women together are working on a rational campaign of their fathers have itself [noise] we'll talk to so feeling when we say about this hot the campaign and how you sound like you have to pay more and more because he really high [noise]\nSo uh it's sad it's been awhile for you on the campaign Sophie I understand you came from New York a week and a half ago that's true yes um what what made you you are and\nYou were working in New York you had a job and suddenly you decided that you were going to pack up from New York City and come all the way back to Prescott tons more it wasn't that set it in a\nI was working in New York at the photo editor for health care publication um and it was a lot of fun it was my first well paying nine to five I didn't have\nAnd I was working with great people and the work was fun it was okay um but honestly it wasn't as rewarding as I would've liked it to be\nAnd I have been interested in politics for years I've been getting more and more involved over the last few years and my dad decided to run for Congress after I had taken this job conveniently\nAnd um you know I I was watching the campaign heating up from afar and it it was just so exciting to watch and I kept calling him and saying\nThat give me something to do how can I help let let me help from here let me do something and finally he called me up and basically said Soviet if you really want to help you didn't get your butt out here [laughter] so I was a little freaked out by the idea of dropping everything so soon after I started this\nPretty great job um but honestly the decision wasn't difficult and I knew that I needed to be with the family and working on the campaign which was bigger than me and bigger than all of us and\nSo I here I Am\nLuis ... how did how did your dad convinced you to work on his campaign um well\nHe was talking about it this was this was back in the fall and I was living in Portugal and he you know we would talk on the phone\nEvery few days and he he floated the idea of running for Congress he said you know um some people approached me and said that I should do this and I'm kind of thinking about it and I was like at first they laughed has like ha ha that's funny\nAnd then he's like no I'm actually thinking about it I was like oh God [laughter]\nAnd then like a week later he was like oh yeah so I'm I'm Still thinking about doing it and I was like wow like\nLike you're actually considering running for Congress like we've never talked about going into politics this has never been something that's come up in the Stanley we've always been very passionate about politics and very like interested in wanting to be involved but like running yourself as as a whole new game\nAnd he said yeah no I'm thinking about actually doing it and then a week later he said yeah I think this is going to happen is that okay I'm coming home\nSo you were just like well if you're doing this I'm coming home yeah so I I booked a flight um I think the next day I was kind of on the fence about Portugal and you know deciding whether or not I want to stay and really teach English or um maybe come back and like work more in the states and then he said that and it was like this is way more exciting well\nSomething you said before we jump on the air you you said you and your father went to Portugal together and then you stayed behind so your your dad actually left at Twenty one year old from my very fondly perspective I'm a Twenty one year old kid in Portugal to make your way teach me when I tell ya mates and on and run around Portugal mhm so yeah\nAnd and Spain um I was in Barcelona around the time of all those um the riots and the protests that were happening in the fall as well um\nBut yeah I've ... he left and I I decided to stay because I was having a lot of fun and I wanted to see what happened he said well I mean you're excited and I and I think that you'll have a good handle on this so mazel tough luck\n[laughter] so what are you guys doing what or I have a listener who says that I'm not allowed to say you guys what are you respect of jobs on the campaign\nOh man we've been we've been floating around and doing a lot of so all the things yeah all the things kind of little little bits of all the things I started I was doing like social media and kind of following him around because you know it started very small so I was kind of like going to all the events with him and\nPutting out the signatures and talking\nTalking to about the content and recording and doing this on the other thing but um\nBasically just whatever needs to be done um right now he's he's wanting me to do more of a we're helping with the media and\nA scheduling what else [noise] I order things\nI help help order a bumper largest there's going to get the swag through the door what um\nWhat are what are you doing stuff yeah I Know in New York you were a photo editor so you're kind of a journalist\nSo I'm I'm doing that I'm I've become the unofficial campaign photographer I'm since I have access to him and I have experienced taking pictures [noise]\nUm so that's been fun and rewarding to be able to use those skills um and then you know I'm On the research team so I'm doing opposition research and issue research I'm I'm helping organized volunteers [noise]\nI'm I'm hoping that in I mean since since I've only been here a week and a half I'm definitely still okay with sort of picking up things here and there and it needs to be done and someone's got to do it so I'm happy to do that but hopefully it'll be a little more streamlined going forward because it is a little hectic but that's the nature of campaigns and that's how you learn\nFrom your perspective are you seeing I think nobody would argue if I were to make the point that the results of the two thousand sixteen election were surprising um are you from your perspective are you seeing your peers getting more involved in in either in politics or in organizing or or just\nGo out and and just pulled out and vote\nYeah absolutely I mean the two thousand sixteen campaign was really tough emotionally I think just as a young woman um as someone who was just watching everyone start to hate each other and more and more it was it was it was hard on I think everyone\nAnd yeah I was in New York City so I was definitely and sort of a liberal bubble and I didn't really see a lot of people who disagreed with most of my views which was kind of nice but at the same time wants to the election happened\nIt was it was it was kind of a shock to the system and yeah I think from my from my point of view a lot of my friends have definitely gotten more involved whether that's um you know joining non profits a lot of my friends signed up to help with my parents had\nA lot of my friends have just gotten much more much better about educating themselves about lots of different issues and\nUm it's really interesting to watch because the disaster than sixteen election was so divisive um but\nNow the more people educate themselves the more they realize that all of these issues and I connected and there are more and more frustrated by the fact that nothing's really getting done and so I think that people are much more open to the idea of reaching out across the uh the aisle and across\nSupport for ... public radio was provided by ... and Keith Kendall at the frame and I and the art store both in the heart

Facebook and Instagram I Do I Do I have made Instagram last summer I Believe oh so you're you're late adopt or even though you're I I also got a snapshot\nSo I I have all three but I never got into my space or Twitter those were for before my time they're little they're more graveyards at this point where did you say Twitter yeah will turn out ... used but we'll play yeah people just don't really get into it now seems like most people have it and still use it but I don't know that many of my friends to get into Twitter\nIt sounds like there's a price of adoption you have to sort of figure it out to me maybe three or so moving on from the marvelous world of social media [noise]\nYou you mentioned when you between between takes that to your mother is also volunteering on the campaign so he's got\nThree women who are very closely I'm working with David Brill your father to to make this campaign happened which which kinda fits with the whole wave of of women getting into politics and in large numbers there's all the unprecedented or nearly unprecedented\nNumber of women running for office right now how are you influencing your dad in the direction of his campaign oh man well\nFor the very beginning uh my my dad and I actually went to a candid training\nSaying in Phoenix together and it was really really valuable because we both kind of learned a decent amount about getting into politics and like you know how to shape your views and basic messaging stuff and from then\nWe started meeting and having coffee here and there and we're kind of like just sort of try and dig deep to you know like what is your motivation here and like what do you have that's so important\nThat you should be in this office like what ... what are your goals and and what qualifies you and what motivates you and how do you express that in a way that's going to be meaningful and\nIt's it's been really really amazing actually just because talking to him he really listens and I think that's been huge for our relationship but also know that Sophie is here it's it's fun because he just both of us sometimes\nWe'll boats you know critique his speeches and and talk about you know like how he presents himself and and the feedback we have and and our mother is the backbone of everything and we all are very aware of\nThat has your father sort of changed his messaging or a change to approach to issues affecting women on your employees refined it I think he's\nHearing us um I definitely think it ... I mean we definitely team up on him a couple of times a week and you know according to him about\nLike little uses of like his words and the ... like the specific\nLanguage that he's using that I think a lot of young people and women in particular are much more aware of these days um and maybe saying that because it's much more apparent in New York but I think also in Arizona people young people are more and more aware of\nThe nuances of like how we talk about each other and how we talk about different issues so yeah I mean he's from an older Jenner\nHe's a man and so I think he is inherently a little less aware but he is definitely making an effort to listen and he is he's changing his language so yeah he hears us\nWe're at when I was growing up I I graduated high school in Ninety three so I I I was kind of in a formative place when Anita Hill I'm accused Clarence Thomas of harassment and and when the whole impeachment of Clinton\nHappened and and everything around that um and and ... for Twenty years now we have um the me too movement and and and people starting to take women seriously when they say hey something happened it wasn't okay how does that been like\nFor you to wonderful women who are of this generation you know what I'm saying is that right [noise] uh you go okay\nWell I\nWas a baby when all that happened so um I wasn't really aware of the new health thing until I was older but\nUm I was working in bars all throughout college and until fairly recently and so I got a front row seat to the culture of sexual harassment um which\nYou know the longer it went on and really really pissed me off and and\nI still see all the time these double standards that apply to women I mean it was still a parent and the children sixteen election um I was talking earlier about this thing that I saw on the MTA last month\nUm all these ads for ... were plastered all over the trains and it was just really infuriating because I've never seen an\nAd for birth control or contraception I'm ever and it's just not talked about and so I think for it has not\nBeen to ... you were saying the double standards are still here and they're still very much alive and and all of this stuff is still ... still happening\nOh I I yeah absolutely it is but I think that the difference is that in the last couple of years women have really started to voice their outrage and voice their opinions and I think that the world is slowly but surely taking notice and um I think I I Hope that things are changing\nAnd I think that the more we express our outrage and you know speak up when we're being harassed or like point out these double standards the more the more we will go we watch and be listened to and taken seriously Luis any thoughts I mean I don't have much to add to that I've\n... I've worked in the restaurant industry for several years now so I've had a lot of similar encounters and it's just very much like ingrained in our culture and I think that it's amazing that people are talking about this now\nBecause I mean when I was sixteen and my first job was I was a sandwich artist at subway\nAnd you know I had like red hair and I was like this like cute little whatever and for some reason I think that like I got more like\nJust like casual like sexual harassment from people who would come in and be like Oh yes dear you're adorable and you make sandwiches for a living so I'm just going to like make endless amounts of cracks that you and and then like working in the restaurant industry when there's like alcohol involved in\nThat that that's a little darker honestly and it's it's very very common but\nI also think that we have to be careful of saying that things are changing because of the me too movement because as cathartic and great as it has then to see these like powerful men be taken down\nI'm In places like the restaurant or take themselves down right ideally I'm In places like the restaurant industry or and you know a janitor circles or you know people who are less privileged than you know these actresses 'em and entertainment people are just rich people in general\nI think that you know they have much much less of a voice and things are changing a lot slower so I think that we have a responsibility to\nYou know make sure everyone has what exactly yeah it's been wonderful talking to you Sophie am Luis ...\nThank you for coming on the show thank you so much yeah thank you we've been talking with Sophia and will be thrilled sisters who are working on the congressional campaign of their father David Brill and you've been listening\nTo she thought that ... public radio American drivers when I'm Out on the air I'm an advisor at my twin wealth management get our newsletter at news dot ... dot com\nOr read the theater guy and producer and even Harris join in Saturday's eleven or Sundays at twelve thirty or listen online at she's all that easy until next week and joined the heat [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nComing up next host DJ ... modern medicine Paul McHugh when regional medical center program focus on your health\nSupport for the Arizona community radio network is provided by two men regional medical center a care MC we want to make sure every woman in our community received annual breast cancer screening we provide free or low\nRegardless of the income or insurance called the imaging center at six nine to two seven to seven K.

obviously didn't have a medical background [laughter]\nSo I grew my hair out still have concussions and then I go on to med school and I started thinking I was just like why did I listen to that and so\nI have my hair down to my button I Wish I had it now eh kind of [laughter]\nKind of well I Know a little bit of both [laughter] um when you were finishing up your residency here residents\nYou know if they've done well they have a lot of opportunities they can they can pretty much go where they want they they have a lot to choose from you decide to stay on it care and see what went into that decision for you so our first year I'm dumped a garrison\nGot us together with the administration with Randy back they took us out dinner they've winding dying is and I was told yeah yeah I was ... hey yeah I was going to do family medicine and the\nPitch at that time was you guys are coming on board now why not try to think long term and that was yeah\nYeah I was all set a Rebecca\nAnderson she signed on already and she was there at the dinner along with Chelsea and when it's Sean\nI'm just working with them knowing that that was our group that was our class if I was a real good feeling that they were going to be here too so just having that camaraderie and then just being established kind of knowing you know the special is kind of knowing the that the patient population\nAnd having like a safety net was was something that I wanted\nWithout that we could grow here so\nYeah we took the opportunity and then um that kind of changed after a little bit\nSo I always had an interest in wound care I wanted to ask yeah uh this is a specialized branch of medicine yeah so what brought you here so I always wanted to do family medicine was only um types of doctors that I knew when I thought of a doctor so family medicine was always on my doubts what I was going to do\nAnd then we came here to Kingman um but when I was a med school my mentor Dr car Williams up in Las Vegas um I did a rotation with him for a plastic surgery but he also there's tons of wound care and the wound care aspect of it really caught my eye because\nAt that time it was thinking that this was something that I could do on the side\nAnd building that relationship with Dr Williams who is also a mentor to Dr fair banks's toward that connection comes and um he just showed us that there's so much that we can do\nWithin our scope of family medicine that we could be you know\nNot only benefiting the patients but it's also something that would also help us so that that that was kind of the motivation and then the more that I got into it the more I was I yeah I really do like this and I like seeing that\nHealing process I like seeing the patient afterward done after we've you know solve the puzzle and kind of maximized our treatment plant and helping them heal the satisfaction from that was just you know it was like wow that's awesome\nAnd that was all from exposure from Dr Williams so I think my second year residency I started thinking about getting certified in about doing more wound care stuff mainly to go work with him in Las Vegas\nI've got all the certification and I started sitting down thinking about getting it done or the hospital approach me and asked you know have are you interested in staying here and doing the wound care\nSo I thought it was going to be you know part time and then the beginning of this year is why they're like no do you want to take it do you want to take it and make it your own certainly you have medical director next I Know it's just a little space\nAs pretty a lot on your work right so yeah I mean so the hospitals and yeah they sent me to uh go get hyper Barrett a certified right we should define that\nSo hyper Baric oxygen therapy originally started for the navy for I don't know if anybody really knows what Kate sons are but for when you had decompression sickness I'm for it back you know in the early Nineteen Eighteen hundreds\nThey were digging down into minds and you know and they would have what they call the case on sickness and it's from going down into the earth and then coming back up too fast and you get into decompression sickness just like we think about when the divers go down and things like that okay so originally it was um used for that to help\nKind of um skilled him up\nIt first started getting used and wound care when Dr Brewer mom found out that you can\nSo he did a study he's a cardiologist who wanted to see if these pigs could survive without blood well\nTrained him up their blood put their plasma back and put them in the ... chamber saturated their their serum their circulation and they found out that they they could live for a certain amount of time\nSo by applying that into wounds 'cause wound are chronic and they a lot of times don't have oxygen and they don't have the proper supply nutrient so they don't have the best culture so they stay in this chronic state of inflammation\nBy applying ... therapy to these chronic wounds you can saturate the oxygen levels by having them go down and then when they are in that state for a certain amount of time\nThe oxygen not only helps with getting more vessels to the area it also helps normalize the inflammation so it helps in multiple ways more so that it helps you get blood to the area\n[noise]\n\n\n\nIt's time for a quick break and focus on
