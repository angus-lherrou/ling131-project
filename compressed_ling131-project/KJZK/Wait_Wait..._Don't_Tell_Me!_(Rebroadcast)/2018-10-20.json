and get coffee talk if you'd see today about how our business fit and healthy even engineer type them I guess\nCrappy Christ into tie get money thanks for having me so I Would surprise right before we jumped on the air you actually let me know that you have not one to two locations ideal for porn and brush yes so we are located in downtown Prescott on just in the back of whiskey row and then we also have a ...\nI'm an actor in place that they found out and everybody you know where that is because that's where the big REI and allows higher bakery are so now we don't we\nIt's wild and yeah the whole foods all the orange theory all those kinds of Shangri la there's even a fall place for those of us who are five star down here in ... the noodle soup you can actually get that in ... and also get your\nSign making cracking is on correct up there in ... and I'll sit down here in ... there may be people who are listening where who table who are wondering what it is that we're actually talking about here so tell us everything okay so bored and brush is a painting steps studio and\nUm we basically do um public workshops every weekend I'm\nAn old ... you know all throughout the week we have private events at the at the studio but mainly people come in and we teach them how to create a piece of home decor would home decor item um from start to finish and I mean honestly start to finish they arrived to\nAh just plain wrong pine wood and we show them how to distress it and it's sand it stain it\nUm they will have registered ahead of time and let us know what type of you know imagery or what type of stunts all they want on it so we help them you know apply to central and paint it and everything so they just totally ready to go and hang on the wall when they leave for those of you are listening\nWho have been following the waiting fact I Am now a married woman and my caterer Debbie Moran bill of goods from the garden showed me one of your science down at the venue and I thought well how cool is that [laughter]\nI Love getting together with other women I that's just one of those wonderful things in life um and and usually you go and you have a few drinks or brunch or many petty but this is this is different this is a new way to to get together and and have fun\nIt is I Love it and ... and usual workshops for about three hours long so you know when I think back I Can't really think of the last time I actually had three hours with a good friend of mine or um my mom or my sister or whoever you want to attend with or even a date night it's perfect but\nUm you kind of put down the cell phone you're not texting each other you actually face to face smiling and laughing creating something and all these feel good endorphins and everything just start flying around in your brain I mean you love it you leave their loving the project he made and just appreciating all that one on one that you had with your friend or friends so I\nLooked on the website and it looked like a lot of the the designs are very similar from from one to the other art can you can you get super creative if you want can you can you go off the reservation or or do you have to kind of make it look like the like sort of what you said you wanted to do well what we have is\nA gallery on our website and there was nearly two hundred items in the gallery so what a person does when they're registering is actually just using the design and the layout of assigned that they want to make when they get to the studio they're able to choose their own staying and paint colors so they can actually make it the you know there's and sit there decor or whoever they're giving it to as a gift I'm so\nWe recommend that you choose something out of the gallery 'cause there's so many different items to choose from\nBut by all means if you've got a particular project in mind that you ... you know wanting to make run it by me um I Do need to make sure that\nIt meets are designed standards and get corporate approval on most situations like that so\nUm so we can do both um but generally speaking most people because our art gallery is so vast\nThat they're able to find something in there that I'm thinking if it's something that we're have them for the most of them are personal I well I should say yes most of them are able to be personalized with your last name or or you know first names or cities or states are established states that sort of thing\nAnd then we have a few of them\nLike American flag type projects and and unpatriotic type projects that just you know they are as they are they don't necessarily need personalization\nAs you get to make 'em yeah absolutely\n... one of the things that made me excited um and and this is probably there's a segment of Prescott population that can relate to my excitement when I saw the sign because I have an Arabic and be and we have a cute little named ... the ... the hill lodge and so I I'd love to get some signs that\nLet's say it's so cute and I we get a lot of requests for that is a very popular a class yeah yeah do you you can help people with their ... to firing of their [laughter]\nA hundred percent yes absolutely so how did um\nAre you an artist Todd how does this happened this no yeah no I'm not I was guessing not because you have to engineer sons and you just told me you and your husband are both Virgo which is really really square with a trigger but\nNo not in the sense of astrology mathematics but um but nonetheless engineers and artists don't always go together\nI Know I I just feel like it's a foolproof concept and I think that's what I like about it and again I'm circling back around to just the fact that you get to hang out with your friends and yeah and you're facing each other at the table and you're all working on your projects and and they always turn out\nThat you're going to get guaranteed crap you know I I'm not going to see that yeah I mean I Can't tell you how many times I've received emails from people just saying I just not crafty I'm not sure\nAnd you know talk them down off the ledge just okay it's gonna be fine we've got plenty of instructors there we take you step by step so you're not you know we won't allow you to to mess it up\nFor a mistake you know do people ever um worry that it's too cookie cutter that it's it's too it's too by the number or to cut by number I have not had that feedback yet um\nInstance if there's um a sign that has a heart on say the state of Arizona and you're needing to put the heart on your location ... wherever you're from you know get small requests like I'd rather have a star\nOr I'd rather have a you know I've had other ... like fire department people want to put that the Maltese costs there instead of the heart so I get little ways that people will make it their own and and make a different or they might even sign their initials on the front of it so I'm ... and they're choosing their own paint techniques and colors and that sort of thing so\nNot so much I I think everybody like this is very much their own thing they made yes yes so I'm telling you tell me about\nThe the the other ... holiday is as it did you say sipping studio painting fifth painting set me about the set part isn't it okay to citizens important that leads to me well it is important uh people like that so we\nHave a ... permit here in the state of Arizona and\nUm our customers can brand or whatever they're wanting to sit so um that being said any four o'clock or later class that's in our studio you're allowed to be ... will be so wine beer I'm certainly may have limitations on the on the corner of ... you know qualities that you can bring in but\nUm it requires a doll we don't do it correct to a large cylinder [laughter]

studio here on she's all that I'm ... Chris uh getting back to your franchise I assumed that when you first became a license and then a a franchise owner it was because they just do all the work for you and there's almost nothing to do\nWhatsoever a man wrong [laughter] presumably so I'm I'm curious but they're\nLike what are the benefits of of having having this this corporate entity that sort of ... up with some branding and ... says yeah you work with that you still have to do what is it\nAbout that okay so what I Love about board and brush they do provide us with this insanely large tool box of marketing type material and um we do a lot of social media\nAdvertising and and we count on people are sharing their pictures and they're part of the pictures of their projects and that sort of thing on social media and spreading the word that way um the board and brush\nGives us I mean first of all I'm putting happens to be the first of the month we have new release stay every first of the month so we have Fifteen new designs today so but I Love about\nI'm just born brushes corporation they just they provide us with so much new material all the time to keep things fresh because I certainly do not have marketing background and I'm really didn't know the first thing about how to get\nYou know everybody to know about my business so they um we just have this huge team of designers and marketing people and um everybody's there to help IT people any I kind of you just can shoot us an email and you have a response almost immediately so I Love that um\nBecause I certainly don't know everything about owning this business you know but there are there to help you and\nThere's no doubt I feel like I've got a huge ... system and and group of people behind me that's that's tried and true and they\nHave to do ... what are the things that you are sort of on your own with or or where where where are the parts where you're just like any typical small business owner that you know you wake up thinking about that as as you go to sleep or do you know and and all ours and between um what what are the parts that you still have to do and and still have to manage\nI suppose as far as building your calendar out and you still it's up to you to spread the word in your community and just let people know where you are because you may have noticed we don't have national type\nCommercials on TV or anything like that and the newness of this type of business is something that I've you know run up against the fires people just not\nKnowing what it is and what we're doing and you know that it's there so the more people that come in and obviously the more if they help you have spreading the word but you still have to rally people up and and get them on in there whether it's um team building events we have a lot of um\nOffices and you know medical practices and things like that that have their Christmas parties and that sort of thing and they're so um\nSpreads spreads fast you know or they come in as a group and then they and then you know or they come in with our work people maybe\nDr the boss or whatever has has purchased all over their seats for the for the event and then they go home and they want to bring their family and friends and again and so I Would say just the challenges of letting people know what we do and where we are well you've come to the right place\nAnd what would you on the radio help what would you say to somebody who's like wow sixty five dollars for a sign that that seems a little Sunday\nI Would say I think that it's personalized and I suppose all of us could go to one of these big box stores and get cute signs right off the shelf and they're probably a little bit less money but\nIt's so worth it as far as the experience and building confidence in yourself and just walk in a way like wow I did that I stand and artist I'm I'm creative and I didn't think I was so really I feel like it's you know\nIt's definitely worth sixty five dollars and it's a customized peace and it's something you're very proud of to actually hang on your wall or to give as a gift um so you know I really don't come up\nAgainst that very often I mean I maybe you've had a couple of people\nUm ask them when I'm going to have a deal or a special or this or that and I'm happy to share that a lotta times when we do have a coupon coat or a special I'll throw that out there on Facebook and and people will see that you know right away Instagram too so we do have sales once in a while but\nIt is all day long worth sixty five dollars you know you're very and an eight us they say they say if you're going to spend your money spent it on and experience and for real and then this is like a mini petty only exactly hanging on your at all in all habits and twenty or yeah\nOr um is this is this a bit since that support your family and it's just you're not\nNo I'm In my head no um it's it's not yet you know and it may be and that's not what the most important thing is to me it's just I feel like I'm using my time wisely and and you know I'm\nI have a place where people can come in and have these good experiences and um it's just a really positive thing for me and I'm no right now it's it's you know paying some bills but not all the bills and they're both pretty new I suppose and and you know the business world um Prescott is is nearing its two year mark\nAnd um September and Flagstaff has not yet a year so\nYou know there's the business model one that is um designed to be a a fully like family supporting this is ultimately or or the yeah\nKind of a revenue stream like one piece of well the day it can be it depends on how you run your studio so we were given that freedom of corporates not telling us how many classes to have they just want to make sure that they're good quality classes of you know construction\nAnd as a positive experience for everybody so that's what we all love about it being born brush owners is that we can make it fit our own lifestyle and our own family needs and that sort of thing so\nAnd so that's what you're doing ... ... you are an instructor I assume so how did how did you turn into an instructor how do you how did you go from being a a person who had heard about this to the person who's like okay stand here okay well we you know\nMy husband and I have under construction company for twenty something years and so that's probably why our eyes are rolling back in our head when we heard about this because it just made sense as far as like what we get what we get would we get we get tools you know we've probably had most of the holes in our garage already that we needed for the studio\nUm as far as the instructing goes we do go to training in um Wisconsin heartland Wisconsin It's where the flagship location is and that's where they do all the training so they teach us how um but I think teaching comes a little bit naturally to me I I'm I'm okay with showing somebody how to do something and\nUm it's kind of a small group it's not hundreds of people or anything like that at the time so\nUm you can just get right next to him shoulder to shoulder and said just follow my lead do it like this and\nIt's a really easy thing to do so you know they catch on quickly they ask questions they just love the product at the end so it seems easy to to show them what to do to get in there and do that yeah thank you so much going on a show\nWe've been talking with Chris ... owner aboard and brush creative studio in downtown Prescott find out more by calling ... eight nine Ninety five to four

I I\nI understand what you're saying and you know we we intermingle the term emergency an urgent care you know um there is some some reasons to go to the emergency department and not come to urgent care if you're having for example chest pain or shortness of breath difficulty breathing your bleeding profusely\nUrgent care is not where you need to do you need to go to the merging apartment because they have the this facility the labs\nThe tools to fix that heritage and care we really don't I mean we'll see you but a lot of times we'll see you and send you over there and you may have to wait to be seen there as well um sometimes it's worth a telephone call do I need to come to you or should I go to the urgency department um\nAnd then this is a place to patients can find out where I Need to go if I have shortness of breath is urging care of the right place to go no because you may need more than just a breathing treatment you may need to be admitted to the hospital\nAnd you'd be surprised how many patients fight that and it's like you need to be admitted you need to be cared for her next twenty four hour for forty eight hours 'cause if not you could have a bad outcome free and\nWe begin this program by talking about how this is really a busy season for you\nGuys are catching a lot of runoff from the ER right now you mean as returns are people who don't go there to know as in as in trying to trying to accommodate people so so everyone can see someone right oh I see yeah um\nWe do and there's a lot of people that come in here that that was nice that they know that this is something urgent care can handle a sore throat a\nCough and cold type symptoms a lot of flu a lot of strap I Would say probably out of the roughly thirty patients I see a day um\nAnd then again there's three to four providers oh we're seeing the vast majority is cough fevers chills sore throat or trading accordingly and then occasionally the shortness of breath chest pain or something that we need to ship over the emergency department I Do\nHave those maybe had moments where someone walks in the front door with the kitchen knife stuck in a ...\nNo not yet [laughter] so I have seen that allow here who I Know they ah thank goodness we don't get that here now it's time I think they know they're supposed to go to our surprise we get we get some things that I give you an example I have an eighty that came in and um\nShe came in for coughing and we treated her for\nThe food types if does but she had this persistent cough for a while to come in so of course with a chest X ray we found nodule\nSometimes not a big deal sometimes a very big deal as she needed follow up right away so she went to a lady and we got her get her as a cp which we only have extra imaging here we don't have ultrasound\nOr see tea here at this facility so we sent our across the street and then as as today I had a gentleman who was a long distance truck driver\nWe found a large mass in his chest I Want to make sure he falls there but his primary care provider to ensure his his uh good at all he was just down the road ... came in for a coffee thought he had the flu and it wasn't the flu yeah I was you have these ... shoes to people when I'm speaking with now their", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Wait Wait...
