Hi Eric how are you I Am wonderful\nI'm excited to have you in the studio um for for this reason for this reason you are Seventy years old is it okay if I just close to a few more months of our minds not quite not quite soon and and so you're in this year\nYour um your starting T transition from sort of middle age into early not middle age yes I Am [laughter] and and and you're making your making choices around that\nAnd I I you talk to we we talked before we sat down to do an interview about it then I just I Want you to share with our listeners what it is you're doing with your life now\nWhile the ... the seven is a a moment of reflection for sure because my body is still good I'm not on ... or anything so I'm but I'm conscious that\nI'm getting into a decade or I'm heading towards eighty and probably not as many years ahead for sure as before and I'm making conscious choices of doing really\nWhat I Love to do which is both working with people of being of service I think that's pretty important for me and\nAs well as doing a lot more physical vacations or you know adventures probably more than vacation because you know vacation is maybe\nTwenty four seven for me but um\nYeah so that's that's kind of it doesn't frighten me you know\nBut uh I figure okay is as long as it's good I may as well just go out on those opportunities and I'm On this for ten minutes is going all out look like for you in your life right now well going all out involves many things um you called me a joy coach I call myself a joy pedal or rather than a coach\nUm I uh I Do joy intensive I work\nOne on one with people or one onto within its partners are a couple or um and I work with a model that is a looks at all the parts of you um the parts of south park's work so ah there's some um\nMarket typical the parts you know like people might have a a often have a partner partner then my call partner husband wife Nate companion however they want a term that but\nAnd a feeling that they're that they've been born wanting to be an relationship you might be a mother or father has that thing that you want you've always wanted children I'm a little boy a little girl and knew how that is so we go down to I go down that and people usually have about twenty twenty five parts in themselves\nAnd then we start if I ask you um [noise]\nWhat are what are your qualities Erica you might named me four or five\nBut if I look at every part of free look at every part and we asked each part okay mother what his mother bring to the system she might be loving nurturing caring so you've got three called is there if I ask you what your partner brings you might say Loyola sensual you know whatever\nSo by the time we've gone through somewhere between twenty and thirty parts you'll have identified you know multiply that by two or three you'll have like Seventy qualities that you contribute so it gives you an idea that oh I offer a lot more than\nWhat I reduced myself too and then if you start asking each part what would bring\nHer or him joy then you have you're looking at all of you because your partner might want\nWhatever but your little girl might want something else and so by taking by stepping back and looking at everything\nThen you start having you know oh you know ... it's not okay for mother to take up all all the the energy and the system I I'm going to leave room for my artist or you know et cetera\nSo that's one by making that's making room for those those pieces you make room for the joy that those pieces for the long run yes\nAnd when I you know and people can see that but I I'm using my hand out here but I work on the wall and the posted clean\nSo everything that that that I Do with with people gets recorded on the wall we look at it in different ways I jumble it there's a collage that comes into play\nThere's just feedback if you've had you've been writing in your journal that's important I might ask you to read it and I I take the the the salient points and put it on the wall so everything gets recorded there and then you organize it\nDepending on you know whatever you want and then you can start making action plans because you've identified what would bring your joined the next three to five years and how do you want to go about that but I work in the positive\nWhen you talk about Seventy pieces or Seventy different little part said I I start to feel overwhelmed like nah many parts qualities that many so Seventy qualities when you when you start to get into these like twenty or thirty parts with ... said maybe up to Seventy qualities\nI start to feel like well that's all it that's a lot to cater to is he is by the time he gets the action plan is it a little bit more we do just\nThink about this okay you're having a dinner party and you're inviting all the parts of you to that dinner party they're all inside you all those little voice and oh why did you do that well I just wanted to I went off and an adventure or whatever so they're all part of you is it you're giving them each one voice rather than just speaking from one voice your conscious that\nYou know if you bring your judge to a discussion with your partner you're probably not going to get anywhere right if you bring your lover\nAnd it might be different so it gives you like a tool to kind of maybe just step back a little bit like why am I approaching it with\nThis partner it it it's a little um [noise] it that's why I don't do the work so I tend to in one day not anymore I Do it over time because it gives you a time to get used to thinking of yourself and not just one voice but of of of many voices and honoring all the parts of you\nIn these in Tempe says these are one on one you're not doing anything for you\nKnow I'm the only way I mean I I don't do them in groups unless it was a group that that we had a week to ten days to be somewhere because it's too hard in a group\nTo get to the same place yeah I might do many happy hour's why might do two hours with people and and that that a whole different ballgame but generally speaking the intensive it's one on one and it's over several sessions had our son nice he could pick your joy drink [laughter]\nWell if you could you could that's a good idea actually I haven't done that that thought before but yeah it is fun with a glass of wine and you're just talk about three things that bring you enjoy it or put that on the wall and you're doing many collage and and uh then people write a six word or a\nSix word mantra of of their joy that's a fun at that's a really fun exercise as well I Do do that\nAnd I think I can probably do it for about fifty sixty dollars a day that and then you've got out of the airfare to that and I haven't totally calculated what Lisbon and an Porto they all guys I have a place to stay\nSo I'm thinking probably three thousand dollars\nA thousand dollars a month in Europe\nI think so yeah it sounds like a nice place to including you know the the they're fair I pay more than that to do a month and Prescott yeah every single my mom and you have a husband so that's slightly different story there it is time for a break we'll return

workshops dot net here on she's all that I'm ...\nNATO you mentioned in our last segment you use very lightly touched upon the fact that you helped put some declaring from time to time I do I do that\nI don't consider myself a professional organizer but I can I work with people um\nTo help them choose what's really necessarily live and what's not\nAnd I have no preference if you put her on the right on the left the down low however you want to uh organizer but um if I look at I helped a friend and client and I was taking care of their dogs they were on a two month Cruz and she asked me if I Would organize recording studio\nAnd I said well before you go and I do that let's spend at least a little bit of time so I can get a grasp of what you're looking for and what this looks like and when I walked into the studio I was like\nOh ... how am I ever going to do anything in here because there were boxers on top of filing cabinet boxes in front of the bookcases the closet huge closet was like a jumble of things and stuff on the guest room you can see the bad you couldn't see the floor\nAnd I said you know before we even start like you'd have to we have to create space somewhere else because I Can't but you've got no it stays here so we found in her in her basement we're able to find some space organize a little bit of that and I said you know get at least a couple of more bookcases\nBecause you know there's a lot of fabric and hoping feel anyway they left on their crews and I stayed with a dog and I every day I I it took a long time because I didn't know what all those boxes contained and you'd find needles in threat over here and over there\nI even after two weeks of still trying to make sense under the bed I found a whole other stash of things but you know it's like every day I Would wake up and I'm finding that it's funny but you're still needed containers how am I going to rise of space and um\nThat takes time you know you and this in a way was easier because she wasn't there\nBut at the same time you know it's not like you can't throw things away or anything but it was like some point it was highly organized just the fabric and then I thought OK well she's got there had been a system you know when you take away things you often find people system and by\nColor was won by you know floral or by oriental or\nYou know different things but that was probably my most the biggest task I've I've ever worked out was [noise]\nGetting a sense of what I had the place and then figure out how I could fit it into the space I have I made a couple of trips to Phoenix I went to ikea and I bought a couple of more of bookcases and had found somebody to put them up for him and everything [noise]\nHer kitchen or if I can switch over to the kitchen the kitchen was on another trip\nBut I you know somebody said well maybe I shouldn't be there I said you know for the kitchen I'm not going to change your pension is going to bend your pantry where you have your ... going to remain where you have your cereals your spices that are made in the same candidate but\nSome of our cameras you you'd be afraid of opening up because there'd be attacked by you know all these things will be falling falling down on you\nAre but that was in a way easier because there was more contained and I knew I knew what a kitchen posted here yes you do exactly\nAnd there were a lot of outdated things to you know expired foods and stuff so that created space that was an easy task and the cool things to do so when she got back how does she feel about the organizing shop you done for her she loves well once you got back and saw the cool thing studios immediately hired me for the kitchen so that was good\nBut there are a couple of things you know that that she was looking for in the cool things studio that somebody was able to tell her where to look and some there are still somewhere because I remember but you know over a seven week period what exactly right exactly did I put that particular\nWas there a time during that period where you were concerned that you would not succeed in your task\nI was concerned I wasn't concerned about succeeding but I was concerned I Would not finished before they got back because of the house looked like a tornado had gone through it because I was pulling things out and in their bedroom the hallway the kitchen the living room for one quilting studio\nI'm Talking about a big quilting studio yes this woman was extremely passionate has her Texas very passionate about or textiles and I think got little would get overwhelmed\nPeriodically and put things in containers and then buy more stuff and put things in containers yeah so that it was that was a major major task yeah yeah\nHow her quilts there after she still cool thing I should say all this happened very recently filmmaking beautiful quilts I don't know if you know three years I might be might not be called back to help her again but I'm a yeah she's ... she is very um talented and making quilt yeah\nThe declaring this thing that you're doing is it kind of like the pet sitting where you just sort of fell into it it just\n... or you know one of them I don't I I fell into it because I've you know I've I've helped the people who are selling their houses I felt pack their houses and I've helped a stage it\nBut using not not not what you see on HDTV but just using whatever's in the house or removing things and just making a house look spare and I you know the houses have sold and a few matter of a few days so\nIt's something I like doing something I've I've always liked doing for myself and I found myself a few friends and things so I felt just like I fell into pet sitting falling into\nThe decoder ring and the results of people are happy and you know I work I work with them I have is that I have no oh you should get rid of this you haven't worn in six months maybe you should but maybe that's something that you are inherited from my mom and wife's if on the you only where every two years why do you have to give it up I don't\nBelieve that because you haven't worn in in a year that you should you know\nGet rid of everything

I Would like to feel better right away too and I don't feel good um but unfortunately there there is not anything in\nA for many many years physicians were getting people antibiotics for I'm known viral types and then ... and this has been\nDocumented to lead to um bacterial resistance I'm In a lot of different strains there's solar recommendation than ours that definitely not do that or\nJust to help avoid those problems\nCan you talk a little bit about some of the problems that come out of the bacterial resistance sure ah so you know\nFor a basic bacteria there are certain antibiotics that are\nKnown to\nKill that bacteria\nAs we use antibiotics more and more certain bacteria become resistant to those antibiotics and as a so that for the view them to move to a bigger stronger\nMore encompassing type of antibiotic and he's now won the same pattern follows\nSo what's happening in hospitals around the world there are there are now bacteria that are resistant to all antibiotics\nOr there's no known cure for the people that need to the super bugs the superbugs yes indeed and so we've all heard about these on the radio and\nUh you know we haven't found them around here anywhere force in LA but um you know we're we don't want to be part of the problems leading towards that or we want to stop that word\nIs would to maybe some of this is speculative boat I mean what do you really do about that this was a problem that we have sort of like we've opened Pandora's box right you're\nAbsolutely right we have open Pandora's box and\nWe do the best we can do their antibiotic development to is you know in the in the tubes for these bacteria and then we have nothing for and\nSays healthcare providers it's our job to maintain you know strict policy of not prescribing antibiotic medications unless they're absolutely needed\n[noise] when you think about what got us into the situation was that more that we didn't know that the providers to know or was it more irresponsible a prescription right and I think it was [noise] I\nThink it's kind of a combination of both I mean you know medicine or balls on a day to day basis and it's easy for somebody to date to look to the past in point fingers or without knowing the whole scope of the scenario yeah\nInteresting though how uh for me I'm thinking I'm we might think that what happened fifty years ago in medicine has very little to do with my daily life for granted there's the progress the technology right we learn and we grow until there's that", "show_name": "Wait Wait...
