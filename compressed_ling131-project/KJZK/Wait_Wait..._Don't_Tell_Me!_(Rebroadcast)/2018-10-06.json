stories and useful chatter from northern Arizona as women [noise] a few years ago I worked for an obscure Pacific Northwest companies is always find a saying good intentions are not enough\nIt's mechanisms that matter today that CEO Jeff ... is the world's richest man and he still pursuing mechanisms that work to try to Amazon for it today and she's all that we're talking with Michele bakers his\nBusiness quite communication is all about using technology to create rock solid communications mechanisms will chat with her about making the transition from the corporate world running her own business what it is she actually does in that business and since it's around mothers' day what's like the bouncer business with being a mom\nMichelle Baker high high so um we just mentioned to your mom tell us about what makes you a mom this\nUm my wonderful doctor makes me I'm I'm I'm I have a one and a half year old daughter Cora Delia so you know it's pretty much on her [laughter]\nTo make me a mom and and did you do you go into this that's the kind of have something to do while raising your kid out at home I did\nUm I actually so the first year and a half with her I was working fulltime preoccupy college and they gave me some of the flexibility I needed I'm working remotely but I was working fulltime in watching her fulltime\nAnd so it was a lot to balance and kind of a lot to do especially with the mommy brain so I'm at the beginning of the this year I actually took the opportunity to step down from that position and start my own business and what were you doing for you have a college I was the technical team manager\nAnd a systems analyst in the student development\nYou're a geek for hire a professional ... yeah like pretty much speak for higher I like you got a new bumper sticker slogan right there\nIndeed indeed so um so you you left you have a pi college and he thought to yourself I'm going to make a business correct and that businesses it's kind if you call it clean communications correct yes and tell us all about it tell us everything All right well hold back\n[laughter] I'll Try not to might need to stop me though\nSo fine communications is a consulting company and we aim to increase the businesses use the technology for customer relations primarily this involves instead of saying an online presence and basically establishing the marketing you need around communication some emails campaigns texting\nOther things that people are still using like newsletters that we're doing that in digital form\nAnd then also social media management and online review management\nIs there some sort of platform that you guys offers that you guys are that you right now it's just me\nSomething I just started it so I'm you know I'm doing the whole show which I actually really enjoy both my parents owned their own businesses so I've been in my whole life and have always wanted the opportunity I did real estate for a few years too so I have worked for myself and kind of that foreign before\nSo it is just me and we are actually not partnered with any type of systems like management ... sales force anything like that\nBecause we don't want to be biased um I Want to make sure to bring any opportunities to my clients that I can so basically I meet with a client and see what they're already using and then just I have a list of a certain platforms I liken prefer and so I Do tend to go to bed and I go to west but I don't work specifically with any one system\nAnd so you're doing your customer relationship management to things like sales worth or or similar similar sort of on line popcorn software as a service kind of thing that's\nSo sad that you throw it in there and and just sort of talked about mechanisms at the top of the show this is a way to sort of automate or or centralized um what people are doing in order to\nMuch you know as so it is working with a lot of small businesses and you know owning a business is a ton and it's nonstop until we want to come in and help people out of me and take that part that they shouldn't be focusing on because they need to be focusing on their industry and their business\nAnd so we can take that part and help them automate it and make sure that they're communicating with their customers and their clients their partner\nIn an automated weighing an easy way and I am and selling them time I'm selling them money selling them are like you know you don't realize how much goes into having an online presence these days those are full jobs having the social media manager\nAnd you have to have one if you have a business you need to have an online presence if you're running it or not you're going to have one out there because there's so many reviewed platforms\nYou know everyone's always on their phone on their laptop well not so much so I taught somewhere in the city and on my laptop that's what I said that but you know they have their phones tablets and they're constantly checking in on social media and checking in with what they're doing\nSo a lot of business owners and even if they're making the choice to not have\nSay a I'm a review in the platform of Yelp it still could be out there if one of their customers felt like put it out\nThere and you need a managed to that exactly exactly made me think of a long time ago I don't know if it's still up and running Second Life where you had to sort of whole online existence saying and and we're all in Second Life we are you're you're sort of creating the storefront in the in the online verse that we all\nYeah I'm a pilot hollering ... because you know I'm not I'm more of a consultant um like the industry itself is for consulting purposes and I definitely go into the administrative side effect of business the fat but a lot of businesses already have created their storefront out there so I really kind of come in and clean the windows fourth\nDo you have are you watching her all day while you're doing business where you have a nanny or\nI'm sure we actually have um we relocate it down to Gilbert recently and so we're still coming back and forth to ... businesses to help with up here and then we have properties up here and everything so\nAnd I'm a Prescott Tony ... so you know this is where we\nWhere we are still but when you have a house down in Gilbert and there's a um co working community called mom Plex How nice and so um I get I get to go there with ... and so she gets to go play with kids and I get to sit and work with moms that is amazing they are\nAmazing and they have started quite fast come on down area it's like okay I'll save you a spot\nIt is time for a break we'll return shortly with Michele Baker you're on she's all that [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise] support

I'd love to talk to about um get kinda down into the weeds and\nAnd and talk to you about what actually happens in your business I'm a ... tell me some stories to tell me stories\nAbout um about coming in like ... that that the state that you found people in in in what you did to get them to the state that that you left them in in what that was like for them in maybe in social media or customer relationship management or whatever you have\nBut I Do um have a specific example we can talk about I'm kind of start with the process so it starts with the initial consultation and basically because I'm not specific on industry and that's kind of when I send out questionnaires and get a little bit of feedback from the business on how big they are or what they're currently doing systems they currently have in place\nUm it's interesting most businesses already have things in place that they're not even utilizing to them a lot of my job to as making sure what they already have they're using\nUm and then with that and we kind of work through well where the there there are points that they are aware of and then the ones I found and so I'm a specific example of one I found is a\nA business that was put down a lot of events and they were doing it primarily to face stuck they have most of their community as on Facebook they're followers on Facebook or their clients their customers so um they post their events on Facebook as well and Facebook's pretty you know on top of it for if you say you're interested in the event that's going to remind you\nIf you say you're going tentative and sent out a reminder an hour before\n[noise] so um it it's kind of all built in there for you as a business it's a good thing to utilize unless of course\nAnd it's it's not always on Facebook or doesn't have Facebook downloaded or you know with the current events around Facebook deleted Facebook can you know so only using Facebook as their event managed that was actually really hindering them and hindering their outcomes with their events that they were putting on these amazing events and they felt like they were marketing them\nAnd when they were they were doing a ton of marketing doing graphic design sending out digital content on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and then only using Facebook as the event management platform\nI'm so then people would not show up because they didn't get these reminders so that was the gap that was the cap and they didn't see it because they're putting all their time and effort into Facebook so um what they were doing was a hundred percent correct in what they you know they have the ... in the ... had not in the in the process right\nBut because the outcome was that what they need it you know when I step in and said well you got to look at your demographics and you've got to see if your clients and the people attending these events is actually on Facebook and they're actually using it that way\nAnd just because they're saying they're interested when they're scrolling through you know and Trent before bedtime doesn't mean they're actually coming to the event\nSo we implemented a year and with that management and texting capabilities\nWhile so that um when you send out in the event\nYou actually can send imitations and for the demographics that signed up to be texted that they would get this tax invitation love getting text messages from businesses I'm a huge rough I I adore it when people didn't like it but now you know like think about just your dentist tax you like uh for your appointment you're if you're in this I Know I had it on my\n... my father shot up to George ... the last man standing with oh yeah\n[laughter] no tax uh yeah it's it's you know I I don't have Facebook on my phone and it it was before that and it's just because I couldn't stay off of it and I did so I don't actually have social media in my life a lot but I Do have my text messaging data and then to remember these things when I say I'm interested I exactly and a lot of us and to kind\nOf have a a you have a work flow around that like you would have to remind ... and you have like certain times and the schedule when they come out so that was the big gap that we felt for them and how that works it was fantastic I mean the attendance shot up at their events and and they actually\nPart of it too is so we do the reporting in analytics you actually get a better idea of who's coming you're much more prepared to\nDo improve the process is that you improve your own visibility into those products them how they're working yup that's fancy I Know it's pretty simple to when you think it's a fancy but it's a simple concepts getting in place yet but knowing knowing what's going on in your business is half the battle sometimes to completely yeah I mean because we were down there you're in the weeds or in the thick of it\nAnd some of my in my own business you know we we have a lot of enthusiasm among our clients and its super traffic and I'm I always kind of wondering my and my leaving opportunities at the table that I don't even know that I'm leaning and I have no idea I don't know how to know if I Need someone from the outside kind of go hey look I'm seeing a whole over here\nYeah yeah yeah do you um do you ever find for your clients um that process is that you suggest are do they end up being too heavy for you know if we can have I'm\nA I'm trying to think of an example but sometimes the process or the platform that you offer is just way too heavy more feel of a business that somebody's doing\nDefinitely are usually offer 'em a couple of different like it um [noise] a couple of different solutions like basically that the heaviest option out there the most difficult what's going to take the must work and then a couple of these airlines I also\nHave a couple of different areas of focus on you know we offer 'em a number of services and so I like to work with my clients to make sure that what we're bringing to the table as what they want to focus on as well so I've actually started I didn't even know what I was going to do this when I was building the business out I started like this ongoing customer\nBase because ... you know customers these businesses coming to me and they said this is the thing I Need facts and then I say I also see this is a mess\nSo we could fix these and they go oh my gosh I didn't know that I had no problem being see I Can't fix anything but a right now and then in three months let's get back to be and then\nNext year let's get back to seize you're always working in your business and then you have that tiny I work on your business yet from ten to carve out you've got to wait for your marketing budgets come around and do so yeah\nIt's like you know me [laughter] I'm Talking right to [laughter] gosh I have had a thousand questions and they all went away oh I'm Sorry oh no it's fine for Stephen I'm always making him at um she's\nI Know it's funny because I had a like a thousand different ways I was like oh I'm Around the different solutions we offer\nYou were talking about back there yeah no I don't know what do you want to talk about\nI used to be really when I first started to show it was like\nI'm like really nervous if I wasn't a thousand percent prepared didn't nail it a thousand percent and I just go and I just don't worry about an hour so well you know I think it works better as a conversation and then you didn't mean like I got that right here yeah pigeon through when I'm Talking about um holes and coming back and processes and\nYou know I could talk about the how interested in its let's go on with the marketing budget so um it's interesting is today a lot of small businesses don't have a marketing budget so what did they\nNow they just don't have money to put into it they have are celebrating their rights and and so part of that is me coming in and saying you know if you put the money and look at what we can do like look how many customers can bring in by bringing this system then and getting your communication ramped up in your online presence ramped up\nUm and then with that too is I like to point people into the direction of there's a lot of free platform I mean like social media like get out there and Facebook and it's time is money so it is not free completely that takes a lot of time\nBut um you know when when you don't have the marketing budget out there there are a lot of other solutions that you can find to ramp up your communications with your client\nIs there any business it's too small for this stuff\nUm they said that uh in a twenty seven twenty Eighteen flu season\nThere were eighty thousand total deaths from the euro eighty ... eighty thousand that I'm from the flu and flu related illnesses and complications and that's just here in the U.S [noise] um it also caused about nine hundred thousand hospitalizations um for Pete's up\nYou know which is a very important to me\nA ... [laughter] yeah so in last year as a flu season a hundred and eighty children died ah from the flu and that's the highest since two thousand nine when we had that each one and one um pandemic really\nYou know that's why getting the flu vaccine is important because for that one hundred and eighty children who died eighty percent of those children are not vaccinated\nOh okay so that was a different way of looking at the statistics wasn't around we talk about a twenty five percent success rate but\nI guess it doesn't cover as you were saying\nIt can mitigate you might still get sick but it can lessen the effect mhm yeah right I Know that the team over Joshua tree pediatrics makes a real effort to get all the kids vaccinated with all the different vaccines uh-huh um how does it go your efforts with flu shot in particular\n[noise] well we have you know we've gotten better with the um uh getting parents to really see the importance of getting the flu shot\nUm although it could be better um like last year the vaccination rates they said for children with about only fifty eight percent that's for the whole us and I would say that that\nKind of is what I'm what we usually see maybe about maybe a little bit better maybe sixty five percent say yes to the flu vaccine\nThere are number of them is to associated with the flu shot 'em we can address those I've heard a lot of people say I got the flu shot last year and two days later I was down with the sick and so I'm not getting the shot again because it made me sick is that possible\nNo um if you have if you have a very good immune system\nAnd you get the flu shot um you're not going to get sick from the flu shot because the flu shot I mean there are two kinds of flu shots there's one that the um [noise] inactivated type a and that's the shot\n'em and that means it's a dead a virus that has no capability of replicating of causing an infection it just has the viral particles that would induce an immune system into your immune system to fight against the real thing\nAnd there is one that is the um weekend virus that's the live attenuated a virus that I'm administered through a nasal spray\nThat one's theoretically can if you have a poor immune system you know if you're in you're in a compromise Ken theoretically cause illness but there have not been a lot of reports about that actually causing you know that's\nJust the one the nasal spray which is the live attenuated virus\nThat's the only one that has the potential theoretically theoretically because it you know it's still a live virus but it's a week\nBut if you get the shot the actual needle uh-huh you're getting an inactivated that started term\nYeah activated a virus so that has no capability of replicating\nSo for people who say I got the shot I got the vaccine and then I got sick\nA there are several things you know that could happen first is it did while it they might have been exposed\nTo flu already um 'cause it takes about a couple of weeks for the flu shot or the flu vaccine to be you know to really caused protection so if you just got it like been exposed already then yeah you know he won't give you the protection\nAnd then it could also be something you might have gotten sick with a different virus not exactly the flu okay you know when people talk about the flu that you really have to ask them so what were your symptoms and say oh we have the uh the vomit in the diarrhea but that's not really the real\nInfluenza influence is more of a respiratory disease\nYou can have vomiting or diarrhea\nCan yeah you can have vomiting diarrhea with the flu but the main symptom would be a fever and respiratory symptoms like a cough sore throat runny nose\nHe has well how long does this would tend to last when you have the virus\nTwo weeks you know about ten days say yeah\nHow long is the incubation period so from your initial exposure to the flu to actually getting sick\nUm the typical intimation period for the fluids from one to four days usually about a couple of days I'm so if you're a healthy adult you can even be you can start becoming contagious a day before having symptoms\nOh okay so this one another potential factor for people who saw got shot and then I got sick that could've been exposed and incubating a couple of days before\nRight ... yeah yeah who should get vaccinated so everyone\nI'm six months and older um should be vaccinated against the flu\nA but particularly want to target a people who would be sick or um like um kids younger then five people fifty years and older because they tend to have more ah illness um and complications from the flu um people who have\nA who suffer from chronic illness that is like a heart problem um kidney problems\nNeurologic problems respiratory problems of course ah people who have immuno compromised a immune system who are immuno compromised\nSo they they should those are especially the people who need to get flu shots mhm or are there any people who should not get flu shots I mean you said children under six months of age mhm\nChildren under six months of age um if you had a previous a\nSevere reaction to any component of the influenza vaccine than you know you should not be vaccinated\nI mean you have some kind of allergen or an allergic reaction okay um and also there's this one type of reaction that we call a recall GPS ... syndrome oh I've heard about what is that where it's\nAn ascending paralysis that typically if if it can be kind of infection that can be caused by by immune reason so uh you get like a paralysis that starts in your lower extremities your legs and it kind of starts going up\nAnd it usually resolved on its own I'm In a few cases it does that resolve but\nUm so if you have this uh if you develop GPS younger a syndrome within six weeks after getting a flu shots and the recommendation as not to be vaccinated if you're not likely to be you know if you're not [noise]\nI'm good at you like you have to weigh the risks and benefits of the vaccine so if you're likely to if you're too sick you know if you have a lot of a chronic illness with that would make a really really sick from the food then you would still consider giving\nThat person the flu vaccine but if that person is a healthy a percentage of developed GPS after getting the flu vaccine that and I said I don't\nI'm don't give that person the flu vaccine\nSo I guess I wasn't clear what what causes ... syndrome\nYoung boys syndrome or can be caused by certain types of infection um\nAnd it can also be induced by one immune system basically it's it's like a [noise]\nUm [noise] what are your body produced it's almost like an auto immune reaction because it's a your body produces antibodies that attack the nerve cells and that would cause paralysis or communist ...\nIt's not very common it's rare yeah I've only seen one case when I was a resident pediatric president and one case when I was a medical student so\n[noise] you know I guess I won't say how long I've been practicing [laughter] nobody but I've only seen two cases in several years [laughter] yeah [laughter]\n[noise] who [noise] who knows when\nIt's time for a quick break on focus on your health we'll be back in a moment for more with Dr ... and it was right on the ground\n[noise]\nSupport for the Arizona community radio network is
