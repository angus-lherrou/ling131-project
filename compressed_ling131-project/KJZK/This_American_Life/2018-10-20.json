know people would drive down the road with their truck with a quarter would in the back of the hog sitting on top you don't see that now but it was really really\nJust western country western lots of you know that sort of atmosphere right the rodeo was real day again and our culture was really bag whether you're the water wars yet we have a lot of wars downtown which are great fun as a kid\nYeah oh yeah we've got you're right I think we've got the last two years of water wars I think Tiger Woods\nYeah it went away so you mentioned by western art yeah so what about that\nWell and it was a lot of\nPeople in town now who are in the ... were showing work around town so you can find work by a Coleman you could find work by never occur 'em and they weren't big names at that time yeah right yeah they were just there are no amazing ...\nTalking about putting pressure on the map as far as from you know a topless artist amazing yeah so um how did you you you paint as well as you don't just owned them yeah where are you paying thrive when did you start how did you begin painting ... thought about you know I have\nDone that as long as I can remember that's just been to me I did that before I could speak and it was my first language yeah and I'm so making art is a way to express myself it's just been kind of innate right yeah just something I always wanted to\nKnow where your parents are the people or were they ... how would I Would you do find them conservative where they you know\nWell the conservatives but their artistic my my dad would paint a little bit and he stopped\nYou know in his thirties but he had some paintings that were really wonderful that he did when they call you know we were so bad sneaky eyes on the people you know looking and then my mother is a musician and she's a linguist she can speak for languages she really play a guitar accordion ukulele she's just\nThis very versatile multi talented lady so we always had art and music and I'm\nJust wonderful things around us in our lives what\nA great background that come from you know what I mean that's I think there's somebody you know people when you look at um families are individuals you can almost tell their background first where they came from a family where there was literature is a big thing art music no drama that type of thing so you you\nStarted actually working at the same like some ...\nMhm okay yeah I had worked for my father in real estate appraising which isn't far from art as you can still young yeah ... yeah and I'm always enjoyed picture framing going into frame shots when I had my own pictures to do and that kinda thing so\nI thought well OK at real estate market in real estate appraising kind of just fell off when they stopped regulating the markets very much you didn't have to praise property below a certain value and then there was no work for me to do right dad didn't need an assistant anymore\nTo arguments he basically laid me off [laughter]\nIt was a a way to cut back a redemption in the workforce so I went and applied at all the shots in town and treatment I was the only one that called me back everyone else was you know had enough employees right um and it was between me and another guy who lived in a tent and that was how I got the job because they couldn't get hold of him [laughter]\nRight right now yeah\nSo you're like what plane one point

four\nThis time she really you know what they what they wanted was to be a memory uh you know an important memory for\nIt and so as a community you know she figured Prescott really\nRemembers them and that's something very deep and profound and our community and she wanted to do that rather than like a scrapbook or a photo I really wanted to remember the hotshots where's the peace now\nThe piece of it in the chamber of commerce and you can go see it if you want to hang it up over there\nRight in the corner of a court no or the corner of a\nGood one and only as good don't want us to get on the

are we leave off oh we're going to talk about [noise]\nIt was about like the camaraderie and so forth and community involvement of downtown businesses especially over ... but there seems to be nice\nA deal to downtown so you've been business for Twenty one years mhm how long has been a member of the rotary I'd been a member of rotary for eight years now so it after this because I'm a lion and my my thought what\nMade you decide to go with the not doesn't wrong with that but I'm sure it's how what was what was your draw to rotary\nWell no decision that are made in vacuum so a friend of mine who I had gotten donations from us for rotary over the years always pressure NATO Kevin ... Senate primary club but and so she asked me there and I went for breakfast probably five times\nAnd and before I joined the club so I got five free breakfast Saturday and it was her persistent set right in the end you know he's not a good friend in there and and she said you know we do fun things we really have a great time and it's true we go we sing songs are silly you know we make we joked with each other and then we do service projects where we go\nAnd we maintain the Vietnam Memorial statue on the square and you know we I donate books to the schools and we've had repaired playgrounds and on polio vaccination to Mexico to sign up\nOr the Senate rotary mhm okay that's not what's one is that\nThe two dollars an hour there three actually yeah there's a friend here okay that up then Prescott so your frontier and set up your ... yeah or sort of got better like size so what is worse than the basic model mission of rotary\nWell rotary is founded on seven principles that keep it short they're just very humanitarian cause they are interested in women's rights in education they're interested in disease prevention and sanitation education and the welding and businesses around the world and they're an international organization\nFor talking about well being of businesses yeah um what do you see the future facet going in a kind of a microcosm nutshell I mean you've been here long enough now that you've seen we've both seen ups and downs and gross and stuff like that it seems to me that depression downtown saying this but do you think about what's going on right now\nWell business in Prescott I think will remain vibrant and it's it's a tourist oriented and people come here for that and it's only getting more popular for that\nI see Prescott really leaning towards now Dorothy culture and a big way and lots of mountain bikers hikers and and that kind of thing and I really see an attraction for that as well as the retirees and that people like to come here to vacation and visit and walk around the shops and they like the Clinton is and the cuteness of the dance right\nAnd so I see it leaning a lot more toward that direction\nOkay now speaking of a business growth and when you when did you move the art store starts me it was next year that was behind you while huh so what caused you to move it over on the ...\nIt was really a financial purpose there were other things I Can't really go into [laughter] but we moved it to be a smaller footprint and you know\nRate and lower utilities had of things but also there's a parking lot there are six street we when we were down town it was just off the street parking and even though we were right next to the parking garage and people didn't perceive that they could use that\nYeah yeah and that's a constant thing it's amazing how often a parking garage to empty yeah\nAnd it's so fabulous you can go\nPark your car walk across\nWouldn't be wrong and you're there you don't get rained on you know get snowed on I don't get hot in the summer and I don't I don't know yet and I don't have it every once in a parking garage so which services you provide or a dark store different from the gallery at the store we sell art supplies and we have a four hundred and by the assets on their full it's\nSo cool anything you want to do from oil painting watercolor it's at scratch boards to pass sculpting ceramics we have it all\nDo you do classes we do demos right now we are I classes around Hyannis but we sort of classes at the other great organizations in town there are a bunch they do it so if you go and look at our website Prescott aren't store dot com you can get our act or dot com yet you can see what kind of classes are going on in the area over yet we have links to all of us and it takes on their cell phones\nWell I just you know well you know I just kind of started dabbling about a year ago or so and the findings are like one in your shop over there for the first time I was amazed what really surprised me was not just the balance of you have to go to the novice you have no idea that brush their costs at thirty five dollar\nRight and even like well what bras do I need and then what painter any and you know\nAll the stuff the staff there who was that was in there that day I wouldn't want to watch but the first time I mean I really like I wouldn't say it was a kid mechanic shoppers were like\nOh help me I Know\nBecause you spend a lot of money on stuff that you may not be way more the the the job application yeah mhm so how many somebody's employees have now I have three there at the store really mhm yeah\nAnd and what they do they try to help you if you come in and you have that here in the headlights yeah they they try to help find out what you're doing so we can sell you the right thing to you know if you don't need the thirty five dollar brush we can tell you the three dollar brush she say you're going to put lack around it and you throw it away right right but if you're going to do water colors or something that you want to keep a really good brush and have a really specific\nLook then the thirty five dollar what might be for you\nSound really so we tried to kind of getting your head a little bit and figure out what you're doing so they can tell you the right thing not just that too many things\nAre some real quickly hours of operation at the ... are\nAt the friend that I have five Monday through friday and before Saturday\nI think I think that's\nOut there and we just enjoy that kind\nOf atmosphere and you were surprised that there were Michele I'm a chair or by an ad that helps us finding Chapin headed right trial are shut off the air\nAnd in fact you do have a fundraiser that made right\nWe can we actually see the show\nAnd I thought that I had a pen and paper and retain trail for\nSigning and we have to actually hire really caught\nHer one time I had her and I helped to\nShoulder shows and I found her program that we have to\nHave the ...\nJust to show to see live\nThis who really really good songs in Rocky Horror show\n[laughter] and then it came out I think what they're saying would tell me if I don't know for wearing white\nAnd Susan Sarandon I mean a lot of people do really that Susan Sarandon was the engine new in that in that movie but I think to you guys\nYou guys you know this is a big fundraiser and it's and it's obviously a really popular thing and I'm sure the tickets go really fast so again it's at the theater to twenty seven um you go to Prescott ... the ridicule for tickets to them because in ... right\nNow\nYou you know who you have a lot of the things that you that you do as to one stage family did it again we're talking the Jimmy ... who's the director of the ones they certainly theater you have on on November seventeenth Eighteenth even if it's a wonderful life coming up\nAnd so that's kinda interesting honor and interesting that you're not actually in the ... and you're watching characters character so telling us up on a\nTrue story of pain forties fires bringing shop\nWas perfect at your own renewed talking about it and again it's an ... an Eighteenth again\nAnd um [noise] if people want to know about when the family dinner 'cause he do how many productions would you say you do over the course of the year I\nCan't wait in line\nFor you to do in in this town so can you give us a sense of what makes up the ones they shouldn't be theater is this something that we each player you have open auditions can anyone who's listening to this become part of your theater company\nOf course they actually\nActually [laughter] I mean I'm playing the Facebook page we\nUsually dishes fan is one player that we're getting ready to kick off a year I mean I\nThink really share that information to the right to the summer programs for parents and we just\nHave it all out in January last year\nMy children and when you can just show me probably older sluggish rate that game [laughter] you know why ranging on but there's little choreography and I'm clear ever again part\nAnd we have to repeat them again repeat again\nYes\nAs a part of that is so cool to make sure you can come in\nThing over in their\nFamily for a lot of people here so\nI don't think everybody\nToo so how did you come to lump theater what does your background I\nBelieve it or not my child\n[laughter] so she\nThrowing chairs\nIn the country and she has she ever had a young age [noise]\nYou know and\nActually my\nFirst call and we're looking for her\nAnd I was in\nTalking you know their fellow right where to go and get things like that\nSo we're talking to me ... who is bringing to the steward el ... opera house the Rocky Horror picture show go to the uh Prescott el ... dot\nCom for tickets or you can coal mine to eat instead to who won three seven zero go to the wonderful box office is beautiful ladies and the costumes [laughter] those were too so you take it\nAnd to me it's a great thing you're bringing to print is a great family theater in this community and I love the fact that everybody who additions is part of the play was only in the name of the new theory which is really cool\nRight at your time Tom and thank you very much for\n... it'll be yelling at the actors to nominate everybody [laughter]\n[laughter] Oh thank you came to me and again people get to know more about one station theater\nI think that's why I have one state family theater just look it up and fight and will because I mean I'm sure if the other\nHand I think that's the right way which you pay
