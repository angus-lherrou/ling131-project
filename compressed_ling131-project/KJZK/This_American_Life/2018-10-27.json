[noise] um I had been here\nCollege to go rock climbing or the friend my father left here I mean we don't really you're here in college to go rock climbing yeah in the late eighties when you go to school I went to Lyndon state okay I'm I'm way northern Vermont and Air Canada and a friend and I just decided we were going to come out and visit from so\nWe came out and I mean the minute I got off the\nPlane I was just thrilled by the way that Arizona smells and the beautiful views and the incredible outdoor\nPossibilities of you know and venturing\nAnd so I told myself that I was going to move back some day and I ended up moving back I'm about Twenty years later of course\nMeal I mean there was all those full circle yeah it's a while but yeah so when you gave it down what were you doing\n[noise] um at first I was just trying to get my feet under me because of the thing or a thousand feet higher than\nYou know where I was living before that which was Vermont was quite a quite a bit to acclimate to and as you know I worked in restaurants because that's how we not right um you were running their minds and I was a bartender there and that was kind of my thing I bar tended\nUm I had a you know college degree but it wasn't quite ready to go into a professional job yet because I wanted to raise my kids and so working nights and raising my kids during the day was a great balance so what was your causes Korean psychology\nNot music now and I'm you know in fact the only thing I really had that was musical at that point was that I was a huge debt had don't know if you're a viewers or your listeners know what that means that a huge fan of the Grateful Dead and I followed them around for many years I'm In the mid to mid eighties to the mid\nNineties and still do I still have to have you had\nHow many shows you think you've been to over ... over two hundred oh you're a dead yeah yeah you're a dead hardcore and mores ... when I went on a on a\nName on the light and all that you know the data Neal lifestyle those people who are married and still has a sort of a home it plays every once in a like\nActually uh on her conservative little car a dead sticker when [laughter] when I was working for you and I realized that she and I had that uncommon now to tell you\nThat our children to look for what this has come up on this show probably one two three four five different time once it through here and that's why they're folks\nAnd I recall the first time I actually heard you say oh yeah and you remember this I think ... and this one they pay you to go on it was like a Sunday afternoon Saturday afternoon I think it was quiet time of day I came on the front door this level and you're on the far back patio\nAnd I don't remember how many people were there but I was in the in the bar area and I'm like\nMy God I heard you saying and I walked out on a thing and there was this\nAre you saying at that point in time right they perform\nAnd still is one of those for me want to stand out moments 'cause I remember the moment when and what I Love about you and your is your voice is\nYour sound as a genuine sheer and it's not you don't sound like anybody else and you know trying to yeah you know but I Love that about you and it's something that I think a lot of people when they come in and I hear you guys perform the guys are okay you know\nI said okay they're pretty damn here you know to the new show up you know but I'm just saying and so\nHow did you call to be that what what did you start seeing what about that about well actually interesting that you mentioned coyote Joe's because that bar tended there and um I don't know if you've had the wonderful bred them in on your show yet but I certainly know right Brad Newman\nWould play taco Tuesdays out on the patio before there was stage before there was anything there was little beer cart and then tacos that was a maid you know in a container\nSitting on a table somewhere and grab heard me singing along with him and I had never really been I have no musical training I had never really performed professionally until that point and Brad would invite me to come up in St Grateful Dead times attempt\nBy doing that and all that just paid off we're going to last Saturday in career was training and uh and then um I came to the attention of\nBecky dulcie oh Becky ... wonderful musician and she does Becky fast and we'll get to that in a little bit another group or another\nGreat unique personality crown and you know so so to speak\nYeah absolutely and wonderful strong powerful female musician and she and I I'm struck up a friendship over a music and decided to start playing together and we started playing out as two girls that was the name of our band in fact will be all talking about this later but we'll have a little two girls reunion coming up in another month and a half or so\nUm and so she and I started to get some notoriety and some attention from the local facilities that allow for music to occur only\nTo the local ... [laughter]\nYou bars right primarily\nI don't think that that's really played a lot at coyote Joe I was sort\nOf a I'm On a mainstay for us and so\nWhen Becky and I stopped playing together I had befriended I'm Michael Lewis and Dallas norm and who are in my band now and the three of us started a little\nA little things together a little thing to go their own thing together and now we studied it's a great that's a great name for ... maybe the expectation little thing together and go like oh like that [laughter] yeah\nAs well that only about it that's how music started for me I mean until that point I had maybe done karaoke in fact I Believe you and I may have a some of those nights our working at them and we don't hear that a karaoke to\nGather some yeah that could have passed that could have happened I was curious [laughter] usually funny before we go to a break on\nSoon you do this because I think\nHaving not having musical training or back ...\nOut you come about involving that that talent parts of writing you know the than the bridge and all the other things and\nWell I think a writer for a long time actually when I was in high school I ... I Want awards for writing poetry and what not yeah so I I that was actually my aspiration when I went into college with that I wanted to be a journalist and or some sort of a creative writer so that's been a love of mine for a really really long time\nTo just sort of flows out of me I just kind of comes naturally I hear\nI hear 'em lyrical content and love music so much that I Can't even describe it and so if you listen and Grateful Dead lyrics it's all just these incredible poetic beautiful um nature base a relationship based reflective\nI'm commentary on the human condition and really for me that's kind of what this is about it's a way to express whatever's going on internally and I don't even know honestly how to describe how it comes out it just I hear the words coming together in my mind they form a picture they create an image for me\nAnd then I put them down on paper and luckily enough I had these incredible talented people\nTo kind of system in putting music to them because I\nI only play a little bit of guitar little excellent yeah\nUm skilled a musician when it comes to instrumental edition and so the beauty of it is is that I have these people who have been thrown together with\nThankfully by the universe and maintain a city and making what I wanted to stay in your mind journal read yeah back a few minutes on the ballot using Kelly were back in ...\n[noise]\nSupport for profit Public Radio's provided by no Freeman dog and the arts stores celebrating over three years of service in the hearts of historic downtown ... the freedom of diet to twenty nine west ... street provide high quality customs ...\nPicture framing for photos to works of art and also find a fine art gallery featuring local artist you know medium they arched door at five thirty seven north six street is a whole line arched door offering a complete selection of our materials for visual artists in those two and three days\nClasses are offered up the art store in painting drawing sculpture ceramic kids are classes and more I came to invite you to the frame and die and the art store in downtown Prescott find them on line at heart store dot framing died dot com\nSupport for the Arizona humidity radio network is provided by God who was ... when your shift parry barb and staff prepared delicious lunch and dinner Andres and exotic tapas for your Donny pleasure enjoy the heated patio\nInto full bar with happy hour weekdays fly music Thursday and friday with jazz on Sunday or reservations goal for four or five Seventy it's God it was ... three sixteen west ... street\nJust steps from Charlotte hold museum\nIt's beautiful don't tone press gets quirky cozy and friendly place to meet\nThe press get public radio was provided by ...\nTo ... arena street in brass band stage to add to Eighteen or go to the street in Prescott celebrating nearly fifty years of ... all the main stage deliver a through the Eighteenth which the trip to bountiful\nThis is the point you'd story of missiles launched an aging widow living with her son and daughter in law you know three room flat and Houston fearing better presidents maybe an imposition\nMrs watch imagine that if she can get away and returned to her old home in the tone about evil she is certain to regain her strength dignity and peace of mind it's an amazing piece of live theater directed by military Snyder it's the trip to bountiful\nNovember a through November Eighteen P.
