eight three eight five to nine to let us know that you'd like to make a contribution\nAnd we've actually had a couple of people who have called in to increase their sustaining contribution to border radio\nEspecially since we've made a lot of changes to their service over the last several months including adding more new voices to the air I've been really excited listening to the students who have been on the air in the afternoons during crossing borders and giving them an opportunity to learn and grow and have these\nNew opportunities to listen to music that maybe they haven't heard before it it's been kind of fun to listen to some of our students I'm frankly mispronounce artist names but then then\nIt's like oh wait I have never heard this artist before and to hear their enthusiasm and their excitement about being introduced to a new artist has been really fun so if you've appreciated the new voices you've heard in the afternoon if you appreciate the fact that David
