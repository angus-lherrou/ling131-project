I\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nNo no\n\nIt was pumping knew from the album Jean ... and the KKK and I am most pleased to be able to welcome you to the global village Jane but if I Jay thank you great to be here this is actually the current group that you're working with a group of young musician jumped female musicians from Cuba\nAlbum in some ways represents a full circle in in your career that you've come around from being in men T someone who went to Cuba to learn about music to now being a mentor to a new generation of these issues that are coming up but you took a few [laughter] are you going to be in a way\nTo do that I Wonder if you could talk just a little bit as we started about how you actually came to Cuban music because you started was classical you've played some really adventurous jazz and then somehow you wanted a really different yeah well I guess\nI have always been curious and I you know I Love all different styles of music and Nineteen eighty two took the first trip to Cuba\nThat was just originally as a vacation now we're going there to no\nNo and no idea that there was so much music in Cuba from the moment got off the plane was music in the airport group lettuce onto the boss there was another band in the hotel lobby playing when we got out\nAnd there was a ... they're playing a carnival group and then that night was really tonight to clinch did when I was like an Eighteen these big band\nPlaying at the outside bar on the resort and I always laugh because it was like more people in the band and there wasn't a hotel there was like in people and all that was a brand new hotel tourism was just opening up in Santiago de Cuba\nBut that did it that night we were up there playing\nSoon the the first album that really came following natural did you make that that trip well what happened was we kept going back to Cuba we\nDid that trip and then three weeks later went to Havana and that that point I had a handful of names of people that I should look up and one of the names was ... and ... and\nWe went to meet them and we became great friends with them now Guillermo\nWas wonderful jazz drummer he played with Sarah Vaughan and and that can call and he broke a lot of a racial barriers there because a lot of these farmers been given like a white drummer to to play with and that can go into that now I'm playing with gamble bread till I Need they need that now they need him\nAnd so in those days before the revolution fifty the was lane every single night he said he never slept with so much music so much so much activities with Americans going back and forth in clubs that was just crazy\n... his wife was a popular singer so she was an Tropicana shows and singing a lot of the popular Cuban repertoire but more importantly as a performer of the afro Cuban folklore music\nShe was highly highly respected she would be on par and would have been the same age as the the cruise they were friends they knew each other and Celia Cruz went to Miami\nAnd ... just listed in in Cuba and she was quite groundbreaking in that she was probably first not only woman but first performer that went over live radio\nAt um the insistence of Fernando ... music colleges they're performed the afro Cuban music on air raids\nAnd got a lot of flak from doing that because a lot of the effort human um practitioners did not\nWant that music going out they didn't know what the audiences response would be you know the backlash from what seemed very lewd do is you know music secretive they wanted to keep it to themselves but she wanted to if they wanted to bring it to the people\nLet's hear a little bit then from this this first record in the song ...\nRight so that means that's in a afro Cuban dialect and Luke where me and that means forever strong unhappy old Doris strength\nAh in Cuba to preserve that music to start up maybe your own group was very difficult but they did form a few of those groups that were located by the government\nAnd the um the folklore group you're Ruben dabble attend peaceful clerk group they were all dock workers in Havana they were not if you looked at their identity cards it did not say\nThat they were musicians they were not\nTheir identity was dock workers and so one of the things was it took us almost a good year\nTo be able to get them registered as a musician so that they could go into the studio with us to record\nBecause they weren't allowed in the studio so I just give you a little bit of that idea of like certain groups that they were organized by the government is these guys they they performed at the docks that were working and that's how they they formed a group so anyway that's a little tangent there but I did want to let the listeners know about that\nSeems certainly when you get past a certain point in history that what we broadly call Cuban music is kind of a blend of and so many things are when people meet so you had this meeting of\nAfrican influences and African culture that was coming from slaves who were brought in ... and European colonized was and they to block their music so there was also a European classical traditional yeah that was part of it as well and that also is something that that you explore a a bit as well can you trust\nEspecially in a ... not to do with the Cuban piano master and yeah there is such a ... with the with the Contra dances and the um dance songs I'm definitely a little bit but yeah well that music those mysterious her yes we'll be or sort of the pre\n... to what came out later as being known as mumble and mumble can be like the certain section and a piece where it gets you know they're really funky where the mic\nSections Contra dance is came first and then that song came came later and the country dancers were from the very heavy in European influence\nComing from France and from Spain sort of society dances where the CIA little ball and very very elegant and of course the people were usually lighter skinned and very dressed up and there was a certain distance but they don't have the bodies had to to be in a very very elegant\nAnd then it moved into the dance songs where it opens up a little bit more gets a little bit funky here in their Greek composers like ... and uh\nThat um you know wrote hundreds of like\nDamp song so that that whole music\nHas a very very very different feel to it even though it's still\nThe ... there's an injection of that very heavy Cuban things start to really come through it's beautiful took a little bit about the the piece that we're going to hear ... with his son ... from the countryside in this record was done with the two pianos the Greek ...\nElite Frank Emilio who was the one of the most famous Cuban jazz pianist\nPart of a group called Los amigos with the Greek chow\nDecode record is thin drums we ... we made this record so that people could really focused on hearing the music and the the harmony and really get a sense of that very strong European influence in the music so we did with the drums it's just these\nTwo pianos and myself with to this is ... from\n... in the Cuban piano masters\n\n\n\nDo but that in the Cuban piano masters with ... de la ... here in the global village and Chris I'm Will return in just a minute with more music in conversation with Jane but yet\nWhen you can get boring ...
