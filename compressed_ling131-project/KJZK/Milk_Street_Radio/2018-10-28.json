Madison\nA at a at a significant important in college or buy a beta\nAnd Dr ... thank you for joining us today\nThank you very much for having me\nSorry about the long winded introduction there [noise] it's okay you've done so many incredible things and that make a difference I'm sure many patients lives\nAbsolutely and and the goal is that we're continuing our learning every day\nSo it's one thing that I meant we we ended up yeah we we practice every day at that as much as we the patients but also thought fill in the learning louder I'm investigating new opportunities for therapy treatments that services and education that we can provide starvation\nA man our patients teach us right\nExactly and guy and in fact you know what what happened but I find is that is in since the end they using the Internet they bring in a lot of information\nAnd then at what we did as an integrated medicine group here is that we didn't further investigate ah another thing that we weren't even a pretty to ah and then we're able to validate or or actually a guide to therapy or information more accurately\nSo you had a team of integrative medicine physicians and practitioners in Albuquerque\nWe have a we had a a a kind of a one stop shop for service a center where we incorporate all the different ah what I'd say lifestyle or traditional modalities from our vet medicine Chinese medicine you know eat a lot of the body therapies we specialize in detoxification program called ...\nWhich is that as an ... treatment that's one of our signature services we also do a lot of the traditional massage sound therapy energy healing we'd do yoga\nAnd meditation and enter variety of things and then my further specialty is accustomed formulation of dietary supplements and making ensuring that people are taking you know the effect of and high quality products\nAnd some of these were going to get into as the show goes on here that are I think really quality work that you're doing um so\nYou spoke at a recent conference this is where I learned about you advances in cancers strategies symposium which was a this past April in Stamford, Connecticut\nAnd I know there you spoke about a\nPlant based the importance of plant based science and natural anti inflammatory to help prevent and treat chronic disease now is inflammation uh\nAt the root of a lot of chronic disease on a physical level today\nSure so it actually I'm I'm actually writing a book this year should be coming out the end of the call inflammation nation and what we've been doing is compiling all the research and data and all the variety of Sciences in western medicine from him a knowledge e anatomy vowed chemistry physiology for example the physical sciences as well\nAnd we've learned that from allergies to asthma from five ... flight is\nFrom a kaleidoscope cancer research now suggest that most if not all diseases are beginning and are worse than what the inflammation and so the thing is we look at what are the things\nUh people are patients are taken internally that will trigger inflammation and then what are the things that we can offer them in terms of diet lifestyle and natural therapies that can actually help block or reduce those inflammatory process is\nA lot of it and let me just interrupt it does a lot of information beginning in the gut\nActually adopt a and that that's why when we talk about food and talked about plant based diet we want to look out which foods are willing to consider pro inflammatory that cause inflammation meaning worsening any symptoms of any condition and those foods they're anti inflammatory that decrease inflammation or don't aggravate the system at all\nHow much does it vary from person to person in terms of you know there's there's a lot of dialogue and controversy out there about gluten leading to information and the guards or and or dairy products and I know a lot of practitioners when patients have an inflammatory illness\nOr have them stop gluten wheat products and stop dairy and see how they respond\nAnd that's a that's a great place for people to start just offhand but we've looked at is two things we look at moving people moving away from animal based proteins which causes inflammation and then we have the move towards that well they call a whole food plant based diet so we're eating more plants\nAnd his work is at San Giovanni center in Albuquerque New Mexico did I pronounce that right Dr pie collects and you have any\nUh before we before we took the break there we were talking a lot about inflammation and you were addressing how foods so many foods are pro inflammatory\nAnd we got off on the subject of genetically modified foods and how they lead to inflammation what is it about foods can we go back to that I Know we were talking about pharmaceuticals and natural anti inflammatory I Want to take it back as we start to segment to\nTo what Dr ... how you how you look at foods from a perspective but implementation\nAnd when we look at food there's there's two sources of foods\nAre two categories of foods those are anti inflammatory which helped reduce inflammation and those that are ... and that that increase inflammation in the body and there's two major pathways that most patients are people consumers might now here's something called negative threes\nAnd they get three fatty acids like fish oil for example they might hear or they may be taking care of a negative sixes\nAnd when we look at what our food supplies comprised of is that the average person used to have a balanced died of almost a one to one relate relationship of\nSome anti inflammatory ... laboratory and everybody did fine but over the last thirty forty years that the the the ratio has change where\nYou know that that that consumers now be in the United states looking at the data may state almost thirty to forty a mega ... to one a negative which that in essence what that means that people are taking a lot more pro inflammatory foods\nThan they should be and those ... foods are predominantly animal based proteins and when we look at and all these proteins or there's a kind of a ranking ah which which animal based proteins actually have\nWell they call ... planet tore markers as cytokines and then it actually trigger inflammation and you know in LA level or order as organ meats\nLike liver or they like beef pork lamb or\nEggs chicken and then also fish particularly if it's farm raised a not wild caught and so the the the skew that's happening is that you know food is cheap nowadays and you know people can get a double cheese and bacon cheeseburger for a dollar for example at three Patty's on it and that\nCascade or information that they're consuming and higher announced than they used to\nAnd so when we when we look at decreasing information from a diet not only side of the sensitivities after we test them but we want to move people to eating more we call whole foods plant based diet studies means more foods more vegetables grains no more beans lagoons\nThose kind of thing and decrease the animal based proteins\nAnd balance if one is taking animal based protein having small portions rubber whistle largely vegetable and or possibly grain meals that is correct a statement well actually\nYou know we're actually moving our patients and will and when you're looking at certain date is like from a doctor calling Campbell from a Cornell has written to the infamous you know the China study right into the largest comprehensive nutritional study done worldwide today I we we were looking at how can we aggressively\nA move people's health in all directions and so we actually trying to eliminate all animal based postings now again that doesn't mean that anybody can not have a pizza chicken or have a you know free range piece of beef but in general most people are consuming ways to large amounts and we want to really reduce that as much as possible particularly for example someone has a really a chronic\nSevere disease or even cancer they were going to be very very strict because we want to get a hold of their physiology and prove their bodies in eastern function very quickly\nAnd ah so I Know at the break there we were talking about uh allergies and ... and a lot a lot of chronic conditions read as well as cardiovascular constitutions in Ashland bronchitis and stuff\nHow much are based in information\nWell they're all\nWorse than the by inflammation so inflation is not necessarily the cause of the disease or diseases but it's something that triggers the diseases to progressively get worse so someone's allergies they might be allergic to hear now because we have a lot of juniper and cotton wood trade\nSo that's an that's an allergic response but it's an inflammatory signal that's being sent from the immune system when it gets a irritated and so when people take an anti histamine\nYou know they're blocking the the the ... the release of certain cells that that caused them to be congested but you can go one step further or one said earlier and that cat skate by taking anti inflammatory and so the nice thing about natural anti inflammatory that we offer to our patients\nUm is that it addresses multiple we we have a we have a a we've coined a term that when people are taking natural products or any products you should have side benefits not side effects and so instead of just always giving only one targeted therapy as you know a one to one relationship we should be able to give people something that has multitudes of of benefits\nThat makes sense you know you were talking there about the distinction between a lot of the pharmaceutical anti inflammatory and national anti inflammatory and the difference was in safety is that the is that the only real difference to want a listener\nAnd Africa St Louis is first talked about safety so I mentioned you know Seventy million prescriptions were given on just the the end said a ... billion over the counter ah was purchased a ... a year or out of the common handset which again is like an ibuprofen or rocks and the you know those kind of things\nBut what people don't realize that the amount of side effects that occur and in ... as prescribed and kind of ... in a controlled setting\nAbout twenty thousand people actually have a death related to uh gee I Believe and a hundred thousand people are hospitalized every year in a controlled setting that means if you were either right ibuprofen for somebody who sprained ankle and that many people per year we'll have that event\nAnd you know this does not include just over the counter use where people can go get a thousand cap was that the big box store\nFor you know maybe ten dollars and take the ... so one of the things that most people don't realize is that that these common over the counter anti inflammatory all come out with a black box warning from the FDA and a black box warning means that you can have cardiovascular and gee iris\nMeaning strokes heart attacks gee I Believe\nUh that can be fatal and they occurred anytime during the used without any warning symptoms and this is something that you know a robbery you know you've been probably using you know a ... anti inflammatory for very long time but it's not until recently last couple of years where these warnings\nHave been placed into products so not not many physicians nominee pharmacist not many patients are\nHave really understood that this has occurred over time and yet we haven't been consented or educated to understand that these are not risk that are very clear and present that are that can agree with that if I'm just taking something simple as I just went to the gas station that ought to ibuprofen for a headache\nI remember when I back in my emergency managers some days back in the eighties nineties I Would meet ... who would tell me that they would really caution their patients against doing too much I'm appropriate because they'd seen how it affects punch holes in the kidney\nA gum airline mucus membranes show and then\nThe kidney there's that when when people are in the ... the biggest uh I'd say prescribe regional people who take over the counter\nMonster will anti inflammatory such as ibuprofen into products and is for osteoarthritis you know so are you know arthritis just joint pain and if you actually look at all the data now that's been published particularly overseas where there's less you know buys for influence\nThey've been saying for years that we should decrease the youth because people who take these and said actually have shown increase progression of osteoarthritis increased\nYou know problems with a joint and so it should be used brain limited for very specific times but people who take it every day for the joy clean are actually accelerating or increasing the damage to their joints\nWhy would they get an accelerated osteoarthritis if they're taking something that lowers information\nBecause there are certain things that are again and the pathways of\nHow it affects you know when they use these things as targeted therapies although they do decrease inflammation they actually have a new beneficial effect on the article or caught ledge\nAnd so they actually celebrate certain things that are affecting the the what we call the cartilage matrix so there's actually some of these now that the generation of those joints and it's been documented there's there are tons and tons of studies and in fact that the one of the biggest thing that was done in England a couple of years ago and\nIt was an orthopedic center that multiple hospitals or an and patients following those they were taking a X rays those with um osteoarthritis taking an end set on does not and it's supposed to be a five year study and at the end of three years they stop this study because those people were taking and said had such a dramatic change just on X ray\nWow and the thing is you know most physicians here I've never had to study why because it's been published in the European journal and you know we do have some times are owned by says here in the United states will say well we don't believe it or we just don't get the information because drug reps are coming to her office in telling us otherwise\nBut we have to look at what's the preponderance of evidence based medicine that's non biased by industry and the you know the actually the earliest study that was done on showing the demonstration of the damage was actually occurring in the United states knows early in the sixties\nSo you know we're talking twenty twelve and we see commercials every day on almost every other every other channel for an end said and still nobody realized is how much data showing that these things are not as safe as we expect\nYes and I know that uh I knew we covered the area of safety what about Africa see with the natural products I Know we all the\nNatural products for example the ones that we use and then there's a product that you know we as taking me over ten years to to work with for years to develop and manufacture a and there's basically four ingredients and one of them is Kirk human which people are familiar with which is\nOr reservations goal for four or five ... ... three sixteen west ... street just steps from Charlotte whole museum

helping Madison we're talking today with Dr ... pi\nDr pies or clinical assistant professor at the department of family and community medicine at the University of New Mexico school of medicine in Albuquerque he has a book that's coming out I think sometime later in the year called inflammation nation which\nGoes over much of the stuff we're talking about in our show today\nAnd some new uh before the break you were talking about this plant you called and asked him I'd never heard of this before is this available to the consumer level\nAnd now it's called Sharon planted in but are there is put together and our product called nutrition edge and\nI actually became an expert advisor to the company because I'm vegan myself and I actually wasn't that way to tell you the truth ah you know go out as a vegetarian most of my life and then I went to college in Los Angeles and went to medical school and I was told I Need to eat a lot of protein so I eat a lot of steak and chicken burgers and French fries and those kinds of things and then\nBut what really changed my life was after I I I did the training a plant based nutrition or with from ... Campbell information at Cornell um you know I looked upon myself like you know I don't want to have heart disease I don't want to have diabetes and well could I Do now team it prevented even do certain things may run you know and and family\nAnd so I decided to let me describe myself before I even started recommending to my patients and I felt better ever since uh my numbers of of my last time I blush I go to great I I have no allergies sentence as I used to have and these are simple things that I started moving away from\nFor fish will for example or omega ... fatty acids either I was looking for a couple of years on who can make a a vegetarian oil a vegetarian and they get three that would be clinically beneficial I did find a company and they'll call center\nOut of Canada and a half the people that are my website they can see some information there that's linked to them but ah there is a product called ... and that's what we can give the people that give clinical doses of the EPA portion that ... is that is not a really are easily available to get some slacks\nAnd also high da chase comport portions the thing about going to them about the fish oils that\nHe will if you're taking it from a plant or if you're taking from uh the fish ... which union says the purity and the safety official and most people don't know that most people go to the big box store and they buy as I called the vat of fish oil and most companies will claim purity on the label do face on top of purity tested or some type of quality assurance\nAnd that's not necessarily true what what people don't know is that companies all they have to submit one study or one test on a bottle or bats that has passed\nTo keep on record but the big box stores can basically sell a billion bottles official and one thing on record that might be a few years old uh well we like to do this with with a Santa and and and what they've designed and why I've become an expert in the company that said they didn't have something called pure check\nAnd check is that each bottle has a specific lot number where that batches a quarter from and the patients are the consumers can go on to the website enter the lot number in and tell them on that bottle\nYou know does it mean to label claimed does it have the amount of ... of on what it says on the bottle is it oxidized has what they call a peroxide and as the dean into talks these are kind of test for oxidation inland city and purity testing of like lead cat and the mercury inorganic arsenic PCB dioxins if Iran\nIt will tell you that per bottle and no other company right now is transparent so even some of the the companies are Robert that you get probably solicited and and I just listen to my office and here's doctor vitamin companies or they'll say okay\nWe're we're we're ...\nWe're Icelandic and it's beautiful fishing villages they show us all the data and they might show me a result that result might be six months old and I want to know when I'm taking something or give me something to my mom or a patient of mine uh that uh it is it is free of any kind of heavy metals or contaminants and it is getting what they're saying on the label\nYes and uh that's really valuable information by the way for everyone who's listening um\nIf you have a particular type of machine that can slow down our uh our interview and really listen and study and some of these things down because we have a problem Dr pie is so enthusiastic about his work with the result she's getting\nThat he's is enthusiasm is overflowing I'm just I'm just trying to create some humor here it's one\nResume awful awful it down for the list\nThere's no don't slow down this is great now okay I'm a bounce a protein and cancer promotion you were talking about your lifestyle experience there and you became a vegan talk about uh would you talk about that a little bit uh I think a lot of people\nBelieve that they have to stop there they're only going to get protein from animal food and then it's okay to take small amounts of animal food with each meal as long as you're getting on a how colonizing vegetables those kind of things which the product\nAnd I think from from a from a general standpoint as most people were to do that\nOr they would beat there'll be large benefits are unfortunately most people aren't getting quality meat products in general\nSo again most people aren't getting free range organic uh animal pro teams\nThere you're going to the local store and getting you know ground of a pound a ground beef up the big box stores are getting it from the fast food industries which is again genetically modified and full of chemicals and ... you know when you look at a plant based diet do comprehensive short term long term clinical trials perspective large epidemiological\nStudies all them all show without a doubt that\nThat plant based diet meaning the reduction of animal based protein and increasing the plant based I Will show better health outcomes and all categories\nAny from cancer diabetes heart disease you name it it will always be better so it's something as simple as diet can be that effective why not do it it doesn't cost more actually costs less because of not you know you're not buying expenses steak\nOr you're not buying fast food and why not go back to what you know your grandmother my I told you when you're young as eat more fruits and vegetables you know get some more rest to play with their friends and share I mean I think some of those\nKind of common things that we we grew up with and now\nNow where she studies to show that time we say well wait a minute when you see plant based uh I\nBased can include some animal food here is that correct or not mean that\nWell planned bases means no animal protein at all plan I mean ... yeah just plant based means just\nLot of ... the ... diet what we mean is because even the dairy which vegetarians like Isaac consume a lot of very particularly\nSo as most college students would do or medical students would do as well um is that we're finding out that certain proteins in the dairy for example case in which is the one the main proteins and dairy if somebody has a a a toxic effect\nAgain when all the animals that he's been shown in the in the China study and Dr Campbell done a lot of research in this research actually started in Nineteen Seventy four actually in India\nUm they would find that for example if an animal already had a ... a trigger mechanism safely induced\nA liver cancer in an animal and we were to give the animal a certain amount of a protein which came from casing or or the dairy a at a certain percentage or it would actually grow the tumor\nAnd at a lower percentage no tumor growth would occur even do that the insult of the talks and it was so even though the animal supposed to have liver cancer when\nWe give say hepatitis or apple a toxin to ... to induce it for the study or it showed that there was no growth and so they started to follow this data and look at or how much protein is needed and what sorts of proteins and and just to make the long story short\nWe find out that it's it's it's less than five percent of protein meaning from an animal source or actually less than ten percent is what is is needed to sustain the body\nBut more than that then that actually will start to promote certain types of a toxic insults or certain cancer cells to grow up so it's almost like an on off switch so ten percent correlates about sixty grams of protein so really the average American only needs\nFifty sixty maybe sixty five Macs\nOf protein the average American today consumes anywhere\nFrom Seventy two hundred and forty grams of animal based protein and it's very inefficient protein has cholesterol which everybody's always worried about the Olympics and it's also pro inflammatory so they'll know what we were to say that\nAgain like you were saying a smaller portion more vegetables and fruits and grains absolutely that's always show a benefit but ... and a lot of patients we want to do better than that we want to get better than average we don't want them to feel normal we want them to feel optimum health and wellness still lighter more energetic better mood better thinking better libido", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "city":
