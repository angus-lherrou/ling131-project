{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KJZK", "content": "And many of those people are having to take our contacts for this pain and what has developed today is it there are a lot of people who are having difficulty with becoming addicted to narcotics or or other ways of\nAddressing the pain with pharmaceuticals or with alcohol or with cannabis and this is what we're gonna talk about today with our esteemed guest\nA doctor Jeremy do been\nDoctor do been as over a decade of experience and treating addiction and he teaches regularly in this field of addiction medicine and substance abuse he is a practicing family medicine physician and addiction medicine specialist\nIn Colorado He's a pioneer in the field of addiction medicine doctor do been started one of the first outpatient treatment centers in the country that incorporated holistic integrative strategies with conventional medical therapies he incorporates integrated tracks for patients with coke are in chronic pain\nAnd or psychiatric conditions he teaches regularly on this nationally his book is your recovery the integrative expert guide to recovery from addiction Dr ... thank you for joining us today\nThank you for having me\nAppreciate your finding time I did I what city are you in a game\nOr up here in Fort Collins Fort Collins tell me why you wrote the book the book that was it was a labor of love it kind of poured out of me it was one of those things where I kept driving home after work and realizing\nStories I ... I was seeing where very unique and they were very individualized and they were very different and they didn't necessarily fit the mold of the textbooks\nAnd it's a little by little I started writing down different stories of people that we're finding long term recovery not necessarily short term detoxification are just getting off of the the drunk of offense but\nLong term years and and like and I would I realize is that people were a finding a very unique strategies that really respected what worked for them not what worked on paper you know what I mean and so it it it really just kind of poured out of me a ... over the last few years and I just had a kind of get it down on paper\nYou know so I thought it was interesting in in your initial biography of the book you describe as you talked about you were just trust or what modern medicine could offer a people who are suffering with addictions could you talk about that a little bit in what led to your work in this area\nSure um [noise] no I think it was more of a disillusionment with a conventional medicine and the truth is as a as a as a family physician and ... dock I use medicines like I Am a I practice evidence based medicine and uh we do our best to stay within those ... those guidelines\nAre but I think one of the the the disillusionment so I had about addiction and an hour at least recovery from addiction\nWas that we weren't really settling with a statistic that we would never settled with with other chronic disease type state of tension and diabetes uh COPD ironic obstructive pulmonary disease and\nAnd ... and we lose our kids to be honest with you I mean we were losing it you know I think it's probably in your community just the way it is in ours we're we're losing our our team children that are twenty somethings that are soccer moms in our city council men and I mean these things happen to everybody and worse and that the mortality rate\nWas it's just climbing exponentially especially when it comes to the prescription pain killer abuse so I think that that's what made me feel like I had a I owed it to the my patients to\nA take off the blinders a bit and say let's see what works instead of what doesn't work but what what just based on the evidence and how we just kind of keep telling the line\nAnd why do the terms addiction medicine and substance abuse accompany each other\n[noise] I guess that's a great question I think that the the the term substance abuse is more of an umbrella term that that it can include really anything that\nSomeone loses control over and in other words they have lost the capacity to control their own own use of now that could be anything from alcohol to gambling to to heroin yeah\nThe idea that substance abuse or ... I think lays on the continuum between everywhere from the beginning which has dependents and we can talk hopefully a little bit about that go on all the way towards a recreational use all the way towards medicinal use and then I think you start getting into problem us which I think the ... with\nWith substance abuse and\nAddiction medicine I think has evolved throughout this psychiatric circles as well as the American society of addiction medicine and\nAnd I think speaking to the idea that we as as physicians are as a medical community we ... we have to do something [laughter] something so we we throw the word medicine at the end of it when it really is you know what kind of healing\nModalities or strategies are trajectories can we create for people or help people in developing their tools to to heal from this and not just treat the symptoms of you know and I think that's the essence of integrative medicine from\nYes they do agree on I think that you're right in integrative medicine is the intelligent application of those principles and thinking through why someone has become ill and\nIn gathering evidence based approaches that will kind of ruin work together synergistic way with people and um so I Would agree with that\nYou mentioned something called the dependence addiction continuum what does that mean\nYou do it's it's one of the main things that come up for me when I'm seeing people for the first time as a certain level of of education I think that needs to occur and\nI thank God the terms are important because it allows people to\nTo really stratified where they're at another word sometimes people don't necessarily have problems when they think they do have problems and some people have problems when uh they they don't you know and the the word dependence um I mean I mean really I think needs to be clarified with the idea that I get I give you an example yes\n[noise] I drink a cup of coffee every morning if\nI sometimes I have a cup and a half if I miss my coffee I sometimes go a little headache um dependent on caffeine you know so\nWe really would not give it a headache if you if you didn't miss that day with the cough\nThe difference lies and the level of tolerance with the caffeine in other words\nI don't need two cups tomorrow to have the same effect five cups next week snorting espresso two weeks after that and then all of a sudden I'm knocking over Starbucks I think that's the difference between as you look in the continuing bitter independence and addiction and I I ... if I could give another example\nBomb [laughter] this is a ... and this is why I think it's important because it's ... it's not\nTo separate camps there is really a continuum here in other words it's not just say the guy to strengthen his coughing and then you got that the person over here that is\nAddicted to heroin and cocaine methamphetamines and has lost their job and their family and their health there's a lot of people very between that and I'll give you an example I have a\nVery nice patients she's a\nA ... elderly lady and she is on chronic opiates therapy in other words she takes a little bit of hydrocodone in the morning and she takes a little bit in the evening when her grandkids come over sometimes she takes a little extra\nI kind of inherited her like she's been doing it for twenty eight years so we kind of the decision was made that she was doing well and and part of that is about eighty percent of people eighty to eighty five percent of people actually use chronic opiates actually don't necessarily have a problem with it it's the ten to Fifteen Percent that kind of make the press\nWell this ... this nice lady she she lost her husband sadly a A N and he died and all of a sudden she was increasing her use in the evening\nOf her a hydrocodone an opiate or prescription pain color so we brought her and we were talking a little bit and what it what we realized was that the medicine we're starting to do something different than help her with the pain it was starting to help her with her grief response with her anxiety with her depressed mood\nAll of a sudden one was a half a pill that night became one became too became three this happened to very innocently this happened uh without warning and this is the person that didn't necessarily have a history of abuse or addiction\nNow with with with her it was it was\nA little easier because all we had to do is really explain you know I think you're using this medicine for your grief response let's think of a healthier strategy for that and now she's back to her her her normal a user dosing for the for the medicine which some people that are predisposed to addiction\nAre you there they have a family history or a co occurring mental health disorder or they have actually a personal history of abuse it can be a little more dangerous I think as as medical providers we have to have our antenna up that dependence can very quickly going that direction towards addiction\nYeah makes sense that makes perfect sense yeah I agree and I know you you mentioned in your book how the journal American Medical association published that I'm most physicians have are have wolf all training in this area\nAnd I think it's up to family and friends to make these observations as well as the patient to be self observant if they're getting into a place of uh having to take too many of the\nParents will send their young youngsters to to get help with and my observations have been that a lot of these young people are placed on high doses of multiple pharmaceuticals and uh\nWhat can people do ... how do you approach it if someone comes to you and says uh how can I Do with my chronic pain\nAnd not have to be taking so many pain medicines because I wanted to add there that the pain medicines have Tylenol I haven't seen him in in in them and if they're taken on a daily basis long term those can do real problems with deliver\nYeah I think that's a very common\nQuestion I I think that folks need to be clear about what they want as their outcomes and when I when I mean that I say when\nYou're talking to a patient the idea of what are your goals have some people say well I really just want to not be in pain or at least have my pain under control\nAnd I want to create a life that I'm In control of my use of whether it's medicines supplements anything\nAnd I take that off and that's really what people want is they won control back on their lives are often people will come out of rehab or our detoxification facilities and and actually you know some of the places nurse and have a really wonderful reputations I think that the peace like that is improving over the years is the importance of an after care plans\nAnd when people come in and ask specifically you know I really don't want to be on my medicines or they have these issues\nI think the idea of helping people take off their blinders for insect and say what are the risks and benefits of every intervention we're doing and sometimes the idea of you have to ask what shark is closest to the boat in some ways in other words the addiction closest as the chronic\nPain closest and sometimes it's both and this needs to be to be a spoken to and all I mean the idea that\nIf some folks are going to create a strategy of a non pharmaceutical interventions or they're not gonna take medicines and a lot of cases that can work if if the right plan is may lead laid out and if things aren't working that they have a good team to kind of come back to and say hey\nWe got up the ante this isn't working but sometimes it is the integration of some of these medicines I think I think specifically what you might be asking is [noise]\nOpiates so people that are on your hydrocodone Roxy code on morphine ... opioids that are using these medicines that can that then develop a problem\nSo often when people develop a problem with his prescription opiates it's it's it's very hard to go back to them in other words\nYou can make the same case with alcohol often when people have a very long term history with alcohol abuse ... it's hard to then come back to recreational use or to our occasional use or if they do I I guess ... you and me don't see those people [laughter] yeah but they do they seem like they're they're not around\nAnd I think that the sand exist with opiate so it is really laying down to somebody\nYou know we need to create a strategy for recovering from this addiction with these physical cravings with these brain changes that possibly have occurred with long term use or abuse but also let's create a non opiates strategy and that can include some medications possibly but that are non that are not opiate non addictive\nAs well as really does Austin\nA strategy that include non medications from everything from exercise to physical therapy to a Chinese medicine acupuncture to pain psychology I mean there there's the the the list is actually quite exhaustive or the or it's quite long but the ... unfortunately again we're talking about earlier\nIt takes time you have to sit down and you have to work with people and you and and and people have to be willing to to do some work\nBut it's much easier to take a pill and that's yeah yeah the mentality of our nation and you know and that probably need that that probably definitely need to be to be challenged and in the face of addiction\nIn reference to what you were talking about there can you reverse brain changes\nThe data seems to be emerging with that um for a long time we've been thinking about these might look like permanent\nBrain changes and there's still some data that supports that uh and looking at MRI scans and PET scans of people's brains have had been abusing opioids\nFor a long period of time there is some a rebalancing or some repair that that can't that has been observed in certain cases and that's been\nSeen in a [noise] a doctor blooms work\nUm them in the mid west where he's been using certain amino acids supplements and and and ... and a new neutral suitable type interventions\nAre unfortunately we don't have the long term data to be to be honest we don't we don't really know so the idea that when moms that tell us when we were little don't do drugs that can cause brain damage there's a chance that she was right\nUm and that we have to respect that and I think part of this as\nBeing somewhat realistic to if if you're doing everything you can do with somebody and\nThey keep relapse and they keep ending up in the ICU an overdose thing in the emergency room you know you got to know when you have to upped the ante to kind of use what works and not necessarily what philosophically are culturally jibes with what you think there should be doing so I think that affects our decisions have been too\nYeah and you know I was reading in that article over criminalization of pain that I had referred to earlier she mentioned in their house Florida has become the pharmaceutical a drug capital of the country in terms of prescription drugs for pain\nAnd there are a lot of clinics and a lot of places down there that people go to to get the pain medicines and how is that going on a state by state basis in this country towards making the kind of changes that will uh provide the kind of programs that people need\nI think that I'm a ...\nA substitute mental health association as well as um the current administration has been advancing certain initiatives to attack prescription drug abuse specifically which is good because the\nNumbers are are showing that we absolutely need that it's going to be slow I think just like most a government intervention is with us but it so it has become up to the states as you're saying and I think that state by state the the use of um [noise]\nA diversion type methods such or they're trying to inhibit diversion such as being able to look on the computer to see if someone has gone to other doctors to get their prescription painkillers been seen numerous or lately and see if there have been getting it from other places the I think the\nWord that can fall through the cracks is that after a ... a provider has that information and saying you know I think that Mr and Mrs Jones here seems to be having an issue with with their with their medicines or possibly abusing them is that\nThey get fired they get they get discharged from these clinics and and I understand that I mean as as a busy family doctor is only a certain capacity that certain clinics have\nBut ideally walking into the room and saying I'm trying to create a an open forum here or a safe place for for us to to really\nHelp you with your pain but also intervene and help you with what looks like it was to developing addiction if people are ready to to change and it's a scary thing for people that that kind of\nSomeone innocently and we could talk about that a little bit [noise] uh\nYou know they'll ask for help if they're given the option to to get help\nWhat do you mean when you said they have gotten that addiction innocently\nWell I think that the the prescription pain killer or an opiate a scourge or addiction has a very insidious component in other words\n... in the brain opening your brain doesn't necessarily know the difference between heroin and morphine and Oxley kowtow and hydrocodone after a certain levels after certain amounts of use end or abuse\nBut culturally\nTaking a medicine for your pain is much different than than for instance using heroine\nCulturally face awfully legally so what happens is that we have people out there that might be predisposed to addiction but psychologically socially emotionally that you know they they had enough tools under their belt that they're able to keep it in check\nAnd all of a sudden they get a little older as isn't necessarily always you're you're sixteen Seventeen Eighteen year old a teenager and this is\nThis going to be like you were saying before the soccer soccer mom or for a you know professional community\nBut we're really anybody and and the idea that all of a sudden their use becomes misuse which can be come up use its legitimize in other words hold the doctor gave it to me and he said she said I can take it as as much as I Need to where I could take it at this level and all of a sudden they become tolerant to it that become dependent on it\nAnd they need more to get the same effect and that's that's part of the insidious nature of opiates in general\nAnd so what happens is that they they don't even know that it's really a problem they it's been it's been\nIt's legal it's a grandma hasn't her medicine cabinet oh why can't I be doing it so you can see how suddenly years can go by where someone is having problems with using these medicines and even they are using them for different reasons and I think that's where you start to cross the line with addiction where it helps\nIt helps it helps chilly out I mean let's let's be honest you know do they named and I'm not knocking Percocet as a trade but they they they named Percocet Percocet 'cause perk up guy yeah you know so the idea that these matters has been very innocently develop into an addiction I've seen it very very often it's very often\nSpeak to that yeah I agree with what you're saying and that's actually stated um I think that while people were on many of these medicines it's important also to be seeing someone to help with the chronic pain you became an osteopathic physician\nDo a level of a treatment um to really identify and tried to face this issue so the the the emerging data is starting to show that\nThey use of of certain nutrients or supplements or vitamins can actually help repair the limbic system and and to be specific it's the doping Maine which is the uh a neuro chemical that occurs in the brain as well as other places in the body that that is is short\nCircuit I guess you could say and the way that it's transmitted in the brain so the idea that we can start giving ourselves to building blocks to help\nRebuild this damaged limbic system has has seemed very important anecdotally my experience as I can I see the people that really take that seriously versus the people that trivialize it it's night and day ah that's been my experience and as well some of my colleagues around the country that people that\nAre that respects that these brain changes need to be addressed and ideally uh dealt with it and on this system can be rebuilt or they do a better to be specific\nWe've seen some data without good pharmaceutical grade fish oils are people that do you make three fatty acids the B. complex or good vitamin as well as a pretty good amino acid complex and these these three seem to be somewhat of a of a of a bare minimum with people that can that\nCan help ah create this repair cascade\nOn that let me just interrupt you there on that subject or doping mean and amino acids I did an interview on one of our previous shows with Julia Ross who directs the recovery center in near Sausalito, California who's written a book called the mood here and she has a questionnaire and our website the mood you're\nDot com I think to guide people in terms of what specific amino acids have you\nFound excess using significant A Guided doses of A L trip to fan or some of the gab a precursor those kind of things with people\nYou know I have it I'm familiar with a with a chili Ross his book it's an excellent book I even think I have some features of it in my book um the what what I've noticed is kind of getting\nBack to the whole holistic or integrative approach this I think whether you're utilizing these and I I have tried to titrate certain amino acids and they have seen some some really good effects are some good outcomes with people's news with their effects with withdrawal symptoms with with their long term effects of maybe a prolonged\nWithdraw states I'm even helping with pain in some cases\nBut I think the important piece there is\nWhat we're talking about is a biochemical intervention so whether we're doing that with nutri suitable such as amino acids or exercise that increases doping mean good nutrition back and help them and support the Doberman ... system as well as certain medications whatever you're doing\nThe chemical side I think it's important that we we give absolute equal credence to the psychological the inter personal the even spiritual component of this people have to have a reason to want to do this people have to have a purpose as well as creating a safety net for speaking to the importance of\nTheir emotional alley where they're at psychological were there had socially if these things aren't addressed you can give someone all the amino acids in my experience was that it won't work that you really need it really is that the quintessential unfortunately quintessential disease that demands a holistic individualized comprehensive integrated approach\nYes are you do you work with an inpatient facility are you I'm just curious are you a consulting physician or attending physician and an inpatient facility and you can ...\nI see and um how does a if the listener wants to define find in addiction medicine specialist who might be open to discussing and working with us from an integrative perspective how how can the listening to do something like that\nMhm [noise] I'm a great question I think I think this has been somewhat challenging I think the American society of addiction medicine has a directory of\nOf of providers that really understand addiction so in other words I think starting with the with an individual that\nUnderstands it and doesn't judge somebody and I think that's important because if someone is really filled with the\nThe shame and and the and and the despair of I I Can't believe I found myself on the situation and that's perpetuated or or continued by the by the physician or the provided they're saying it's very tough for people to to be honest with their provider so finding a good eye addiction knowledge just or even a good psychiatrists that that has that\nNon judgmental understanding of of this of this condition or I think it's an important place to start now what does that do I think it allows people to create a I'm kind of a Base Camp I guess you could say be because it's got this this condition that can\nBecome more severe at different times having someone on your team that can help you will evaluate at any given time\nWhether you need a higher level of care what I mean by that is\nPeople can do great and sometimes I Need a hospital here and there and sometimes they can pull it off and on their own and having someone that can help them identify when those needs are there I think it's important I think that's an important a safety net that beginning now creating an integrative strategy after that are having a provider that can help I guess you could say quarterback that\nUm has been more challenging to people and I think that finding a good addiction specialist a or even any really any integrated health care provider that is that understands addiction and understands it as as a as the entity it is which which is being understood as a as a separate disease state um\nI think will will lay the groundwork for people to start integrating different modalities as far as\nFinding the if there's a a forum or or an area or directory of of people you could say integrate of addiction specialists um I think they are out there is such as Julian and other people and uh I ... I think it's it's unique to each community I think Arizona has a good reputation with a there are certain places that don't\nThink people are in their my sense is that people in their local communities if they can put together a team of people like a natural path and acupuncture\nAnd many of those types of practitioners if they have a good trusting relationship with the practitioner can add an element that can make successful recovery uh happened\nI Would absolutely agree with you and I I think one of the most important pieces of what of what you just said is that [noise] having a provider having someone on your team or spoke on the wheel here that is honest in other words someone that's going to be able to say to you hey man this is we've got up the ante\nYou know we we have this person on board and this person on board and and you know we're not getting the outcomes we want to you know you've been in the hospital six times in the last year for overdose we have to do something else someone that's able to really be straight with your with people and and and\nKeep the door open for them at the same time as important [noise] um so creating that team I think it is absolutely a\nNecessary an integral to long term success but it's also having people on your team that are that are willing to talk straight to you and that that that you know or are there to help you and not just a ticket lip service in a way\nYes um there's an area that we haven't covered in the show and that is cannabis and I know many states are struggling with this to a with a camp Medicinal Cannabis\nAnd in chronic pain would you talk about that and where that stands is active in Colorado right now I'm just curious\nWe we we actually we are one of the states that that has an amendment that allows for a physician is assigned applications for people to get an additional marijuana and we actually just it's a grand rounds here though one of the hospitals are my colleague it myself [noise] ...\nIt's really an evolving story here and and it seems that unfortunately what we're finding out is that from the medical community side we don't have a lot of data we have some information from a hound ah there's I think it's called the\nThe subject of the ... Institute for cannabis research I might be getting that one wrong and there's some research from California that's been emerging to ah that's being ... you know it goes back and forth I think there's data that supports that uses a cannabis for medicinal reasons and there's some data that so that goes against it as well\nYou know I'm I must I must say there I Want to add there that you know this whole field of this whole emphasis upon data and where's the proof I see that in my practice is an integrated er physician this blowback comes from\nA major medical institutions where's the proof and where's the data and I think the Hippocratic\nAxiom of first do no harm\nAnd what I think many of these approaches do we know through our outcomes of what we have seen as practitioners with patients have in Africa see it doesn't necessarily need\nA study to prove that which would require millions of dollars and much of that money comes through pharmaceutical proving and licensing of pharmaceutical drug\nI Would I Would absolutely agree with you I think that\nYou know we use the term around here evidence informed medicine versus evidence based medicine I loved it I don't have the time to get to wait for some of this research ah wouldn't peep especially what some of our patients are really struggling are suffering\nSo I I Would absolutely agree with you I think that some of the concerns have been at least from from the addiction medicine standpoint or at least from maybe some of the conventional standpoint says that is that one\nYou know you can get addicted to anything I mean if you were in that ten Fifteen Percent that are predisposed to something you know marijuana that can be an anchor to you or can it can really mess yeah really make your life pretty dysfunctional mom at the end and we really don't know how these things interfere or how they how they", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Kingman", "day": "14"}
