D. world doesn't really addressed that much to the underlying causes like the pesticides that are contribute to many ... conditions today so hopefully this will become a trend to bringing this into the process\nIt's the talk that Dr Patrick gay was\nDecreasing a ubiquitous toxic load or Ghana phosphate pesticides Dr Patrick bang for joining us today\nThank you and thank you for that kind of introduction I'm happy to be here\nYeah I'm really glad we're doing this show ah these big words ubiquitous I don't even know where you're cool to me [laughter] okay um\nWell let let me to find it in a very simple way and make sure [noise] so what we know from from the studies that have been published by the Centers for Disease Control [noise]\nUh and they do look at the load of of toxic chemicals in people and they do the same about ten thousand people every two to four years is that Ninety nine percent of us\nHave a pesticide stored in our fat tissue and\nThese pesticide haven't been there our entire lives for most of that\nUm the pesticides that are actually no longer legal to spray in the United states and of course I'm Talking about the tea and dating even breakdown product in the DPJ until that plane that you were referencing in the movie with Cary Grant which I'm old enough absolutely through a number of Cary Grant\nThat plane was probably spraying the\nTea so we know that you know we\nCarried pesticides in our bodies all of us um unfortunately children are born with pesticides and their systems and so that's what I mean by ubiquitous it's everywhere everywhere in our food chain and it's in our bodies I remember they are in our bodies\nI remember when I was a kid in Columbus ohio running behind the DV three truck with the white smoke coming out I loved inhaling I'm really and of course at that time I was thinking boy you know this is going to come in handy later in life so I have something to blame for my illnesses so\nUm you were not you know [laughter] that's [laughter] that's\nFunny [noise] and actually you know that is a question I asked my older patients mhm show DDT was taken out of circulation in other words it was banned um you know in the late fifties early sixties and so for those of you listening who were born after that\nUm you don't have as much of a body burden as those of us who are actually older\nAnd ran behind those trucks because then we can stay out and play all night and not get bit by mosquitoes right so I actually asked my patients that\nSpecific question about their exposure to pesticides um because some people actually didn't even know that that's what was being sprayed they would ride their bikes behind the spray truck\nOn and what we know now about those of us who did that is that we actually have an increased risk for cancer as a result of those exposures mhm\nSo um so that we don't make this show into how bad things are and people mainly helpless so what if I have pesticides on my body what can I Do about it so what do you do with that information if someone tells you that they used to run behind the DDT truck\n[noise] right well oh there are several directions that I take that\nThey are a cancer survivor or someone who is currently a diagnosed with cancer of course they need appropriate treatment for that diagnosis uh-huh I'm In addition to\nThat appropriate treatment for that diagnosis I Would also add\nOn to a lower their body burden and there's some very easy ways to do this I'm Dr Steven general is who is actually an OBGYN practices\nIn Canada and did a very interesting study um several years ago where he put a patient in sauna which was just a regular was not a fancy expensive sign this was just a um a lady in sheets honestly I had a heating unit in it and a fan\nAnd then he looked at their urine levels of a whole bunch of toxic than before and after\nThe song and look down and out is that after the sauna there were significantly statistically significantly higher levels of those older legacy organic clawing pesticides in their urine [noise] and\nHappens when you get in a sauna and we're really talking about you know I'm a low heat Tonight Show as low as a hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit ... you know it doesn't have to be really hot um for a thirty minutes\nIsn't that you start breaking down fat you know you start sweating and some of that sweat\nComes from your sweat oil glance and your sweat oil glands actually secrete you know more than water more than ammonia and they actually a secrete oil\nWhich come from the brown fat and your body so in other words you're just not sweating water you're losing some of these that the toxic competitor starting fat and so that there are more studies that are done on this and recently I don't know if you saw this Robert but\nThe cover of National Geographic along last\nMonth I Believe [noise] um talked about Sean I had a very interesting I'm a cover story about sweating and basically the author of the story said well you know he doesn't really matter\nYou can't sweat toxins way you you know sweat that much and it's unfortunate that they didn't interviewed Dr generalists because he had\nPretty compelling evidence that not the case that you actually can if you sweat or sauna on a regular basis and you can extract a significant amount of not just pesticides but I'm certain metals certain toxic metal ... as well\nYeah we did a show on on sauna therapy for environmental toxicity so I'm wonderful yeah so without getting too technical\nOr you listed a four major classes of pesticides or and among them were pesticides there were some decides to kill some guy and there were a few more ice water and insecticides and then er besides what a few moments\nRight so feeling is our special class of pesticides that are used basically um\nFor things like strawberries and and ah they can ... their most commonly there to kill 'em all but they can kill bacteria as well um and they absolutely and I brought mine is a famous feeling it that was used on strawberries\nUm and it so toxic that you actually have to wear a hat you should wear a hazmat\nSuit um when you apply it and the toxicity was so concerning that BPA and this was back many years ago actually placed several um restrictions on they use on the\nTeam against because for wind was blowing at all if there was even a breeze that feeling and ... and\nI'm On long ways away from where it was being applied so I think currently a clean diaper minor ... is still used as a few again on strawberries but it's um it's very highly restricted\nThat I had the good fortune to hear her speak as did a number of other national physicians are in Phoenix recently uh and uh uh when you were you wanted to clarify something that I was trying to bring a point to at the end of segment one\nOh thank you Robert uh yeah so you mentioned that you know especially for serious conditions like cancer that there's always going to be a relationship to pesticide exposure\nOr and I can and all in good conscience say that I don't know that we have the research for that\nCertainly we know that there's so much higher rate of cancer in um occupational exposed folk so people really apply pesticides and their families\nHave a much higher rate of all kinds of cancers lung cancer colon cancer or breast cancer or pancreatic cancer lymphoma um I can go on and on price cancer that's been documented so I can say that\nA lot that's clear from the literature that we are exposed to so many different kinds of toxic exposures um pets aside is a huge one it's just not the only one or not they are they're not the only cancer causing toxic ... out\nThere you quoted the study that was done by that Canadian physician where he tested the urine was that with patients with cancer who were in San hero no\nOkay no doctor in general is Steven journalists was the the OBGYN a as actually uh now I'm tired of what he does Stanley medicine and these were a group of patients that had other types of issues some of\nThem more neurological um him in a lot you know the mountain and nervous system the brain right a chronic fatigue but there were no cancer patients he didn't feel like that would be inappropriate I'm a kind of person to test for China\nIt doesn't seem to me when they were really ever going to see any kind of significant studies on the accumulation\nA positive factor of some of these pesticides in these chronic conditions are today because there's there's no drugs for it or there's no funding for those kind of ... the do those kinds of tests that take a lot of money to do those\nActually there is a study a very important state that's taking place in the Salinas Valley right now it's called the China study and um this is through um UC Berkeley you know and they've been doing this for for several years they're following a group of moms and kids\nThe moms work in the fields and have pesticide exposure that and their children and what they're finding is pretty interesting 'cause they are measuring levels of very specific pesticides in the moms\nAnd their children and they're finding out that the higher the pesticide level\nThe the uh lower the birth weight on the child which is not a good thing and the smaller the child which is not a good thing and they're actually finding that these kids not only have behavioral problems\nThey have lower significantly lowered I. Q. so they've lost brain power they're much more at risk for asthma they're much more at risk for cancer as children\nThey're much more at risk for developmental disorders or talking about everything from autism to mental retardation [noise] and so this is a study that has a\nYou know hundreds of a human beings in it that are being followed for a long period of time and directly relate to the closure to and not just\nThese organic phosphate pesticides but fungus sides that you and I were talking about just a little bit ago sprays appealing to actual damage in these kids and and unfortunately some of this damage probably happens in utero mother trying to become you know healthy human beings and among smelly\nI remember you saying in your talk that it's really it would be a really good idea for all of us to be eating more organic foods why isn't everybody eating organic food today\n... is a\nCost difference between\nConventionally grown food\nYou know that that you find in the grocery store and now every grocery store has an organic section right I Want to I I Want to remind everybody that organic sit right ... and every grocery store but there there it's more expensive and that's because the government subsidizes farmers to grow food conventionally the\nFederal government doesn't subsidize organic farmers to grow food so there is a a cost difference the problem is\nThat we don't see the extra money we pay on health care costs\nThat comes along with eating conventional diet so all the health problems but I just mentioned in children along with the\nAdult neurological damage you know so the I'm a good men shows and the Parkinson's and Alzheimer's related car so I'm not just talking about medical costs but [noise] um people who are not able to earn income as a result of that you know we don't aren't\nThat on the cost of our conventional food if we did actually these studies have been done we find out that conventionally grown food actually costs more than that organically grown food does\nYou're saying it costs more because it's increasing the healthcare costs of everybody including you know Medicare Medicaid those kind of avenues of reimbursement is to increase in the health cut off the Amish conditions got it\nUm that is a guy that so uh you mentioned a ... an organization called the environmental working group and uh uh uh something called the dirty dozen list what is that\n[noise] of environmental working group as a non profit that looks at chemicals in the environment and things people can do to lower their exposure to these chemicals and they created something called the dirty dozen last which is now\nI think there are like Fifteen or sixteen things on the dirty dozen left that were the vegetables and fruits that had the highest levels of pesticides on them\nUh and so they created something called the dirty dozen so and they actually have a little card you can pronounce it says you know going shopping here are the witch and vegetables that you should always buy organic now the problem is that that list is now pretty much obsolete\nBecause of the most dangerous pesticide ingredients in our\nFood supply are actually hadn't\nWhat does that mean where do you mean by that\nWell we can't see them on and they're not measured so this list you learn a working group got their list on the USDA the U.S department of agriculture\nThat program I mentioned where they look at the pesticide levels of fruits and vegetables and they only test boots and vegetables they don't have any other components of our um diet\nAnd the problem is that we spray the most common pesticide in the world that sprayed on food is something called ... state [noise]\nQuite the said um it's commonly known as round up that's a trade name um there are many other\nProducts that have like a state in them and like the state is commonly known by people because it's used on genetically modified food right on there are certain foods like corn and soy\nThat are made you know the the scenes are genetically modified so they can handle a higher level pesticides so you can marinate you're feeling pesticide it'll kill all the week but the corn and soy will remain intact\nRight because they're not the ... so\nI see this ... I see this product round up constantly on commercials on TV it's being normal lives as something that normal brain will do a that there's nothing wrong with it ... somewhat of being well soon\nYeah that's an implied right what's in quiet and they actually and the state of New York\nLike in the nineties advertised that are at war had um [noise] uh I Can't remember exactly what the wording last but basically they implied that it was a a\nBio degrades within days you know in other words it's not residual in the soil it's not going to be on the plant it's pretty safe [noise]\nUh and the state attorney general took the manufacture of this past aside Monsanto\nTo court and actually one when Monsanto could not prove that the pesticide ... actually uh in fact\nWas biodegradable and some of the latest research that's been published show that it actually money in the soil for six months okay sounds so yeah so ... is sprayed on corn and soy\nIn terms of walking into the store to get foods the fruits you want to stay away from that are probably a the non organic foods that are high in ... Hyun pesticides are strawberries berries and a foods like that correct that have no real or is\n... identified\nGoing to say as a possible carcinogen and now they can't call it a carcinogen until they can feed it to humans and prove that it causes cancer or and what they were looking\nAt is um the\nRelationship between certain cancers like breast cancer liver cancer and thyroid cancer cancer the pancreas cancer the bladder and\nThe use of life is said and those cancers have risen dramatically the incidence of these cancers how using dramatically in tandem with meaning\nEqual you know right at the same time as we started using a lot of ... and that was back in Nineteen Ninety so they looked at that data and they said there's a concern here um between the use of glad to say and cancer\nOr there were a group of scientists who also published an article in a\nEnvironmental health journal the following year two thousand sixteen I'm Talking about their concerns about going to say based herbicides and exposure is and what they talked about was non Hodgkin's lymphoma\nSo what type of blood and Gore cancer that's also very common\nAnd they looked at ... for the sake action what is it really do well it seems to damage the nervous system\nAnd the immune system but it also does something that we call an decline disruption in any kind of corruption is a big big deal and medicine right now because we're finding out a lot of chemicals [noise] a lot of toxic and have\nThis ability to alter the way our hormones work and you know hormones control everything from\nHow our thyroid functions to whether or not we can control our blood sugar and so there's some studies that have actually been published in the animal literature because we cannot give pesticides to human\nThat's I'm not allowed it's illegal and also somewhat immoral\nTo to do that so we use wrap that report rats but what we're finding is that there is a relationship um that's published you know in a scientific literature between feeding of guys say and the incidents of cancer we also know that go I just say alters\nThe micro biome and now I Know that all of your listeners have heard this word it's a household where the microbiomes gumption I got used to be afraid of them now we worship them\nOr if you watch TV you see there's\nA lot of pharmaceuticals for irritable bowel syndrome and that's a good I'm Glad you brought that up about the micro biome\nAnd the guard and there's a lot of commercials about drugs and monoclonal antibodies for these conditions like Crohn's disease irritable bowel syndrome all sort of collider\nSo when I'm hearing you say is that if these licensed seats as well as the pesticides are disruptive to gut Flora\nThat it would it's really important if you have any of these conditions\nTo start transitioning toward damage foods and to be doing a lot of pro by optics\nAbsolutely um this study where you know we learned this was just published in two thousand Eighteen where they looked at me I'm animal in the past animals micro biome and found out that\nUnfortunately that class of a a pro by addicts\nThat is most highly inhibited by ... I Would say to some income for bacteria and you and I know Robert ... bacteria are probably the most important uh or at least one of the most important and kinds of beneficial good bacteria in the intestinal tract\nThey make all these wonderful little short chain ... fatty acids that we need for good health and good nervous system health and good immune system help [noise] scope the fact that you know for those of us that we'd be studied the fact that we saw this significant\nOff of the bacteria was a big deal and very big deal and make life a said has been patented\nAs an antibiotic and that's usually we need to patent for an as an antibiotic so how did that for a mouse and every day through Arctic supply\nWhy is it ... does is an antibiotic what's the thinking behind that or the rationale\nBehind well\nI Would need to talk to my incentive to be able to answer that um because I don't know it as strong as Clinton license which is a you know a fairly strong antibiotic and Canada mice which is an extremely strong antibiotic\nI don't know why they apply for that pot and I cannot tell you the answer to that but it is indeed God a patent\nOn getting an analyst addict whether they don't want to use different animals and I don't know when when\nWe go into health food stores or or regular conventional stores and buy vegetables and foods that have plastics on them that are covered with the plastic to protected or so is there a problem with that\n[noise] so the the chemicals in plastic called Sally will migrate from the plastic I'm\nInto the food we know that um there've been those pretty good evidence for that uh the problem with Sally Yates is that they too are ended Curtis raptors and specifically sex hormone\nAnd decrying disruptor is meaning they interrupt both sex hormones in men and boys and growing male\nAnd a female or you know of all ages including fetuses and so\nUm that wakes up particularly problematic now more colleagues are going to migrate into the feet if he for instance put Saran Wrap over your food and put it in the microwave [noise] that's something everyone should always avoid\nBut yes um wrapped in Saran Wrap that there is evidence that college where migrate from the Saran Wrap into the food is if the food is touching Saran Wrap it's not a edging Saran Wrap cause molecules can't jump to the air but\nYou know the absolutely so ah yeah that that's just one of the many other and the current disrupting chemicals we have in our streets supply\nAnd what about these tests lawn pans that are convenient so to speak\nI don't know if you've been watching the news Robert but there there's been a lot about these chemicals in the news recently because the government\nJust published a huge study on for Flora needed compounds that's what they're called and um [noise] the EPA refused to release it and it and just got released I was just looking on my computer this morning it just got really\nAnd the the damning evidence apparently is that there is now a significant amount and some of these compounds that have made it into the water supply um but my guess is your question is does it go from the frying pan into the food and\nIt does if you scratch the surface you know with a metal statue on if you scratch the surface or any other sharp object uh some of that those ... Florida they compounds will get into the food and our carcinogens\nAnd they are are pretty clearly implicated in thyroid disease and hypertension blood pressure problems right or yeah we we have a serious water\nIn this country with these chemicals\nThere's an energy and when we talk about these things of how bad everything is so why even make an effort to do anything to change one's diet if if one is going to develop if one is two one cannot afford to make the transition to organic food\nYou know Robert you'll be happy that now that there's so many it's actually doing research in this area I mentioned actors Cynthia curl [noise] ah I think she's currently out of the University of Idaho she's actually doing a study\nLooking at pregnant women and children ah when we take kids and we take them off conventionally grown diet and aren't organic diets the levels of pesticides in there and urine dropped\nLiterally overnight and seriously talking about twenty four hours wow some fairly high down can barely detectable and so she's doing this study in Cairo when and what she's doing he's also looking at the cost effectiveness\nOut of switching from a conventional ground I too am organically grown diet not only in terms of the health of the mom got the health of the baby and totally yeah we have to think about if our food is totally on medicine it's okay to spend a little bit more money [noise]\nUh and and eating lower on the food chain also saves a tremendous amount of money you know the Washington vegetables we eat the better off we are we just have to make sure that those fruits and vegetables don't have a right lesson news of pesticides and on the easiest way to do that is to buy organic\nShow it would seem to me that if one has a chronic disease without having to wait for proof of studies that isolate these things these the toxic effects we have enough research data on these without", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Kingman", "day": "21"}
