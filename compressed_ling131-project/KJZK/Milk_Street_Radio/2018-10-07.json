women's health care is very high in the public mind\nAnd we're kind of focus today on this area of women's health care and I think some of the things we talk about pertain to the men who may be listening to the show\nSo today we're going to be talking with Dr tore Hodgson to natural Patrick physician she's a graduate of the national College of Metra passing medicine\nAnd has served as

older by a let me just say this now that I'm sixty years old so [laughter] I've been in practice for a twenty eight years now and uh so\nMy apologies are well not just\nProbably found something on the Web that I had it yet but just thought I'd uh you know on our my my age here and there you go that direction but thanks for the invitation glad to be here [noise]\nYeah I think Oregon a is a beach or for the country and embarrassing or this impulse of bringing natural medicine and integrated medicine into greater coverage in the system and\nThen I have lots and lots of referrals to my office are from medical doctors that I had you know had relationships with over these twenty eight years and they refer\nTo me either when they feel like they're at a you know an obstacle or when the patient asked but what about this you know what about ... what about Kurt ... what about fish will also the medical doctor and a place like Portland can easily refer to nature panic physician that they trust\n'em and we have in in Portland we have the nature of having physicians working\nAt Kaiser Permanente we have some working at the Oregon the conventional medical school ah we have some offices we have a residency program where my nature path that rather than it is working ... are also sharing their residency was a real mythology office I'm so there's all kinds\nOf and the greatest things happening here and of course you have the integrated medicine a program at University of Arizona in Tucson train medical the medical doctors are true to introduce them to scientific evidence based natural medicine\nThat's true that is happening in Arizona\nLet me just ask you about some other conditions or woman goes through\nA it used to me is always seemed to me that our lives today are being medical lives depend a lot of things we go through specially women\nAre given diagnoses in order somebody's food into these are insurance billing codes and the big pharma model I wanted to ask you about that why is that so\n[noise]\nKnow I I don't know all the things that go into that but I think it's been an effort to you know I think a benevolent Li it's an effort to name some thing and I you know identify something recognize the name it and and have an adequate\nThat was fundamentally an effort to [noise] you know help 'em but I but you're right there are some\nUh limitations and even down side to that and in some cases for example or maybe not a you know I think none of pause I think is one of those\nYeah that's what I was this is that's where I was getting after I I've talked to a lot of women that get really upset the mental pause is put as a diagnosis\nWell the thing is though I mean yes it's normal and natural but you know pregnancy is normal and natural and that's a dialysis center are things that are\nRight but some mental pause is a there is a physiological endocrinology hormonal definition you know it's one year you know your ovaries when he sees\nHaving period because your ovaries are producing less estrogen and not all the leading anymore I mean there are right physiological events that are occurring this thing and yes men of positive normal and natural and some women don't really suffer any or many or\nOr minimal problem but some many women suffer huge\nModerate you write huge problem okay that's your insomnia is severe anxiety\nOkay let's touch on some of those issues after the break\nSupport for this public radio station is provided by these Kingman underwriters\nSupport for Prescott Public Radio's provided by\n... offering physical

part two of healthy Madison\nAnd were interviewing Dr tore through the author of women's encyclopedia of natural medicine alternative therapies in integrative medicine for total health and wellness or Dr Hudson is a professor of ground ecology at the national College of veterinary medicine in Portland, Oregon\nTore in your book you said that women they view the bio mechanical model of medicine today than a different way can you talk about that\nI think you were starting that enough women and raised two that they were\nSort of objecting to the over medical invasion of certain conditions like man I thought\nIs that what you're talking about yes uh-huh yeah yeah I mean I don't really hear that too much because women are\nComing to me for a problem and they want help with that problem and they realize that that problem is\nIn the case and menopause is influenced by their hormones so they just [noise] I don't get in that conversation doesn't come up for me and my circles but I understand the point that you're referring to [noise] um [noise]\nBut then I think really the point is what what changes are happening related to mount a pause and and as a woman suffering from them or not and that she is then let let's figure out the best way to help her and weather\nAnd I think it is important it let's say in a forty fifty something year old woman I think it is a very important for a doctor to appreciate that it's that woman as having\nInsomnia enter periods that become infrequent that she's having some hot flashes that treating that insomnia needs to be treated in the context of oh this is related to her hormonal changes and that to me is a very\nLee did for kind of treatment plan than treating a twenty five year old woman with insomnia because she's just she's a let's say she's a [noise] um you know super stressed out and an anxious or or or or or some reason that we don't understand why she hasn't Samir\nBut to know and same with it but if that twenty five year old woman has pre menstrual insomnia like the week or two before period she really has insomnia it's important to treat that as Tom ... as a ...\nIssue and ... why is PMS you know why is her insomnia happening is because of hormonal changes and neurotransmitter changes in our brain so just you know giving her a big center and PM or a or an ambient or a ...\nWhich are conventional medications or even just giving her malaria melatonin and\nHops which are alternative medicine is both of those would be incomplete to my in my view is her insomnia was a pretty menstrual sometime or for insomnia was Perry menopause or menopause symptom because the underlying cause is\nThe PMS issue or the Perry none of pause issue so those deserve I think a special way of treating the insomnia just that's just one example\nNo I think that's a good example what you're saying here's it's important to look at the time of life and the time of the moms symptom is disruptive to a woman's life is happening in in order to come to help the person to design\nThat would help them yeah since we were talking about mental pause there talk about the whole what happens with the bones of Thomas bombers\n[noise] well one the estrogen a pocket you might say is depleted you know when those over you stop putting out as much estrogen as they used to\nUh there is a normal age related and I stress the word normal age related a bone loss that's going to occur and it's about you know two percent per year for about forty five years right after menopause so we lose let's say um you know eight to ten percent\nOf our phone don't ask that we went in with we lose and that's normal aging and is comes with the territory but the point is you know did we start out with\nA hundred percent or greater bone density before we hit that mark in time or did we start out with only eighty percent because we had\nUm\nYou know we had an eating disorder when we were teenagers are we ... you know anorexia and we were we lost her period for two years now it's likely that my bone density when I hit menopause never reached a hundred percent maybe only reached eighty percent of\nFor her there's very little in the herbal department that does something for bone density there is a little bit of research on red clover [noise] um [noise] maybe a tiny bit of research on lock up you know but there's not much their\nTime to plant what about what is the importance of vitamin D and in women's health\nWell vitamin D is very important for bone health that's the one I think most everybody knows about already um and vitamin D deficiency does\nCause bone loss and osteoporosis so vitamin D which is actually a hormone uh we mostly need to get\nThat either from sunshine or from taking a pill because we don't get that much in our diet\n[noise] do you have the patience or do you measure your patients vitamin D blow mobiles\nSome patients don't automatically test everybody but yes I I Do test one I have reason to test and low bone density is one reason but there are other\nA vitamin D is associated ... and ... it's a it's important to say associated with that doesn't mean there's proof that it can prevent but it is associated with you know people who have higher blood levels of vitamin D steam that\nThere is an associate it a lower risk of breast cancer multiple sclerosis ovarian cancer heart disease a ... kind of goes on\nYes that's right yeah that's what I was giving after an idea of what I find\nIt on I think when a lot of partnerships fun is with their patients vitamin D levels I measured vitamin D levels on relatively healthy looking women\nAnd I've seen them come back ten and twelve a yeah meaning huge deficiencies in vitamin D and at risk for certain types of cancer like you were saying there were significant bone measures and the importance of vitamin D in the brain and can cardiovascular system\nIs that is correct statement\nYes yes and and you it's one of those things where you can't really tell if someone in vitamin D deficient by looking at them you really do need a test but\nI usually you know there are some red flags to me that warrant testing and logo on down the is one of them and if she has a family history of breast cancer ovarian cancer I like to test if she's got depression I might test you know there's some things that would\nMove me too especially want to test somebody\nMhm what forms of vitamin D or I Know there are many different product brands and I don't want to go into different brands here but does the brand matter without ...\nGwen vitamin D probably not so much that brand um I think there is some you know there's there's capsule there's subliminal tablet there's jobs I think we don't really I prefer to use capital because I don't think we really actually\nHave enough scientific evidence that dropped the stumbling little adequately raises the blood level I just sort of waiting for that\nYou know that it's interesting I didn't know that\nCome to light 'em so I Know a lotta people take it but I'm just not as confident and anything that you know something that you swallow [laughter]\nUh and then there's you know the whole conversation of vitamin D tree versus vitamin e too and and vitamin D three being more potent more by a veil but even there even in that realm there's research to show that if you take vitamin D every day almost every day they both\nRaise blood levels the same OK I'm\nOK let's turn I break and come back with Dr tore Hudson after\nSupport for this public radio station is provided by these Prescott
