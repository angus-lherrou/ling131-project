are today against\nAny non white group um and people have a non Christian train and immigrants and it was a real threat because in the south they um\nHad a lot of lynchings so people didn't live in fear of them because they were unpredictable and you know what was going to happen next and so there's a lot of research that went in to their shy it took about three years for me to write for ...\nYears so the racism angles came from your family and I would assume also the musicians you interviewed\nYes and then there were a document documentation to stories in the newspapers and other
