very good we've got an incredible singer songwriter from Nashville to introduce to you and amazing with songs kid\nFirst up there we're going to dip into some Gen un American music history has based here in Kentucky it's the sounds of jug band ... bands that started at the turn of the century became very popular around Louisville, Kentucky and continues but you have heard\nThe sound in popular music it started in the Nineteen sixties with the sound of a great group called a loving spoonful John Sebastian and his ... ban why\nDuring\nThat they can do and in Britain among\nGrow Jerry had a huge with the joke sounds sounds summertime\nGreat great sound\nA historic kind of music [noise]\nThese guys carry on that tradition were very very proud that they could be here when I talk to them about jug band music and what it means to Americana and American music they're going to do a tune from a brand new album is called jugs up this is called a washed board man please welcome from Louisville, Kentucky the juggernaut jug band on the what is\nOur primary [noise]\n\n\nPlaying softball but that was on his hands crazy random domino change as it used to say I love to hear that ...\n[noise]\nMillion everything is due to the last man [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nHe'll tell you to take a long time\nSo that must have been a brave move for use or to go from Arkansas to Nashville and that kind of community were just overflowing with skill and talent and you go to college to learn how to do it\nWell luckily I don't think I knew any better at the time so scared as I could have been where\nThe the odd thing is that you actually accomplished to view superseded all the expectations in you became a big\nSuccess [noise] you're driving\nIs supposed to talk about the the Allen Jackson cut because a lot of times a lot of times um you write a song an artist likes it and they kind of put a hold on it for a while yeah that is sort of precludes another artist from recording it so you had an artist technically put a hold on on a song\nThat came to Ellen Jackson's attention tone told me how that\nWas actually on hold for two other artists for the year proceeding when al inherited\nAdded as a publisher at the time who played for Allen's producer and he put it on hold us for another artist at first but it turned out they weren't sure about the timeline for that album and what was going to go on so yeah that one should Allen one day and said I got a song I Would love to play for you to get back to the office in\nAllen really liked it and the other artists was gracious enough to say you know what I don't know exactly when it's going to be cutting so I don't want her to miss that when\nI was a song Monday morning church was a beautiful beautiful written\n[noise]\nWaiting for something that you knew that there were art is interested in the song and you're waiting and you're waiting and you will was killing\n'em know again I didn't really know anything at that point in time Alan actually ended up hanging out on spring break my senior year in college\nAnd went tell me about the first time you heard it you're you're probably in your car like everybody else listening to the radio\nAnd actually a dairy Overton Eddie was kind enough he got a copy of it because he's worked with Allen for years and he was kind enough to him by me and to hear that cut\nAnd you know it's a really it's a strange thing it's almost like you're watching a TV show or maybe somebody hooked up a computer and ran ears song through it and made it sound like somebody else it was it was really amazing\nWhat about the first time you heard it on the radio you heard Allen singing your song on the radio\nWell I I don't know if he's seen a movie called a thing called love but it was about like that I'm driving down music row and heard it and\nWe were actually on music growing area well the dogs if the serendipity those stores are lining up for re that\nSaid another claim to fame that you had and this is kind of important in Kentucky and all because he was the voice of Kentucky tourism now but you were a Chris Stapleton upstairs neighbor I was yeah so so what was that like he must have been a interesting a showdown sort of probably\nSinging and work and all the time really helped me carrying or a girl upstairs\n[laughter] so what let's talk about the changes in the music business because I mean the last ten years has really\nAffected the ... not the music and the musicians so much because they're still there and they're still passionate and they're still working and trying but the music industry itself has really changed music row has really changed it's\nInteresting ah you know there are good things and bad things about it it's you know technology is changing so fast um\nYou know I think about my granny growing up she didn't even have a radio when she was born and are what all we can do to day and it's really amazing to think about all the innovation that's happened to me I think it's a good thing because I think there's a lot of possibilities for independent artists that maybe weren't there before\nAnd you you have a lot of independent nature in your career and so I mean you're getting major cuts with with important artist but but you are a singer songwriter that also views yourself as an artist as as one of those performers\nThat's what I Need to Nashville for I I really I started writing songs to have things to saying and I'm I think I was lucky in that way because maybe I didn't know who are thinking when I was trying to write I just tried to write something I Love that I'm\nKind of fell into it so now you have\nYou you have this series of of singing\nIt's been on your own one of the ... told me about that tell tell me what you're doing there\nWell I put out an album last fall called wiki town crier that I'm really proud of Jimmy Johnson and Jim is brown ... said I say that I was a kid in the country music candy store get to do that I got to have all my favorite players into play got some friends of mine\nA Christ came in saying on a couple of songs and rainy Hauser Ricky Skaggs was this a really special experience and then since then I've been recording some kind of worn\nAcoustic bass songs or just because you know as an artist it takes a long time to do an album that you want to have something new and freshwater fresh baked cookies out their share with your audience\nWill Allen Jackson even set in one of the salt lordy don't the wheels turn slow and it it is true that it takes a lot of ah there's a lot of work being patient\nThrough the through the process but speaking of whiskey towel cry which is a great great title because that's that's what they used to call people who shouted out the news yet ...\nSays is that how you view this album is sort of like a ... claiming than the news or the state of a community\nYeah it's actually it's a theme to record and so it's basically supposed to be an auditory newspaper for a small town and I'm really big into characters and story song so each one of these songs could be a little a\nAnd the local paper where a lot of places that would can recommend living things like really bad like well\nHeartache so pretty good these days so now you've got this beautiful album is called whiskey terrible crimes are going to dip
