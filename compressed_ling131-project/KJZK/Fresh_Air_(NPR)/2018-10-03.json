history someone would turn their attention back to this incredibly dramatic time in its history to ... where did your interest in the depression era and the dust bowl I'm situation in America\nThere was actually kind of an accident I was running a song one day and you know I'm sure you're a songwriter Manchester songwriters and you just throw out ideas and I I just had this idea for a song that eventually turned it into a song that sounded like it was about a drought and I thought well that's I got to change that because no one wants to hear a song on the Trump but no matter\nWhat I tried I could not change that I had to have those words and so I thought well that was a big drought one time what was that I went on the Internet and I sat there for seven hours\nFor burst than the first five minutes refreshing whatever I learned in school which wasn't much and then I expanded my knowledge I over the next two or three years it took me to write the album and they got to write a book about the dust bowl now but\nIt it really opened my eyes when I read and listen to interviews of survivors that they taped or recorded on film in the Nineteen seventies I was just amazed\nWell it it it it is truly one of the most dramatic moments in American history especially what happened\nTo its own its own people I mean you know and Woody Guthrie which you know he made his name uh supporting the poor people of the dust bowl era but he was from there he was from ...\nYou were born in Jacksonville and you kind of moved up north to Rhode Island and you've been like all over the place and

taught me how to say how do you say how do you say ... but they use LA just like a T H like they used our alphabet because they never did have a written so let me get an improv said properly\nAgain ... have strengthened the Choctaw\nLanguage and I actually I knew a friend of mine said you got to write a song about the Native Americans during the dust bowl\nThis was after I threw where the first version of the record and I said oh man you're exactly right but I don't know how to write such a song because I'm not a Native American idol I think if I Want to just wouldn't be true enough so I contacted\nAfter I realized the Choctaw were the first of the byproducts marched into trail of tears a hundred years before the dust bowl I contacted the Choctaw tribe and they helped me so much right the song I have to give him a giant thank you and they deserve a lot of credit well it's nice that you were\n[noise] so\nYou will you do this and you put the put the album out I mean how was trying to get audiences especially young kids today or not they may not be really aware of the dust bowl or what was happening in America at that time so this is like a whole education thing\nIs actually created a one man show or to have a twelve foot video screen behind me like a hundreds of the pictures that were taken back then and I did it for the high school in Bakersfield, California about seven
