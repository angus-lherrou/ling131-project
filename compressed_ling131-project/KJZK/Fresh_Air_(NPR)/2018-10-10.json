cool to a\nA sort of is the selection of artists all kind of related to Memphis the current in contemporary a kind of tackling that material I\nI thought it was a cool selection of material there's some really well known stuff but there's also some some pretty obscure stuff on there too which I thought was cool to sort of represent\n[noise] and then giving props were props or do of course we know who Luther is a camera as a a\nIs a treat to a patriot a of a mini artist she supported guy Clark or working heavily was Chris christopherson right now and she's really a supported the legacy of many artist so the idea of her working on the tributes son record the certainly appropriate for her\n[noise] and I and I see around it\nAnd so you're you're taught to tell me about your interest in the Memphis Sound in ... as an artist you are interested in the Memphis Sound you're interested in the music that Sam Philips brought forward or through the vehicle of sun records and this is something you were interested in this little kid or does come out\nYeah I mean I ... I wasn't fully aware of what's on records was when I was a kid I was familiar with some of the music but it wasn't until I was\nYou know a teenager and I was playing music already that are sort of studied it and again and started realizing this was all under one sort of umbrella you know the stuff that I heard was vaguely aware of it as a child I became obsessed with and then when I realized it was all one thing I was like oh wow I'm not\nCompletely completely a change my whole way of saying about music like it does for anybody that really delve into that catalog but um that was a\nBefore I ever moved to Memphis and then I moved there about twelve Thirteen Years ago and\nI'm just really got to be a full time student Memphis music and get to be immersed in it and an around some of the people that made it and it's just been a real uh\nUh it's been an amazing sort of experience as a musician living there and spoken up the Memphis thing kind of being an outsider but now I can totally considering you know I'm you know but\nYeah it's a and and then the Memphis Sound is so broad you know you talk about another sound that there's more than one son records is one thing that's did um unrest stacks records directors are that you know there's the the uh there there's not a Memphis down there or Memphis Sounds you know\nWell and here we are celebrating one of those sounds as as delivered by Sam Philips and his record label son record to Amy you worked at son record as as a tour guide was talking about the recording studio room where all of this magic happened Roy ... Johnny Cash\nJerry Lee Lewis a course Elvis recorded his stuff there's not a big room\nKnow they may change might be bigger than the actual tracking round one car garage really radiator shot it was a radiation\nNow it has to be a white stick tiles I'm a law ... years back there [laughter] in fact this town\nAnd the healing or Israel out if it hadn't really that peak and valleys all along the capital of the room like how the sound and ... and then when ... got there she the endemic formed\nAnd the way was the way the room was portrayed in and walk along which you were part of the motion picture and one of the actresses and in that that movie it was a very accurate portrayal of of the room and the way Sam Phillips work with the artists and\nActually and I actually sat\nPretty they built a whole nother studio down main street and the storefront to look just like it inside there because they the owner is signed with respect to the people that come from all over the world to the time studio then he didn't want to credit to the public\nFilming said they had to build that\nThey had to build their own you know we\nTo record the sun sessions at night after seven after they've finished the tours Theresa we did the daytime such an operating studio you're at it I did\nHear but only at night do they do they have ... ...\nDid they have the same recording board that they had the old dark deal to this whole new stuff yeah middle yeah all that new all\nThey don't have the actual the actual here they do actually yeah one of\nDevices that seem to go around and make field according to bring it back in the mean and that's really cool things in the studio knew\nAll the actual console that same ad is that the rock console museum\nThat they actually it was just just not they're not operators\nAmazing I give props were props is due again I mean it's amazing how good those records found even today on the modern sound systems with the gear that they had to record back then\nSo it's a combination of really great songs really great musicians and Sam's ears and the engineers that e you work with well it's a it's an album that is a fitting tribute to that legacy it's called red\nHot it's a tribute to Sam's tulips and the music of sun records and we're going to turn our attention to John Paul ... this is a tune called the red Cadillac\nMoustache right here on the songs old time\n[noise]\nThing you do me around\nWho you are the ones that are\nThen\nThe same thing you know\nYou're going to a\nLittle a\nAnd everything you know\nYou've been loving it was

hear you perform the song do it with Amy and it's it's pretty much in the same DNA realm of what Sam ... son records are produced as part of the American musical cannon\nYeah yeah it's very much of a
