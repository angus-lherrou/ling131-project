his anger Reinhardt what he's doing on the guitar you are doing on a hammer do smart that I mean that's a whole different uh ... I mean\nI've got a lot of explaining to do I suppose\nThere's there's a\nAncestor to the hammer adults were in Europe called the symbolism and it's a real central uh instrument in a gypsy Roma culture particularly\nIn the Eastern Europe a region so uh in folk music I'm so there's a real strong connection in terms of a gypsy culture with this instrument what you'll find a lesson of is the application of hum a juicy swing the jazz stuff of Django\nOn the instrument so when you first tried it\nHow much whiskey was involved in trying to take the chain goes music and interpret it on a hammer do summer 'cause I mean what what he's doing was two fingers on shreds you're doing with hammers yeah Jew cameras do so maybe it won't work two hours two fingers Seattle seriously this is this is a complicated thing that you're interpreting yeah this is ...\nAvoided it for years and I'm a\nGood friend of mine in Chicago alfonzo on a chilly he kept saying you should learn that on this you should learn this music on the instrument and I just thought it couldn't be done and then I I heard a a symbol of player I'm from Holland a guy but they are ... Khan who are pleased that wonderfully and even though it's a different tuning game altogether I just thought yeah\nI Need to figure this case so this is what let's talk about your hamburger all summer sure Kay\nOr is it is it is a beautiful\nSounding instrument but our ... you say you're tuning it differently since yeah there is an American tuning\nUm that kind of based around um the cycle so I Want to get into all that but um yeah it's great for\nFor doing 'em and um\nIt's do you know it's it's playing gypsy swing or really any kind of jazz on the instrument is still pattern based there are actually shapes that I'm following the kind of work like cheap\nBut there are a little bit bigger than your typical shapes that you follow them and for the radio audience I mean the the hammer do summers is sitting in front of you as a lot like almost like a tilted card table\nRight and it's got a ... string so you're a dead end about during the years to tune it straight [laughter] but but it it is it they are tuned to a patterns like you said he so you're you're actually aiming with your hammer\nAnd you don't miss awesome yeah I I Do you just don't know to see your planning so fast\nWe can get a test right exactly\nWell let's get back into the music of Django Reinhardt and you're going to invite the lovely a Andy to come up\nAnd she is going to sing vocal on a song that is not necessarily I'm associated with the Django Reinhardt but you're going to vote ... going to recognize the tune actually singing it's from his CD swing more to the tune is called ain't misbehave and it is Andy young hammer do summer champion on we saw\n[noise] and\nNo one at all clear\nAll they have\nI Know that's\nI'm through with\nAnd then they have\nSay then\nNo no no no\nThen the me I\nHow am I buy me\nAnd then they have that\n\n\n[noise]\nKnow makes me I've\nToday and then you\nAnd then they don't\n\nYou\n\n[noise] great\nAndy On the hammer know summer we are celebrating the music or shame go Reinhardt so we also got the incredible hot club of San Francisco we're going to get back\nAnd wait until you hear this\nHad to stay right where you are will be back right after this\nYou're listening to what some show number aged forty four broadcasting around the world from the historic city of Lexington, Kentucky\nAnd he went likely attended with blind spot Catholic missing Lexington I'd rather be an asset scheduled on our website which song dot com will be back\n...
