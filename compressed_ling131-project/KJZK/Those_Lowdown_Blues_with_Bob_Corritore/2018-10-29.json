change of scenery it really felt like the place for me to be\nBeing surrounded by like music I Love being surrounded by musicians I Love the community of these missions in Nashville and uh just a great place to live\nAnd wonderful musical artist to go through and there's there's so much more than just country music out there the musician a\nPallet is huge in diverse in Nashville which I guess that's what that's what makes it such a beautiful artistic adventure to go to Nashville\nAbsolutely and I you know I I have I primarily started out in the blue genre but I I I kind of spread out of the uh to a little bit more American roots and country and I and I and I love music and and I love and I really appreciate\nThe diversity of music\nIn Nashville or it's going to ask you about that I'm Glad you brought it up because it makes it easier for me but you did start out very much as as as hardcore blues and you certainly have the pipes for your voice is incredible I needed [noise]\nBut the\nHurried allied does move into more of an American world I mean not that it matters what bin urine I mean there's no more been there's no record stores but uh but the but the the idea of the album itself is is more acoustic based in in America\nYeah absolutely and this is my eighth album and I I've I've I've always kind of don't\nDonald mixture of of different genres um and I've always tried to incorporate different sounds and to my to my original songs but\nI as I go along I sort of evolved into more I'm rich the material more Americana I'm neither but more of a twang I have a very hard time limiting myself to just one one sounded when John up because I Love everything and I just I Love writing all kinds of music and singing all kinds of music\nMusic is a lot like art like painting an art you can't have a beautiful portrait made out one color you have to use all of them it's it's a beautiful palette of many different styles many different musical colors and that's that's what

grateful for that will rise or fail it's your name on it you got to be happy with the album no matter which way the album goes right absolutely gotta you gotta be you've got to hold it up no matter what and say I'm proud of this this is mine yeah my statement\nAnd whenever I released an album I always I I Do not believe in filler songs so I always try to try to make sure that every song on the
