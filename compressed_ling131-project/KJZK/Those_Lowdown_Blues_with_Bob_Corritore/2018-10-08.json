[noise]\n\nFrom Nashville, Tennessee it's nice to have you here they can ... I Would love it I grew up near a Little Rock Arkansas oh excellent that's where I was born at you and you are made your way to Nashville went to college out there to learn how to be an artist in a songwriter\nSo that must have been a brave move for used to go from Arkansas to Nashville and that kind of community where just overflowing with skill and talent and you go to college to learn how to do it\nWell luckily I don't think I knew any better at the time so scared as I could have been\nWith the the odd thing is that you actually accomplished you superseded all the expectations and you became a big\nSuccess [noise] so you're driving\nIs supposed to talk about the the Allen Jackson cut because a lot of times a lot of times uh um you write a song an artist likes it and they kind of put a hold on it for a while yeah that is sort of precludes another artist from according it so you had an artist\nTechnically put a hold on on a song that came to Alan Jackson's attention tell them tell\nMe how that happened that time was actually on hold for two other artists for the year proceeding when Alan heard it\nI had a a publisher at the time we played it for Allen's producer and he put it on hold us for another artist at first but it turned out they weren't sure about the timeline for that album and what was going to go on so he was out to lunch with Allen one day and said I got a song I Would love to play for you and get back to the office in\nAllen really liked it and the other artists was gracious enough to say you know what I don't know exactly when it's going to be cut into I don't want her to miss\nThat when I was a song Monday morning church is a beautiful\nBeautiful written to [noise]\nWaiting for something that you knew that there were art is interested in the song and you're waiting and you're waiting in your way was killing\n'em know again I didn't really know anything at that point in time Alan actually ended up hanging out on spring break my senior year in college\nThere and tell me about the first time you've heard it you're you're probably in your car like everybody else and and listening to the radio\nIs actually a dairy Overton Eddie and mine was kind enough he got a copy of it because he's worked with Allen for years\nAnd he has kind of stunned by me and to hear that cut\nIn and you know it's really it's a strange thing it's almost like you're watching a TV show or maybe somebody hooked up a computer and ran ears song through it and made it sound like somebody else it was it was really amazing what about the first time you heard it on the radio you heard Allen singing your song on the radio\nWell I I don't know if you've seen a movie called a thing called love but it was about like that\nI'm driving down music row and heard it and\nWe're actually amusing growing area well the talk of the serendipity those stores are lining up for you that\nSaid another claim to fame that you had and this kind of important in Kentucky and all because he was the voice of Kentucky tourism now but you were a Chris Stapleton upstairs neighbor I was yeah so so what was that like he must have been an interesting uh Philadelphia probably singing and work and all the time really helped me carrying a wardrobe upstairs nice\nGuy but so what this is talk about the changes in the music business because I mean the last ten years has really\nAffected the ... not the music and the musicians so much because they're still there and they're still passionate and they're still working and trying but the music industry itself has really changed music grow has really changed it's\nAh you know they are good things and bad things about it it's you know technology is changing so fast\nYou know I think about my granny growing up she didn't even have the radio when she was born and are what we can do today and it's really amazing to think about all the innovation that's happened and I to me I think it's a good thing because I think there's a lot of possibility\nBut maybe weren't there before\nAnd you you have a lot of independent nature in your career and so I mean you're getting major cuts with with important artist but but you are a singer songwriter that also views yourself as an artist as as one of those performers\nThat's what I moved to Nashville for I I really I started writing songs to have things the same and um I think I was lucky in that way because maybe I didn't know ... when I was trying to write I just tried to write something\nI Love that I'm\nKind of fell into it\nSo now you have a you you have the series of of a single vote you shorter releasing on your own one of the time told me about that to tell me what you're doing there\nWell I put out an album last fall called with the town crowd that I'm really proud of Jamie Johnson a gym is brown to produce it I say that I was a kid in the country music candy store get to do that\nI've got to have all my favorite players into play got some friends of mine a Christ came as hang on a couple of songs and Randy Hauser and Ricky Skaggs I was just a really special experience and then since then I've been recording some\nKind of one off more acoustic bass song or just because you know as artists it takes a long time to do an album that you want to have something new and fresh she wasn't fresh baked cookies out their share with your audience well\nAllen Jackson even set in one of the song lordy don't the wheels turn slow and it is that it is true and it takes a lot of uh there's a lot of work being patient through the through the process but speaking of whiskey town cry which is a great great titles 'cause that's that's what they used to call people who shouted out the news yeah\nIn the ... is that how you view this album is sort of like a proclaiming than the news a on a state of a community\nYeah it's actually it's a famed record and so it's basically supposed to be an auditory newspaper for a small town of I'm really big into characters and story song so each one of these songs could be a little a\nIn the local paper well a lot of places that would can recommend living things like really bad like\nHeartache so pretty good these days so now you've got this beautiful album is called whiskey town cry or going to dip into that album for this particular song is called it ain't it just like a cowboys Aaron enderlin on the with the song sold for\n[noise]\nNew day 'cause I\nYou know\nThere's\nThose are the kids didn't\n\nThe ... and then he ... the food in\n...\n...\nYou were a\nOh pretty big no no no
