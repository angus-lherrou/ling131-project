Sellars through a bay they uncovered some evidence going back ...\nYears of this poaching effort and what they were doing it was you know allowing basically ... they were contacting these third party sellers it recently and a lot of stuff that was on a day and they said hey you should come along and uh it joined in silver on Amazon you can sell these same products and we'll we'll work with you and stuff like that in\nVery interesting approach there\nAnd yes that is a that is an ongoing lawsuits they did a cease and desist first and then just\nIt just two weeks later bone lawsuit palm All right so let's let's let's dial back a number of years I'm used to be a the palm pilot the palm pilot pro the palm pilot a personal and a a ... a\nFew different ... pockets in digital assistants that were about the size of a smartphone maybe a little bit smaller and they did everything the smartphone can do today\nWith the exception of making a phone call okay so the so they didn't have as much memory but the programs are smaller and it's so palm went along and then they started doing smartphones but by the time they got to smartphones they were woefully behind\n... for whatever reason came out with a pang da ... last week and this is um it's referred to as the palm\nJust the palm and it is for lack of a better description it is annoying little cell phone that actually isn't the cell phone it old slide into your pocket\nAnd it will be a second screen that will be larger than the earth smart watch ... but somehow it's just not\nWorking now to quite the same way so it's\nIt it actually will allow you to make a phone call as an extension of your regular phone and it is an Android item\nAnd it's ... it's just really weird I I have no idea why they came up with it I I looked at it a number of different ways and it seems like they're looking for this to be just a second second screen what was the third screen I Am ... and\nFor those to be trying to figure this out I usually referred to in the industry we referred to the vein of the iPhone the smartphone the Android phone as being a second screen that the first screen being the TV\n[noise] so yeah this is going to be a YouTube had a major outage this week and a ... and when I see a major outage for a couple of hours\nThey were down as a matter of fact there were a few other things that we are going on over the course of this last week in regards to the Internet there were some day and asked problems or there was a serious change in the late DNS\nDomain names systems operate and that was that was something that they told apparently a bunch of high end in nerds that we're going to have to deal with the hardware or they told them for ages\nIn advance the the matter of months and months ahead of time but it didn't hit the news and it didn't get distributed down to the end users you die and pill\nActually last friday when the outage was supposed to happen on Saturday ... yeah I'm not too good part of a part of this whole concept of having an out in ...\nWe are already you know looking at two different images from two different points in time with a different than picturing yeah one of them does look a\nLittle bit more clear but that's because perhaps the camera wasn't moving as much maybe there's something else was going on maybe it's just a higher contrast ratio between the two televisions we don't know enough about this\nSo I'm going to tell you right now there is\nSome level of people playing them\nThese comparisons now let's go to the next level of discussing\nIt discussing the differences between four K. and eight to ... I'm going to take you on a little journey I Want you to imagine you're out on the front lawn you're looking at the grass and your front lawn you can see the individual little pieces of grass that are there right\nYou can see this is it is something that is invisible there you can distinguish between now however\nIf you leave your front lawn and you go across the street you can no longer differentiate between those two\n... between individual blades of grass why you're just too far away your vision is only capable of so much as a matter of fact most of the people out there\nHave they have somewhere I'll say eighty five percent of the people out there have twenty twenty vision or their mission is corrected to twenty twenty roughly\nThe other the other Fifteen Percent they can't correct their vision that far\nOr a rare they can corrected the or the it's on corrected a little bit better right mind is actually corrected just a little bit better when I wear glasses I have a little bit better than twenty twenty vision awesome I just came from off the whole an ophthalmologist uh what about a month ago or so\nNow so we don't have a delivery system we don't have\nAny way to really get the images up there but let's get another staffer right\nAway you can't differentiate from that far away and the why the reason why you can't differentiate from far away is because it's way too small everything just becomes a blur you see a nice lawn grass how far away is it before and the different blades of grass\nIf you will blur to gather on an eight K. television well here's here's the optimal daily distance where you can tell him just barely this actually this is optimal viewing distance\nOr before it starts to blurt out on an eighty five inch screen that's withstand sunscreen that I talked about optimal viewing distance somewhere between roughly two and a half feet\nTwo four and a half feet ... let me say that again I'm Sorry five and a half feet two and a half to five and a half feet most people do not fit that close to their TV why well at eighty five inches\nThat that's going to be a big huge viewing area\nIt's going to be absolutely gigantic nobody sits that close everything else and once you start\nMoving beyond that five and a half feet on an eighty five inch screen\nIt's not worth anything it blurs together it all becomes just a waste of money so I didn't tell him right now no matter how much have we seen over the course of the next few years eight have televisions\nAren't going to be worth it at all\nFor most people and I'm gonna I'm not going to stay up for a few years I'd say probably forever [noise] who knows things may change\nA little bit and probably get a kick televisions anyway this has been listening to computer talk radio I'll be back with more in just a moment [noise]\n\nI'm gonna give out at different websites than I normally do [noise] it is ready dot Gov G. O. V. forward slash hit what is this well this is a basic emergency kit [noise]\nI live in Southern California now California is the United states second Walter earthquakes\nAlaska being first in case you didn't know that [noise] then California and then we simply Oklahoma is been catching up eight hundred and eighty eight and twenty Seventeen and I'm\nKinda curious as to what's going on there [noise] um [noise] we have to be prepared at all times no matter where you live there's some natural disaster that is\nAwaiting is chance to be a thorn in your side we have tornadoes on through tornado alley we have hurricanes that hit the coast and we have a blizzard that\nHe had the northern states yeah we got the earthquakes yeah everybody's got their own little issues here and there so it's ... it's okay we\nAll need to pay attention to these things now\nThe government has put together a basic kit\nAnd there are a number of things on this list and I never read them off\nThe things that's changed over the years is the tack that I'm going to put at the end which is not part of their list so\nLet's dive in water\nOne gallon of water per person per day for at least three days this is for drinking this is for sanitation this is your basic need that\nNow the next one food three day supply of non perishable foods that's always ideal and and these are minimum you can go beyond that for instance first aid kit what kind\nOf first aid kit are you going to get you going to one of those little you know ten dollars specials\nThat you get down at CBS no I Would suggest getting a nice good heavy duty size do in the Amazon to look at the different first aid kids that are available out there was a larger the family the larger the home the larger the first aid kit whistles\nThese are for signaling for help you want to dust masks\nA that is going to help filtered contaminated air you want plastic sheeting and duct tape in case you needed shelter in place for a while and\nYes this was part of a sort of the the different threats\nLike terroristic threat but this is common sense stuff you still want this around\nFour okay let's say there's an earthquake you there's going to be dust in there there's going to make concrete dust in the air there is going to be a lot of different problems that are going to be coming along with this so you want to be able to have like a clean living area somewhere um\nMoist towel laps and garbage bags and plastic ties these are all\nReally blood for personal sanitation I suggest five gallon buckets there's also said that you can put onto five gallon buckets um\nIf you get my director there\nYou want to of course they're rancher pliers ah their special special tools they use for turning off the utilities so how do you turn off your gas you know how to do that\nDo you know how to turn off your water do you know how to turn off your electricity those are the key items you've got to know does manual can opener you got food intends\nAnd usually that it usually people have a lot of canned food there's only I mean it's it's a weird stuff you know for whatever reason you were going through the stories that hey I Want a can of rhubarb\nAnd you got a can of rhubarb\nNow for those of you who live ... bought a house like rhubarb my wife looks at me very strange when I get a can of rhubarb but that's another story you want your local maps as well now we've covered all of those but here's where we start moving into the tech items because\nYes we're going to have to get by for a while\nAnd we have to know what's going on a battery powered hand crank radio especially one\nThat has in a way that's a it's a weather radio stuff you want to like tone alerts and you want the extra batteries for those now the battery powered\nOr the hand crank if you get a hand cranked frequently they have the crank on them I I'm thinking of anytime anytime there's a great company\nAnd they support the American Red Cross which I'm also a supporter of them are they're the same people who make I'm a ... radios ... great radios so each on has um a hand crank radio that also takes batteries and it can also charge\nYour cell phone it's also get a one of them I think has a hand cranked regular batteries and sell ... solar charger and\nThe cell charger and I mean it's it's all put together all in one\nNow a is there are important items that are going to be on the radio the radio\nAllows you to hear news reports it keeps you informed about what's going on where to go for more help it allows you to understand what kind of disaster that you are facing a week we aren't always aware of how\nWhat I like about it is in the latest incarnation in Iowa is twelve it actually gives you little weather alerts I mean I started getting weather alerts and the latest version of the my radar apple ... that tells me rain starting in five minutes should last about Fifteen minutes\nI mean it's not accurate nights when I use this act Benjamin I have a back to the future part two moment where we can get a caller now it's pouring rain and dark brown looks at his watch and it stops us white on the tick\nToo by the national postal service wasn't as good as the weather services [laughter] it it ... we really hard living that back to what your moment that's an area where they got that one right now it's really cool and before we wrap up\nWant to point out that in a feature in the clock app\nIn the bed time mode if you set the bedtime mode when you wake up in the morning we'll have\nA good morning breathing\nAnd the weather for the day on your luck scream and that is super cool and I should point out before we wrap up injuring Iowa is twelve point one a major point release it will be coming out in the next week please do not afraid to do it just yet hang out we'll tell you when it's\nOut on my radar then I I\nVery cool this has been through a log will keep mc ... and you're listening to computers are great I'll be back with more in just tonic\nMa ... no no no relation to mother Teresa I almost said mother Terri and uh she reached out to me at ... ... talk radio dot com down to the best\nTime to purchase and video games and video game consoles and this is something that any of you can reach out to me by going for answers your questions computer jak radio dot coms roll down the races contact us I Will get back with you or you know the phone number is there to\nTeach and reach out to me via some anyway monetary these she had a very valid question do there are certain times when prices are going to go up when the prices go up well prices go up just before Christmas prices go up just before\n... three and stay high three eat three and then they start to ... uh uh\nJust before school starts for whatever reason they're a video game prices also go up I think that's because we're in that that position of wanting to buy things for our children\nSo young sometimes if you have a little bit higher discretionary income you might get a video game for your for your child however they may get distracted\nBy those video games and their\nGrades yeah their grades climate and the bat that's when you want to be ready that's when you want to pounce on this so two big times for for purchasing video games or video game consoles I it right after grades come out and that's just at any of the quarters\nA show it basically ... this is a punishment to that happens you know what you've been really bad\nJohnny and your grades are showing it and we think it's because of your video games so we're going to get rid of your video game console we're going to get rid of your video games or\nIn the ... any of the fourth quarter urged even at the end of the school year I Know that kind of competes with eight three uh but it's still it's still a valid time ... after Christmas right after Christmas there is\nA for a short period of time the the prices are still high but they they start to drop off pretty quickly as returns come in\nSo you can check out the returns eh also after a new console was announced so I ... after each different layer of console is announced\nThan the previous console it goes on sale and sometimes it's a matter of just a few weeks before where the prices start to plummet I don't suggest doing as actors\nAnd the reason for that is because you are now buying the previous version of the council you're buying something that is already somewhat out dated the best time to buy a if you want something to last a long time is of course when the console is brand new to the latest and greatest\nGeneration of that console so there you go there's just a little bit of advice there\nFor you for your mind needs for saving money for for getting the best value and more and that's a that was all the things to mom's Harry who we are going to send out something I've got to get some stuff that has long video games\nThe that she can add to her collection a because
