second hour\nOr in the pod cast a coming up later on this hour I'm doing too well\nI'm going to lament the fact that I I think that the price of phones smartphones is getting out of hand stay there already are in the second hour cases in the first hour and I'm going to come up next with nerds millennial churchgoers and a common thread\nBetween them and we'll be tackling that pastor mark is not to not around this week uh he'll be back very soon I\nEvery week I have an ... of various Sainz one of the things that I\nAm kind of merging a couple of things I saw something and said I'm so old and dirty I remember when and I kind of a mixed any of this and I remember when the Internet was a place where the big guys call it a\nFree and open the soap box for all people where censorship lists never going to happen and that kinda fits right in with the news and\nI'm going to read on some uh some various quotes a Google or Google's atmosphere of creativity and challenge has helped us provide an unbiased accurate in free access\nTo information for those who rely on us around the world that lose from Larry Page and Sergey Brin and two thousand four in two thousand twelve Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook as a tool to create\nA more honest and transparent dialogue around the government the results will be better solutions to some of the biggest problems of our time\nAnd in twenty Seventeen the CEO of Twitter said Twitter is the free speech wing of the free speech party\nAnd the things have changed for instance Joel Kaplan he works at Facebook he is a top executive there he went to the cabin on um the cabin on hearing and a\nA Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg and a bunch of other people basically screamed and yelled and ah it called for his head on a ... a lot of people screamed and yelled and called her his head on a platter ah but I they made him seriously back\nTrack his presence there\nNow if you think that that is in ... let's talk about the fact that Facebook is real moving hundreds of accounts that are well to them it's banned in political misinformation now this is something that is not\nWith any kind of accountability oh we think that they are providing information that is misinformation\nSo we're going to remove those accounts and oh yeah if you think that's where it stopping know Google has also said that they're going to start censoring political content specifically\nThat they disagree with not not false contents quote unquote fake news if they disagree with it they're going to\nStop it to what extent if you think I'm I'm kidding about this um they actually well okay ... mess was an internal company briefing but it's a hideous some whatever it is eighty pages long\nAnd it is presenting a big huge ... push for we need to be the good to censor\nWe need to abandon free speech for safety and civility this is scary\nBut this is really scary because yeah they are looking to basically just struck shutting things down and the references that they put up were you specifically calling out anything\nHaving to do with President Trump being pro trade as a President Trump or ... and oh yeah there's a lot of stuff in regards to\nI Will yeah [laughter]\nNever my ... it's ... it's just amazing to me this is this is something that is\nScary especially when you consider that we are right around the corner from our next election\nAnd what exactly are we going to be prevented from hearing about what exactly are we not going to be able to talk about\nAnd that that is very concerning\nSo now over the course of the last few weeks we talked about Amazon okay they uh they're raise everybody's pay that was a a two weeks ago a week ago we found out oh yeah they raised the pay about the pay also included losing some bonuses well there's also now a new email that has been\nA center around to everybody at whole foods and that's been actually passed along to the public and people are kind of freaking\nOut because of some of the raises\nAre well ... you get a dollar an hour or basically up ten Fifteen dollars an hour raise if you aren't there already so ... so you're up to Fifteen dollars if you were already at Fifteen you get an a dollar an hour or more or\nYou get two dollars if your team leader now if you're a team leader that was maintain let's say Thirteen dollars an hour you're now going to get bumped up to Fifteen dollars an hour and all of your team members are going to be at oh yeah Fifteen dollars an hour\nAnd follow me there [noise] yeah so there's a lot of screaming and yelling going hey what's going on with us and we'd been working here for two three five however many years and we're going to get we're going to get something small or nothing at all\nAnd that's that's scary that's\nA that's kind of amazing especially since they're also yes eliminating those bonuses as we mentioned so\nWhat incentive is there we're going to find out we're going to visit or going to be following this we're going to be watching this to see how this is Randy experiment is going to present itself\nMicrosoft has a had a very interesting situation ... release items for windows tend the October twenty Eighteen of paid well\nPeople were finding that their personnel files were disappearing their main deleted\nAnd yeah there's a little bit more to that too because these files were being deleted from folders that windows\nShouldn't even have known about shouldn't have touched I mean yes things is to there but uh let's say you had a folder in your region directory that said documents\nNot a ... not any of the usual is folders that we would see their let's say it's um it's fun documents or or a work documents or whatever it is something that Microsoft normally would not see or touch and yet they were deleting stuff from there\nWow\nScary now don't worry about that too much that Microsoft is already yanked the entire ... section of that updates they've gone through and they've said whoops we made a mistake and they are fixing that problem so you don't have to worry about it\nIt ... I don't want to be in a click but they have issues they have to have problems and needs that can only come with a ... ... with the support of a community that word since shares with them\nI've seen this in action I I've seen there's an accident my church I value it because we work to grow people outside of their own little tiny shell there was\nA section that article it talked about stop placing blame on individuals who struggle to get connected again all of this this is a U.S connecting all of this is about ah\nI don't I Will tell you that churches a place where we need\nThat ... where we can find connection Wi Fi connection to it to the various people that are around us and we find connection to the Bible and we find connection to God\nNow I I I'm getting kind of preaching here I'm getting kind of down to that that religion road for a moment\nLike here is something that is very valuable to a lot of people at least start chasing them away whether we're talking about church or talk about work we talked about wherever we are\nWhen we start chasing away the millennials we've started busy and all of these uh dissing disrespecting all of these millennials\nYeah they they they all wanted a job where they worked for four hours and they get paid a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year you know you haven't we start disrespecting them even though they do have some disconnect at times we still need to help them we need to connect with them\nAgain millennials nerds they struggled to connect now I I'm a talk\nShow host on a type a personality in a one on one and I am I'm an extrovert one on one I'm an extrovert when I Want you to the microphone why because there's me there's a if you ever is helping run\nSound here it yet and that's it you know if it's one on one the ... there is a\nPerson who's interested in me and what I Do and I can I can give the ... to them but I don't talk about this very often but in a larger situation I actually become a type B personality where I actually start soaking up everything around me and I slowly\nDrift back to the side to go to the wall does that sound like a millennial as well yeah\nMillennials injured they struggle like anyone else does they having society their appearance in a church a new office another unfamiliar location may actually be an overwhelming task here is a challenge\nFor all the listeners out there I Want you to please bridge that gap with anyone and everyone knew that you might need\nIce yourself in the news of that person and encourage them to share\nListon and treat them like anyone else that you care about that's how we're going to get past some of these barriers yes I struggle with opening up conversations but I Try to do that on a\nRegular basis whether it's a ... after computer store or IEDs outwards or it's that church or aids wherever wherever wherever\nI Am working towards reaching out to my fellow human beings men just to just to get along to make this a friendlier world for any of those of you who is this\nMessage resonates with have no fear churches a place where there are people who are far more uh maladjusted then you give them credit for\nIf you go to a church where everyone has it altogether and they're all perfect and then there's something wrong they're all wearing masks they're all\nHiding what what actually is wrong because that's my pastor as bypass little steps as frequently we're all sinners so you wind up at a church where everybody's\nPerfect than they are not centers around church to find a different one find one which is full of you know the headed up bikers when you do people\nAre a little bit crazy kids face it you're a little bit crazy too [laughter] we all are this is Benjamin Rocco you're listening to computers are great I'll be back with more in just a moment [noise]\n\nThe website can hundreds on radio dot com can return to radio dot com that's where you can reach us is global down to where it says contact us and you've got a bunch of different options and we will get back with you do them theater and joins me now\nWe're kind of makes me think of just a little bit to do we do that in the\nAir and tea or one of the big things even I had a conversation about [noise] a a just a couple of weeks ago in regards to computer mice and men are and I wanted to compare up it just kind of get an idea of the mouse usage\nOver in the apple world I I Know that [noise]\nIs this some things that that we can talk about I I Know the magic mouse is different than than what we're used to sell it let's start off let me let me describe to to users what I use I use a larger take him seven oh five mouse I have\nActually been a few of these I Love these this is a\nA a standard to buttoned mouse with a squirrel we'll which are also operates as a button and I it also has left right on this role we'll plus a page to\nPage down on the side where my thumb is in in in the tissue button for which I live in what you can program all of these buttons different ways but I use it for minimizing whatever the active application is um\nI mean that's just kind of my work line move between a lot of different applications I was a magic medals from what I understand it it's it's a mouse which has kind of a touch pad on it and can well like if it were a hundred and three only understand\nWhere you are yeah with the apple mouse we need to look at the history of apple mice because on the earliest Macintoshes\nThe old beige Macintoshes\nAnd they used a port on the desktop called the ab board the apple desktop bus [noise] but\nWhen Steve Jobs returned to apple and introduced the first bondi blue I'm back in Nineteen Ninety eight it had a brand new mouse with the revolutionary new interface that was the USB port I mean we did not\nHave devices that had\nUSB ports let alone mice that were us be so the interface itself is revolutionaries of time [noise] but\nThe new mouse by apple was not well received because it was like a little hockey puck it was completely round outlay and Arab or have used it\nIt was very difficult to find your center I mean even with the way the tale was the corn on the mouse it was very hard to find a center and a third party company made a snap on\nFor this which actually made it an oblong mouse but that was very short lived and in\nLate two thousand apple introduced a brand new redesign mouse called the pro mouse which is roughly the oblong shape that we're using the day yeah yeah and that\nGave way to the mighty mouse which had a scroll ball which is army directional now\nThat ball got very dirty very quickly and ... track of all no I'm Talking about on top of it this way saying well you have a scroll we'll on many mice yeah this had a little tiny ball which was says he has\nWeapons so ... but it would get gummed up and dirty and lose its functionality very quick apple\nWas pretty quick to respond to this by then\nInventing we now refer to as the magic mouse and what's needed at the magic mouse is it holds true to\nSteve Jobs promised that we will never sell a multi button mouse well in a world where PC users are coming over wanting to write click and not wanting to control quick on their keyboard to get the\n... to get the can textural menu better right click would give you want to windows PC how do we do that how do we deliver the promise of not having a ... button mouse while the same time giving people extra functionality they made the entire top surface of the mouse what is essentially a track pad\nSo you can go into the mouse control panel in the system preferences and you can have it so that when you touch the right side of the mouse it actually functions as\nA write click or you can turn a function\nOf the off altogether and you basically have what is\nLeft click only a mouse but they event you know to have a situation where it gets all dirty and then you can scroll\nNow that's a lot of money that a lot of money that's\nGoing out the door and we keep spending or not but there were certain drivers to that as a matter of the different software packages\nThat were coming at us the different abilities and capabilities that were being thrown at us now we can add in us be into the system now we can add in the latest and greatest Microsoft Office now we can add in this that or the other thing\nBut at a certain point it kind of slowed down at a certain point I realized that I Am tackling things way too quickly\nYes if you know and the two thousands their religion thousands yes every two years was a good grade point for me to keep not on bleeding that I even leading edge but close to bad the leading edge\nToday I get the high end system it it'll run more like about four years five years for me and that's perfectly fine\nYes uh you know I made a side I've got to certain things that I Need to do a a ... a year and actually they're ... and things I Do like that I I tackled the system and I make it better\nBut is this something we're going to need\nOur smartphones I seen\nOr at least I force seeing a future where we aren't going to be chasing after the latest and greatest whether it's iPhone or Lucy I'm sudden phones or whatever it is\nWe're going to look for the device that probably best suited for us but is it to be that own very kill that it used to be I mean right now I'm starting to look\nAt a level of over ... that is not to sustainable\nWe need to probably and reflect on this all of us I mean all of this has been listening to your computer talk radio [noise] we'll be back with more\nIn just a moment\nSince he had reached down to me she's got she's done an issue with her son he's it's way too close to the television or F ... according to her and she's concerned about his eye care she's concerned about a lot of different things and you can reach out to me you got any questions computer talk\nRadio dot com computer talk radio dot com now let's dive into this Cynthia is concerns are about\nTo emerge as something that we should all be concerned about that I see kids all the time I'm Wondering the lunch and I see these kids and they are holding the phone inches away from their face the they yes everything gets bigger\nEverything's it you know old all kinds of wonderful but the reality is we're supposed to hold books were supposed to hold whatever it is we're looking at at arm's length now if it's a big screen TV yeah\nA a matter of is there a few feet away there they're going to be fine if they if they're ... you know you're worried about nose prints on the television\nTo Africa concern\nBut get them away but we still want to help help the ... there's something that the build up let us know as far as I strain whenever we're looking at the same thing at a same distance for too long now how do we come back after this how do we tackled\nThis and get it out all the way well what do we do sell there is a twenty twenty twenty rule\nAnd they'll help you keep twenty twenty vision so how does it work\nEvery twenty minutes look at something twenty feet or ... or more away for twenty seconds\nOr more and we can apply this all the time this applies whether we're talking about our cell phones were talking about video games are talking about books you know the old fashioned type yes paperback hardback books everybody's\nLooking it'd be like I\nI yes I I'm Sorry you know they used to exist what can I write [laughter] so it's like twenty twenty twenty ... twenty minutes twenty feet twenty seconds\nIf you apply this if you would encourage other people to apply this this is going to go a long way your eyes\nAre valuable to eat if you lose your eyes site you know you're going to have a hard time in life now\nYes I I Want to encourage and a few other things a distance yes I should be arm's distance minimum and if we're talking in a big screen TV probably\nMom and dad's arm's distance not the five year old learns distance a a ... it's it's just a lot better all the way round\nThere are different things you can do a for instance you can set up by\nThe time outs on certain pieces of hardware you can shut down the fire wall after a certain period of time you can make it so that yes the you will no longer be able to access whatever it is it's destroying her eyesight\nI think yeah educating them and encouraging them sitting timers for twenty minutes and having them look away for twenty feet for twenty seconds that's going to be a lot better\nThan a lot of the other end runs that we do around it is still this has been listening to
