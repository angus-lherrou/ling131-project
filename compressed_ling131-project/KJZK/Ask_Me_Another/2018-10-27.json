I I saw four different articles I Ming capital eating it like this\nIt's a hostile work environment for just about anybody and if you're not politically correct it's even more hostile cell and we'll see how that all unfold\nOf course Netflix is going to be facing some other problems coming up in in the near future we're yes they are going to be having to deal with okay and right now they have to deal with Hulu\nAnd you to read to some extent\nAnd ... yes CBS has there are all access and there's a few other different uh focuses that are out there\nBut currently Disney is planning to their own their own streaming service and a TNT is coming out with one of its Time Warner focused Amazon or Amazon Prime already out there and they're also a big competitor\nBut we are starting to see something where a lot of these different companies are going to take their own uh movies back in house\nAll the ah productions they've already said do you know they're going to a definitely\nA take back some of these movies because they're creating their own services and that'll be as early as a mid twenty Nineteen I think so uh this is going to be kind of the breakdown of ... is streaming learning to work\nUh we've ... we've all screamed we want\nThe ability to control what we have on television that all a cart service ... out of the cable well it's coming to that the way from all of these different services will see how the whole unfolds\nSwatch is a guy in the news I I'm actually kind of surprised I didn't realize they were around any longer or to any great extent I should say\nIt but they're announcing that they're coming out of a smart watch now they say they did come out with one a little while back that was specifically made for beach volley ball players this was their target audience I kitchen not a\nBut they're coming out with one that is going to be for the open market I I'll tell you I I I'm I I'm not particularly\nEnthralled by that is uh other than the fact that yeah I I'm I'm kind of surprised that they're that they're ... back in the market again\nStephen Hawking wheelchair well he's a he's passed away earlier this year and\nA yeah it's it saved an auction and some of his possessions including yes ah actually it's an early version of his motorized wheelchair and that'll be that'll be kind of interesting I Wonder I and I wasn't able to find out any details on that is\nIf they were going to have\nHis computer his voice computer up for sale\nDifferent items were designed for objective performance improvement\nThings like how many people did you serve how many drinks did you serve how many plays its special entrees appetizers desserts Adams up sizing up sales and so forth and you got some give and take on those up cells why because well yeah\nThat is a subjective area but now it also includes it how many people came in the door with an unbeatable bad attitude because they simply burn the dinner at home and have given up yet again and we just need substance\n... oh I don't have any food in my stomach and just it's an two hours late I Am just not happy okay\nPerhaps the gas that came in has\nA different expectation about service than the general world you've actually seen those people that's the that's the lady over their chief screening because her steak fries and she's insisting she wanted mashed potatoes even though\nWe heard her hurrying fries because she was when we were hoping she'd better order or maybe it's a guest\nWho might be a closeted racist or sexist against a great black wage her not when he drinks so you know I'm I'm mixing those two together\nWe have no idea whether they're racist or executive they're just giving it down points because it has to be a black guy instead of a white woman and it does exist some companies are now listening anything not again not a hundred percent perfect as being a complaint as a reason to punish\nWhoever you're dealing with you in this case yes we are talking about service but it could be yes the ... the ... the dentist or as the dental assistant\n... if you look at those ... those surveys the list five is average middle of the road but if you see that yeah that that experience as average what happens worse yet they're presenting questions\nThat are no longer really objective as to that particular person would you come back oh yeah great service but the state was overpriced how clean as a restaurant will\nI didn't think about it before but you know I see a napkin over there on the on the floor but that's not my ... my shirt rich fault would you recommend to little friend\nIn advance lists for your steak house I'm not going to tell people\nThis is becoming prevalent everywhere and I hate to bring ended up just because I Know that there are people out there that wish to see the world to burn and would love to just blast away I Love computers and I think we should use them more but we need to have meaningful data\nYour numbering system might be different than the next person I've had employers give me perfect previews I've also had other employers give me what they consider the perfect reviews you're doing a great job but they gave me will world the numbers\nSo that they could say well this is where you need to improve business where you don't need to do so much improvement focus here and they explained those details and they've always given the increases in selling they've always given any similar increases in salary\nBut I don't have an answer for solutions for this problem that worked with rolling into I just hope that somebody else or comes up with a better solution and it's one that's going to be clearly objective spaced\nAnd doesn't punish because\nBob and Barbara had a really bad day\nOff and don't even get me started on the taping percentages difficulty to Eighteen twenty and twenty two percent in an industry that spent years telling us Fifteen Percent\nIs the norm for tipping yeah this is Benjamin Rockwell listening to computer talk radio I'll be back with more in just a moment [noise]\n\nThe website ... radio dot com computer talk radio dot com that's where you can reach out to us ... says contact us and we welcome any of the contacts uh there's a lot of different\nThings that people have suggested how do I fix my computers maybe you should talk about this on the radio the captain hatred Tonkin radio dot com [noise]\nHas their mind joins me now this is where we get into the crossers have faith in technology and that and merge [noise]\nWhen you see things posted on Facebook that are called to treat their lives their eyes the whole ... arguments started up and there are of course the\n... I mean we're we're we've got to the election right here I it politically charged sites and people are going to scream out fake to true based on their own opinions right and ... we say Google it and and we keep petey is often referenced as a source of the truth\nBut one of the things that I I'm starting to see is this isn't really necessarily truth this is just ten cents is ... ... it and then you do gal is all about well actually even even then with the Google they we we can go down that whole road but sure\nIt won't do it because they have their own political designed and uh and thoughts and ideas um how is this idea though I I don't want to get into a you know what is on Wikipedia other than the fact that it's a consensus it's fine\nWhat is true and there's all kinds of arguments behind the scenes as to what is true and what is ...\nHow is ... cents is going to face the church how's it going to affect once we believe in when trees just no longer allowed to be absolute but just feeling suggest a consensus from loves feelings\nYeah I I mean first of all I'm just because the majority of belief something's true ah doesn't necessarily mean that that's true ah for example the majority thought the world was flat a for a lot of humanity\nConsensus yeah yeah [laughter]\nExactly um in fact the one the first guy that spoke out against that got killed for saying that right um so it it's not always true that that there is just because there's a consensus something's true um\nYou know saying so it's not necessarily culturally based true um\nThe the other piece of it is is is um I don't think that the truth is is relative I I don't think what's true for you is not necessarily true for me uh there are some things that that that is the case um we caught subjective truth ah you know a chocolate chip ice cream is my favorite ice cream and it may not\nBe yours not really not yeah yeah so you're wrong and I'm right now uh you know of course not right that Chilean um and but then we have what's called objective truth in that things that are are true for you and me or or whoever your insulin help diabetes that objective truth right I'm\nIn and I don't think that people actually think that truth is relative uh\nI think people just pick and choose what they believe is true ah into it specially on moral grounds um\nThat we we we see our side of it in our desires in it or and then we we let go of things that don't fit inside of that world view it doesn't mean that they're not true uh it just means that I'm choosing to ignore the truth behind and and that\nSeems to be more culturally true for the culture that right now um is that we we like the ... the idea of our comfort in in what you know that truth for us it's just what makes us feel good or versus things that that may feel like they're hurting us\nSo now one could Lincoln easily it's throw out an argument I and I I I Know there are certain people that say but are are are they in a little bit deeper in the weeds and we normally do but you know the king James version of the Bible is the only ... version of the Bible mhm\nAnd yet I Know there are errors in the king James version right and then there's I didn't know we'd get the whole men and then we've got a ... an IV and all of that and there's ... there's all kinds of arguments mhm\nHaven't we already at ... at a point just in Bible translation are where we almost have this consensus of truth versus absolute truth what would you say to to that kind of idea\nUh uh well well a couple of things uh [laughter] I split chew on those yeah ... yeah a little bit um I I mean I I don't know anybody um you know for going within the Christian faith uh I don't know anybody that\nUm that wouldn't allow me to read from a from a different translates into ... million you mean they're not going to say no the Bible is true and your Bible falls they may agreed or they may think that this one is more accurately\nTranslated but they wouldn't say that that Bible is going to lead you to hell you know what I mean [laughter]\nI have met all\nThose people yelled layers scary\nWell then I'm going to allow that to me an outlier [laughter] I'm ... and say that you know that that's a different conversation yeah\nYeah and and I mean that is true that this world is is there's so many layers to everything that you can't some everything into one little box although it would be nice yeah yeah um so so yeah I I\nDownloaded the proper drivers and installed them not only did we give complete functionality where it stop propping the user to press okay on the front of the printer every time they point to print something it also wound up installing the proper scanner drivers so they can take care take full advantage of the fact that the each paper in your head a scanner filmed\nIn his mouth and when he went to those all England's yes absolutely yes now did it have the facts and I I I I I Am wondering if they if they're still putting the facts cards and\nThey are on some this would have been different particularly habit but I did that went up\nA better we can go for a client who has one so I Do know that you treat is still making all the ones\nWe have acts with us facts options now there is a technology that's almost a dead it's it's on its way out its kids dying but very few tiny cell facts\nStill is important in legal and medical\nYa yeah I'd say becoming less so in the world of finance and learn\nFrom this is Benjamin ... I'm Keith mc ...\n... I'll be back with more in just a moment\nWhen was your first digital camera [noise] it was probably somewhere right around\nWell it was after mine I'm gonna see it like that at least somewhere probably in the early to thousands maybe a little bit later mid to Dallas and for some people but mine was back in I mean they say ... Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd we're talking some really Haiti is options back then and they were expensive too I was Kim Perry of\nMy Nikon and I was just kind\nOf ... some of the different things I I recently probably\nI I shouldn't even say recently a matter of a year or so\nI go I was cleaning up boxes and I came across this thing and I just checked it to the side because they advances we have on a on digital cameras today are just amazing so I'll go get my uh nighttime be fifty five hundred stand the predecessor the or the deep forty\nI which I enjoy both of those they're nice digital as the largest but the original digital cameras that I had was probably resolution wise six forty by four eighty we're talking that\nIt probably a tenth of a mega pixel I I I don't even know how it compares up compare that to today our cell phones in my ... my my current cell phone has ... I I forget I think it's an eight mega pixel camera\nI I'd have to look that up I don't really uh it doesn't really matter to me my forte only had\nIt was it was just ... mega pixel I still use it\nI I still haven't around because it takes amazing pictures\nIt it handles the is the whole photography thing a lot better than a ... then you know then the cell phone camera we are moving into direction however\nWhere a lot of people are moving away from their digital west L. ours they're moving away from the additional cameras that they have to lug around\nIt was very interesting I went to Disneyland oh I I don't know about a month to month and a half ago maybe two months whatever doesn't matter but I I remember noting that a lot of people had their cell phones out and they were taking pictures with those\nInstead of taking pictures with regular cameras that would be one around their neck\nBecause we're creating a different kind of memory today were all able to carry around are in the camera or however you want to refer to it to the ... the ... you know we've got that instance do know that we can store and we can Stuart tons of pictures\nI kind of lament the idea that we have moved in that direction because we don't look at our pictures anywhere near as often as we should\nWe take a picture and then we moved on we take too many pictures and we move on and we just move on like that whereas with my\nOriginal digital camera I still had to slow down and so they can take more pictures and if I had a bad picture I can delete it\nBut I had to think about it because it had no memory card in it [noise] it had mental ability to pay to just pop out the card and put in a new one [noise] it's actually retained it\nOnly it would fit into memory kind of like what film what do you remember that great film film we used to have to put in the end we have thirty six okay fine [noise] we'd be better at Roswell you're listening to computer tucked radio [noise]\nSupport for private Public Radio's provided by better though to the drive through wildlife adventure park in Williams, Arizona view by should bug and go big or cheap and black bear from the safety uncovered of your private vehicle or troubled coach watch playful Barrett cubs up close at the end of your to Arizona\nLike forty at highway sixty four in Williams, Arizona dot com\n[noise]\n\nPhone number ... a day to day married eight a day to that they take six three seven three eight eight eight and its toll free anywhere in the country you can reach out and talk with it well you're going to talk of me and then uh\nI Will forward your message on if it's for someone else but there you go again ...\nMarried at Eighteen tape Steve Gass he joins me\nYou're talk radio in the ... for me this week\nWell as a certain somebody I Know has a new car in the family yeah yeah\nWhat better to do then let's talk about\nThe new tech for your car\nOkay so and so this is stuff that is that a car would come with or this is after market stuff\nAfter markets decay alright sure\nThose little odds and ends that you want to put in your car that's high tech but you don't necessarily need to connect them up to anything okay All right so it's the first one\nOkay this is a a a by best tech that B.
