I've actually experienced at a few times All right so let's talk about what's coming up this week uh let's see here in the second\nHour and then to give you tips on setting up a new computer later on this ... going to join ... talked about registry edits in windows were going to have pastor mark is well closing out cautions say from\nMe that you should not require or need to the requirements of others especially during the middle of political discussions on the line next step and then it will cover the revelation that yes we\nTo technology that first let's dive into the news limiting your children's screen time we're talking about yes they're smart phones or tablets their TV movies whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever\nImproves brain function yes now there are certain elements that come with this you need to make sure that they get the right amount of sleep that it the right amount of physical activity\nUh end of this is this is something that really is this should be obvious to most people and a lot of people are saying no no no no no but I I can tell you that the the generation that's coming along right now\nIs almost spoiled oh\nI'm\nSorry I don't mean to mock them but if if your kids are doing that you need to wean them off of the technology yes as a cover in the next segment we\nWe're all this technology and you know to some extent we need to use it as a tool it needs to be a good tool but yeah [noise] well the past couple of different things they have\nBeen re enrolling former customers into an unlimited plan unless they opt out now this is where it gets really kind of scary crazy\nSilly they are whipping people\nWho have canceled then if they don't click on a specific to opt out link and they're giving 'em unlimited movies now the people who are not who didn't cancel their getting punished they only get three movies per month\nSo this is this is getting ridiculous and moving past I Would think that they are on the way out except for the fact that somebody just came along and gave them sixty five million dollars in funding\nNow this is something that's interesting because they're not saying who gave them the funding yeah all\nRight so yeah I'm a privilege\nAre going to be experiencing some very interesting issues if they're going to New Zealand here in the United states if you went to the United states you need to provide your password upon request from customs officials\nOtherwise it gets [noise] they they can hold that technology not give it to the New Zealand going a little bit different they're gonna give you a five thousand dollar fine if you do not have handed over your phone or laptop password now it's not enough to unlock it from what I'm understanding you\nNeed to give the password itself\nAnd a ... there is some discussion to they're going to be updating this I was in saying that yeah you don't have to give up or your password but it's still getting tired of it kind of crazy now there is a a certain level of do they have to have a\nJustifiable cause however\nAre the only reasonable suspicion but they don't have to prove what that is a reasonable suspicion is there's no way to actually even challenge them to say you don't have probable cause you don't have any reason to open up my phone yes we do\nWe don't have to tell you do it now are we find you five thousand knowledge yeah\nThat's kinda creepy but then again that's not the United states\nOr it could be sooner or later who knows\nWhy fight has a different a\nDifferent thing that's going to be happening with then naming convention you've heard these before eight oh two eleven and be able to live in a ... eleven G. eight oh two eleven in or in the ... series router or James theories router and the next one is eight X.\nYeah they're making it easier\nBut why file lions as you might figure out the Why Violence in the group of people who do all of this branding and the naming of all of these what they've said okay fine we're going to do why five six is the next version\n[noise] so you're going to be able to just check your phone your your hardware whatever it is and it will say why of four or five or six and will continue from there and that's going to be the direction that they go with now why why one two and three\nNetflix only each of these different groups that you know ... my wife and I we have chosen in the past\nTo move through in binge watching some TV shows will watch a couple of them in a row ... series you know we'll we'll go through and yeah you know where that was the season finale will watch the season opener next day you know it will spend a little bit more extra time a year and then we'll get on with the rest of our day\n[laughter] my wife and I know a short while back we binge watched we watched the first show of the series on friday night and on Saturday we continued with that series and we continued and we looked at each other after each of these different episodes\nAnd so we got to find out what this cliffhanger is all about what you got to resolve that as we were hooked all kinds of different science from the art of the director and the the different people involved the acting the action of the the story writers all of this supply is everywhere in our lives to\nFace book they've got us in our own little bubbles where we're seeing all of our friends and yet other friends who have different views and yeah we can silence them further generate in our own little echo chambers which is actually\nWe find that it's actually\nNot all that bad for us to have at least some segregation\nYeah some statistics actually came out saying that we actually will get driven further apart if we continually look for people who are in drastically different than us or maybe we should be listening to others and accepting in learning\nFrom people who are a little bit different\nBut if somebody's really diametrically opposed to us I don't think of that I I I I'm trying to think if somebody out there that okay if you were a far far left lane mean\nPerson maybe it shouldn't be listening to Alex Jones for instance who's very far right that's the only going to serve to just ... increased the divide\nBut maybe it might listen to somebody a little bit more centrist like me I'm I'm [laughter] okay so I'm a computer nerd and and I am centrist but a more libertarian ... but that's another whole story cell\nBut we've got things like Instagram Snapchat which are basically moving along all of these different ideas of how we have to have a picture perfect of life that\nThat actually cares away it upset that actually cares is down because there are people who were spending half an hour to an hour getting just the right to looking picture\nAnd I look at that and I will never attained that I Am not a body builder I'm not on those troublesome I Am just a normal nerd All right maybe I'll take pictures of my glasses of those classes are good but here\nWe have moved in different directions where\nPeople can target us these different companies are targeting us in so many different ways to everything that you can imagine is ...\nBecause we are amongst roughly two billion people around the world that are plugged into technology yes there are people that are striving and I encourage the idea of getting the rest of the billions of people onto the Internet and communicating\nBut at a certain point we turn to them yes the downtrodden the the people in third world countries into the product as well and\nYeah there are there are some crazy things out there there's all kinds of different ideas you realize\nThat when you go on the line they're targeting you based on what they believe that your religion is or you may have actually already said in your religion or they made it makes her getting you based on your particular racial makeup or they may have already figured that out you may have to hold them\nOr maybe it's because of your but particularly or ...\nWhatever location you're at the ZIP Code or your your city or whatever your state and they're looking at all kinds of different things if you are pro in in one direction you you you start looking at the different design Web sites\nAnd I'm thinking of a three D. printers they'll start targeting you for that they'll start targeting you if you're a quilter but with friends who are quilt church\nAnd they are now delivering messages that are actually kind of creepy Facebook found out that depressed team by more makeup I I'm I'm I'm just let me just sitting here boggled by this\nI Would you even look up something I mean I guess you do want to buy or sell more makeup\nBut you're now hitting people when they're\nEmotionally vulnerable that's kind of that's kind of creepy\nAnd there's all kinds of different things there's all kinds of different whether we're talking about the influence of going over us the of personalized ... as a kind of the different things where we're being told we're missing out\nAnd we're being told that it's a you know our self esteem as bad or good or whatever and they're even a number of different things where [noise]\nThe idea of consensus it's not real it's it's actually somewhat fake or sometimes really fake\nIt you know there's so much they're\nAll of these algorithms all these different formulas all of these different things that are set up\nTo profit from problem is that these companies would go broke if if people really started to pay attention and started to drop off and you know I'm I'm concerned at times that I might become a target because\nI preach out against this so I Want you to step back every once in a while and think about what church do what's your engaging with and to think about how worth while it is household some it is\nAnd if you are actually the product this is Benjamin rock while you're listening to ...
