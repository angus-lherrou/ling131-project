S. and M. and and it was worked out over several different ... several months um\nWhere there was an agreement that was that was reached and we all agreed that we would not do a um [noise]\nTry to try to interfere with that without agreement in any way\nAnd I'm no initiatives no backstabbing no you know trying to tear the agreement apart um without everybody else being at the table which was really fair and um and so we held onto that we held up the agreement\n[noise] um [noise] but the problem is that not too long I think it was like ah like the next month after\nAfter the new rates went into effect which was a four percent increase in the rate of for a PS customers um and we were being told and I'm a I'm an atheist customers so I can say we\nWere being told that would be you know a five or six dollar increase in our in our monthly bill well ride right away it turned out to be so much more than that some people were seeing a twenty dollar increase some people were saying you know a fifty dollar increase in my account and then I just found out this week uh\nHad a fifty percent increase ... with no extra usage or no more usage\nSo there was some some some real you know clumsy things that were happening with the rates right after that settlement agreement and that rate increase went into effect and I'm just wondering if you had heard anything about that and if that was something on your mind\nIt is on my mind and you know I have I sit and listen to people as I Am\nThe state and I hear about how\nMuch their bills have not just double triple but in some cases quadrupled\nAnd you know I sit on numerous occasions if to commission and and I do understand settlement agreement settlement agreement that you know people come to the table and they agreed to disagree you look at it that wrong there is an agreement right\nBut in this case I think clearly there needs to be a forty dashed to fifty two now that's a state statute\nThat allows the commission\nAre any one commissioner\nTo write a letter to the doctor and say hey maybe we made a mistake\nWe had no clue that a PS is going to come up with a new way of failing to my service there are a lot of issues that are cannot\nEntwined into their recent case\nAnd I think that they really need to reopen it and take a look at it see what mistakes were made because the new feeling structure is not a good structured it it is that it's just it's not the same structure that prior to this re case [noise]\nAh so you can't compare the issue here last year to the year before\nMhm when I notice to what I heard from from my accounting okay he's a numbers person and so he's very wonky about getting in and comparing this bill to last month's bill to you know last year's bell the same month\nAnd what he saw was that there were a brand new fees that were put on the bill now the electorate doesn't understand the bill anyway and uh so it's like well I Need electricity so I'm just gonna go ahead and pay the bill\nAnd that's that's that's what we're stuck with so um anyway I just wanted to bring that up a Sandra I Know that you're following along with all this I think we're going to go ahead and take a little break right now and then we'll come back\nAnd um and get into the the issues and we can kind of pick up from here to if you like a phone call that with us we're visiting with Senator Kennedy who is who is a former Arizona State corporation commissioner and she will be back with me in just a little bit stay with us [noise]\n\nSupport for this public radio station is provided by these Kingman underwriters\nSupport for ...

Doug gum [noise]\nOkay we are back\nI Am Lucy Mason here on Arizona energy cross roads and we're visiting with Senator Kennedy who is a candidate\nFor the corporation commission this year and um well you've got less than three weeks a left Sandra [laughter] and November sixes coming very quickly I'm pleased talent\nAnd trust me I'm counting on down\nYeah it's an exhausting it's an exhausting time and just for our listeners benefit or people in it we all need to understand\nSomething that I think you know we don't pay attention to in the in the beginning stages of an election year but candidates for these big possessions start a year and a half to maybe even a year and two thirds or ... years in advance of you know\nCollecting trying to raise money to get your campaign organized get your people in place and then and then\nEven after that which takes months\nUh then you're on the road and you're going everywhere and in in a statewide campaign it isn't an enormous task and it's exhausting so we appreciate you Sandra for putting putting yourself out there again but tell us about what you're thinking about for it or\nAnd I think that resonates um I you know I thought everybody in their own way did uh did a good job on his thinking on who they were but I think uh it was just interesting to watch and I'd like like you to talk about what makes you different you know from the other candidates\nWell thank you it is actually a great question I Am a got an advocate I Believe that [noise] people up to date need wrong [noise]\nI Am committed I have been committed and I have a history of being committed to the voters of the state and I think that that is what's really missing at the commission [noise]\nUm you know we talk about the commission and it it doesn't get the kind of attention that it really should get [laughter] but it it is probably next to the governor's office it is an an important office\nTouches the lives of every body on a daily basis and we just don't realize it\nBut I wanted to talk to you and you know tell you that you know in my first one hundred days one of the things that I think it's really important is the consumer affairs office ... ... knees out some attention\nIt is a three person office and with the type of complaints that come through that office I think it needs a little attention maybe an increase in numbers we should talk about why\nEmployees at the commission haven't gotten a raise in over a decade\nOr does that affect morale sure um\nI looked at the budget just for this year there's no mention of races for the staff huh we we've got to do some things to keep the staff even interested in\nComing to work getting the job done\nA ... to the rate payers making sure that their complaints are ah heard from the time the complaint is given all the way to the end of you know completing\nOut and getting a you know somewhat of an answer to the individual who's making that complaint so those are issues that I think need to come to the forefront and I really want to bring them to the forefront you know we've got\nA I say we like um they got there aren't very small water companies and I don't think that those water companies get the kind of attention that they need a we've got a water company right now in southern Arizona that hasn't had a rate increase\nHasn't had new equipment hasn't had any great and equipment and Seventeen years Seventeen [laughter] so the commission doesn't know whether or not they're functioning properly but that company now approached\nThe commission and they want a thousand percent rate increase\nTalking about small community ... boy\nNow it is just gonna devastate community\nIn southern Arizona so those ... want to get back and talk about and I want to be a voice for the people\nMhm well there is a voice um we have a we have ... the residential utility consumer organization\nThey are there to defend the backup and help consumers as well and see the utilities from the consumer point of view along with a corporation commission how are they hoping oh what the issues to think\nYou know I was trying to read through the docket just last night\nAnd I have not seen anything where a real cold is um our has made any comments or statements and it may be a little early 'cause the um this company just came to the commission and\nI Believe next week they're gonna um the hearing division will probably start taking comments on it [noise]\nBut [noise] I'm just praying and hoping that you know there will be a voice and I'm hoping that if it's not me which you know the case will probably voted on next year [laughter] but be there to speak on behalf of the rape pairs of that water\nWell I'll tell you with Sandra we are out of time but I I Hope so too um you know I\nHave a yes or no question for you to answer and and that is do you want to take in both sides do you I mean you're not just against utilities are or just against so where are you for both um are you wanting to listen to both sides\nOh absolutely I'm you know what I've always had an open door and I will always hear both sides\nYeah to be coming termination but I've got to have everybody at the table yeah okay well\nThank you so much for joining us today folks thank you for joining us today\nAnd visiting with Senator Kennedy a candidate for for the Arizona corporation commissioner as

guy guy knew or not ... what they could probably but I if you know who should I made it only had like a diary for you\nMm\nThey say the city never ... maybe it does on maybe ... maybe a dream\nThe two of us so we\nDream\nToday to treat loud [noise] readers wrote back\nIn the city dream than John nightmare she and others agreed on my dreams robberies rapes and murders corruption but it's a funny dreams or the dream Halloween nightmare\nSome people thought the city dreamed up its buildings being torn down it's beautiful architecture being replaced with something modern steel and glass is

in our history and how that crane brownie and now that it has no memory that has a dream okay art and create\nChange being in a ... dream the gun\nAnd so the letters trickle down at my column went on to other things\nBut sometimes late at night when I'm walking back to my apartment\nEspecially on a warm summer night and I wonder\nThey say our life is what\nIs Joseph cambell points in this universe is heaven and hell so\nBring dream dream by a single meaning\nTo all the dream characters are dreaming too\nOh yeah and it's all through the that actually happened to me [noise]\n\nGuy knew our is presented through a generous grant from readers radioactive Julie reaches its Armageddon in a bowl tried\n... radio I feel your morals so it'll shake your faith and break you down again and I\nMaybe that means I\nHave read\nUs radioactive ... now\nIt'll be a lot of them probably already like I\nJust see that by and\nWomen how to take the benefits and while we can't guarantee a hundred percent that we're going to get it right I can tell you we ... on the chances of getting it right and gives you a lot more in benefits than you might have otherwise or received this is a big deal trying to get this right now I'm not as easy as people think it\nIs and then trying to make that decision in isolation of how it might ... ripple into your entire financial plan is something I wouldn't do by myself so number three what should I budget for health care this is the number one question that I get\nHow what what are you guys putting in for healthcare costs so you know it depends on age I've got so many young people retiring right now once again about this confidence that the market has brought\nHer statements are looking better and I'm Talking both about like mid fifties like fifty five years old they're all they they want to retire and so when we budget for health care we look at a couple of things we have to look at what's your health care costs going to cost before ...\nOh that magic ages when you go on Medicare so that between fifty five and sixty five that is a huge expense\nNow there are some clients that actually I'm a that actually are eligible uh for\nFor a formidable healthcare act so we go through an analysis of whether there I'm eligible and that's something that you absolutely want to do is sit down and and look at what benefits could you get from retiring early\nAnd then secondly if you're sixty five and we want to look at what is your supplement going to cost and then there's a longer term considerations like long term care\nSo I'm Bruce it's thousands of dollars so I Would say between fifty five and sixty five if you don't qualify for affordable health health care we put in a two thousand dollars a month\nFor a supplement we're putting as high as six hundred dollars a month now lots of you out there are finding insurance that's less than that\nBut it's because you're healthy so it it it it goes based on your health\nAnd we have a a resource that helps our clients find out what's the best company for the best cost and and it's almost like Social Security it's not just an decision you can make in isolation it's got a lot of factors that go into it and who doesn't want to pay the least\nFor the most benefit so that takes some time in research than for is should my risk tolerance change and retirement so many people get close to retirement and what they want to do is\nGo to cash go to conservative because they they're they're the emotional life changing event tier of retiring is big\nAnd so why who wouldn't want to lose the money that you work so hard to say but it's the opposite of what you should do and it's the opposite because if you put a purpose to your money so take all these chips that you've actually saved all your entire life\nAnd now you have to start dividing I'm into piles\nAnd the way you do that is you have to figure out which chips are you going to use in the beginning like for income or which ones are you going to use Twenty years down the road\nSo if you're just joining us peg around talking about six questions to ask your advisor if you're retiring and two thousand and Eighteen so for me the number one where's my retirement from coming from number two one door apply for Social Security number three what should I be budgeting for healthcare number four should my risk tolerance change beg what's far\nShould I be moving my money into different accounts before or during my retirement well it's important to know so now you've done your money matrix and you've got your pockets you know the box is filled out as to what they are in\nSo many people have so much in that tax deferred so the answer to me for me would be yes we need to work on it now we need to work on it for ever and the ... for the rest of your life and it it's based on your tax situation and how can we utilize all these strategies\nNot many people know how to do that in isolation themselves it's just looking at every bucket and seeing how you can move on from one bucket to another\nOkay Ron time before you turn a list of six almost suggests we do this when we come back we'll finish talking about the ... after ... team and we'll give you the listener involved as well so when we come back and review what we've done so far and then we'll finish up are less but then if it were about to for bird\nYou know some ... come as a couple of ways for you to get involved to ask you a financial questions either by phone or worse than the your email questions here's the phone number and by the way you can use the cell phone number twenty four hours a day seven days a week that number's eight eight eight six advice\nOr if you prefer cinder email questions to your money and wealth that has come\nIf you're just joining us pregnant I Am and talking about questions to ask your advisor to fear retiring in two thousand and Eighteen and kind of more than ... mind getting most of your financial advisor now again if you're just joining us a first for the show putting them ever going to go over six questions\nTo ask your advisor if you're retired in two thousand and Eighteen we ran out of time we were a number five so big or knew the first five again and then you can take us home number one where's my retirement income coming from\nNumber to ram and how should I applied for Social Security number three what should I be budgeting for healthcare for should my risk tolerance change in retirement and finally five should I be more money to different accounts before or during my retirement\nElaborate on that one a little bit because I felt like I rushed at the end but let me give me an example so should I Move\nMy different buckets well if you're retiring early like I've got a couple of fifty five year olds that are retiring right now um and they have saved a lot of cash in the bank and after tax money\nSo they can live off their after tax money what a great opportunity to do some bucket changing because they actually have no income\nFor Social Security there too early to turn on their pensions and now we can take their IRA money enrolling in converted over to a raw to a tax free bucket\nThis is just a huge opportunity if you have seemed money after tax and not all your money is in IRAs you then are in control of taking advantage of some of these strategies\nUm that we have to offer you may not want to take any moves if indeed um you truly want to retire it's all in tax deferred but you are going to actually go into a lower tax bracket\nSo the idea about tax differ all Bruce was\nYou know take instant gratification gratification for a future attacks we have no idea what you're going to pay but do you remember ... when the message was you're going to be in a lower tax right when you retire\nI never see the\nI don't see that happen either but if you believe that now you're going from a high income down to a lower income it might've been the best thing you could do it's a tougher job for your advice or though to have that tax deferred bucket last for the rest of your life\nBecause it's almost like you're overstating your net worth because you're liability to the IRS is somewhere between probably thirty to fifty percent on that IRA so it takes more strategic planning if they are all IRA dollars\nAren't one summer starts in number six is what else do I need to plant and do what do I what I got to do so here we're talking about if you're thinking about retiring in twenty Eighteen or or even twenty Nineteen pretty soon\nI Would look at the advisor that you're using and ask them questions and do you have a tax background do you have a legal background\nHow or what's your knowledge on investing money how many have you created paychecks for any of your clients for the rest of their live what's your experience because I wouldn't take this lifestyle change lightly\nThis is a huge event in in ... there are strategies that you can use to make your money last longer\nAnd Bruce I'm as with the founder of wealth unanswered grew you just said I don't want to just help people accumulate more money I Want to be a specialist as far as just distributing their money um creating paychecks for the rest of your life and then\nLegacy getting some to um your family so I've never been so happy birthday you guys decided to do that because\nIt it is a unique thing to have a team of people that can help you create paychecks for the rest of your life\nSo ask yourself are you with the right advice or can they do that do they have the\nCapability to do that\nA bunch of the time or it's just really quickly and not to do a commercial the reason our model is the this way I can tell you being one of the original folks that started I can tell you those uh foreigners group we challenged ourselves to think like a client we said you know take off your advisor has to offer your business on route\nAnd what would you want if you were clients here we tried to really do that and that's the way we built the business model but again this experience to ask your advisor first saw them I guess for its with she should have an advisor we think\nAnd not everyone needs to work with law for here from a group of uber goodbyes or that you trust and you're happy with that is great but it never hurts to get a second opinion from another advisor and if you don't have an advisor we think you should go interview for one but once you do the six questions are where's my retirement income going to come from\nWomen how do I apply for Social Security wants to be budgeting for healthcare member force my risk tolerance change when I retire fire should I be moving money into different accounts before during ah", "show_name": "Podcast Playlist", "year": "2018",
