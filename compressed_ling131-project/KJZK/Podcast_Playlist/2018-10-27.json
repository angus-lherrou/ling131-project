I got out to a whole up to Flagstaff yesterday at all over this tape and now the saddle brook\nTo San Sierra Vista the list goes on and on heading up to the snowflake or next week and it's just really enjoy the opportunity to\n... ... Wilkes great Arizonans from all across our state\nI Want you to tell our listeners about ... what makes you unique and why are you renting thank you so much for that you have a great background and you write back to as much yeah\nYou know I'm a native of Arizona I'm born and raised here and you know just have a great love for the community my wife's also a native of Arizona we've chosen to to raise our family here because Arizona it's such a great place to live it's a great place to raise a family\nThat's a great place to grow a business to retire and recreate can we just love love the states I'm sure it's the same reason why all your listeners have chosen to make\nArizona they're home you\nKnow and so we've gotten strong ties to the community I Want to make sure we make sure that we have an ... a safe or a strong a free country a free state to a great state for many generations to come\nYou know we've got a got five boys and girls or my wife and I our the parents of nine children that that keeps us very busy and I certainly\nEnjoy having having a big family but it also gives me a perspective about you know the future I Want to make sure that the the future that each of our our children and their children and she used to be a ... a great future a future full of prosperity and opportunity for years to calm\nThat's just a little bit about about my background I'm In my personal life I've also served in in public office before I served in the state legislature I was first elected in two thousand ten\nWhole and in the legislature I focused on fiscal issues making sure that we have fiscal responsibility to keep our tax burden as live as possible and I was a strong proponent for the right to lie and the second amendment\nI I've got a a proven a record of also got a record on the corporation commission as you mentioned I was appointed the commission in October of last year and I've been serving for a year now all of this mission and\nI've been striving to to serve in a way that is\nWhat's the highest\nLevels of ethics and integrity\nHighest standards and I became for policies to increase like Allen ability and trash parents at the commission and also working to reduce our utility rates and looking forward to address in each of those\nThose questions but uh but when it gets to your question about me and I also got a a background and finance I've got an MBA and years of experience in the private sector analyzing complex financial statement for parents may well\nService at the corporation commission\nWell you know I was interested in one of the things that I thought well you do almost from the very beginning and that was jumping behind a and support what Bob Burns was doing and the corporation commission about asking a PS open their books and I thought that was interesting so apparently had been following that\nUm yeah why not slowly\nAbsolutely you know I I think that you know ... some great work at the commission yeah you know and and I was happy to support a him invite voice that support for the first day he's led to try and increase accountability and transparency I mean that's that's critical on the public's guy have that confidence that the\nCommission unduly influenced by the utilities that we regulate\nYeah yeah no that's that's exactly right and of course I think you know everybody wants to see fair treatment or\nOn the corporation commission I mean nobody wants to the utilities go away but we we do want to see fair a reasonable actions from the corporation commission to protect the consumers um and we're all you know rate payers this brings up another thing I\nI'm One of the things that I I really don't like to see a is and this is just my opinion on me but I think there's probably a lot of agreement out there um\nWhy in the world is this a Republican and Democrat issue you know a corporation commission on election it should not be because it's all about rape parents whether it's water whether it's electricity utilities whether it is\nA corporations that are trying to form in the state and then these are not these are not you know political issue [laughter] than [laughter]\nHe was even non partisan issues you know and I'll give you one example um you know just this week I was meeting with representatives from from ...\nAnd I are gee right it's an organization that you know I value the opportunity to hear from uh-huh and we have a lot of common ground on the issues at the commission notwithstanding the fact that they heard outside of utility issues support\nIssues that are far different from the issues that I supported uh-huh in public policy issues they want and would consider liberal issues are Democrat issues\nOr why I've been a conservative Republican but at the mission\nOr their issue is ensuring that we have affordable rates yeah and that's an issue that I support you know as a as a conservative that's something that that I think is absolutely appropriate for the commission and should be advocating well asking to ensure that we have more oversight or utilities\nSo we have affordable rates and safe and reliable public services\nYeah and freedom of choice you know some of ... you know energy choice and so yeah no I think I think I just wanted to bring that up and I wanted to get your take on that I think there's an awful lot of us consumers state that are electric and electricity consumers and we need to have that electricity and we want to have that\nI'm a focus on what's fair and what's reasonable for ratepayers [noise] so\nUh Justin we're going to need to take a little break right now folks please stay with us I Am Lucy Mason here on Arizona energy cross wrote them we're visiting with commissioner Justin Olson who is now also a

[noise]\nOkay we are back I Am Lucy Mason here on Arizona energy crossroads and today we're talking with commissioner Justin Olson who is candidate for that same position and we've been really happy to visit with you because you are you know you're in kind of uh\nUh the last couple of weeks of a very difficult long campaign and of course they're going to be slings and arrows that are going to come at you um and there's one that recently came and it was about um uh you know your\nUh work with with a PS and answering some questions tell us about the details what happened how did you get in into this um this these questioning from reporters around the state about this\nYeah I Know I appreciate the opportunity to address that article that came up like you said or certainly in the last\nDays of of a campaign and and that is one of the Arabs start start coming out and and in many cases those criticisms are somewhat unfounded or are somewhat unfair and I would say that in in this case that uh is what has happened\nUm the article I in my view mischaracterized ah what occurred during a call\nWhen I was speaking with the wall street analysts do with the public call\nIn addition to that you know I you know I've mentioned as we mentioned it than previous segment\nRetail competition you know I think that this is something that the commission needs to look at it it's going to occupy a significant amount of the commission's\nTime to forgive value wait all of the data that is available to us you know we've got some great examples in in Texas where retail competition has been in place for quite some time but we can we can evaluate how has it worked what's worked what's what's gone wrong\nWe and we can learn from them you know I mean ...\nSame mistakes [laughter] absolutely where where where they weren't ... enacted policies that help the repair than we can avoid that you know where that data clearly demonstrate that that some policy was beneficial to repair\nAnd then we ought to pursue that I'm looking forward to continuing that that conversation like I mentioned you know I've called for the commission to consider this issue on\nAnd then lastly you know I I I think and you'll amount of our attention or will be a Johnson utilities and I know this may seem somewhat remote from your listeners\nAre in your part of the states as it's out on the stand and valley but I think that it is important to all Arizona consumers\nTo recognize that the commission is providing the proper\nUnnecessary oversight over ... of all of our\nUtilities yeah and so that's what I look forward to do and making sure that we have that proper\nOversight well I'll tell you what I'm from an outsider's point of view a and looking at the commissioners I think the commissioners are going to have them a huge um responsibility honestly to the rate payers to to really really get into what you mentioned earlier and that as a retail competition I\nI mean it's it's a natural for corporate interests not to want to utility interest not to want that competition if they're a monopoly but but but the point is that if we are going to move the state forward um we're gonna have to really evaluate\nAnd ... and and and looking at it as a positive pointed point of view about how we can gracefully maybe not but gracefully bring in the renewable energy industries and there are so many of them um and how does that\nReflect on the revenues back to the legislature you know and how we can actually fund education and other issues that we have in the states that are so so big right now we can continue to\nRely on tourism and so I think that that's a big um responsibility of the corporation commissioners and um and I you know I Would look to you\nI'm as to how to organize that you might you know if you if you're elected you might be the one to take on the organization of how you move for maybe you're the one that calls for a workshop what do you think\nYou know I I Am absolutely happy to to take that lead\nI'm like I said I've certainly you know supported a ... and and ... and ... specified of that as an already you know in the docket of the corporation commission and I think it's on that we that we need to evaluate at the very best interests at the right ... and we should pursue it\nYeah you know I'm interested into and what you're hearing from around the state um you know how to how do people feel I Am as you're listening to folks how people feel about\nAh bringing in this these new industries all of them yeah 'cause I mean it's not just solar panels on our roof it's commercial and utility scale and [noise]\nYou know after all the associated batteries are all of it you know how do they feel about this\nYou know I I think people are excited about the future you know I think there's a real potential\nFor significant change in the the way things have operated in gaining our our power and and that change will arrive when the technology is available that makes the the the storage of our solar energy\nMuch more cost efficient and and I expected it will be available in the very likely in the near term but certainly in the long term\nI when it arrives than we can significantly drive up the amount of our solar energy that his powering the demand on the grid because we will not be limited to only the times when the sun is shining ... not to that future\nThose technologies technological breakthroughs yeah bringing down the cost of storage or things that I think people are excited about we're excited for future\nYeah well we know you know we've been around at all you know we've been in business which you have and I have and you know many of our listeners are we've got ranchers down in our listening area you know they're all concerned about you know how we can\nMove the state for word and what does the economy look like in the future and what are the industries that are going to make sense for us you know and so I think you know I think you're you're absolutely on track with that\nUm and I think are more importantly I think our citizenry is on track I think they understand\nA without collective wisdom Ohio where we ought to be going I just need to say thank you so much Johnson for joining us today we are flat out at a time or we wish you well and go forth\nThank you so much for having me it's been it's been my pleasure\nFolks

yeah maybe once or twice and he says\nAnd the big guy with his silence all this time says\nAnd burgers potatoes and meat balls [noise]\nI thought it sounded kind of poetic\nPotatoes and meat balls\nI just told his story is got to say something is going to do something says\nI don't know probably the Greeks you know Plato wanted Plato ever say about hamburgers potatoes and meat SALT I wouldn't bet on a horse named Plano\nBut not potato you don't want a banana or snap hamburger\nIs not a good bet what about me Paul tied never bet on the menu that Russia back to life except the one day it's all

of the Mayo Clinic care network [noise]\nLiving near the ad and young healthy living here is Mayo Clinic medical as he asked the our primary sclerosis and Colin jaded in a chronic inflammatory disease out the ... which can lead to scarring and eventually cirrhosis of the liver\nThen maybe you want to talk about him talk about that today because when we're going through in our financial planning I ask people what their long term care plan is and they quickly jumped to oh I don't want to buy that insurance and I said I didn't mention insurance I meant what is your long term care plan like if one of you get sick\nAre you going to take care of each other or you know are you thinking you're going to pay for a facility because then we have to incorporate that cost into your plan so can you talk a little bit about family planning when it comes to 'em long term care and then secondly why would someone by insurance\nAs well as far as the family so you are I mean you're right on I mean if people say that they're not going to buy long term care insurance than really in the next question is which one of your kids is going to be the one that's going to provide care and I'll tell you they everybody tells me I don't want my kids to take care of me I'm like well then you just told me you didn't you didn't have\nIs your plan contradict I don't want to be a burden by American\nRight right [laughter] so um so that that happens a lot and you know I think the reality is is\nFor us and growing up you know getting older we don't want our kids to provide care for us so we have raised our kids to be independent there's many times they are not even going to live near us so how can we expect our kids to be the ones to provide that care\nI'm without some kind of a plan in place so the way that the you know what I've been reading is that care tends to fall to the youngest daughter\nOf the family and so I'm like I don't look at it I'm like I've got my youngest daughter and I'm like I think she would take care of me but I don't want her to you know I don't want or I don't want to be a burden to her I don't want her to have to come in and do those things and put her life on hold and so that's that is huge so walking\nThrough that with clients what I find that is um ... they want to be educated on long term care insurance so talk a little bit about what does that provide then for the family what\nDoes it cost and what does a cover\nWell the cost is going to be it depends you know that that favorites that famous answer it depends on what kind of benefits you by how long you want the benefit to last for ... inflation protection and things like that\nBut I think when you if you have a long term care insurance plan in place really what you're doing is you're to me I've let my kids know I've got a plan in place\nIf I Need care you have my permission to file this claim I understand what my benefits are I understand that somebody can come into my home and provide services for me I understand that if I you know move into an assisted living facility I have services being provided\nAnd a lot of times when you look at home health care it could be a home health care aide coming in and helping you with your bathing and dressing light housekeeping duties meal preparation things like that to kind of help you stay independent for as long as you can\nUm I think you know for a lot of people have services become more than that maybe in assisted living facility where you have people on staff that can come and help out throughout the day and obviously if you had to go to a nursing home which I'm never going to a nursing home but if I had to go that at least I Know that my policy is going to cover services there as well\nIf you're just joining us we're talking about the long term care to do in a ... a kind enough to lead this discussion what do these are mostly to and again I I'm not just saying this because I'm looking at you and and but I must be some of the things you're saying and it's just brilliant and assist resonating with me or like how we talked about\nLong term care planning and long term care insurance or not necessarily the same thing you can have a long term care plan without buying insurance now put your mind both talked on this show many times we both on long term care insurance and I volunteer that the reason I I bought it because at the risk of sounding\nOstentatious I probably could solve ensure the risk but part of it is just a I'd ... I'd rather transfer the risk to a large insurance company and part of it was not even financial part of it is like a C planning\nI don't want my assets to be you know a reduced by by those costs if it ever happens to me I Want to leave a bigger legacy that my kids and other loved ones and so forth but part of it again it's just this whole issue of the other non\nFinancial things the quality of care and where you get here and who's going to give the cure and not being a burden all these things we've been talking about I don't think most people think about they just think about\nThe financial part of it and they think about the costs I Can't tell you but you don't know if this happens to you how many times I say a year people say what if I spend all their money all the premium and I'd die healthy and I never file a claim it's probably the biggest objection I get to people barring long term care insurance\nAnd honestly I say well then you when you know I mean how how lucky is that the pay insurance premiums and then die never needing long term care\nSo how different is that than buying home insurance every year and it's not like we're wishing our house burned down his claim as we tally up all the insurance we pay on our cars in our homes and we never make a claim were actually quite happy about it but when it comes to long term care you're right the first objection we get\nIs what if I never use it so uh talk about you know the reasons that people actually buy it and when it's when you decided you want to buy it wins the good time like what are you are you when you buy it\nWell you know what they say the average virus fifty seven\nI'm I truly see that age getting lower um because the premiums are it's expensive and this is it's a lifetime commitment when you're buying a long term care policy because you don't just buy it for a few years and just decided I don't need it anymore you know something you're going to have to take with you for a long time\nHow is the underwriting today is it easy to get is it harder to get well I'll tell you for all the years I've been doing this it's not getting any easier okay you know it is getting it's getting a lot harder to qualify for a policy because you do it's a health underwriting\nHistory for the past five years I'm right now they don't necessarily look at your family history um when taking that into account so that's good for us especially with um growing dimension things like that out there so that's always a positive\nUm but I think with with the underwriting these diabetes is becoming even more difficult\nA tobacco use is becoming more difficult and again any type of family history you may qualify for a policy um based on your health but you know depending on what that looks like maybe you don't get that average rating\nOr maybe they're going to charge you a premium 'em and give you a what they would call a rated policy but you still have something and then at that time you just kinda look at you know what kind of benefits and things like that that we can afford\nWithout out of time but when we come back we'll kind of tired bar on this discussion cover anything that we did recover and the first half of the show that we want to hit and then we'll give you the listener involved in the second half of the show and then he's going to tell you how you\nCan do that a couple of ways to do that Bruce or you can call is affecting the news is so number twenty four hours a day seven days a week so if you think of a question that you can just call it right in eight eight eight six advice that's eight eight eight six to three eighty four twenty threes you'd rather send us an email question\nTo send your email questions to your money at Wilson has but that come your money and wealth has but that\nIf you are just joining us the first half of the show we talked about long term care insurance on November is long term\nCare awareness month and we talked about only bought insurance but a long term care planning\nBecause not everybody listening and that everybody is going to buy insurance not everybody's gonna qualified that everybody's gonna wanna buy insurance but everybody everybody should do some sort of long term care plan\nAnd helping us in our discussion today kind enough to join us as the long term care specialist Pam ... and a ladies and the first half of the show we talked about what long for a cure is when the buyer what some of the benefits are not just financial benefits but being less of a burden on family members and preserving assets\nAnd we talked about a lot of different things but one of the things that we didn't talk about\nIs that as an objection or a question that I get from clients is okay so I Do my due diligence I work with Pam\nI get my policy my premium is a\nIs that premium set for life or chemical up and I ... lead us into the discussion until a full disclosure to listeners I've\nHad situations with clients where we've recommended long term care that they would tell you the best decision they ever made somebody at a health issue in the long term care financially saved them from potential devastation I've also had situations where people got\nIt and the premium went up maybe Ninety percent and go to the point where they had to make some sort of adjustment to continue to afford it\nSo this idea of costs going up after you buy the policy I think is a big concern for people Pam talk a little bit about the ... why does that happen what other options when it does happen and why is that still reason not to buy it\nWell you know and that's been I'm obviously a lot of the work I've been doing lately because it seems like every company out there is going through some form of a rate increase or another rate increase so what I like to do when I talked to clients about that is look at you know what is their premium\nAnd you know the reality as some of these policies that were bought back in let's say the early to thousands they were truly under priced I mean to get a lifetime benefit which means you're going to have a monthly pay out\nOf you know six eight nine thousand dollars a month that's going to last you forever\nUm and they were priced at pennies on the dollar so you know when you look at some of these rate increases and you compare him to current dollars for similar benefits it's amazing the difference in cost
