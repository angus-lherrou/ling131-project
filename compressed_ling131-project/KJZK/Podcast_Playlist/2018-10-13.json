Flagstaff ... park at Ninety One point three FM frozen proceed public radio in ... the following program\n[noise]\nI'm\nLucy Mason the executive director of the Arizona solar energy Industries Association or air as the U.S [noise] and this is Arizona energy crossroads where we talk about the policies economics in technology and the twenty first century energy marketplace\nToday we're going to be discussing the solar and utility industries and issues that are rising right now in this election season\nAnd to discuss them any facts and issues that we have our guest to talk about today Nancy ... who is an energy consultant welcome Nancy thank you so much for joining us\nThanks Lucy and it's great to be with you after hearing about you for so many years\nOut well you know the the other way around to ah this is just such a pleasure and I and I just have to say it's it's also a pleasure to have Nancy in Studio with us today so Nancy tell us a just introduce our listeners to you tell us about your background this is an energy show is all about energy tell us how you got there\nYeah thanks for the question Lucy um [noise] I started out in a two thousand six and I read a couple of books about climate change and about coal big hole by Jeff Goodell which is a very well known book\nAnd I had heard through some activists friends that there were plans on the books to build another hundred and fifty new coal plants and another breed of coal plant called clean coal somehow clean coal yet [noise]\nAnd so a woman that I happened to meet at a PC hearing 'cause I went to make a statement at the at the time I was living in Colorado I should say I lived in Arizona from Nineteen Seventy nine to two thousand one\nAnd then two thousand nine to twenty Thirteen\nBut at the time or two thousand six vote in Colorado and uh I met a woman who is ... became my mentor infect she lived in Prescott for many years her name is Lesley Gloucester him\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of listeners know her so Leslie took me under her wing and a said while excel energy wants to build a clean coal plant here um we're going to fight it or is it okay sure\nSo I signed up to be the expert on clean coal even though at the time I really didn't know a megawatt from a cat [laughter] so I immersed myself in clean coal\nAnd I learned from a woman named Carol overland who's a real character a truck driver turned attorney he was a three legged dog and I went out to red wing Minnesota to spend three days as her learning about clean coal\nAnd one of the most interesting things that happened was that\nAnd it's sort of tells a story about clean coal at the time a former excel executive who who left excel to make their own company\nWas want it to build the plant so therefore excel and Minnesota would have had to buy the purchase power from that plant\nWill because those plants were pretty unknown and pretty expensive the power would have been a very high expense for excel they would have made no profit on the electricity because they would have had to buy the output from the clean coal plant\nMade no profit and they knew it was expensive so they filed testimony in the Minnesota PC saying this is a terrible idea it's it's awful\nBut meanwhile in Colorado because they're trying to build a clean coal plant there that they own\nAnd they could put in rate base and make a profit from their pushing clean coal so low and behold we introduced this testimony from Minnesota in Colorado and we say hey look what excel doing\nTheir thing in in Minnesota they're saying it's terrible and in Colorado they're saying it's great what's going on here\nSo we were able over the course of a few months to provide enough information to the public utilities commission in Colorado that they had real doubt and you could just tell from their statements that they had doubts and so in October of that year our first filing I think was in around march\nBy October of ... Iraq excel energy had withdrawn their plan for clean coal plant\nEven though they got I think it was a hundred and twenty million through Ken Salazar who was then US Senator in Colorado\nIs Colorado [noise] and so the ... the kids were grief and so we were a basically able to stop that plant will then in\nIn August a few months earlier I got a call from Paul Newman\nAnd Paul Newman was a corporation commission or the time Paul is on the coach he's county for her supervisor ah and I had somehow never met Paul even though I worked in Arizona politics starting with working for Mo Udall and ... sex and the state legislature as an intern in law intern\nWent to ask you law school but I've never met Paul and So Paul said hey they're\nTrying to build a clean coal plant in it'd be in Cochise County outside of the city\nSo I flew down here at my own expense to Arizona\nAnd we talk to people and they were so smart it was like throwing a match in a dry fields and those retired IBM executives I remember this woman named Ellen ... author\nWho is the smartest ... they took it and ran with it and that clean coal plant never went anywhere in Arizona well how did you get involved in solar what happens there will solar was first I've worked on coal for about two years\nThen Leslie and I was still working in Colorado she said Nancy I'll take coal she's quite an expert you take natural gas so I took dance for gas and I don't have and to natural gas for a number of years and then slowly\nAlso got involved in the solar docket in Colorado now all the time I sort of got into Colorado into solar it was about eight bucks a walked\nAnd so them wash it while I get kind of go down down down down down and my husband at the time Andy barred well who's a dear friend and we still work on energy policy together he built a net zero house\nAnd so I watched Andy do this through solar PV an solar hot water and started to understand the potential mhm and then just watching the costs go down\nBut I didn't really get my solar education until I came back to Arizona and two thousand nine\nMhm [noise] that was a that coincides nicely with of much of the work that I was doing in the legislature now you went and became you became staff on the Arizona corporation commission um when did that have well\nI wasn't actually staff and it's hard for people to understand that I was a policy advisor and so\nBecause policy advisors and the commissioners in Arizona has fiduciary\nRelationship and actually this is due to a U.S Supreme Court case I mean Arizona State Supreme Court case where there was foul play going on corruption and basically the the policy advisor and the commissioner pointed their fingers at each other it with him that was him\nAnd the court said no you will fiduciary relationship and if one of you break the law the other view breaks the law so I was pause policy advisor and we were more like a judge's office where it was me Paul and we had a wonderful Adnan gal\nNow at that time was Paul involved with a with solar issues where what was Chris mazes commissioner a involved with that\nChristmas is a commissioner and it was wonderful to work with are brilliant hardworking woman um and uh so we were lucky because Christmas there yeah because Christmas paving the way Christmas amendments would come out and I would run to the printer and get them\nYeah [laughter] okay Well Nancy we have to take a little break here listeners you are listening to me it was the Mason the executive director of the Arizona solar energy Industries Association here on Arizona energy cross roads and we're talking with Nancy ... an energy consultant we'll be right back stay [noise]\n\nSupport for this public radio station is provided by these king when underwriters\nSupport for Prescott Public Radio's provided by\nThe Grand Canyon ... miles east of Williams on interstate forty walk among the deer and read them right out of your hand she hundreds of animals up close ilk buffalo boroughs gambles quarter among the kangaroo lumber sheep goats ... learned more online at ... dot com the Grand Canyon do for support for ... public radio is provided\nBy ...

I Believe in anyway the bottom line was they ask people a bunch of questions about energy and electricity do you like solar do you like cold blah blah blah\nThen they spent a few days educating people about that and the numbers were astounding yes they were staggering as all these people who said yes we think cold okay once they learned about it you\nKnow they want to clean energy and even back then Lucy that I forget exactly what the number was but it was jaw dropping yeah and to mentioned something a little bit further that you talked about\nThe deregulation ballot initiative in in Nevada\nIt won by Seventy two percent they were outspent some huge unbelievable amount tend to want a hundred to one and the reason was because the corporations in Nevada\nSwitch a data center MGM a bunch of hotels they want to clean energy so they went to the commission and they said we want clean energy and the commission any till they said well okay that used to pay an exit fee one of them was eighty three million or more and so basically\nThey did about him to shift to deregulate and when you look at states like Arizona Nevada Colorado I Would say any state\nThat has lots of really low cost wind and low cost solar and that is Arizona Nevada New Mexico Utah Colorado their their ... their their prime for that why not all the people who want the free market Gary peers commissioner Gary ...\nMeant you know an inch and trial for bribery and fraud um you know they talked about the free market all the time well let's have the free market\nHas a free market you know I I Love this uh we have obviously got to have you back\nNancy uh there is so much more to talk about ... and ... and it includes pole and where we're going it includes the four corners area that is a New Mexico but supplies electricity to Arizona and it includes all of the utilities and the rates and\nThe market that wants to have solar desperately wants to have solar but right now we're in an election season where there are negatives and there\nAre concerns and the utilities are fighting hard and yes they should be available to do that and I have the ability to do that but it's time to\nRecognize a

restores energy balance to sound through meditation and movement\nOn things we maybe we shouldn't do so for example I got an email and looked like it was coming from the Internal Revenue service I thought oh my God I'm thinking to myself\nHe's iris has contacted me so maybe there's something wrong with my taxes ... money so that's my emotional reaction my logical reaction if I think about that the only the IRS doesn't contact people by email\nThey didn't send me physical male not email not text not tweet\nThere's some of the people in our executive branch of government that tweet but not the IRS\n\nSo my emotional emotional reaction may make they click and if I click on the Lincoln attachment in there and there's one in this particular email on that ship that had calculations that said so I you know your emotional reactions to click on that now and this gay that further in that attachment contained what's called now where\nNow where is derived from two terms malicious software and malicious software can do lots of bad things\nClick on this and nothing happens then I can see 'cause I think it's from the IRS and trying to open it up but I I don't see anything so that I go about my business\nAnd secretly that click has caused this malware too low to my computer and it's on my computer in the background I Can't see it and now as I typed in my youth to name and password to my accounts my bank account my email accounts that this now or takes it sends it to the cooks now that's one way they could commit fraud so to wait to avoid that\nAre in this this will stop about Ninety percent of computer problems if we're just cancel we'll be quick if you get an email from someone you don't know don't click on the link and attachment and you know\nIf you get an email from something that looks suspicious to click on a link creepy attachment and email and anything that's designed to elicit an emotional reaction you know like hey your taxes are late we've got high for you um you know you have just one of the Amazon gift card don't click because\nThat's their all tricks to get you to do that not all of them will be resulting in malware on your computer\nSome will just send you to places that are trying to sell you something\nBut it's still it's better not to click so that ... that was that will prevent about Ninety percent of what's experienced a on a computer you

something on your screen that you want to get rid of that you're afraid to click in it and you shouldn't even sometimes on the X You can click in these big pop ups just hold down three keys on your keyboard\nSo most people have windows computers so in that case you know hold down the keys that say control\nAlt that's healthy and delete\nThose three keys will initiate the computer's a task manager which brings up a program and it shows you what's operating on your computer so you can see\nThe weird looking program you may you may have a you know you may have your ... or it up there you

Mac keyboard that will get you out of\nThings to a lot of people ask me to I think the question that the at the event in February is they they said well what about in that I had an ... ...\nAnd windows and yes Macs are less susceptible to now where for two reasons the world is not composed knickknack computers as it is\nWindows so about eighty percent of the world's computers windows based so the hackers go after the bigger target and then also max seemed to have a little more security in mind there's less open and they're more protective and then makes it harder for the for the hackers to to get now are on on a Mac computer not impossible but less likely\nWe're very good will be back right after this break here's our phone number eight eight eight six advice that's eight eight eight

fortunate enough to have with us today a special guest just Lanza who's an expert on\nProtecting yourself from identity theft and from cyber crime and other scams attorney you recommend the FBI talk a little bit to the listeners about you know protect yourself with passwords\nSo there's a passwords or a gigantic hassle\nSomeone should take passwords out and shoot them because it's it's we need a better way to log in or because people have trouble myself included managing passwords coming up with strong passwords and um and then having to reset passwords and you forget them and so we need a better solution and maybe biometrics is coming down the road fingerprints retinal scans and\nThings that we don't have to worry about passers by the time being I'm strong passwords or or imperative because if we password\nThat's makes it a lot easier for the hackers to hack into accounts you really don't want that that to happen so strong password and the recent changes there's been reached changes in the definition of a strong password it used to be you have to add up a case of lower case a number and the special characters symbol like a dollar sign explanation point\nThat made a strong strong character at least\nA strong password at least eight characters long but the government just change that and they change it to phrases are and they say has ape characters don't need anything special\nOr just ape characters can be all lower case I don't think that's enough\nThat's the minimum I think twelve character so if you want to use a phrase as a password things that you can remember you know paranoia will destroy it that's a long password it's very strong even though it doesn't that upper and lower case and this ... paranoid is good when you come up with passwords as regards to lend the\nLenses became so the longer the better and she might want to use you know as an example you can use that one but you can use that and then maybe\nAnd just changed or some some letters around ... numbers to it if you want a never using the same password for different accounts\nTry to make it a little bit different at least and so if they get one place they can't use it and other places so that's coming up with strong passwords now some websites have not adapted to the changes that the government\nIssued a two thousand Seventeen they may still require you to use upper lower case and the number and the symbols so you may still have to do that now how do we manage passwords had a really remember all these different passwords well a couple of things you can do\nA you can use a password manager which I Do there's many out there there's keep her last past there's one pass a they help you manage passwords many of them have free versions that whole passwords encrypted backed up there's they've proven to be safe and secure\nPassword managers if you'd have a system at home where you're writing down ... on a piece of paper you know that's okay as long as someone does get into that or and or\nSomeone that has access to your house and maybe get access to the past ... so you can also storm on your computer just make sure that you use an encrypted file when he said look style of the computer you can encrypted that file so knowing get access to it that means you provide a password even to\nOpen that file but don't forget the password 'cause there's no recovery for that in Microsoft's that she can do has written has been in those guys the easiest ways with a password manager strong passwords helps you managing believe in plug them into your computer for you\nOr if you want to in the in the spaces where you like into two pages\nPassword management is very important and using strong passwords imperative\nTo be a things that I often talk the clients about is that they need some money in a bank or a financial institution ah the swimming pool in the world looking financial advisors like me and they say all they're greedy and they want all of your money but the reality is I coach people all the time they have some sort of banking relationship\nBut I Want my clients to get the best interest rates that they can so I often times are for them to an online bank or they can bank at home on their computer and a lot of my clients don't want to do that even for the potentially higher interest rates because they're worried that they're more vulnerable\nTo a scams my identity theft if they bank on line I guess to crush the number one is that fear is that accurate number two what can you do about that if you want to be a I\nAn online banking relationship to get better interest rates or whatever um how do you have to act yourself there yeah\nI recommend online banking I mean I I use it you know almost all the time I Try not to even go to the bank anymore yeah you could take pictures of checks and\nThe positive into your bank account with a mobile app as well and mobile banking is very secure even more secure than the computer because the apps here very locked out on the phone as long as you're using the mobile apps for your bank here's the thing about about banking what are you doing it on line on the computer or on your phone\nBanks when you open up these accounts they got to read the terms and conditions they protect your money\nUm if if someone were to hack into your computer and get your credentials and transfer money into your bank account the law says you have sixty days to report that fraud because you don't miss a wait that long it's sixty days after your last statement arrive so you get a bank statement that stays zero then you have sixty days reports right and the bank what we find your money\nAnd believe me actually not going to argue with you about that if someone has committed a cyber crime because they want people to use mobile banking and they want people to go on line and if anybody has a fear of losing money they're not going to go out there so banks do guaranteed individual bank accounts up to sixty days to report fraud so you are\nYou are protected but the other thing you should do regardless of this protection within mobile online banking account is just set up alert right so when you said at the bank account and your banker will help you with us or the on light on the on line a Web site will help you um has the website the bank", "show_name": "Podcast Playlist", "year": "2018", "city": "Kingman", "day":
