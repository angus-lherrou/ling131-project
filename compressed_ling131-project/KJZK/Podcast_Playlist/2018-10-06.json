with commissioner\nJustin Olson who is also a candidate for election to the Arizona Arizona corporation commission commissioner Olson thank you so much for joining us today\nFrom you so much for having me Lucy it's a pleasure to be here\nYou know this is just a really interesting time for you I'm sure [laughter] with it they're only is this campaign and and you're already a commissioner but you are trying to get reelected\nUh to that position\nI'm now let's talk about this is talk about your background and then at ... at some point after we hear about you and you know just tell us about who you are and your family and your education and how you got to\nI Know you were a legislator so let's talk about your background and then we'll go into that legislature and the appointment that by the governor to see\nAbsolutely well thank you for having me and for the opportunity to share with your listeners a little bit about myself I'm you know I'm a native of Arizona I got deep roots here in in our community and great love for our state and and certainly\nTo see a a bright and prosperous future for the great state of Arizona I'm born and raised in Arizona I'm raising my family here and my wife and I are are the parents of of nine children I'm very honored to\nBe able to raise a wonderful young children and look forward to the wonderful things that I I Hope they might be able to do and and their lifetimes\nBut um you know as far as my background that are prepared me for service in a corporation commission it varies between my professional experience legislative experience I can mention as well as some of my education I got it and education at a public school education Aaron in Arizona\nPublic schools uh for high school\nI graduated from from issue and I got my MBA and finance I from the w._b. carry school of business at at ASU which was a a high quality education I value\nA significantly as preparing me well for service both in the private sector and in the public sector at the legislature and at the corporation commission you know a little bit about my private sector experience I mean I work as a tax manager and the private sector of I've done that for\nFor many years and that experience has been very um effective it helping me to understand exactly how the policies are enacted the legislature as well as in Congress affect\nThe businesses and the real world and I feel like that's helped to keep me keep me grounded and in the real economy to see what\nI point what challenges are are created when government overreach is and and and so I've been an honor to be able to participate in the private sector is attacks manager and put to to use my my background my education at ASU\nI'm In addition to that I have also served a six years in the state legislature and just shortly after the time that that you were there and our our past crossed a briefly in different capacities but I didn't get the opportunity to serve the same time that you're in the legislature but it was very honored to be able to serve six years\nOr in the state legislature and if you'd like can be happy to talk a little bit about some of the things I ... a while in to the state legislature\nYeah I I Would like to know about that\nYou know I'm I'm ... interested in the business end of this uh\nAnd you're you're interested in in taxes and you know I at one of the things that I've always been a pushing is a\nEconomic development in the state in and we have an\nAwful lot in a way of of a moving industries forward um and one of the my pet peeves and I'll just share this with you in our audience is is hearing from leadership or anybody else down there in the legislature will we can't create winners and losers I'm Sorry we do that every day um\nAnd I'd like to know your take on that [laughter]\nRight now I I agree completely that you know it can be frustrating that there's far too many obstacles that the government puts in place to a ... that the growth of the private sector\nA and that does that we ought to be a removing those obstacles right and ... the the economy to grow and to to flourish without\nUndue burdens from from the from the government and you know and so that that's the perspective that I took to to the legislature I worked to minimize the littlest those obstacles to grow so that Arizona is can be put back to work you know when I first went down to the state legislature\nIt was at a at a time when we saw record unemployment you know two thousand\nWas when I first ran for the legislature and we saw\nRecord unemployment unprecedented budget deficits and and I went down there promising to make rebuilding the economy and balancing the budget it's my ... my number one priority is and I felt like I was able to play a significant role in delivering on on that promise I became the appropriations chairman in the house representatives\nI delivered on on tax cuts that reduced that burden that the that the government was placing on the economy and and Arizona's got back to work the economy grew because the government got out of the way we balanced the budget provided a structurally balance the budget for the first time and\nIn many many years you know I authored a bill that reduced uh our state income tax rate for Arizona income tax payers which I thought was a\nVery appropriate response to the environment that we were we were facing at the time\nVery excited that at the time that I left the legislature we had a record low unemployment levels we had a balanced budget and the economy was growing and\nAnd the budget then was in a situation where the budget was able to grow at a at a sustainable rate so we could provide the necessary services and priorities of of the government but to do it in a way that's fair and reasonable to the taxpayers as well\nI uh I we're going to have to take a break in a minute but I Want to bring up an issue of since this is the Arizona solar energy Industries Association program here through me I did have a question um and and I like you to answer this after we take a break but\nI I have a real concern about um government getting in a way we're a over regulation on the solar industry and um and then it goes into also into the the corporation commission think about that if you would I I just you know there's there's a lot of concerns about\n\n... board ruse public radio

Lucy Mason here on Arizona energy crossroads I'm Still commissioner\nHow do you feel about um your job as and and your responsibilities at the corporation commission and how that's going\nYou know I I've I feel that these responsibilities and a half of the corporation commission are are vitally important and it's been a real honor to serve\nArizona is on the commission you know when governor and do see a point in me to the commission just eight months ago and is very honored by what he said when he said that you know the number one priority that he hasn't feeling this fake and it is to ensure that he feels a vacancy\nWith someone who will serve what the highest standards of ethics and integrity and that's been my my number one priority and my service at the commission in addition to that\nI have also to strive to ensure that the policies that we adopted the commission or policies that will protect the rate payer and also ensure that we have reliable unsafe public services\nAnd I was very honored to lead the effort to require utilities to reduce their rates in response to the tax reform that Congress passed in DC just last year\nAs a result of that tax reform our utilities are paying a significantly lower amount of corporate income taxes\nAnd so as a tax manager and a private sector I start quickly recognize that this is an opportunity for those utilities to reduce their rates\nAnd cast savings on to the rate payers as a result of these efforts that a lot of the commission repairs are paying a hundred and sixty five million dollars last annually and that amount will continue to grow into the future or something I'm very excited\nAbout that is exciting um and and that is an important thing I think uh most news media folks don't pick up a so I'm really glad that you're able to talk about that here\nYes a at tax reduction that turns into a reduced rate from the utilities is extremely important you're talking about rate reduction I'm sure with all the utilities right now now\nThe corporation commission is a little bit different in its structure just if you could just take a minute and talk about what you can do a there's a lot of rules a lot of rules within the corporation commission where if you're in a docket where you're discussing a certain rape case um what happens to the public uh\nHow how does that were just really quickly if you could uh Justin\nYeah it's a great question because we are caused by judicial body we are subject to some restrictions recount pre charge a case where you to wait until all of the facts have been presented to us in a hearing an open meeting and then at that time that the commission's ready to rules and we make a determination on what the facts\nLead us to to rule until that time that the commission rules we are limited in what we can say specifically regarding cases that are pending before the commission not any different than a judge would be limited in his ability to speak openly about an opinion on a case that's pending before\nThe court I Know as a as a a lobbyist right now I'm for the Arizona solar energy Industries Association I Know that there are things that I Would like to talk to commissioners about and I cannot because you're in an open docket and so that goes for consumers to write\nTo a large extent now or or limited and the substantive conversations that we can have regarding\nThat are pending before the commission and I think that's just to protect the integrity of the ultimate ruling that the commission will\nProvide and to ensure that the commission or does not have to recuse himself or herself or for having prejudged that case\nYou know and I think it's important to have the time to be able to work with staff that's completely politically neutral to find out the facts and be able to present them to you and for you to ask the question the appropriate questions of staff as they investigate\nIt's so I just wanted to make sure that our listeners understood that I'm All right well and are remaining time there's a couple of initiatives that are out there one is called the clean election uh I'm clean energy for a healthy Arizona\nCan you talk to us about that one\n[noise] yeah so this is the amendment the Thomas Fire has funded the effort that he's fun to to put in a constitutional amendment to the ballot than fire as renewable energy standard in Arizona to increase to fifty percent by twenty thirty\nAnd so it's a it's a significant measure it'd be the first time to to energy policy would it be established\nAt the ballot box and and put in to the constitution\nUm you know I Do have some concerns with that approach to establishing energy policy and the concern that I have as as I mentioned in a in the previous segment and I think that energy policy ought to be driven by the technology that is available to the to the to the parents\nAnd my my my my concern is that if we put energy policy in to the constitution\nAnd we get that energy policy wrong well then it's going to be very difficult to adapt to that policy okay to the reality is that the rate payers face on it so\nMy approach is to continue to increase the amount of solar energy renewal energy that the state is using in its portfolio as\nThe cost of storage falls and now I think is a an approach that creates a win win we can have both sustainable energy and sustainable rates for the rate of\nSome some ... analyses have demonstrated that that the initiative could lead to an increase in about a thousand dollars per year for the annual repair and that's my concern I Want to make sure that we have a fully yeah I'm ... and ...\nAnd I would urge you commissioner to re evaluate that number [laughter] it's um and bringing bringing the experts are to talk to you and I want to go we only have a few seconds left but can you just say something about the outlaw dirty money or a initiative that's out there\nAbsolutely and I just a quick comment I certainly am looking in all of the different perspectives on all the different birds and and one perfect example look to as I can look to California that has adopted some of the same\nMandates that this initiative would require and the repairs and California are paying fifty percent more on an average then Arizona rape pairs\nSo as the technology improves then we can create the ability to reach those\nThose thresholds perhaps but we've got to make sure that we do it in a way that's balanced and and appropriate yeah I'm with regard to to the other an issue that I I absolutely support trans parents who I think that we've got to do everything that we can to advocate an advance transparency so that we know\nAre we know where money is coming from and who's influencing who\nAre a lot of the questions that are dealt with with the initiative have to deal with at the Supreme Court ruling and unfortunately you know I don't see it on the Supreme Court overturned or adjust that Supreme Court policy but I fully support transparency and accountability\nOkay thank you so much a commissioner Justin Olson for being with us today I Am Lucy Mason here on Arizona energy crossroads listeners come back and join us next\nWeek Arizona energy crossroads is pretty public service my problem with the communications in partnership with radio and the radio\nOn Saturdays and Sundays [noise]\n\nEach time for Tony as kids taking you around the world of food in line here is tonia carrying things we do any meat today a regular guest on the program is just silly and today we're talking about a ... wrenching salad for summertime entertaining\nI liked born in balance out the one that comes to my mind\nToday they wait until the hundred and thirty two percent so\nThe smartest thing is to really just do your homework and figure out when is the best time for you to take\nA that benefit you need to take control of this decision you need to figure out mathematically what is the best decision for for me I should I take it at seven hundred and fifty dollars Seventy five percent for eight years or should I\nYou know can I wait and that's that's that's the big thing can that person wait until age Seventy for the hundred and thirty two percent in order to wait for that Social Security him out what are they going to need they're going to need other income to live off of right\nOr should they tap into to those other retirement income sources do they have a pension do they have IRA money or four one K. money that will be able to carry them through those years in order to wait for that hire him out another big decision is your health\nIf you are not in the best house right burger sixty two they're thinking I might not live that long I'm going to take her hair and a half exactly so another you know a few items that you should consider would be health and family longevity what are your current cash needs right because I have a lot of people walking at age sixty to saying I\nSo um you know your current cash need another thing to consider is are you planning on working because remember earnings from work could affect\nThe number of checks you get for that you are right so you need to think about that\nToo and then the last item you should think about is uh do you have other retirement income sources that can carry through those years in order for you to wait and let that that money or crude at eight percent per year and then cash out at the maximum rate\nWhich for the baby boomers right now would be aged Seventy at a hundred and thirty two percent now we do have a Social Security calculator on our website too so you can go to Social Security dot\nGov and then when you register for that my Social Security account and you can view all of your earnings well there's a calculator you can use you can say OK Social Security I Want to know how much I'm going to get at sixty two at sixty three sixty four sixty five and it will use that database that you're looking at in order to do that top thirty five year calculation\nSo you can see instantly on line what your benefit amount is going to be then you can look at the variables and say All right well I think I can wait until this age at this percentage but once you select fat\nThat amount so let's say you're sixty five and the percentage is Ninety three point three percent when you take it at sixty five at Ninety three point three percent you are locked in to that for the rest of your life it does not convert over\nAt full retirement age or at age Seventy so you are locked into that for the rest of your life now you do have a window though of security a little bit lenient here where you can change your mind I but you it has to be done within that twelve month window from when he first started up your benefit\nBut when it when I was hurt and and the problem was prevalent discussion with ... or early retirement benefits but there's also potential stove on survivor benefits for ... percent even further referred to talk with her\nRight now spousal benefits is is a little complicated I have so many spouses walking in every single day to our offices saying I Want to take his benefit first because he made more money or I Want to take her benefit for us because she take she made more money and I want to delay mine for the hundred and thirty two percent it's not that easy okay spousal benefits\nWe need to understand why supposed to benefits was great it was created to protect those buses with little work or no work at all for instance my mom she was a stay at home mom\nShe's solely relied on the spouse would benefit\nYou fast forward to me that's where it's my sister we've had careers ever since we got out of college we're not going to get a penny a spouse will benefit right because our benefit on our own work records is going to be more than what we can receive advice about so you have to be smart at that too because if you have your own work record\nMost likely you are not going to be eligible for a spouse or benefits now widow's benefits a that's a difference but with the spouse of benefits definitely um we have a lot of information on our website regarding spousal benefits examples of house buffalo benefits work but don't don't be surprised if you go into Social Security or talk to Iraq\nAnd you have a high income you know high wages if they say no you're not eligible for ... okay so there's a couple of filing options are filing strategies that were very popular and one was filing suspend and the other one was file and restrict\nSo the filing suspend was where a person would would actually filed it benefits the spend it in order to solely entitle a spouse that has gone away back in twenty Fifteen legislation took that\nThat benefit away because that was becoming very lucrative especially for high income earners where one member of the couple would get the fifty percent and they were both waiting for the hundred and thirty two percent\nDrove about a minute or so ... put it in for position ask your question uh that you can't answer in a minute but if we have to stop and I'm David Greene over we will bring you mentioned walking earlier and you talked about working in court and benefits before ... terminated ... right\nSo then if you decide that you want to take your benefit and let's say start collecting your benefits and then\nYou are saying yourself you know what I'm a little bored here I Want to get a part time job I Want to work you can work and make up to a certain what we call earnings limit so this year at Seventeen thousand forty dollars you can make up to that still collect all twelve checks if you go over that for every\nTwo dollars you go over you will not be paid one Social Security dollar so what I usually do with my clients is I go through the the scenario how much you're going to make\nBut subtract the Seventeen zero forty and then we plug in their benefit him out and then I Will tell them you will be able to receive aid checks this year or however many checks are eligible for depending on how much money they're going to make from their job\nBut if you read found terminated you can work and make as much as you want to do some or\nBill Gates could come in today back to work tomorrow and yes he will get all of his check\nVery early ... hey that's worth when the when I ask you about ... Medicare and the discussion but first we have to take a break and maybe in the ... we can even get listeners involved\nGood use a couple of ways to do that your phone number you can use his phone number twenty four seven and a six advice that's in age six students read any for twenty three or you can email us your questions\nSince the your money and wealth and has but that totally get your money and wealth and has been dot com\nEveryone thanks for joining us or staying with us was the case may be if you're with us for the first half of the show you know that round or white now from the Social Security administration\nIs joined us today and we're talking about Social Security and we know every time we do this topic there's a lot of interest there's a lot of questions and ah this is a very important topic and it's a very important decision to get right so we're going to continue our discussion and then maybe a if before the end of the show\nWe have time we'll get a few listeners involved as well but we run and we got a few more things to cover and first of all thank you for coming out I Know how busy you are and appreciate your coming on\nUm Medicare you can't talk about Social Security and not also talk about Medicare at the same time\nRight now Medicare should not be mistaken for medical assistance or or or Medicaid remember Medicare is a piece of legislation health insurance legislation that was passed\nBack in Nineteen sixty five but the the big question I always get about Medicare as do I have to sign up at age sixty five do I have to take it at sixty five now for a lot of our workers a lot of our our\nOur baby boomers they're working past sixty five right they're keeping their job they're keeping their health insurance so the answer to that is if you are working and you have your private health insurance through your employer you do not\nHave to pick up Medicare part B why pay the hundred and thirty four dollars when you don't have to write when you're fully covered a hundred percent through your employer so you delay that Medicare part B and you will not be penalize as long as your employer is willing to fill up this form that we have saying yes you know Joe Smith was on our\nOn our private health insurance plan all these years all these months after sixty five you get that signed by your employer Social Security uses that to basically wave the penalty so you do not have to sign up\nAt sixty five if you are going to hold that private insurance plan and you could be on a spouse's private insurance plan to end delayed taken it I just did the session with ... you know a large number of U. of M. professors they Seventy Seventy one Seventy two years old has never been on Medicare\nThey're not going to pick up that Medicare until they leave the EU and their private health insurance plan\nYou're sort of a couple of things that might come as a surprise to people that are now\nYou have sixty five and eligible for Medicare I think a lot of younger people hear the word Medicare and they think number one it's free hurt these free but for hospitalization ... be there is a cost based on your income no you through a number of there for the cost of ... the and that's a pretty common number but you're your own\nPremium or payment could be hired based on your income that's income driven that's all right so that's that's a surprise to a lot of people in the other thing is\nI have some people Rhonda that are eligible for Medicare but they're still working\nBut we look at it and we do an analysis and we determined that Medicare is actually a quote unquote a better deal either it's cheaper than what they're paying for for their insurance or it's better coverage or a combination of both so you might be eligible and not wanna\nProfile for ... be but you might be ... might see this is better than the insurance I have right now I'm sixty five and when to take advantage of it\nRight and then you have to do that you know you have to actually um price out the numbers because your age that's free pardon me the one thirty four eighty as a base premium right then you have to look at and and the party covers eighty percent of Dr outpatient clinic visit so then you're going to have to look for the twenty percent policy put a number on that\nAnd then look for prescription drug policy put a number on that\nTotal it all out and then compare it to what you have with your employer so yeah I can see where you know it could possibly be cheaper than the employer based health insurance but another thing do do you know do the research you have to look at your personal situation figure that out", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Podcast Playlist", "city": "Kingman", "day": "06"}
