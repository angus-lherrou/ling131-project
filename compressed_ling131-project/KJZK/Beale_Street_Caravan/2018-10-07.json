and this week we're introducing you to a new feature scholar and author ... is a professor at the University of Memphis and she specializes in cultural studies her latest book is called wrong what I Do to our country music and contemporary culture\nBarbour begins a new theory that important and explores the relationship between the blues country music here she is Barbara change\nWe're hearing country music legendary records and the truth or the truth than twelve bars were listening to American roots music that's grown out of a lot of shared territory particularly the American south\nWell white southerners were spared the experience of slavery and its aftermath they played a lot of music with their African American neighbors to forward Bailey an\nAfrican American her Monica player gave the grand Ole Opry its name on December tens Nineteen twenty seven when he opened the show then called WFAN barn dance with the Pan American blues\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd figuring out life\nYou know what I mean which is weird\nDon't think 'cause I Know a\nAre people that we've encountered business part they just go I don't\nYeah and um [noise]\nIt doesn't scare me in the same way\nLike music to me is the artistic form that we get to do and in the music happens and then you got to talk about the business part\nBecause if you don't know your business somebody on that show up to me this is an artist rate and getting up there on stage writing songs is an art\nBut at the same time I got\nWhat streaming doing or what's publishing and all the all those kinds of things and I feel like that's been a lot of fun I learn something new every day about this business and the interesting thing that\nPaul the entertainer what\nDoes he do\nTo get inspired\nI don't want to give anybody a bad show yeah I don't\nWant anybody that you don't care if there's five people or whatever\nPay less like watch us like a man that phone in it and then I\nSpend the hard earned money to come see a show\nNot me just you know sitting in a chair on stage or whatever you know\nMotivation to always like brand\nYou guys are really good at\nEngaging the audience to the point where they feel like they're in it together\nThere on this ride together [laughter] yeah I\nFor me the ideas very communal and no matter where we come from\nWould you know you know socioeconomic or ethnicity or\nOr sexuality all of those things we all kind of come together and you create this moment\nThis can happen and I think that's the beauty amuse yeah you know what I mean and and then it doesn't happen in a lot of places and our in our in our\nSociety and I think music can do that\nI think that's important to me I still I mean I see it I said you know when I went to go see France yeah he saw that\nI mean and it's like this communal experience and it's like I I don't know I think that's important to me because it gives me face [laughter] you know and it is very church background\nOr you want to get to that pay that moment and everyone feels like they're having a shared experience and and I get to be the conduit that goes through that I think it's a beautiful thing and I don't think you can put that\nWords exactly what it is another\nPiece that often comes up is people with experience and gospel music in the church they get out to make them feel good make them feel together and to give them hope for something bigger\nI I think that to me that's our that's that's the background\nLess I grew up singing in church I just\nI feel like that's my ultimate goal I think a hundred percent that's it is to to give that hole\nAnd then there was a bit idealistic at times but it's like you do all that you can and then when you come to his show\nThe communal experience and and you do feel loved and then you have a little\nRight man ... carries you through and I think that's the power of music and that's the power\nLife for a listener records or songs or music and and it makes me it just makes me get through a hard time you know what I mean like to have a dive record like that and that's important to me\nMusically in between you guys um Alabama Shakes what's going on in Birmingham\nA cheaper rent [laughter]\nI think that's\nProbably a I'm coming from Alabama\nIt's hard to navigate because you know I'm a pretty liberal guy\nAnd so being in that state you kinda wanna be like no no no not every\nBody and not everybody's Jeff Sessions Roy Moore yeah [laughter] you\nKnow and and try to be a good ambassador and try to do the right thing and try to help those that that maybe don't have the same opportunities that you do have you\nWho made comments he with everything going on in the national conversation rise\nUp you know I\nAsked [noise] especially overseas when Trump got elected it was like I was a slight were in New York and it was just like there was a funeral goes crazy it's one of those things that she try [noise] I don't make a secret how I feel\nThings I and I don't think he should um\nI also I'm not probably during the show but I'm going on twenty minute political rant yeah what's been bizarre is that when Trump was inaugurated we were in Europe and so we weren't we didn't we didn't get it and [noise] and we didn't get to see it and which I was really happy I was like oh I just feel pretend it's not happening yeah it makes me sad\nAnd I keep trying to be like All right I'm going to I got to get through this and and figure out and this watch people's bags and you know a good thing about being raised in Alabama and and believing different I mean I'm a very liberal God\nBless you learn how to\nCommunicate with people but I think when you start getting into prejudice and things like that that's to me is not a political issue here is a human issue yeah\nAnd I think that's where I start going no no no no you start talking about someone's ethnicity or they're or their sexuality like why does politicized I don't know we need to have conversations when you talk about stuff and and I always want people to come from place to la mhm I think the problem is that we're getting into this weird territory right now or it's like it's not coming from that\nAnd I use you read with my doctor king said any really talk\nLoving your enemy and I think people just kind of under estimate that state [noise] yeah do you know what I mean and Honda come from\nA place of love and acceptance hard I guess so angry and some man\nI've been trying to navigate through that\nThink that's a good place to start\nYeah so for anyone who wants to find out more about the ban what's the best place for them to go\nI mean we've got a Web page you know I don't know what we have a Twitter and Facebook and he can't find it you don't know how to use Google\nWe're going to go back with more music from Saint Paul broken bones at the mighty Mississippi music festival [noise]\n\nJersey oh\nDo we always do the yeah\n[noise] we turn\n\nOh we minimum\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nKnow well\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nUm [noise]\n\n[noise]\nNo", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Beale Street Caravan", "city": "Kingman", "day": "07"}
