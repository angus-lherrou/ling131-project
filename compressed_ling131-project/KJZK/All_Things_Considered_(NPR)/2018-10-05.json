phone line busy right now we still have several lines open college right now at eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to well wow well you guys were enjoying that was great songs\nAnd we were getting some of the back story on those songs and well I think some of that we can actually say talk about over the\nRadio a little over [laughter]\nYou you said something about your high school connection with this music\nYeah so uh one of the the ... that came through I actually heard on college radio when I was with my high school principal shut up to Tom Russian who is still here locally in quite\nA and his son and I were friends we were watching what other you two shows and visiting is this are are most of Russian most or cut out the director of the children's museum author has to be tuned into the college radio station I heard the folk song I've seen it in Rolling Stone and like yeah picked up the vial pretty much straight away after that box some\nGood stuff and that was the fiesta song which is a a perfect example of what this radio stations all about because we are border radio and we are crossing borders we believe that we love music from both sides of the border in fact all sides of every border and that's what this station is all about it that that was clearly at an Irishman this perspective on more as I guess so [laughter]\nI I'm really trying to not order another round I mean both of you guys right here this close that music is just like being an elder a prison ... feels a little bit like all of its feeling like home to some of you maybe you are friends of Fox or Chris and maybe you've enjoyed some time in their hospitality over a prison he'll call them now\nYou can reach us here in Yuma locally at nine to eight\nThree four four seven six

gifted twenty dollars or fifty dollars or a hundred dollars\nBut um but we have a um a regular program a lot of support a monthly giving program that you participate in crafts you you are one of our ... why\nBecause it's the easiest thing in the world you know you look and once a month you get something that's taken out of your ah checking accounts five dollars to ten bucks [laughter] you know it's the cost of Starbucks it's completely easy it's mindless and it does it on a good by sounds like you'd be real well mindless\n[laughter] that was awful [laughter] I got off the [laughter] all of the [laughter] house it's always boxers often that's\nGreat and like I might even luckier than that because that since I work here and eight of you see I get it taken right on my paycheck every time I

another phone line busy we still have several lines open call now and get involved right now with\nThat border radio a beat out or we've got the donate button there\nUh there's also the button there where you can listen to us on my ... border radio ac downward and that was by explaining to a Christian Fox a moment ago we actually have two different apps you can use to listen to us on your smartphone there's ... which had radio stations from all over the world on it or that tune in one word and\nThen the other one is called ... all one word and now I really liked that one because it's all college radio station stations like ours that are trying to get a you know have\nThat college radio sound with students involved\nAnd what I like about radio effects and that ... has shortcuts to all of our social media will you know yeah really convenient so if you want to listen to us on the smartphone a check out one of those apps downloaded and you can hear us even when you are and you can't get us on the radio waves it all starts with getting involved your local public radio station that is what\nPublic radio is all about is a community involvement so please get involved now eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine\n... even if they if they do choose to use radio FX or maybe they just decided to look for our social media it's easy to find is\nOn Instagram and on Twitter and as well as on Facebook so you can find this in any of those locations and while we've been very busy here we're steadily posting some photos so we will get some things out right away as soon as possible you'll see a nice dream on any of those sites\nBut I Know Chris un un Fox you've been you've been a little ahead of us you've been promoting some stuff on your social media\nYeah so ah you know we put it up on the prison hill Facebook page and we've got about four thousand followers oh yeah and I do\nOut I put it on my personal page Fox has it on Instagram\nI'll get away with all my friends all employer employee on everybody about it for a week or so now\nSo anybody you need to you know publicly out that they should be picking up the phone yeah his wife Carrie [laughter]\nThey're not sending them and she'll be calling right now uh he should be done a great enabler things like that\n[laughter] you know all we're asking for is you know donate the cost of one beer per month for like the whole year yeah how are they good yeah I mean that's a simple embryonic six bucks a month to get done\nVery easy very easy for you to take care of now we know I'm a day pointed out that you're batting a thousand here with the level of support that um that you fed us today that you individually support the station and that you're supporting it through your business now it might make sense that yes you're passionate about the station but why is it a good idea for your business to be a part of this\nSo it's it's absolutely the demographic that comes into the brewery I mean you've got progressive thinking you've got people that are interested in the community and getting locally involved in living things that are source locally [noise] this is I mean you know public radio and you guys here doing it as local as you can get any kind of doing the same thing we're doing over there are ways\nThat we we all have different service offerings [laughter] no doubt\nAnd as far as like a\nSafe frequently when we're talking about\nAre a music service here it says this music service is definitely touched by human hands or we don't use a computer algorithm we don't have a a giant a\nComputer in the sky city that's down all the music that we are going to play a we pick it out uh we uh we curated\nA I don't know if you guys walk by all the albums out in the lobby we have a huge collection a professor here on campus donate adjust to us the other day some great music from the late seventies all every single step an album\nIn pristine condition yeah on a on the original vinyl just gorgeous seven right now we're we're sorting through that and getting that all into our our plane is so we definitely a hands on a humans are involved\nAnd that and then what we like to do and when I specially I'm teaching to the student DJ's on the crossing borders program is um is don't just play a bunch of music tell people why you played where I'm from hell it how it affected you tell us tell us a you know what it reminded you are\nAnd that's what I think makes the programming so much by and that's what I've been trying to do on the bridge for many years and and do it this new format it's kind of like\nA we kind of broken down the barriers and said hey we're gonna go we're going to go all the way to the wall on adding and er and make this thing really happened because we know that there's an audience out there that cares about the news here is about what's going on so we do newscast things you're about to ... see news guys but also just wants to get away from it sometimes\nAnd just think about other stuff some college right now at eight seven seven eight three eight five to nine to that's eight seven seven eight three eight\nFive to nine to icy without one line busy we still have several lines open please call and uh and give us a give us whenever you can to help support this and I know that's what the whole idea behind the craft beer a beer movement is his hands on human made stuff yet right\nKnives and local support that's how we live\nHand to hand you know people right next to you're making a framed I drink and with your that's what we do outside of that as they know who to blame [laughter]\nSometimes it's a win [laughter] not one of the perks my job I get to direct that occur [laughter]\n[laughter] hey I've got\nI've got an idea out there and
