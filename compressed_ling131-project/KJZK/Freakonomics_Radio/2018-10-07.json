time or yet okay\nBring that baby heavy can't up\nHoping if in reading and hoping the wind in blow\nAnd doing the art shows and I would stay across\nCourthouse square so I could see my ...\nAnd every time I did it I wished that I Lived here and that I didn't have to\nProbably seven seven years I say roughly\nBefore going to further your to do was random art yeah it's a little bit of two fourteen north McCormick\nBecause I live above the studio if someone\nCalls me I can go downstairs okay if I'm In the studio and going to be there for a while I turn on my twenty seven dollar sign which is worth a million bucks because I turn it on people know him open\nOtherwise it's our walks\nEvery hour walk but for years right\nEvery fourth friday down long have you been in Prescott\nTwenty years Twenty years in ...\nOr so before that you weren't nurse yeah okay so how does it go for nursing into art or orange or nursing which came first\nCame first okay um but I didn't get my upper class degree I guess you'd call it out of you know\nHigh school I didn't go for the art degree\nFirst or did I Know I didn't show I was a nurse\nUm I wanted to show my work but I was a little timid okay and a good friend of mine said would it help if you had a degree behind you would you feel more\nI went and got their degree so I have the nursing degree they are degree and also along the way I got my license at ... my real estate license\nWhat I didn't know that I'm never sure what I Would [laughter]\nOne stream of income is an old enough yeah Antarctic\nAnd because it worked with being um for a while a single mom\nOf three little girls so what I did was I taught art\nDuring the day while they were in school I was teaching our at ... college okay which at that time wasn't called that was called our callers graphic design school\nSo I taught there and then when they got our school we had time for dinner and homework and then I had ladies come into my our studio so they can do their nails\nBecause the girls were slave and then we can go to their dads and I work at the hospital\nSo I use all three\nOf my background education at one time I hear a long time\nFor me so I didn't know about the cause of with all due to the ... yeah well I started because I wanted to enter their competition for nail art because for seven years I painted nothing but photo realistic\nSmall miniature ... members are suitable and I traveled all over the southwestern United States predominantly doing them nature shows\nWhen they all are ... you know the acrylic nails came in but then I found out that they have a competition for Naylor which was right up my alley so I did compete and I did take second place\nIn all files and to compete you had to have a license okay so I went to cosmetology school got my licence never really do full time except like I said in my studio a little bit at a salon and I found it really tedious but\nSo I never did much in the salon but I Do do the competition and that was fun\nSo when you break nails 'cause we drove me nuts I don't I don't get the whole thing but I always thought the little distorted Neal are so what kind of stuff we painting on them\nWhile you had to pick a theme for the competition\nAnd my thing was Katrina okay and I did ... of all different descriptions on all ten ... your time is twelve minutes basically per nail and I remember this was in Nineteen eighty six yeah\nI did do a Mary and the only one\nDrawings of other Marion that but I Want everyone to know that I'm no engineer and that is in engineering feat literally took about ten\nI studied I bought the book I read about it I attempted one head and actually\nThat's how these has came to me\nI did a head it was way too heavy ... so it became just a

Halloween on the line how so how did you chew me out of out of whack\nIf you don't want to know do what I yeah I live all mature artist come together and they're ... they're not the same thing I doubt it off\nWe met because I needed a photographer impressed got to do\nArt pieces is difficult for all our line of a cliche I Know Mr photographer we please come to mind our eye and take some pictures ... guy\nWasn't interested in him only his psychiatrist at first\nUm many are there so that was in\nSaid Nineteen Ninety nine we just spent that seems to have them doesn't matter Seventeen years ago and I may I may\nBeen that line now I was actually introduced to him by an ex girlfriend of his who said I think he can take these pictures 'cause I was driving my paintings to the next right to have them shot so that they could be reproduced um and then she plays cat and\nYou're a geek for hire a professional gate yeah pretty much speak for higher and like you I got a new bumper sticker slogan I\nIndeed indeed so um so you you left you have a pi college and he thought to yourself I'm going to make a business correct and that businesses it's quite if you call it clients munitions correct yes and so it's all about it tell us everything All right well don't hold back\n[laughter] I'll Try not to my needs to stop me though so find communications is a consulting kept me and we seem to increase the businesses use of technology for customer relations primarily this involves establishing an online presence and basically establishing the marketing you need around indication some emails campaigns text in\nOther things that people are still using like newsletters that we're doing that in digital form and then also social media management and online review management\nIs there some sort of platform that you guys offers that you guys are you right now it's\nMe and I just started it so I'm you know I'm doing the whole show which I actually really enjoy both my parents owned their own businesses so I've been in my whole life and have always wanted the opportunity I did real estate for a few years too so I have worked for myself and kind of that foreign before so it is just me and we are actually not partnered with any\nIt's like management ... sales force anything like that\nBecause we don't want to be biased um I Want to make sure to bring any opportunities to my clients that I can so basically I meet with a client and see what they're already using and then just I have a list of um certain platforms I liken prefer and so I Do tend to go to bed might go to west but I don't work specifically with anyone system\nAnd so you're doing your customer relationship management to things like ... or similar similar sort of on line popcorn software is the service yeah kind of things yeah\nSo and so that you throw it in there and and just sort of I talked about mechanisms at the top of the show this is a way to sort of automated or or centralized um what people are doing in order to\nVery much you know as so it is working with a lot of small businesses and you know owning a business is a ... and it's nonstop and so we want to come in and help people automate and take the parts that they shouldn't be focusing on because they need to be focusing on their industry and their business\nAnd so we can take that part and help them automate it and make sure that they're communicating with their customers and their clients their partners their vendors in an automated way and an easy way in a way that makes them a sense and and so we can say that you saw in time\nI Am I Am selling them time I'm selling them money selling them are like you know you don't realize how much goes in to having an online presence these days those are full jobs having the social media manager\nAnd you have to have one if you have a business you need to have an online presence if you're running it or not you're going to have one out there because there's so many review platforms\nYou know everyone's always on their phone on their laptop well not so much so I thought they were in the city and on my laptop that's what I said that but you know they have their phones tablets and they're constantly checking in on social media and checking in with what they're doing\nSo a lot of business owners you know even if they're making the choice to not have\nA say a I'm a review in the platform of guilt it still could be out there if one of their customers felt like putting it out\nThere and you need a managed to that exactly exactly made me think of as a long time ago I don't know if it's still up and running but Second Life where you had to sort of hold on line ... scene and and we're all in Second Life we are you're you're sort of creating the storefront in the in the online version that we all\nYeah I'm ... because you know I'm not I'm more of a consultant um like the industry itself is for consulting purposes and I definitely go into the administrative side it's like a business needs that but a lot of businesses already have created their storefront out there so I really kind of come in and clean the windows for\nThem [laughter] that's very nice like write for ... for ... for what kind of people hire you for your customers well\nWith my background I actually have worked for you know the corporate world and nonprofit sector I've done real estate I've done tech um higher education so are you saying yes yes yes limit my clients yes they're all saying yeah so I\nHave not focused on a specific industry as of right now I think I might in the future I Know there's just kind of starting off in consulting a couple of businesses you know in the past few weeks I I Know there's some that work a lot better than others to consult with because they have more clients they need to be in front of their clients more specifically service industries [laughter]\nSo I haven't really the other ... like restaurants are timers like hairdressers medalists they you know those types of things where there's other businesses that they\nThey already have it locked down to and they have platforms for their businesses already so they wouldn't mean you know a third party to come in and bring more third party solutions for them so\nWith regard to your clients who are yes you're young science everybody I'm like ... or do they come to you because they're having a pain point is is there a problem that they are desperate for you to solve\nThey can be um right now we're actually offering free initial consultation so a couple of my clients came to me not thinking that had any problems at all and I've been able to show them I found a couple of reviews on line or is found there are some issues with something else happening with their communication flows\nYou know with all these ... these systems and automation is you can put in place there stumbling through their communication work clothes because they're doing them all manually and they're missing steps\nAnd they don't realize that you know because they're going along and they're running their job they're working twenty six hours a day and all all the hours plus some and not realizing that they're missing these huge gaps with their customers so I've been able to kind of come in and show them you know there's there's this break here when a customer science that bond\nSay your your contact form or when they first purchase a product and you're not only that but that you're not instantly responding and giving them feedback you're not responding to their reviews online those types of things\nAnd it's time for a break we'll return shortly with communications meeting Michele bicker here on she's all that [noise]\n\nSupport for this program is provided by Montoya

Michel before the break we were talking about these big gaps that you find in your clients effective communications they often don't have any idea that they're not giving this really excellent customer or prospect experience that people are feeling kind of like they're dropped into the void and once you fix that her when she would tell them how to fix that if you'd like here's the tools to use\nUm what what did they find well\nYou know with communications um in streamlining you find a lot more time first of all you know you put things in place to basically take over what you're doing the anyway so all of a sudden all that half hour every morning he spent checking your emails because of the contact farms coming and no longer have to do that\nYou're also find mean better communication with your clients makes them happy here you're in front of them or they feel more taking care of\nIt's interesting in with all of the technology that we have today we are always you know being stimulated by something in our face and customers there's actually a lot of information out there on the customers are feet feeling dropped and they feel like they're not important to businesses anymore\nSo that's part of making sure your communications are in place in streamlined so you get a lot more customer loyalty\nMany fix these problems or their increases in the actual bottom line or do you have to fight back and saying so I now have this much coming in and I used to have this much or you know the differential between my course and that might not I'm not even more than ever\nYou ever and that is the main drive ins as it's a big increase on your our our ally your return on investment right so these systems they cost money to put in place obviously I cost money unfortunately I'm not free [laughter] I Would come in and you know anything if you write buckets of money in the door right after you exactly so um\nYou have to put this money up front and by the systems and get on planes and put the time up front to streamline these systems and get everything in place and then once the customers are happy and you're communicating with them\nThey start coming through the door and your revenue starts to go up you know and do you have returning customers to I think it's something I don't have that effect in front of me right now but it's something like eighty percent of the revenue in businesses next quarter\nOf all that twenty percent of your effort yields eighty percent of your uh eighty percent of your return yes when he presented her customers are going to be eighty percent of the problem or or twenty percent of your customers are going to be eighty percent of what exactly yes so it's your problem with a cigarette while we can apply it to a lot of things right", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Freakonomics Radio", "city": "Kingman", "day": "07"}
