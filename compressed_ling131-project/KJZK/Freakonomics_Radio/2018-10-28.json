Prescott Chino valley Ninety point seven K. J. C. K. Kingman Boulder City Nevada and on translator cake to one seven eighty five ... park at Ninety One point three FM from ... public radio in ... new following program\nWe\nWhen does this week on the Prescott out I'm sitting here with this is actually pretty amazing 'cause we've known each other for how long [noise] probably about sixteen Seventeen and you're going to be something at least that long as you move them John how one was as\nI moved here about Nineteen years ago and then I started working with you at mind maybe a year later and a half later\nYeah so we're sitting here talking with Susan Kelly I'm a member of the group salt of the earth which is a ... how do you how would you describe yourself\nUm we call ourselves Americana with a\nEmphasis we cover everything from blues to folk Americana but um it's eclectic it's for sure that we have our own spin on sort of Americana bluegrass style of music okay so I'm going to go back\nTo the first question I ask Susan Kelley yeah what brought you to ...\n[noise] um I had been here in college to go rock climbing or the friend my father lived here you're here in college to go rock climbing yeah in the late eighties we go to school I went to Lyndon stay and okay I'm I'm\nWay northern Vermont and Air Canada and a friend and I just decided we were going to come out and visit and so we came out and mean the minute I got off the plane I was just and for all by the way that Arizona smells and the beautiful views and the incredible outdoor possibilities of you know and venturing\nAnd so I told myself that I was going to move back some day and I ended up moving back I'm about Twenty years later called\nMe a while and it was all those little sort of wild so we agree with you on what were you doing [noise] um at first\nI was just trying to get my feet under me because moving four thousand feet higher than you know where I was living before that which was Vermont quite a quite a bit to acclimate to\nAnd as you know I worked in restaurants because that's how we met right um you were running Zuma than I was a bartender there and that was kind of my thing I bar tended\nUm I had a you know college degree but it wasn't quite ready to go into a professional job yet because I wanted to raise my kids and so working nights and raising my kids during the day was a great balance what is your college degree in psychology\nNot music now and um you know in fact the only thing I really had that that was musical at that point was when I was a huge debt head don't know if your viewers or your listeners know what that means but a huge fan of the Grateful Dead and I follow them around for many years I'm In the mid to late eighties to the mid\nNineties and still do actually I was just looking at the failure to\nHow many shows you think you've been to over ... over two hundred oh you're a dead yeah yeah your dad hardcore and ... when I went out on a on a\nGame on the line I Know that you know the data hill lifestyles those people who are married and still has a sort of a home and it plays every once in a like\nActually studying a on her conservative little car dead sticker when [laughter] when I was working for you and I realize that she and I had that in common that it's always\nTold his before but this has come up on this show probably one two three four five different times once with through appealing than some other folks\nAnd I recall the first one I actually heard you say oh yeah and you remember this I think ... and this on their coach who is going on there was like a Sunday afternoon Saturday afternoon I think it was quiet time of day I came on the front door and blah blah and you're on the far back patio and I don't remember how many people were there\nBut I was in the in the bar area and I'm like\nOh my gosh I heard you say and I walked out on the thing and there was one of the Susan I'd no idea what you're saying at that point in time right they form\nAnd it still is one of those for me want to stand out moments 'cause I remember the moment when and what I Love about you and your is your voice is\nYour sound is a genuine sheer and it's not you don't sound like anybody else and you know trying to yeah you know but I Love that about you and it's something that I think a lot of people when they come in and they hear you guys perform the guys are okay you know but there\nCertain okay they're pretty damn in your shoes and they show up you know but I'm just saying and so\nHow would you call to be that what what did you start seeing what but about well\nInteresting that you mentioned coyote joke because I bar tended there and um I don't know if you've had the wonderful bread Newman on your show yet but I'm sure there are no right Brad Newman would play taco Tuesdays on on the patio before there was a stage before there was anything that was little beer cart and then tacos\nAnd you know in a container sitting on a table somewhere and read or heard me singing along with him and I had never really then I have no musical training I had never really performed professionally until that point and Brad would invite me to come up in St grateful dishonest with\nHim doing that and all that just paid off we're going to last Saturday area and with training and uh and then um\nI came to the attention of Becky dulcie Becky ... wonderful musician and she does Becky fast and we'll get to that in a little bit another group or another\nGreat unique personality down and you know so so to speak\nYeah absolutely and wonderful strong powerful female musician and she and I I'm struck up a friendship over a music and decided to start playing together and we started playing out as two girls that was the name of our band in fact will be I'll talk about this later but we'll have a little two girls reunion coming up in another month and a half or so\nUm and so she and I started to get some notoriety and some attention from the local facilities that allow for music\nTo curb\nThe local ... going to allow [laughter]\nI any bars right primary thing that I mean we're really played a lot at coyote\nJoe I was sort of a I'm On a mainstay for us so\nWhen back in I stopped playing together I had the friended I'm Michael Lewis and Dallas norm and who are in my band now and the three of us started a little\nA little things together a little thing together thing together and now he's studying it's a great that's a great name for banning ... maybe that could be a little thing together and go like that [laughter] yeah\nAs well that only about it that's how it started for me I mean until that point I had maybe done karaoke in fact I Believe you and I may have some of those nights our working at them and we only had alone than a karaoke to gather some yes to that\n... that could have happened I was curious [laughter] usually funny before we go to a break on\nYou know it's probably because they don't talk to so far on the program\nPrescott is such a vibrant music community and you have to admit I think ... shows with such\nA vehicle for all these guys that you just start with open Mike and all that stuff you know the cages doing now is whether people but you know that really was at that point in time that was the the gig place in town yet and you look at the guy that it's still playing in town we're talking Twenty years later yeah you know the ... I mean you go down the list\nYou know all these guys really not going to start down there but they got a nice you know I'm exposure so to speak I chose\nAnd I really I still miss him and Rio and actually I I think you're I think you're onto something that the majority of those guys really dead last Lyman Don cheat um gyms co bow and that's where we met my age I'm ... yeah yeah all those guys that's where we all started and and um you know now it's far from Folsom and we're all pretty much still playing\nThere so I said when we get back with a little more about what's going on about ... all your loans with Kelly on the ...\nYoung\nDon't\nSupport for the Arizona humidity radio network is provided by God it was you were just very ... stuff prepared delicious lunch or dinner Andres has exotic tapas for you're done and pleasure enjoy the heated patio\nInto full bar with happy hour weekdays fly music Thursday and friday with jazz on Sunday for reservations goals for four or five Seventy it's oh God it was ... three sixty west ... street\nJust steps from Charlotte hold museum it's beautiful don't tone presage quirky cozy and friendly pleased to meet support for ... public radio is provided by\n... and Keith cannot at the frame and I and the arts are both in the heart of historic press get the frame and I had to twenty west ... street provides high quality ... and picture framing from family photos to works of art you'll also find a fine art gallery featuring local artists in all media\nThe arch start at five thirty seven north ... is a phone line art store offering to complete selection of our materials for visual artists in both to de ... de media classes are offered at the art store I'm painting drawing sculpture ceramics kids art classes in more ... and the art store in downtown Prescott find them on line at Prescott art store dot com\nBubble radio was provided by ... yards\nTo await North Korea street in Prescott band a stage do have to wait ... street in Prescott celebrating nearly fifty years of art so to me is\n... public radio was provided by ... to a lake or Purina street in Prescott band to stage due to Eighteen or go to the street in Prescott celebrating nearly fifty years of arts at an age old image day job ever ate through the Eighteenth which the trip to bone evil\nVicious but he pointed story of missiles watch an aging widow living with her son and daughter in law you know three room flat and Houston fearing better presidents maybe an imposition\nMrs watch imagine that if she can get away and returned to her old home and the tone about evil she is certain to regain her strength dignity at peace of mind it's an amazing piece of live theater directed by ...

I did not grow up in Prescott and or Arizona and where did you grow up in New York uh upstate New York but New York state I haven't lived here for any long period of time and I think that you know\nPart of finding common ground and and also campaigning in general is listening to the people that you're trying to persuade um and hopefully finding something that you agree upon and finding shared interests and I think that that's the\nThe key um so that's what I'm trying to do I mean I again I've been here for a week and a half and I've been working really hard on the campaign so\nUh I haven't really been getting out too much yet but\nI think the focus of the campaign is to try and um appeal to people on both sides of the aisle and that includes listening to the people in this district um and finding out what their most important issues are and seeing how our values and their value is a kind of line\nLet me see you've actually been here for a bit\nLonger than a week and a house with seven and a half years ago so this this has been your landscape this is this is where you've sort of come of age and ... and how was how has it been for you are or how is it for you or or do you feel like you have different\nTools and your tool box for for being able to play well with others and to to learn from people who have they ever divergent views um yeah\nDefinitely I mean spending so much time here and you know moving out here when I was fourteen you it was it was very a very very different from upstate New York and I think that it was valuable to have that contrast\nBut um you know after the twenty sixteen election I think that one thing that really like shape my perspective was that I think that in like the most important thing is to take a motion out\nOf your political ... how do you do that\nBy focusing on I mean yes listening to people and finding practical solutions and talking about the fact\nAnd instead of you know like disliking people because they voted a certain way or because they prefer a certain party it's more about like you know listening to why they do those things and not just you know being triggered by five you know small issues and it comes\nDown to education I mean we're in a Planned Parenthood panel last week um and this woman was speaking about how she is a conservative Christian mother and she used to pick it Planned Parenthood\nAnd she used to be anti gay uh and now she is a volunteer for Planned Parenthood and she started a foundation that helps homeless are members of the algae ... community and and all she said herself it all came down to just a lack of education and a lack of understanding of\nWhat exactly she was protesting and you know I'm not saying that everyone who holds\nA views that aren't ours are just ignorant because I I think that I Am also quite unaware of a lot of the experiences of people I disagree with so I think it really does come down to education and understanding of other people's experiences\nDo you think that these same skills listening to the understanding or also useful for healing some of the divisions that have been fomenting on social media and the last couple of years is is this something that you can take to Facebook and and and and turn things around there [noise]\nUm I think so I think that left Facebook I did and um it's I've gotten I'm so glad I did and I'm not going back to it um I don't care if it's used on the campaign I'm not getting my Facebook back because\nUm I think that like Facebook and social media is home to a lot of like these bugs words kind of attention grabbing headlines um and the things that illicit emotion rather than illicit sort of greater understanding exactly and I think that like since I've been off Facebook I've spent a lot I've\nPut a lot more effort into left a lot of cat videos at the table\nWhat surfing there have been a lot of cat videos that you could have seen just cute little cats you know playing with Ducklings it probably true\nBut I see them in real life uh\nYou don't own a car on Instagram and anyway um\nI I don't know in my experience I've wasted a lot less time on the Internet and you know the things that are important to my understanding of the world still get to me I think\nAnd and I've I've put a lot more time into like you know reading articles that didn't show up on my Facebook feed and talking to people and or like to think I Do and so I think that\nUm yeah I think that a lot of the stuff on\nOn social media is really just a slam into our inflammatory yeah\nNeeds it does not need so much of our attention\nSo that he may but you you're still on Instagram it's like so so what's the difference between Facebook and Instagram explain it to a ... we ancient once so that we can understand\nWell I'm a photographer and so Instagram is all photos intermediaries streamlined um and I just love all the visuals and there are some great means um and so yeah I mean I'm not really on Instagram\nContent I'm I'm On it to see my friend's pictures I wanted to see how people are using imagery for different for different means for different reasons um\nAnd yeah there I mean there's still plenty of garbage and the and the comments if you care to read it but I think that overall it's it's a lot less\nAngry I think it was like\nSome Iranian guy was basically going to rain fire down in Israel and Israel responded the Israeli embassy in America responded by trolling them with a mean girls mean and it was the best thing ever in the entire universe it was the whole point of Twitter right there in one week I didn't hear about that but freaking brilliant\nOne of my favorite parts of political Instagram in the last year has been Pete Souza who was of Obama's she photographer\nAnd he like after the election he started strategically dropping photos exactly you've seen that yeah so he he every time you know Trump would say something inflammatory or you know derogatory about when women are for example he would post a photo of Obama\nYou know shaking hands with a woman and saying oh like he elevated her to one of the highest positions in government and he respected her [laughter]\nYou know it is time for a break okay we\nWill return shortly with Sophie ... here and she's all that\n\n\nSupport for this program is provided by Montoya wealth management of
