we leave off over there to talk about\nLike the camaraderie and support and community ball but I don't have businesses especially got over ... but there seems to be a nice\nA deal with the downside of it so you in business for Twenty one years how long have you remember the rotary I've been a member of rotary for eight years now so what I've asked you this because I'm Alive when rights aren't what made you decide to go with the not doesn't wrong with that but I'm sure it's how what was what was your brought her rotary\nWell no decisions that are made in a vacuum so a friend of mine who I had gotten donations from us for rotary over the years always pressured me to come and have breakfast that Senate primary club but and so she\nProbably five times I'm and before I joined the club so I got five free breakfast Saturday but it was her persistence that brought me and you know he's a good friend in there and that and she said you know we do fun things we really have a great time and it's true we go we sing songs were silly you know we make we joked with each other and then we do service projects where we go\nWhen we maintain the Vietnam Memorial statue on the square and you know we I donate books to the schools and we've have repaired playgrounds and done polio vaccinations in Mexico comes to ...\nPercent of rotary mhm okay that's not which one is\nJust to comment on their three originally yeah there's a frontier okay then up in Prescott so you're ... and set up your ... yeah order to the other side so what is what is the the basic modern mission of rotary\nWell rotary is founded on seven principles that to keep it short they're just very humanitarian prince cold they are interested in women's rights in education they're interested in disease prevention and sanitation education and the wellbeing and businesses around the world and they're an international organization\nFor talking about well being of businesses yeah um where do you see the future for us we're going you know in a kind of a microcosm nutshell I mean you've been here long enough now that you've seen we bolted scene ups and downs and gross and stuff like that it seems to me that the prophet downtown saying to say well what do you think about what's going on right now\nWell business in Prescott I think will remain vibrant and it's it's a tourist oriented and people come here for that and it's only getting more popular for that\nI see Prescott really leaning towards now Dorothy culture and a big wave and lots of not Rikers island's hikers and and that kind of thing and so I really see an attraction for that as well as the retirees um but people like to come here to vacation and visit and walk around the shops and they liked the quaint and this and the cuteness of the downtime\nAnd so I see it leading a lot more toward that direction\nOkay now speaking of the business grow up and when you when did you move the art store search for me it was next year there was behind you while huh so what caused you to move it over on the ...\nWell it was really a financial purpose there were other things I Can't really go into [laughter] but we\nMoved it to be a smaller footprint and you know better better rent rate and lower utilities and things but also there's a parking lot there are six street we when we were down town it was just off the street parking and even though we were right next to the parking garage and people didn't perceive that they could use that\nSo yeah and that's a constant thing it's amazing how often a parking garage it's empty yeah\nAnd it's so fabulous I mean if you can go park your car walk across\nThe wrong and you're there you don't get rained on you don't get snow down right now don't get hot in the summer and I don't get ... every once in a parking garage so which services you provide or a dark store different from the gallery at the store we sell art supplies and we have a fulltime job in by the assets on their full it's so\nCool anything you

I get access to all the time in the studio you know what made you choose this but\nI have a a good friend of mine that I've known for about Twenty years and she came to town and she lives in Wisconsin so she um she was driving through going to driving on a road trip to spring back to California brought me a would sign that said ... family establish Nineteen Ninety three\nAnd I said well gosh scary that's really cool at you know what's up with that and she says well I made it at that place that I that I manage in Wisconsin and I said well\nI'm can't really remember where you work in Wisconsin and you know I just I didn't really think about it and she said well born and bred born rich creative studio I work in Lake Geneva Wisconsin and they manage that place and we make these ... you know would signs there and\nPeople come in and classes and in groups and we paint can do this and I teach it as a you know teach everybody in a public class and this is what we do\nSo I um [noise] my eyes just that must have started rolling in the back of my head and I look I shuttle look over to my husband and he and I were both giving each other and I like we need more information on that so after a few more close\nLet's look it up online so checked out the website and everything and I said\nUm please call the founder your boss and tell her I Would like to meet with her so literally two weeks later I flew I flew out to Wisconsin and met with them um [noise] we had breakfast so over pancakes and coffee\nUm my husband and I became an owner of of a foreign breast studio in Prescott so shortly after that it just snowballs and here we are and we're training and we're going to retreat somewhere I'll finding all these oh its foreign brush with such a fund group to be involved with that we call each other family ... family there there are a lot of fun so\nI'm so we open Prescott and then maybe only six months later we decided we wanted to do a second location so we started in on our flight stuff enter and here we are I think we're pretty good stopping at two right now um\nWe had these grand ideas that we my own five you know some day but um there's at high right now I kind of\nThinking too is plenty [laughter] so um were you guys in a place in your lives were were you were ready to be small business people or were you looking for jobs that are\nWe must have been and I was I'm a manager at a dental practice at that time\nAnd just about to get you know getting ready to be an empty nester and um I thought well I Will need the distraction so I don't absolutely as like you had another small baby for real yeah hello [laughter] really time consuming expensive baby [laughter] uh so I stay all are\nSo I'm just jumped right in I mean it just sit with my personality and I thought when I left the dental practice that I Would just be so sad about not seeing our patients every day and\nUh the best part about born brushes I just met so many people and I it's filled that void that I thought it was going to have I don't have a void that at all I mean I'd meet tons of new people\nEvery week that is my favorite part is that everybody comes in and unlike working adult practice they walk in with a smile on their ... you have you be there um you know they're they've been looking forward to it they don't have to open their wallet because all of the pre registration and everything is done online ahead of time so\nThey're literally walking in with their little beverage and their friends and ready to have a blast and um you know there's no pain involved and you know no expense while you're there kind of thing so it's just all it's all countered Conrad Murray and yet very positive\nExperience do on ... ... some of us start businesses from scratch and and some of us do franchises this this is a franchise of boredom brush then you have both here and in Flagstaff um what made you do I mean it sounds like first came to brush them then came oh I'll have to franchise it in order to make this thing happened\nUm lured us so when I first met with Julie sell the the founder um we were actually we became licensees because born brush with so new that\nAll the franchise paperwork had not been processed yet so I was the twenty third location to open and certainly the farthest out west and that sort of thing so um as it evolved and then we you know bought Flagstaff shortly after Flagstaff it did become a franchise and now we're over a hundred and fifty locations and\nSo are you still license licensees or converting franchise yep and and they're on extending into Canada now which is super exciting so it sounds like you're a huge fan of company as well oh your own business hundred percent\nYeah absolutely and and I what I Love about this particular business is just the freedom I mean cause I think sometimes it's scary sounding to start your business and that whole um\nRetail hours having the door open from here to there and then you're\nYou're there and you're living it and you're babysitting and you're married to it and all that stuff I'm the best thing about born brushes that you know are open our eyes are when we're having workshops and that sort of thing totally a doable scheduled for me um I don't have to fling the door open at any certain time you know I just have to be\nThere and answering customers questions by phone or email or whatever and then obviously we're ready to rumble when ... you know in the class and guns and\nUm we get a lot of cool walked by traffic and both locations um so it's you know everybody's interested and we make a lot of noise so you make a lot of noise when they're distressing the wood and their pounding with hammers and ... and things like that\nPeople stop in their tracks you know walking around outside and they come up and stick their nose on the glass and they're like what the heck is going on in there so\nIt's a you know we we we attract a lot of attention [laughter] and it's an entire room full of women mostly I should say but we love having gentleman you know but most of the time it's just women and they are going crazy with with hammers and ... on these projects so\nThat sounds like you know much about it for fun I I was looking around the website which is bored and brush dot com forward slash Prescott if you're looking for\nThe Prescott location or fourth flashed like that that are looking for Flagstaff and and also what I thought the processes and you're correct me if I'm wrong I'm it looks like there's a calendar on the website and you go when you find\nThe day that you want and you see if the classes open and um and you just you feel in all the blanks ... pick your project and and then you you pay right there and yet and that's how you do it in my ... so so so
