I. L. E. N. A. it's so hard even you don't even know how to find out\nI was going not going to get a check to\nStart again like I Know my parents didn't do anyone anything what was it I think that uh my dad wanted to be original they made something out of the fairy land like\nPull something out of imagination goes all the family name no no I mean my last name but I wasn't\nMarty\nRight now here's a this is the first question was are real quick first things you learned me 'cause I Know was the last minute so I really would appreciate that\nWhat brings you are brought to or how did you end up in ... ah\nMy mom followed her\nCompass and just moved us after she got divorced from my dad moved from Michigan all the way to Arizona only having visited one really and took the opportunity when they got divorced a chef a lesson relocate us\nOnly goes so you were born in New born in New York New York City okay New York city I'm an island they are [laughter]\nSo you're in New York City you go to

with everything ... wants to be my number one fan right she's far to social to actually make a toll Mike\n[laughter] [laughter]\nActually shows up to every single one of them\nUh that's amazing yeah so I mean he's he's doing a month every\nWell I'm ... from Austin, Texas I'm from the area and people knew my music and they wanted me to play for them I like doing a gig\nLeast once a week then it became two gigs a week and then up until recently it was three games a week every week so I'm I'm starting to dwindle down and do just a couple of months so that I\nYou take a breath right now over inundated\nSo let's talk about this for people if they don't know who you are when you say you're doing good what's your good\nA regional music that I've written over the last ten years and years ... singer songwriters disagree because you are the uh the epitome of the singer songwriter 'cause I don't want her to do one cover and now they're going to number two than requested you do it [laughter]\nAnd so these are all stories that substance you're storyteller basically yeah and what I Love about the music I Love you I Love your side of the people they're just drawn to you there are certain people are voices that just come across the so genuine and pure an honest\nYou know what I mean I think that's what people really like about you and this dog because you're basically life first as far as I can [laughter] but you know and that but your style is really unique\nAnd it comes across as really sure that all the innocent but really pure in on us so and what I like is when you do your songs\nSince you've written I'm all for all of the way you introduce\nYou avoid a song came from so what's your favorite now what somebody wouldn't be like your favorite one you're doing right now if you can pick a song and you say like I Love the song is my favorite one I what would it be right out ponderosa pine\nBecause they came from a really sad\nPlace ... looking at somebody who\nBasically there but\nMaybe the lights were off in their eyes\nUm did drugs or depression or their own thoughts or whatever and\nNever win the bark beetle came through and it's just devastating the forest [noise] um we had a huge ponderosa pine in our backyard and\nDuring this time and a storm came ... huge like he couldn't wrap your arms right such a proper training I was a kid so [noise] um and the storm knocked the tree over because it was completely hollowed out on the inside but but looking at it you would never know until it went and fellows in fell over and I thought\nPerfect metaphor so a lot of songs kind of um like don't you care via ponderosa pine like you tell me if you need help\nWhen did you write that how old you\nThis was about three months yeah really yeah so it's really writes that when did the tree fall down oh the tree fell down in\nA decade ago was it was there was never experience do you remember that and that's ... oh yeah my ... now a feminist\nCool experience way and the cat that was a hassle\nFor my mom but for me I just got to watch but um yeah we\nActually how bizarre it was that we didn't perceive that tree is being dead right right it's kind of like people they show up\nAnd they do their jobs that were they interact with you but you have no idea what's going on inside right you know ideal extending them alive so\nGreat metaphor yeah or like cricket oriented and I ... if you're from Prescott you know the ponderosa pine ... right\nThat's great [noise] so how did you so you're in your when did you start playing a\nSixty and what bothers you about what ... what was said oh I was I play guitar\nI'm about like ed blending of I wanted to be really cool\n[laughter] I've got work on our by the way to do with your wife will let me tell you I think that the guitar I'm trying to right now um I\nThink that I felt like I wanted to say but they didn't know how to save them and singing always felt really good but it's like like when I was\nAnxious or something if you start singing a song kind of life and again I think feel better it was an exercise of energy [noise]\nSo I thought if I could play guitar\nAnd saying I can exercise on my team and\nGet on the ground chest\nWhether I set it eloquently or not but I'm just seeing\nSeeing the airlines just because they didn't really good it's cathartic because it is it yeah it is you

September ... I'll have a backpack\nAnd I don't want it more than Fifteen Eighteen pounds so I'm really looking at OK what could I use and I'll be not only during the camino so I have to do sightseeing as well so but yeah we often have my too much stuff you know\nAnd I'm really paring down I figure if I'm buying a blouse I've got to get rid of something else it's not always successful but it's but you know I have lots yeah it's getting close to don't tell me more about the trip you're taking in September [noise]\nHave you heard of Santiago to ... and I tell you the ... the mild is about ... or you just need to tell me everything okay the if you remember a Martin Sheen son did a a movie called the way anyway that they do them and just been in existence you know since at least the middle ages and coming from all over Europe\nTo Santiago de ...\nAnd it was revived I don't know a number of years ago maybe fifty years ago by a priest because a lot of these villages and northern Spain you know we are dying and people were leaving so [noise] um [noise] the main route\nGet Bob in front and crosses appear in ... and then crosses northern Spain to Santiago\nBut there are about twelve routes around Europe and they're too and in Portugal one is the central camino and another one is called the coastal come you know\nAnd I'm from Lisbon I'm not quite sure of the ... that will be leaving for Porto and it's about a hundred and fifty miles to and I've never done a hundred I mean that's done a lot of hiking but not a hundred and fifty miles you know and ... every day getting up and doing so I I don't know I'm not doing it in a\nSpiritual sense probably although there's always a spiritual component no matter what because that's the kind of trip that you're doing\nBut um so it's I Want to see how I'm going to do on a Fifteen day\nTrack and um but it's also easy because you aren't lugging tent and food and everything there enough hospitals and small hotels all along the way that and you can break stages up and everything but the research has been going well and having fun doing the research and\nCombining coastal and central a path to to Santiago\nAnd looking forward to discovering Lisbon and then part though and maybe a little better the al ... but yeah so it's a month month trip was probably about Fifteen days of of actual hiking\nFor people who hear you talking about a trip like this and do you think well I Would never be able to afford that is is this going to be enormously expensive [noise]\nYou know I don't I I have a friend I'm taking care for cats right now she's in Ireland right now but the first time I sat for her um she was doing the same job at fault the five hundred mile trying\nAnd I think I can probably do it for about fifty sixty dollars a day that and then you've got at the airfare to that and I haven't totally calculated what Lisbon and and Porto ...
