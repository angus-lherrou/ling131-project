of it over time but you don't get this thing under control\nAnd [noise] and a decrease their stressed and\nGet some of these vitamins going and hopefully we can make some headway\nDoes the overuse of antibiotics to they contribute to the proliferation of any of these other infections that we are talking about here I Know it does in terms of candy to Canada and in terms of chronic viruses\n[noise] no I don't really um I don't know what the the scientific data is on that Robert I Do know that it uh overuse of antibiotics\nCreates an environment of more resistant bacteria you know and then that's why we have\nHave to have a new generation of antibiotics and then another new ... and then they become resistant to that class and then you have to have another generation of antibiotics so we definitely have run into problems and even conventional medicine recognizes that yeah you know and has stricter guidelines for [noise]\nYou know when to use an antibiotic and children for example and that's it's cut way\nBack but\nUm I think drawing overuse of antibiotics can disrupt or even just a one time is Ken Ken distress vowing\nThat John bladder Flora and make you more vulnerable to another uh and and at least another\nBladder infection or another that generally eastern section or you know those kinds of things and as far as another a viral infection I'm not aware of that\nAnd I know that in relative to what you talked about earlier I was small and test them what was that side B you\nYeah what does that stand for it in\nA small intestine\nAll bacterial overrode that can be contributed to buy overuse of antibiotics also\n[noise] um I'm not sure that that\nIs cause all I Would have to look back on my notes that ... possible but I I I Would uh catch me with all the things I don't know here at the end Robert but um I Would guess yes but I have to double check for sure\nI was going over my list and I was thinking what can I ask tore that she won't um [laughter] whining and things aren't there are plenty of things and all of us don't know yeah yeah\nThat's what makes life interesting\nIf you're taking a an antibiotic is it a good idea to ah I'm currently be on a good ...\nYeah I I think in general that's a good rule of thumb\nI think the research shows that you get less secondary infections and less significant bowel over ... or by doing a probiotic along with an antibiotic you if you have about it\n[noise]\nThere's some research that shows are so um\n[noise] so what is it the talk about oh I Want to take it back to what we what we started in the show\nUh it seems like a just to stay on topic right there with these infections on the other kind of comic infections it's important to be doing things there are herbs like a struggle is another herbal combinations that can help build up the immune system or\nTalk about that a little bit\nThere you know in in terms of uh\nResearch topical lemon balm I understand the research for this purpose and I think even a little bit of research for at least in laboratory although they give you a topical aloe and nine point five percent cream\nTo shorten the healing time but but and that was a randomized controlled trial on Siberian in saying\nBut there are lots of traditional and I think I'm licorice and and the virus in a laboratory you you mentioned that strike so there are lots of traditional urban wear Fonda ... even though they might not have research I think there's good\nGood logic and I struggle with is one of those and murder is another one in a nation\nYeah granted ... yeah you know it's my feeling today that\nUm [noise] with many people's immune systems really suffering\nBecause of cortisol levels and because of food intake\nAnd many of the other stressors that many of us have today in life it makes sense to stay on in addition to our foods to stay on a good type of oral program with the kind of nutrients and herbs that support the immune system and support good general
