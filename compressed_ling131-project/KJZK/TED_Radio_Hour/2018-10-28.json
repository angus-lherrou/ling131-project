which has been pretty early\nCareer because it didn't take long so everybody knew him as Yogi\nWay in you know sometimes you\nHave a nickname but when you actually sign something he was signing your\nYou'll get down to Yogi Berra museum in say a a story\nMy manager says like a charge of the book but the city\nMore on values is with Brian and leave [noise]\n\nThe perfect Prescott public radio

committed to helping you invest for income and plan for peace of mind you'll find more information I'm planning your future at WWW Montoya wealth dot com [noise]\nA lot of stuff in the news is we there are as they say I'd evening cable news\nThere's a lot going on there is News New we have a lot of breaking news is there's so much breaking news I just want to be it'll turn on the show that says that doesn't have breaking news is that just want to do it regular news just you know it's good while we were going to provide that aren't we speaking of things breaking yeah they have a piece of art is broken Oh yes\nYes yes not only breaking but self destruct thinks this is really cool story\nRight it's that the banks ski painting that was just sold it said the beach and the minute it sold it but it was in title by the way a girl was balloon and submitted it sold it began to self destruct actually began to go down through the frame as if it were in a shred out the bottom and read it yeah and shredded halfway ...\nStopped halfway and I wonder if it was supposed to totally shred or was that I rented halfway I don't know it's a very elaborate frame an elaborate scheme that must have been implemented through some radio signal exactly like someone who is in the room at the time I think there's I think there's a movie here [laughter] yeah\nThere's more to this story yeah because as the onlookers are watching and imagine you just bought the painting for what a go one point something one point\nAnd yeah or or one point three seven million if you're just bought this painting and you're looking at it in the audience and all of a sudden it starts to slide down\nSo was behind glass and then it just you're right it's slid down from the frame and historical germ\nAnd it's got long yeah read it launched round shreds on it to about half of the painting and ... so the big story now is the big question is is it worth more or not and and is it truly does it truly belong to the to the buyer when the hammer came down the auctioneer said sold them\nTwenty three or whatever number that is true do you have to take\nTypically the minute the hammer goes down it's yours or is it after payment it's been made well it's usually when the hammer I Would think well you know better than this it's usually when the hammer goes down I usually say it wasn't a hammer goes down the ownership passes\nBut there is the period until this actually paid and the contractors not consummate it mhm let's actually paid for it but the auctioneer has responsibilities for reasonable care of an item time of the hammer 'til the time the buyer picks it up\nAbsolute was reasonable care taken was it something that could be anticipated by the by on a lot of questions yeah\nIt's it wouldn't be talking about the show yes we will talk about it what is there are other things that have come up a lot of things have sold for a lot of money well a bottle of scotch yeah bottle of scotch yes the bottle mckell and the holy grail of scotch whisky cells from one point one million dollars that option I think we talked about this last week with Andrew for anything about it right yeah inch and yeah\nAnd we're talking about what do you do with the one million dollar bottle of scotch you don't drink and you don't ... you keep it in a safe place 'cause it just it you look at it as money in the bank you put it away for investment purposes you don't ever think of drinking it yeah that's for sure and it was sold it bottoms auction their only twenty four bottles\nOf dismayed and each one of the\nArt of twelve twelve different pieces of art on this so they\nSo the label itself is what made it special knowledge in fact that it was a very rare\nVersion of McCalla scotch the other news this here locally here in New Jersey is that there was a theft at a liquor store you're under ... that you can't pay one point one million dollars for a bottle of scotch you go to the local liquor store and you steal fifty two thousand dollars worth of Scott yet now they\nDidn't steal cases of it there was like what four bottles or ... this was a store that had a bottle of scotch for sale at what twenty eight thousand dollar exact I don't think I've ever gone to a liquor store and seen a bottle\nOf twenty eight thousand dollar Scott no he was also I have a look for it I must admit that yeah there's also fifty year old scotch worth two twenty two thousand dollars\nAnd the bottom a calendar of sulfur Nineteen thousand dollars or was\nHe said surprising the left one on the shelf that had a retail price of forty two thousand dollars that they were cameras all over the place but apparently\nThe or the there was a couple of ... have you with a camera and they walked out with it which is really amazing\nNow and the the thing was they didn't break the class it said he lifted up the track of the class it sure lighting door you know in some way they're able to lift up there and get it off the track and then reaches hand in and get the\nThe scotch and and put it in some kind of a\nContainer to hide it yeah right and then went out the door pretty amazing and they end accordingly that now it just didn't happen to New Jersey it's happened around the states and they figure there's some kind of ring the railing another movie ... and ... roosters diamonds is a rooster humans or something like that so they're looking for him\nGot picked him up on the Internet if you're looking for and look for people to look like they're happy and they smell like scotch\nOh is that [laughter] so we don't

you probably have not been to bleak Ireland I have that\nNot been anywhere in Ireland oh okay 'cause I've been to a bleak I haven't even been to a saint Patrick's Day parade oh my God oh my so I've not been to Ireland no well believe it is a really nice part of the ... you take the tour and when you when I when I went into the uh the bleak factory they have a very nice museum right at the from\nA very very nice place very nice part of the country they're\nLinked collectible um yes and most people think of the modern bleak which again is that paper thin kind of cream color with green\nSonnet or a gift where and so if you go into an Irish shop anywhere in the world that's the type of thing they're going to be selling\nBut bleak as I said started in the Eighteen fifties and it was different was more a sick or white um and um when people collect bleak it they collect what they call the marks and they're so there's a mark on the bottom that says bleak in the early remarks were done in black\nAnd so they'll say well I have the second black mark period yeah so they're they're able to date at by that were as more of the contemporary items or the screen markets later mark\nNot quite as a valuable as the old the older pieces and apparently a lot of these porcelain and Potter east they changed their logos after a certain period of time\nAnd it helps you date than we know he's he has a good if he could be made\nBut it may just made it as a later date you know he's known based on the the logo or the marks and there's also during the Nineteen centuries America in New Jersey started American bleak\nOh yeah and it was like a precursor to the ... company a and Jersey it was a very very short period and it will be marked American ... league I saw a leak so you can differentiate the two they do not look like it all that makes sense okay I'm going to college now we go to calls right to let it go to the phones\nHere on value this with Brian Leon who is this is

museum in the world\nI guess somebody in may I have you been there for you know I have not I think you they are called ... do you think our caller from previous was given us a hard time about that just because he knew I played the banjo [laughter]\nI don't think so okay I think it's kind of neat well if you happen to the banjo museum out there you're going to you can do a live report you should

glass\nYou knew the reason I was very impressive Lisa you're going to be like are unsafe researcher now [laughter]\nAt least that leads to the horse kind of looks like a unicorn without the horn
