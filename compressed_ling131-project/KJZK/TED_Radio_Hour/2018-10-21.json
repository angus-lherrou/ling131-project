[noise] um the the ... ... when I was doing the psychological passed and collect thing I saw those two directs news one was quote a why the Snow White light a cigarette cup ... with a million dollars to the two million dollars to mobile\n... things like ... ...\n... on some of the cause of the closet calls and vintage cows are being bought a movement not swollen Raisman collecting\nGod and it was really a few people collect those things because the late ... settings on rise to the example of a guy\nThat was really and you know I mean he was he's a friend of mine but he was on the east coast of ...

I don't think I've been in the last weighed\nBut ah I've been to Scotland numerous times I Want to share this with you and with our listeners is a one time my wife and I were in Scotland in in we're somewhere between ... and I'm Inverness saw and I can't remember the town but it was out in the countryside\nAnd I'm at the time I was a member of a group called rotary and you probably have a rotary there in in town\nUm and if you're a road a row Terry and you have to then if you miss your meeting that week your local chapter meeting you have to make it up somewhere\nAnd it's nice because wherever you go in the world there's another little ... you know each city or town has a little chapter and so if they're meeting you are welcome as a row tearing and you could do a makeup\nSo I it was a we're somewhere between ... and a Inverness and I noticed um that the the rotary met there and it happened to be the same day that we were there so I told my wife I said listen let's uh they ... they have signs of course on the roadways and\nAnd it said the local rotary made a ... at this place that for dinner at a in the evening I said let's go there for supper and she said okay\nSo we showed up and it was his castle it was a magnificent private castle and we walked in and I said does the rotary major and they said yes they're they're meeting in the back\nAnd so we were directed to the back\nAnd here was this distinguished looking group of about thirty um gentleman most of them and killed ... very formal wear which was a shocking and and at one hand\nAnd so I explained who I was and I was from America and this was my wife and I'm doing a makeup and of course they make you feel very much at home and they\nHave to introduce you to the to the rest of the group and you get up and say things and and uh you know the toast you and it's it's kind of a very nice thing and uh so we're sitting there reading and it was just a lovely dinner\nAnd then usually at a rotary meeting there is a speaker and the speaker can talk about died in a local business or you know something like that and it's like a Fifteen minute a talk\nShow or the speaker phone actually okay well the speaker for the evening in a very distinguished looking quilt got up\nAnd what he did was he read a Robert Burns poetry for Fifteen minutes and it was\nStream Lee touching we had the almost the best time we'd ever had\nAnd um but but just before I left I happened to it it just suddenly dawned on me that there weren't any women in there except my wife and I know this is really weird because here in in America women are part of rotary and so I happen to say\nBy the way do you have women in your club and they said oh no no we don't have women are over here\nAt ... but they welcome my wife they never said a word about it or just made us feel a wonderful and it was one of the best remembrance is I have of out of a meeting and Scotland was was that rotary\nClub or you know the middle of the name of it [noise] no I Wish I could\nDo to come into my head was held\nThat that might be it that it was ... because I thought it began with a letter day\nOr so to me with the council yeah he's a hotel\nYeah rarely okay there we get so places you remember see you never know you never know world is small world\nI sold the minute I Will I'm speaking you look\nNice that's wonderful here we go to Scotland ... we'd have to get an invitation from somebody that we wish we could do Roadshow type that we could do do value their show they're right movie when did you do have we just need to tell you it is right yes I mean the taste or from somebody in Scotland would be a great idea\nThat there's anything really oh okay I have to deal with Andrew we want to think any of the last minute thoughts before we wrap up and go on to some calls that are waiting for us\nWell yeah it was a school in my ... ... the the us if you click on you the answer and it was\nA six year old mhm\nI'm In the hot tub and he said who's Mm and I said why do you do [laughter] and he said because I Do\nYes I Do agree with you on the subject [laughter] because I Do a\nWhy that's it right when we are so grateful to have you join us every time he joined us and we'll look forward to the next time that's Andrew ... checking in from a from across the pond as they say although I have a lot of European and uh and listeners from different continents um it's always a pleasure Andrea thank you so much\nTo enjoy that I buy my last wad Scotland\nGood that's good because I think we got an invitation you think of anything I yeah I don't know if he can send us a private jet will be okay but that would be nice to have been nicer and that's a good\nYou're talking about passionate collectors yeah you weren't right an auctioneer did you ever had situational yeah passionate collectors draw vying for the same item yes I Am I that's a good story or John ... we're auctioning something once\nAnd um it was a collection and there was this gentleman that that used to come and they would dress up and shabby clothes he had a cane and shabby clothes and you'd always sit down front like in the front row and whatever he wanted he bought it you know is this um\nAnd it wasn't until later that we discovered he actually was a lawyer his office was one Wall Street New York so pretty pretty heavy duty to have you do a lot of money and he came up the slump that he didn't want anybody to know what the wide\nYup but whatever he wanted he bought sure so um we had this one option of collectibles and um\nMy father was selling and\nWe're selling something and sure enough the guy in the front was bidding on it so we knew he was going to end up with it well the point was there was somebody in the fact that was just as a enthusiastic as the guy in front and when he discovered who was bidding on it he just kept bidding on and on and on\nSo the item that should have brought a couple of hundred dollars was now in the thousands of dollars and it was a bidding war and it had it had long since passed the value of the object know him and he was two guys battling out because they were\nEnemies handed down at some point or or so um I ... I give a lot of credit to my father who stopped the bidding\nAnd said okay I'm Sorry but something I'm is not as something not good is happening right now I think we should just a step back\nWill sell this what kind of go to remove this and we'll sell the item later I think there's too much emotion involved in this and that's the way did we set it aside he stopped that we went on and sold out of the things and later on in the day he brought it back up and one of those guys wasn't there anymore and\nUm it brought what it should have brought but it was on one hand it's an option your dream\nTo have two people bidding on something that just want it you know nature center and the other hand there was there was definitely something that was ugly about the situation and it was an ...\nYou didn't want to make sure it's yeah it's always something it's up to the auction you to really kind of getting the land the land at now obviously it happens all the time in every auction there's going to be people that are", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Kingman", "day": "21"}
