news news about\nFakes okay alright okay foreigner fifty million dollar counterfeit ring bust is one of the largest in New York City history this happened not too long ago\nAnd a homeland security and agents I homeland security investigations and I'm I'm I'm a New York city and YPG has buffet counterfeit right now what were what were the people counterfeiting they well they were we're not sure if these people actually did the counterfeiting or they were the ones who just sell the audience but okay you know\nAnd it's usually high end clothing or accessories like bags handbags\nAnd shoot ... clothing ... fashion items where you know when I was coached by a coach by myself for six hundred dollars or over such bank myself for twelve hundred dollars a three thousand dollars or whatever they knock those off because they're fairly easy to knock off\nAnd there's a huge profit margin on ... ... even if they're selling for twenty percent of the retail price they're still making a lot of money\nAnd and in some cases they're you know they may be made overseas or they may be made in this country too but there's a lot of stuff literally billions of dollars every year get smuggled into this country ... years\nAgo it particularly in sports memorabilia was operation bullpen that writing Yeah Yup ... sting operation and\nIt was basically not based on items that were coming into the EU to the United states but in terms that were sports memorabilia that were fake right workout legitimate and what they appear to be yes yeah and their conclusion was something like I mean was it as high as like Ninety\nPres yeah between eighty and actually the FBI agent that we work with said it was eighty percent\nI Believe the percentage is even higher than Ninety percent of all sports memorabilia and the market autographed sportsmen with the on the market today is not as likely sock right might be a clubhouse bombing signed by uh uh someone in the clubhouse a manager a bad boy or something or done to specifically do the public in\nA white now now forgeries or you wonder when it comes to fashion like women's handbag\n... watches and things of that they sure have such a very high retail level mhm\nAnd and you're buying them on the streets you know in in a metropolitan city uh you're buying them on the street at a fraction a at a fraction of what it would cost for a a low in competitor exactly so\nYou're getting this that and it has what appears to be the look real mhm but you're not paying anywhere near the bride and they're\nPretty good and you wonder I mean so people are buying these things are part of the problem as well so people weren't buying him he didn't go down a back alley somewhere someone open up his jacket and have thirty watches run up going up his sleeve you know they're not Rolex watches people really know that\nAnd if they if you don't know that and they put a real then they think they're hot so you shouldn't be doing that any way and I want to hear a lecture people and it's kind of stuff but but this creates a problem for every body when\n... it creates the problem a generation down the road what happens Thirty years later forty years later these things have all been absorbed into the market\nThey've been passed on from one to another now they have a history they have a provenance yeah oh yeah my father had that one it was whatever and this then develops I'm kind\nOf a smoke screen so that it it it ends more credibility and believed that the I Am is worth more than it really is right right and it puts the onus on people like appraisers yeah but we have to look at items and go\nTo the you know and\nI think about the the items that we see um can we say that maybe a quarter or a fifth of all items that we see are not legitimate short that might be vacant I'm thinking the numbers getting at that point you know\nAnd when the when our customs and border protection people or homeland security investigations gets involved and they see this stuff appraises get involved\nAnd authentic ... get involved in say are these ... are they not if they're not genuine they get crushed are burned or shredded if their watch as they get rolled over what is the roller if their bags or clothing they get incinerated or shredded um but if you don't know that\nPeople could be strengthened some genuine stuff out there and letting counterfeit stuff get out into the market as well but if you're buying a year is at fault as a people who are trying to smuggle in\nNow ... so if you have something like that and you're on shore or ... you try to get into praise and now we don't know there are tips\nBut there's also comes into issues with other their cars that are already on Soul Train 'em so there\nThere is like I'm a group like a really famous group that I it's a fictional group they're called the ... pretty much looks up to them she watches them dance all the time on the show and when she meets them she has a she has a negative and counsel with them\nBased on the fact that she's not black I'm One of those things where they were like hey listen this is our show\nYou know we worked hard to get here and you don't belong here\nSo she kinda caught in this really weird place where it's like you know her parents feel like she doesn't belong because she doesn't act like\nThey think she should act and then there are other people that she wants to be around who feel like she doesn't belong I'm simply because she doesn't look like them um and I did it that way because I thought it would be a lot more interesting when I first had the idea of the show you know I was going to play the lead and it was going to be about me and I was like well you know what that\nIt could be a little more interesting than that I feel like all all black girls in the seventies probably wanted to be on Soul Train so I wanted to add a different spin to it um so that's why I decided to make her um you know I decided to make her of a different culture and um I think that added another dynamic to the film itself\nI think it was really interesting too and I had an opportunity to see that portion of the filming and and the idea that discrimination comes from all different places from all different backgrounds from all different races all different cultures it's not just one in particular and I thought that was really powerful that where you you portrayed that portrayed and in the movie yeah thank\nYou thank you know you obviously then since his from the seventies you obviously have seven to use music and that there will be of seventies dress closing were in the movie was your was your furniture and fixtures and seeing the props from the seventies it made it look very Seventy years from now how did you give them\nYes so the pops and the wardrobe all that was very very important so there are a particular scene where certain like I have to have a typewriter and you know I have to have a certain type of phone so you know I hired a set designer and she and I work closely together\nOn a small budget you know so we would just visited a lot of um thrift stores and secondhand stores like down\nTo the lower east side just to try to find certain things um and even for you know the Filipino culture with doing research there are certain there is like I'm a big boon in uh Fort fixture fixture that I'm a lot of Filipino families had\nIn their kitchen and I just so happened to be at a bar like right by my house called Harlem Nights and I looked up and there was this huge fork in this huge boom hanging up there and I was like oh my God I Need that for my film\nThere [laughter] and so I like to see what she meant\n[laughter] is there any way or know what you're talking about all this good for\nMy film and they were looking at me like you want to borrow the\nWork that we have in my wallet [laughter]\nLike yeah you know I I'll pay for it or you know just just how and they're looking at me like I'm Crazy and I knew that they probably were like okay this girl she's drunk she's looking just put me in contact with the owner and let me speak with him so I spoke with him and he didn't stars me just I'd have to pay you know just like a little down payment fee but I got that feedback you know when our brought the\nPictures back you know on\nUnscathed and they were perfectly fine so I'm cool yeah different things like that and it was it was tough because you know do those ... their expenses inches proper definitely expensive so I did the best that I could and even a there's a scene with a college professor the first scene that opens up the movie and you know just making saw her desk looks Seventy\nBecause I didn't you know I didn't even realize it but the places that I was picking my director was rights with his table doesn't work does or doesn't work for Wal doesn't work there's you know and it was just like everything didn't work so it was tough and you know at one point I was like I think I'm a little in over my head\nIt wasn't alive in the seventies either\nSo I'm just I don't know I only I have my research yeah I'm going off of what I see on Google so in my director\nWas only ... I Hope that's not it said nope not at all that's too funny hey look you shouldn't tell we're going up against a break here can you stay with us on the other side was talk a little more about the movie in a little bit about what you thought was most exciting about the seventies even though you weren't there [laughter]\nAll right and when we come back we got more with Sean how Maurice talking about ... and her work in the world of a movie TV and entertainment\n[noise]\nYou're listening to value this was right in ...
