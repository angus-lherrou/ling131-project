Montoya wealth dot com\n[noise] jumped favorite baseball player ... absolutely no yeah who would that be Mickey Mantle Mickey Mantle\nNumber seven numbers says I used to back when I played baseball yeah I Am ... his swing oh really both right handed and left him do use it you know yes I did I hear you it it did fine I was on drugs and he did [laughter]\nBut no everything was number seven so I really my favorite number wow every player now I'm sure I had his cards yeah which I don't have any more now I Know a\nReally but no he was he was my favorite and ease everybody's favorite because his card is worth is hot hot hot it is worth more than almost all the other guards when a when a baseball\nPlayer begins and he manages to make it to the majors um the major baseball card companies will create or take a photo or get an image of him and create a baseball card and the first year that during the majors they call that\nHis rookie year or her ... year depending upon who's playing and and that rookie card is usually in the most valuable of all the baseball cards\nThat particular player because it's a first year that came out is that you write and after the people the first year when it comes to no one knows who they are and so if you're training them as a kid\n... those cards are not worth anything they're the only thing I Know they're always the way are the ones you flip to your by the motorcycle saying you really do get rid of him mhm yeah today\nIs different because we buy year packs and they buy year pack on in in the field right and they put them away hoping that in Twenty years when they open them there'll be one or two rookie card narrow someone who became very faint post back then they didn't do that and so the chances of finding an a\nParticularly in good condition yes that's the key you know there were no I didn't clip it on your bike you didn't mess around with it mhm oh yeah ... is pretty pretty rare now so one sold right this\nPast year and we're talking about Nineteen fifty two was ... and you also you're alive and I was a while so gun looked at that so Mickey males rookie year\nAnd two sports car companies rented number two major sports companies one was tops the other was Bowman beer WMA Bowman says there were two cards now Bowman how to Mickey Mantle rookie card as well\nBut for some reason that didn't take off or become as collectible as the Nineteen fifty two tops Mickey Mouse card\nAnd heritage auction one of the auction houses that are based in Texas sold one for and it's all for two point eight million dollars which is a world record for Mickey Mantle baseball card in human condition and when we talk about ... what do we when we talk about ... what are we talking about\nMen is like brand new like you you just get it out of the bubble gum ... yeah I Know it hasn't been touched by human hands and it's centered nicely immuno et cetera\nSo no rounded corners no fuzzy corners of Scott's no scrapes know signatures on it\nAnd this year in Nineteen fifty two tops had a it was it with his bad on his shoulder had the Yankees logo had his name in like a little Freeman below it hey it looks like it's taking a trip to Iran and had a a signature looked like that's the one you want to look for and apparently somebody found one not to uh\nNot too long ago um\nAnd two brothers found it and they ended up putting it in an auction and it turned out to be in a really great shape but even in rough shape these things can be worth tens of thousands of dollars well what's really what they're saying\nNow is they're estimating that there are three grade ten out there okay ten is the highest of higher and higher ... and they're saying they think there might be ten or those three that are ten and a nine BSA nine brought a to point eight million\nThere thinking the sky's the limit for\nThe for the times for those three yeah those integrating there are different grading companies um and again they track their cards that have come their way so they know how many they graded and they usually make that information available they don't make information bills to who owns it and how long has been or or any of those kinds of things to\nThe news story was that they may be worth up to ten million dollars each very interested outside a lot of money for baseball I not that many years ago there were even close to that too right now and now here's the thing is it's because Mickey Mantle in in my generation that's that that's a generation is buying them\nRight yeah no I think our generation is going to be done soon that I wrote cause I'm over the hill\nYou know the the collectors are going to be over the hill and I'm Wondering if that means the card is eventually going to peak and go over the hill\nOr will it become an iconic investment\nThat has nothing to do with ... and somebody buying it doesn't know anything about Mickey Mantle they just started it's a good investment that's right like buying a bind a stocker taping taking a leap on my patio or something like that uh we'll find out there'll be more news in the future will do sounds great okay let's get there so real already here we go\nSupport for

I don't think it takes on she saw it originally and I think when it first came in but I but not the sketch fencing though she hasn't seen the sketch yeah\nBut um you know I think that's unfortunate I found one too I bought a painting at auction and I had taken at home and\nIt was cleaning it taking it out from the frame and they're in the painting itself was in front of another painting it was a half and so I took the one paying out and the other painting I really liked and it was actually more ... worth more than the first one and it wasn't signed but it was a a folk ... and\nUm that was nice it was a nice surprise and it was worth more than what I paid for the other but we're not talking a lot of money so unfortunately I don't think you have enough here to go to Italy [laughter] okay well\nI appreciate your expertise in your house you can look out so unhappy with that\nIs that we had to go look I'm eating so so which side you have facing out uh the girl\nThe girl you know it yet because that's the classical scene and and yeah and you'll just have to find out how we signed his name and be able to sign that on the bottom lower right maybe that'll help out I don't know I'm\nGonna I'm gonna look more closely I ... and then from\nThere you go if we find anything else that will let you know to but if you come up with anything gives the holler back already okay and I'm like okay All right like much enjoy the rest of your lunch Bye bye thank you [laughter] and we go beyond the bearer of bad\nShe's you know some day I Want to be able to say\nHere like the greenery per ... of of antiques and collect green refer agree the grim reaper\nI Know [laughter] you know and I like to tell people that I don't tell people how much it's worth I tell people how little it's worth yeah that's true and I don't like doing that high end that's what happens is but you're that you're a ...\nSome day we're going to say wait a minute you've got a million dollar piece there that if I did this with a with a a a famous painting or just the other day and and the people just couldn't believe that it wasn't worth a hundred thousand dollars or so you know what about the signature what about that signature what about what maybe they could have what if maybe now you didn't sorry yeah well you know and\nLet's face it on all of the antique shows the ones in television and their daddy is is that you are seeing such a small fraction of what has been seen absolute ... van yeah ... I mean there could have been\nFive thousand people and ten thousand objects that that is that's very and you get ten of them get shown on\nTV and they're going to be the big money when there's a big money women's how long would that show live last any of those shows last as long as that\nAnd it's not worth anything that's reproduction a good idea how many times can you watch people cry [laughter]\nThat you say we we don't hear people cry no that's not really go after Johnny disconnects I thought was oh bad can I say well if they tell you these days are gone and I'm Glad you have a lovely day\n[laughter] great but it just goes to the point is that\nThey're finding a treasure is possible but it's a needle in a haystack that's very good at the percentages are very low of getting a super duper item you know ... ... oh yeah ... million dollar piece he's still there yeah and I think it's a service to be able to tell people listen to this really is what it's worth\nSo you don't have any illusions are to delusional out what you might think you know it is yeah so I ...\nA long since\nI've flown since forgotten about trying to surprise people was good yeah that's true and I'll tell you there's a story that goes with that um [noise]\nI was asked to do an appraisal once I was flown down to Bentonville, Arkansas on a job yeah OK because there was an estate down there it happened to be one of the richest men in the world right yeah and they said would you come down here to do the appraisal\nAnd I said certainly you know I'll go in there\nAnd so they flew me down and took care of you know and put me up with a nice hotel in a limo and all this stuff could cause of the name mhm so I finally went to the house the next day\nIt was gorgeous house it was like a Frank Lloyd Wright house over water you know like oh yeah sure it was a beautiful house and one of the house and it was stuff I Would I see every day I mean yeah ... stuff nothing out of the ordinary while it was just common everyday items very comfortable I mean are very very modest mhm\nAnd so instead of taking a week to appraise all these treasures the appraisal took less than a day I see you know we had a little disappointed 'cause now I have to come back home or you know and and do regular work really and when I did the appraisal I did it this way if it were loads of money and you're right yeah yeah and and Senate in\nAnd put the total was so low I mean it was and I thought I didn't understand it so I finally I I called the executor and I said listen\nNo offense but I don't understand why you got me\nFraser's in Arkansas now I Know we're all do you have to come and get me in may and the expense to come down\nAnd he said well that's why we got you a she said we needed someone of the highest caliber to come do this because we knew the state would red flag the IRS\nAnd they would expect a pedal on our suspected to be a million dollars and we knew it wasn't worth that much we wanted it but we wanted to make sure it was done right or we could have got someone locally\nWay they they'll believe ya mhm so I was hired not to prove how much the items worth I was hired to prove how little it was worth that's very inch which really shattered my ego", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Kingman", "day": "14"}
