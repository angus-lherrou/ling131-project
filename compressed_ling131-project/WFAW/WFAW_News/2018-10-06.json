time with each other on creative issues and uh taking a look at each other's new works as we work on those and develop them and then we plan and developed for shows such as something coming one [noise]\nSo it gives us an opportunity to come together as a group of artist and and uh pursue or creative interests individually but bring it together as a group\nPhoto view on the back of the uh a card here for the show your looks like you're having waste much fun for artists [noise] well\nThat's the whole idea of this and other rivers to have fun together uh and pursue or various creative interests\nThere's also a three about age difference a picture of paintings on the on the cars here is that one from one for each artist yes they\nAre some very interesting stuff I Can't wait to see this stuff oh I'm the shows let's get the specifics that that'll be the uh whitewater uh Arts Center opens when\nThe uh shows up now with the formal opening as this coming Sunday\nVia reception you'll all be there yes yes\nOkay and um refreshments\nYes they're already there'll be fewer refreshments\nThey do well is that yes um and talking to be a voucher work of\nThe questions we'll all be available for that purpose and and that's one of the things that's nice about an opening a reception that gives us an opportunity to see artist to interface with the people who love art and I've come to view arts and gives us an opportunity to have some some good discussion about our work\nAnd be from one to three correct and\nLet's talk a little bit uh about what each of you are doing drawn start with you\nI'm primarily my focus on is landscape um which one of these is yours the tree the honor of trees as much yes got to have a lot of work on\nIt is my primary medium I work in his water color but I also do some work in abstract clash um um my work tends to be um\nLandscape are are just some natural settings um I like to think that when everything is crazy um you can look at the painting and jump in and relax\nOK [laughter] we all need a break these days are more so in all the time a good idea how many pieces are you going to and\nI have twenty five you know kinda show excellent Tom ah which one's yours\nMine is in the lower left and it's\nA sea scapegoat landscape peace\nSo my general focus is to him and that's a new painting for the ... year old so then I have it All right uh other than on the card their\nUh with my eyes were my focus is to try and capture a moment in time so I Try to do that and and sometimes they're landscapes sometimes or\nSituations involving wildlife for animals or sometimes a Cajun or their four oh pieces\nBut I Try to capture a moment in time or that I have seen and\nAnd the record either as water color oil or acrylic\nPaints Sylvia what's wrong the surfer his mind\nYour the big cohort on here I guess All right okay I was wondering\nWho's a who's that was that was the would be one of the guns with a\n... and the reason for that is\nThat [noise]\nUm I I think I play with art more than these two gentlemen do they both have their style and their media and they know what they're doing I'm the one who\nDoes art in order to maintain my sanity and I have fun and so I keep trying new I'm a new medium maybe acrylic pours maybe alcohol ... maybe water caller\nAnd this surfer was one that was the first one I tried with on a new technique where you don't even use a brush you pour the paint onto the canvas and then you tip the canvas and you blow on it and things like that and it happened\nIn who made this picture that way yes yes no brush ever touched the canvas\nUm Jackson Pollock never did anything like that [laughter] yes well I never saw the painting from a Jackson Pollock got for his either as well [laughter]\nSomebody's off or do anything in the seven figures not not yet no guarantee type this show I figure that will happen while I was young I think if they knew how you did is to be up to a prize [laughter]\nWell you know after I had poured the paint on and everything and tempting blowing on it and all that looked like waves I hadn't intended it to be necessarily that but then it needed a surfer so that\nSo you had no idea what was going to be you know if you know well let's see what I got here\nThat's right yes while he needs to a gentleman plan their paintings and do a beautiful job\nFor just about everybody kind of plans or painting or Joe the first one I've ever heard of that did it this way yes well that's probably true [laughter] ... it looks like a beautiful picture to I'll have to see a

Cooper had\nThat job to pull off playing a rock star and a star is born yes there's been another version of a star is born a Lady Gaga was still amazed to watch the transformation\nOf Bradley Cooper turning into this rock star Lady Gaga says she saw Cooper turned into a musician in his own right not just as his portrayal of Jackson made in the film she says the music team was working on a song in the studio and Kuiper came in and said that's not Jackson sound\nThat's not what Jackson sounds like she says she knew right away oh yeah I've got a musician on my hands a star is born is in theaters now and I believe that came out just yesterday on friday a new\nVersion of a star is born last what was done in the seventies with Barbara Streisand and\nChris Christopher say I do not remember the one in the fifties and there was actually the very first one from I\nThink the mid thirties while ago so this is the fourth yeah this is the fourth time the story's been told yeah or it's going to have a more modern take right then the Nineteen Seventy six version which probably had the most modern take of all three at the time but this one\nBrand new I Believe this is Bradley Cooper his debut as a director oh I didn't know he says his film yeah for the most part this has been his project to all the way\nWow I uh I gotta admit Lady Gaga is a good as in you know in a film and TV actress I actually liked seeing her and stuff and Bradley Cooper as well I'm not a big uh it's about country right their country people\nAre I Would say it's ... it's the modern country so yeah it's like country rocket\nThere's yeah I'm not a big fan of ballots still have ballads in there too that's true yeah but\nUh I I Would like to go see it I Would like to take my wife I'd like to see if the musicianship of it all I Am you'd probably like\nThe whole love story of at all if I Believe it's a love story right yeah I like pretty positive it's it's summer and there was a love story\nYeah I'm not in your country fan but it would be a it's always cool to see a actors doing musical stuff especially when they're good at it mhm\nAnd he apparently Bradley Cooper is pretty committed to it and he then yeah it sounds like it and like she said he transformed right in front of her friends or just regular guy that she knows no we don't consider him a regular guy ... ... is really a professional\nActor but right but she says that yeah you sounded like he\nDefinitely has a vision for what he wants\nYeah yeah and the one clip that I did I Would agree with you I'm Lady Gaga one clip that I did see with her I\nI actually saw the clip with the sound down I was in the other studio doing my other show and I saw a clip of the sound down and I was just\nActually I was pretty amazed by her reactions ... you know what she was just having a ... a conversation with the other actor in the film right and then I saw the next scene with the sound up and I I was more blown away by how physical she is yeah I was fine her dialogue was\nFine but she had all the the movements down right right it was very good at that\nYeah and it's I like seeing her a ... you know it's no ill they know that but as a as a normal person you know plane plane that kind of character just because she's so theatrical and her in her ... her son I it's interesting to see her just plain like you\nKnow just a person just a regular person right and a\nFairly she nearly she's a song writer in the film rabbit she doesn't she's not brave enough to take on the actual lead singing herself right she's a song writer but she doesn't want to be in the spotlight but rarely Cooper's character Jackson, Maine brings her out to the spotlight I think that's the whole idea from star is born I could be totally wrong

kind of public typical of what you've seen with ... quarterback for the past but I think the real key is going to be what I was able to do all sensibly against the war heartbeat that today\nYou know you ask how she was put together some really um potent defenses over the last several seasons and while they're working some new faces into the office of side of the ball you know ... is there still some pretty strong defenders on that side Gary\nAbsolutely pretty safe they call you order he's a three year starter he's had just an outstanding start the season uh twenty nine ... leads a team foreigner exceptions\nHe's got four capitals for a walk as well we've also got an ice linebacker and Derek Jennings who is also had a very very good start because the season as well so they've got a good solid defense and we knew that that was going to be their strong suit\nComing into the season so it's going to be interesting to see what our game plan will be against their defense or last year\nOr even though we live for the ball game uh thirty seven twenty we actually got within three points to twenty three twenty early in the second half but then I was able to put two touchdowns up
