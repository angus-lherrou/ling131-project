delighted to have you uh what specifically are you going to be doing Saturday Saturday the twenty twenty seven yeah\nWell following the tragedy at Sandy Hook with the a little over five and a half years ago when I lost my six year old son\nI decided to be part of the solution to the issues on that we're experiencing in schools and that translate then out into society and I realized very quickly that that was more than just violence\nWe have a mental illness epidemic we have a substance abuse epidemic um\nBullying is actually increasing despite our best effort a and and other suicide and depression uh and so I started researching solutions and I came upon\nSomething that's been around for decades and actually has decades of scientific research and it's called social and emotional learning\nAnd uh so I have incorporated social emotional learning into a program odd that is pre K through twelfth grade right now it's available on our website at no cost and so on this program actually teaches\nKids how to connect on a deep and meaningful level I and not just kept away all of us\nOn it teaches how to manage our emotions skills and tools for resilience how to manage conflict and die and it makes common sense but also research has shown that our children and adults by the way that have these skills and tools um are that\nHave more meaningful and purpose filled live and they have actually a last instances of anger and violence and mental illness and substance abuse the pro active preventative approach\nAnd that and so I'm so excited to come and share that with your congregation ...\nThank you thank you should mention to there is a free and open to the public um the keynote address that a scarlet is going to be offering and that will be at three o'clock and it

concern\nYes you are I'm you can also add that these young people and people who think this way or a need more fulfilling lives are happier\nIt's true you know the interesting thing is we're all connected as human beings I mean uh\nSome of us a look at perceived differences we have perceived differences between us\nHowever we're all the same in the want and need to love and be log that is something that connects us all human beings regardless of age or religion or non religion or or or where we live\nIn the world where all the same in that and on this program called the shoes of enrichment program actually teaches us how to choose\nLove for ourselves in any situation are circumstances very empowering\nAnd of course in a in that situation or an interaction when you choose kindness carrying concerned compassion or choose love to to respond with love you are taking your personal power back and it feels good when you react with anger hatred and resentment\nYou're giving your personal power away becoming a victim and of course I feel bad and that and so we teach a formula that helps a everyone\nShe lives in any situation and it's a formula that I live my life by that has a really helped me so fundamentally\nFollowing the murder of my six year old son Jesse and die in a in a message that I've been spreading throughout the world really and ah to every kind of audience you could possibly imagine and it is derived from a message that Jesse left on our kitchen chalkboard shortly\nBefore he wrote this message shortly before he was murdered and die he wrote these three words nurturing healing lots\nAnd this was something I found a after the tragedy um and it really was a course those three words aren't something a six year old with normally\nThey were phonetically sell because he was in first grade them [laughter] um but uh it was it was very comforting more ah his family\nBut I also realize this is where we need to turn in order to survive and thrive and I realized that if the shooter which was a former student at Sandy Hook elementary school have been able to give and receive nurturing healing loves\nThe tragedy would never happen would never have happened it was pretty simple and\nSo I I basically dedicated the rest of my life to spreading the message I quit my job and went on the road and so I'm really excited to share it at a at
