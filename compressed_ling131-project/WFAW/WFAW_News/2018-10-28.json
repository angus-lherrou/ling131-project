thing because he said that Kavanaugh was not\nA fair because of the out first and they wait conducted himself his performance ... and ah the hearings well you know a A R I don't know it was carved into every a court room with a capital\nThan in all the decisions he made obviously are using one thing you see what I mean\nHe is using one thing and and again I'm I'm curious how Jimmy Carter would react if such charges have been thrown at him I've interviewed Carter so I don't even have to to ask that a rhetorical question I Know how we would react he would react\nUh very intensely he would probably out Kavanaugh Kavanaugh in that regard not to mention a although we we should in this context the Kavanaugh rode\nAn apology that appeared in the op ed pages of the wall Street Journal saying that if he went overboard that he apologized for that so [noise] yeah I I guess I must say I I put Jimmy Carter in the category of ah\nWho cares quite frankly I don't I consider him a has been to some

just half followers\nOh they do that and and and I'm sure that you're correct I mean the problem I have is merely the fact that there are a lot of people who may very well form an opinion based on what some celebrity says and then that's the part with which I differ\nOr that they both have the right to speak out oh without question without question the great\nGreat great but I think yeah and then like I said that you know like I I rarely get respect you sell a lot and then again I think that I think I guess trying to reach all their followers and it's just trying to get them out there now\nThat that ... in which case ... together because as I say I firmly believe that each of them\nProbably injured their career to a certain extent so if in fact it was that al ... a boy when you

responsibility when they get to a certain point of saying that they\nThey're saying to get into politics that's one thing where there are actually active in politics when you have so many years the

consequences are us feel that that's a long way to use you're saying\nYeah I I again uh\nI I think what they have to say and how they say both both does a couch a very much um so I see what you're saying and and the the act the way the circumstance is good for them back in the moment\nNot automatically know it certainly does it\nBut when they call it they're out and of course a lot of them are

she\nShe recognizes as a as dirty Harry Collins said a man or a woman's got annoys limitations and I think she's much better as a as a media communicated than necessarily as a candidate but I think

gross cause a lot of uh what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say uh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it is going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states um flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming seasons going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it is going to be\nExact we're for those who say well uh I was ... last year I was vaccinated employees or dream that somebody may need to realize that as a a flu virus was a very sneaky food which keeps changing on his\nYeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change on flu viruses change constantly um and\nThat's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season into the next the vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be the thing that we're going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year\nLet's look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nYes so last season the two thousand Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's through your seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand deaths um we had\nOne hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season and one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um the activity was very sustained across the country for\nMany weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one um\nAll of that said we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're gonna see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant above flu and values that the older and younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely to develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have debts and those are the very youngest in the very oldest um\nThose under five years of age particularly under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nUm all that said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with some chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill and even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm\nEven previously healthy people young adults can get severely ill children who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs we're more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this year on the two basic types if he\nWanted to divide them into two broad categories are we have flu shots and then we have um the nasal spray vaccine shots are given with a needle generally and they are made either with no virus at all or with virus that's been an activated and killed so it can cause disease\nAnd then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't\nMultiply enough to cause any disease\nOf course most of us are not at all confident to make that choice ah ah other than the cost factor and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on those which one was more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer because I'm ... one of the\nMany things that very about flu is vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and that can depend on the person they're age their health status how good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another\nOn for the most important thing people can do is talk to their health care provider about what vaccines they have available and they can help

Greene thanks so people are a little less than\n... than after ... they have to go to their Kansas native cream thing just out of course you can be happy with our but he is I Would say that one\nStory broke gets ... they're not doing that at ... I Believe that aired and they're finding that wasn't that I feel like a fall out later that Afghanistan is occurring\nA damn thing I really am right now or\nWell it is it is very unfortunate I was wondering do you have anything to to say in regard to the specific topic of the rest of the suspect in the uh the uh the only bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has always been I don't know if it's true is and how they stay clear Wyoming to me that's why people in their faith than had been ongoing arrests factory\nIn healthy people arrested for twenty per cent therapy than out on the street I guess that's the ...\n[noise] uh\nYes it is for black ... me as well of course obviously you can be arrested to many many many times a\nAnd a convictions or or what would matter in terms of ah of any ah what amounts to prior restraint but uh see what you're saying that yes obviously something that needs to be done in the in this regard I Would thoroughly concur\nOleg ... calls in from Philadelphia tonight for the good evening on land [laughter]\n[noise] anyway yeah\nAnd what's on your mind is a hard time because I saw was I got up on what you're saying where laws and you know a person can only got so many chances I was also looking at it\nFrom my mother proactive and go where we have a problem with the healthcare system in this country especially compared to other developed countries\nAnd I think the CEOs of mental health is even more under served in the medical field in general and so maybe after somebody goes then somebody times yeah they must be on probation they put people on parole maybe they could have a thing\nWhere they uh put people on mental probation where they they go to a specialist mental health professional\nAnd they got to help and maybe if\nI got I think what's more acceptable at first place that person would never get\nTo the way in their minds when they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money mental health professionals are expensive that's one part of it but then we have things like that and how much money was spent by the FBI on this investigation\nThat the financial part of it and then from the other side as a mental health professional is able to help somebody I'm prevent that kind of thing from happening on the first place\nThat's just priceless especially if the you know especially somebody could be better building these bombs and they\nI Would I say get lucky they\nAlso go undetected I something actually happens and people get hurt and prevent something like that with a little bit of a best friend is definitely something I see is priceless\nWell somebody that I Would agree that certainly to the extent that in fact we are able to be so proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health and science down to ... to such that we can offer treatment of give but let's say a\nA Seventy percent chance that we've a fixture you're a defect the brain but a yes or the short answer is we do need more resources in terms of mental health and maybe some kind of a\nIf you will mental health probation might be at least something worth pursuing

that pressure point is for him to pass the government had to put it in that in the fish will request\nFor military assistance on their southern border that way you could send troops to their southern border with\nMexico southern border yeah\nWell first of all I\nMexico should be doing their job on their border that's number one and number two I don't know that that we need the opposite where there are quite capable of guarding that border is a proven over the years and suddenly decided to their advantage to let people through but it's not as though they're capable\nOf defending that border they have done so very effectively over the years and they have suddenly stopped which for whatever reason there's a new a new president in the in Mexico city\nAh if I thought that that would make a difference and there was no other way to do it I could go along with that idea David but honestly I don't I don't think that it's necessary to do that and I do believe that that's the appropriate way to go\nAnyway ah by the way I almost to was in the visiting your good friends village Joel on the double duty you end this past mourning but at the time was having a dental problems so it was unable to make the trip ... in a moment\nUm our country are encouraging these people to come forward um they had people who are encouraging each and it's all about getting more votes for the Democrats and

people\nThey organized and is paying for it who I mean how how are these people eating our they sleeping our they go into the bathroom I mean that's a lot of people\nYeah whereas the expos they on the leadership of this group who's paying now it seems to me if somebody could figure that out which I Would think that our government's already looking into this\nThat that would disclose the true nature of what why this thing is happening like you know figuring out who's in charge and who's paying them your problem it\nYes I think the the there's absolutely a somewhat behind this ah if it is a a a a
