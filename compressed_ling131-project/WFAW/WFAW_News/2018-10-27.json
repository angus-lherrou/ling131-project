Illinois forty nine to twenty last week behind a good defense of effort and the strong rushing attack on one two punch of Jonathan Taylor Taiwan deal with too much\nI guess what I really enjoy watching was Wisconsin to ah forcing five first half turnovers Illinois had committed just five turnovers in their first six games there by no means a great football program\nBut they had taken care of the ball in Wisconsin completely changed ... ... ah this past weekend\nI think the badges it was a one scoring game of fourteen to seven and then the ... really started taking the by the way there was a formal there was an interception there were couple just back to back to back and it was a dominant performance obviously when you're able to run the ball with Jonathan Taylor and Taiwan deal both going over a hundred yards\nA the ball control off ... kind of just\nRan Illinois away so um it's what you expect to see from the badgers and the defense is again what surprised\nI Will not really surprise it's just a dominant performance we know what the ... the offense is able to do a obviously they were playing with South Dakota Dixon too so uh some younger guys in the secondary getting some opportunities supply in this one\nWell what the ... defense is able to do a obviously they were playing with South Dakota diction too so uh some younger guys in secondary getting some opportunities to play in this one and we'll see what they're able to do against north western team that is obviously a little more ... this is a little stronger on the offices out of the\nBall definitely so I'm probably the name that came up the most or this week is Alex ... for a hundred and eighty eight yards three touchdowns in two interceptions last week but his status for today is still questionable as used bending the concussion protocol\nUm again today's game against north western kicking off at eleven o'clock so we'll have a decision here shortly um\nIf Tony ... can't go in software quarterback jak cone will take these steps are\nAnd I guess part of me is curious to see what Cohn can do but with so much I'm Still at stake for this season I I'm not quite ready to pull the plug on hardy Brooke quite yet where are you on the on the quarterback situation for the badgers\nI think horny Brooks the right guy to go with when healthy um obviously if he's not able to go today you have to go with someone else but\nI think in the long term for the rest of the season you got to stick with him he's\nGotten the badgers to this point he's been a ... salad quarterback I'm leaving the team obviously that Orange Bowl victory last year's his standout performance so he's done that for Wisconsin I think you ride with him\nHe's good enough with what Wisconsin needs him to do obviously every ... wants him to do a little bit more but that's not always Wisconsin's often so um they're run heavy ... as long as she's able to hit some of those throws that's exactly what Paul Chris's asking of 'em so I think\nShort term the rest of the season ... books the guy uh you want to see what jak cones able to do in terms of what the future might be but I don't think now's the time to pull the plug obviously if he's injured can't go you have to but we'll see what happens\nWith traveling to Evanston uh this morning um there's just been a lot of uncertainty ah in previous games at Northwestern so I feel like that just bring someone certainly with today's match up as well the uh the Wildcats been up and down at different points in the season and you could argue the badgers have been as well\nWe talked about just how good the ball control often was last week in the running game against Illinois I feel like if you want to take some of the uncertainty out of this matchup today that's where you got to go first regardless of who's playing quarterback just run the ball effectively when the ... being decent shape\nYeah the northwestern always has some weird things going on there and they've got\nAn interesting it's always interesting when the badgers play it uh northwestern in Evansville so I think the war hawks will be the badgers will be in a good spot the ... they're going to run the ball\nThey're going to take control no matter who the quarterback is I think they stick to what they do and I think they'll be on the winning and will figure out in\nA couple of hours yeah the the ... the best thing northwestern has going for them is they're passing game they've got some injuries that running backs and they're going to turn\nTo Clinton source in their quarterback and that probably is a good match up from northwestern as Wisconsin's head injuries in their secondary all season uh they're continuing to deal with that this week so I think that's going to be the match up to watch here\nBut regardless of the ... you know the individual matchups the outcome of this game means a lot to a lot of schools in that Big Ten western division at Northwestern Purdue Iowa Wisconsin all have one conference last right now Wisconsin obviously be Iowa they've got that tie breaker there\nBut ah with Perdue coming up with a big win over Ohio State\nA lot of people and see that coming that make Purdue a contender all of a sudden but Wisconsin needs a winter day and then they should be in pretty good control of their uh their fate of getting to Indianapolis for the Big Ten championship\nYeah win over northwestern today would be big but there's also a big game against Penn State\nComing up so that will play a role for the badgers and the Big Ten standing so um they need to win today because if they win today that makes the Penn State game a must win and that's not an easy game too\nSo uh I think in the standings obviously this is a big game for the badgers to kind of take control of the west and give themselves a little bit of a cushion for that challenging getting down the road\nGetting the match up his badgers at Northwestern again that kicks off at eleven o'clock regained coverage beginning right here on nine forty W. F. A. W. at the top of the hour\nSounds like we're pretty confident in the badgers match up I'm curious to find out what Sean Maloney thing says he's got that Wisconsin game is part of this week's can't mistakes and he's got a couple of others for us here as well take it away\nFor health care is baby friendly working with the world Health Organization\nAnd UNICEF or the health care is one of only a handful of hospitals in Wisconsin that has been designated as maybe friendly there's a focus\nFrom prenatal to burn after\nNurses will provide information about bathing\nAnd how family members can help out around the house\nCome home and being baby friendly is breast feeding there are several international board certified lactation consultant on that\nThey'll show you the wonderful long term health benefits of breastfeeding\nFrom child [noise] and for the mother board healthcare and provide support and their families twenty four seven through our nurses courtroom\nPamphlets videos online resources animal\nLeaves visiting board healthcare dot com forward slash\nMore you know for him\n[noise]\nLooking to sharpen theory skills apple has reportedly gone on a hiring spree to bring in the town and it's nice to have a march the giant had one hundred sixty wind engineering physician with it for the Eighteenth\nI signed the company wants to improve the personal assistance ability to perform non music related cat so we can better compete for like ... and ...
