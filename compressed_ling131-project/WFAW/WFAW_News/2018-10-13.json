their part of you mentioned the playoff high school football we will have coverage here on nine forty W W and or cool when I was six point five to ... you mentioned a lot of teams in the area six of them going onto playoff action so we will\nDo our best here at the station to cover as much a high school football as we possibly can I Know of and have fun doing that with John Kippur and hopefully we can continue that\nMoving forward new Simon age twenty eight four years Saturday morning here on sports ... will turn our attention\nWell I think it's really more on the old Clare side John because all Clair is is uh about ten years you move from making it in the play offs and they've just really had a hard time sustaining any success up there at the large ones in his third year as head coach they dig it off to a to an old start this year in defeating a Laura ...\nOut of Iowa and went into overtime for the saint Norbert\nAh but then he lost three straight biggest got rolled by St Thomas and their second game and then\nLastly scheme is just a real head scratcher save costs the Steven's point nine three it was a battle field goals they just haven't had a hard time really trying getting this this program built back up and\nI you know I think they've changed coaches a couple of times they they just have not been able to recruit the type of players that white water in Osh Kosh all across the table to recruit they do for your starter quarterback and and uh ... pretty good and I think he's going to\nGive the war hawks and things to deal with but basically it's just been of the two programs going in different directions born anything else\nYeah there's no clear team that's giving up three hundred and forty plus yard the game and twenty four points to the teams that they are playing we talked about some of the big played last the last guy you think there's any more opportunity for maybe this nonsense to expand a little bit and get more involved in that big late attentional\nYeah I really do I mean they've got a number I mentioned we're probably not going to miss a Mitch dash today he's still recovering from a\nAn injury suffered in la La Crosse game Derek are Derek ... ah the younger gloom role is only really seeing the field once he's still battling with some injuries but they've got plenty of staff that the wide receiver spot and I think that's where you're really going to see whitewater try to do some things today\nSome injuries but they've got plenty of wide receiver spot I think that's where you're really going to see whitewater try to do some things today I also think they really want to get some ground game going they only got about a hundred yards rushing last week against Oshkosh granted a very good\nI Know Alex peed on a very good running back a little bit different style for each one I think they really like if I'm going on the ground and really get that bring in going as we get into the second half of the season [noise]\nYeah I'm sure they would so you know the kind of finish things up here ... I think you wouldn't be crazy to say whitewater should continue their recent success here against Claire but you know a big game last week against ash cash what kinds of things are you looking for here for whitewater to avoid maybe playing down to an opponent after a really big game last week\nWell you know it's always a worry I think any coach as that any any team has that concern\nBut one of those things that I've seen with this team right really right for the very beginning has been taking care of business attitude in other words\nNot worrying about what's down the road not worrying about looking ahead asked anybody they just basically take care of each and every week I think because of that I feel pretty good that they're not going to have\nA they're not going to have a lapse or a relapse in this ball game I think that they're going to come out and still play with a high level that they've they've always played I think it goes right\nFrom the top the coaching staff and also the capitals on the team very ants were priceless ... true and these guys are really outstanding after that I think they've been a big key 'cause it's excessive white waters have this year and then I really think because of their leadership\nI don't think you're right there and look to Asheville clear it any way shape or form today\nYeah once again you W whitewater traveling too old Clare today covered starts at twelve forty on cool when I was six point five and scary Douglas the voice of whitewater athletics Gary thanks for calling in and thanks for taking it easy on me today\n[laughter] you guys have a great day\nOn some violence again you do the same Gary have a good call up there in Oakland at once again twelve forty for health care pre game show starts of Gary Douglas or hawks take on the blue golds in old clear we will focus now to the division one level Chris capital L\nJoins me back in Studio after enjoying a nice ten minutes off there and that was so I'm enjoying himself over there but looking back quickly on last week it's already been a week so quickly look at this one but the badgers a nice victory over in Nebraska team that hasn't won a game yet this year but you worry maybe a little bit oppressive kind of played Wisconsin tough\nOn and off for the past few years and you're you're just hoping that those kinds of fame please God don't let this be Nebraska's first win but Johnson Taylor wrapped up to Twenty one twenty four carry them three touchdowns including that career high eighty eight and ah yeah this one's got some running game look really good last week\nIt seems like Wisconsin during the game always looks good against Nebraska so uh we'll ... we'll see what happens against Michigan I think\nThe cause for concern right now is Wisconsin as a secondary obviously with Scott and they'll send being a suspended for the first half of the Michigan game after getting adjusted for targeting so I think that's going to be the question mark ... machine can pass the ball\nBut I'm I'm not worried about the run game Jonathan ... good he leads the nation and rushing yard so I think that's going to be solid I trust our ... played well against Michigan last year she when he steps into his throes ... knows when he's decisive in this play\nPlay making he is a good quarterback so I'm not worried about the office today I think the big thing for Wisconsin will be the secondary\nThere'll be able to stop the run I Believe uh for the most part and then we'll see what Scott notes and can do in the second half kind of making a weird Justin back in\nYeah it'll be interesting to see 'cause I think this is definitely a match up with a two quarterbacks 'cause this is going to be an opportunity for shape Patterson on the Michigan side of things you mentioned that secondary between the suspension and the first half and some of the injuries\nIt's an opportunity for him to put up some numbers in the navy take this game Michigan it's kind of been the J got Harbaugh said he's got there they can't lend a big game they couldn't be Notre Dame earlier this year uh this is another big game though of course they got the game against the house they later but this one's at home\nBut for Wisconsin you mentioned the ... I think this is going to be I mean Michigan got\nThe ... in the country ... Gary those linebackers run around a little bit I wouldn't be surprised if things are tough early for Johnson Taylor and this Wisconsin running game and I wouldn't be surprised that Alex ... broke maybe open things up a little bit for this Wisconsin's he moved the ball around Michigan susceptible to the past we've seen\nAnd I think maybe he can move things around a little bit and then open up that Ron game kind of flip things in reverse here for Wisconsin use that passed it set up the run I think can be successful\nFor you W so who do you got in this one\nI've got some bad there's going to be home with the badgers yeah\nMy heart wants me to take Wisconsin my\nBrain is telling me Michigan it's a night game in Ann Arbor at the big house but you know what I'm going with my heart here I'm going Wisconsin twenty seven Michigan twenty three I'm probably going to regret this looking back next week I've actually been doing pretty good\nI'm Seventeen and seven on the year of and foreign one with the badgers the one wants to BYU so we'll see if I can make that five and one um\nLast week I was going to take a look at some of my other games here in Washington taking out Oregon kind of a down leak in college football really only two big games when I look at the market here Washington versus Oregon Washington saw sense of starting to get some big planes going they're starting to get them some things going for them But Justin Herbert has been playing like the number one taken the draft\nThe bleeding over Seventy six percent of its passage he looked really really good and I'm going to take Oregon to win this one over Washington twenty seven twenty four bit of an upset their\nNext one Georgia LSU this one is always good Georgia's all senses exploded this year and they look really really good LSU defense has been phenomenal is well under coach all but I just don't think it's going to be enough I think Georgia takes us one twenty seven to Nineteen and then for my stump or\nNew Mexico versus Colorado State New Mexico three and two on the year\nColorado State shoo in for this New Mexico off Anton look really really good ... Jones is thrown for four touchdown passes\nAnd back to back weeks off and says look really good right there they look really good against the U. N. L. D. but kj Carter Samuels eyes having a hard time getting things going for Colorado State and I think this one's going to be shootout don't expect a lot of events in this New Mexico Colorado State game Chris I'm taking New Mexico forty\nSeven to forty five quick look at the Packers here to last week last to Detroit\nSecond half made the score look better but man that first apple is really tough to watch you could tell that they were down to run 'em on top because these young wide receivers as the game when I started to develop a little bit of a chemistry with Aaron I'm that's what many uh saint brown involved scaling not easy to say either but\nEarly enough that you tell that they were as you don't miss cues on routes guys weren't getting open\nAnd that you can tell Rogers was getting frustrated with somebody's Ricky receivers\nYeah I think it's ... it starts with the receivers marketing open than it moves Aaron Rodgers getting frustrated holding on to the ball to long trying to do too much and that's when he follows the ball twice um leads to Detroit getting some good possessions so\nNothing went right in that first half obviously missing Crosby Mrs for fuel goals and the ph yeah so um that she makes one or two of those it feels like a different game so ... are just nothing going right for Green Bay\nIt's yeah so um that she makes one or two of those it feels like a different game so ... are just nothing going right for Green Bay at that point so ah things get better I Know the Packers send Mason Crosby out at the end for a field goals that kind of make them feel a little bit\nBetter I get that momentum back oh that may confidence up a little bit yeah\nAnd the Aaron Rodgers a brings the scores to within one score is the final score so I think it's\nI think it's overall just a game they forget about and move on as long as they're able to get Randall cabins around them all back at some point so um\nIt was just rookie right as wide receivers uh young wide receivers not doing necessarily their job or not doing enough necessarily to get the fence rolling early\nOn Aaron Rodgers has quite high standards for his wide receiver especially when plays break down and he gets out of the pocket he expects them to do some do some things but\nMoving on a Monday Night game another marquee game here for the Packers there'll be a prime time in front of everybody taking on a one in four forty niners team I think this is fun that at the beginning of the year you looked at you like Jimmy ... versa Aaron Rodgers is is that could be a primetime match up", "show_name": "WFAW News", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "13"}
