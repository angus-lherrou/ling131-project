in that ... let's talk to a\nA General David or about that uh that part of this or\nThat in retrospect would you say that you that you were sent into combat\nA witch and which is what it was it what it turned out to be into combat with less than the resources that they should have been made available to you\nWhile semi I think any commander with a but always want more resources but I think the um [noise]\nI'm\nOfficer so we're in command positions singer to me it made it very clear to the national command authority is that um\nArmored vehicles were required for survivor ability and um that's the best we protect our four so yes obviously um [noise] you know the more arm or you can have around your anytime she was a pretty good for the exam um yeah we we certainly could use that but we

be a it was I assume common knowledge\nTo everyone back then that among those forces active in Mogadishu at the time were those with RPGs rocket propelled grenades or certainly more than a match for ah for example for a Humvee a right\n[noise] well I think that is true but I think you also have to look at it in context at least from my perspective you know the basic mission was to go in and and the seriously for tax humanitarian assistance operations that were designed to be starving Somalis I I don't think anybody anticipated\nI'm going into into a firefight and I think part of that was a lack of recognition and in in my own over the last twenty five years that a lot of time to think about it\nWhen we we have this turn cold peacekeeping operations in from my perspective it's not a

information that was coming out to a theater with regard to what was going on\n[laughter] well maybe not to the general public would have to think the defense secretary Aspen had that information\nI think that's probably true ah but I'm not a school that he had the ability and I can't really speak for was asking I mean I I can only tell you the respect invest that folks that ah I was around on

have so much a respect for you and um you know just thrilled to pieces that you've got this show when they went so well and your daughter\nIs doing a\nAn incredibly wonderful job for the president and for the country\nWell thank you very much I'm very proud of her ah I tell people that Donald Trump was not my first choice for president because I was my first choice as a thought he was my second choice and I also say wait at least we got a Huckabee and the White House just wasn't the one I thought what ended up being there\nYou know it's got to be tough as a dead to watch people beat up on her little girl every day and let's face it doesn't matter how growing up she gets she's always going to be your little girl\nWell she is but you know it doesn't make me nervous as people think and I'll tell you why because I Know are well enough to know how ... years and lost some guy like Jim Acosta smart often try to you know put the squeeze on her\nI I'm more afraid for what's about to happen to him as I realized he's about to get his head handed to him he just didn't know it yet\nAnd sure enough she turns and really Texan down a notch and I I watch or with guys like that and I'm thinking you know I've seen that same approach that she makes to her five year old and a three year old son\n[laughter] All right I Love semi is the fact that you have to pull it President Trump\nAnd ... if everybody eats it wouldn't try to do that you know he had our president\nThat's true so the fact that a lot of people seem to ignore Richard your call low Charlotte let's go to a Calvin in St Louis hello Calvin\n[laughter] hey how are you where when I hear you\nYou're talking to the governor of the world there I mean I I I I grew up in Arkansas and when he said about girls is absolutely true 'cause I have five girls\nAnd every one of them could take that just about anybody of fighting in something they believe that it said you should just be so proud of your daughter I agree with that lady earlier but I just wanted to ask you as well I wanted to say something to\nYou know you're one of the most truthful people I have ever heard on the radio or TV or as a governor or as a politician or concerning abortion I think you're about the only person that I hear\nA hundred percent of the time talking to the truth about what that's about dead and I think ... um I Would ask you I mean do you think that this has more to do about abortion but it does anything else where Kavanaugh facing this opposition\nI think it does a cow in in in large measure because the locals are scared to death that there might be an honest look and revisit a rosy weight which was a ridiculous decision\nThat was a reaching out into thin air and creating a law that did not have any basis in the constitution\nWhat most people don't understand either grow the weight or reversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states and each and every state would make its own decision how would approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question\nIs to deal with it through the issue of person heard because we wouldn't accept the biological fact this is the science of of the unborn that every person is a person from the point of conception\nThen the Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie way a ruling ever could be in protecting life liberty and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd would provide due process and would make it impossible for anyone to deprive a person of their life and liberty and I I really hope that that's where we ended up moving with this because there shouldn't be about protecting innocent people\nYeah I really hope that that's where we ended up moving with this because it shouldn't be about protecting the innocent people not just about stopping abortion\nGo up to ten seconds here Mike than I Want you to stay on the line we'll speak all fair but I was doing a little checking your the calendar on inauguration day twenty twenty five you'll be sixty nine same ages Reagan was when he was elected president a year younger the Trump and and we've never had a president

jumbo had an\n\nCongressional faith and so are you really have to find the Republican the jazz them in a in swing states than a safari it uh it seems like Democrats are more eager to bode well for their\nCandidate and to show a kind of given middle finger in the trunk that ah that this is an election based on a project on the president's performance and um and how he's acting on\nYou know I I think that a lot of it depends on whether you see Trump's name on the ballot I think that the Democrats look at the ballot and they see Trump same everywhere on it doesn't say Donald Trump but anything anybody with an R by their name that's close enough will vote against that person\nOf whereas Republicans I think look at the ... and they don't see the president's name anywhere instead they may see a lot of people that they made you ride as as rhinos Republicans in name only and uh\nAnd so uh I think those two viewpoints may not be a good news for Republicans\nYeah all all falls short and I think all\nTrump has basically said that this is a referendum on a handle on that as hell nationalize the election not good for a Republican or any time the power and the party in power and so they're\nTrying to like keep that's a localized election uh and not have a Trump is the main issue they want all prone to call a judicial appointments or do they want that to me talk at because uh and

Stein did that is particularly interesting we'd go to this in the in the film or is during the twenty sixteen election or they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John a blind way um\nBut they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches um on both\nGoogle and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was or a five six month period and then they captured all the search results that people\nGod now some of these volunteers for the red states where some were blue states something with the Republican somewhere Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status and what they filed when they reviewed the result was that you know\nThings seem to be pretty balanced but Google in every single search position at the\nTop ten search results\nThis result favored Hillary Clinton said\nWhat they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton in the seat and they pushed negative stories like Donald Trump\nIn the same search results [noise] um and you know by his estimate this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't tell the results at the end of the day [noise] um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is that science is actually for the call but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen oh and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins who loses\nBut here's the real concern is you know we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that win undecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that one day sort sort of go into the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for\nYeah which is of course there's another way to put them none of your damn business they don't have either the do the or the responsibility [noise] ah I mean that's the kind of we just have ... ... ... if he were alive today would think boy I was born to sue and this is the perfect tool for running a a Nazi state\nNo your ear you're exactly right um and if you think about\nAll the sort of just ... uh uh novels about\nA totalitarianism it was all predicated on one thing Jim essentially the power of the state was going to smash in control people so you know in Nineteen eighty four it's big brother and you have these you know large television screens or these voices that are sort of\nBumping information to us but it was\nSimple it's kind of the you know the the\nThe clenched fist right in front of your face you know what we're facing now is not any kind of police state\nAbout what we are facing is this ominous power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the test\nBut it's still there and the power is still there and I I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a ... imagine I'm now or a stolen or a Mussolini\nThat had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we give them an enormous power and Google basically tells us trust us yeah last us\nGeorge Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Linda\nHow long can am I going to make a quick comment a lot of if they believe that the party\nYou were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Linda\nHello ma'am I'm I'll make quite come at a lot of us do believe that the party has been building a Nazi techno state with going on Facebook and all these people but what I really called us to ask and I want to thank our guests for what he's been doing and about search engines\nAnd they're used to be I just click which had a\nThey they have another one called start page the same company that they got rid of X like and that was if you didn't want to use Google result he wanted other result and I don't understand that Google suppress did they make them suppress I click or what happened to it and I use that that go\nYeah I Know that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in the space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year\nFor the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that it's an apple product and Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing their searches but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that\nBecause they wanted the information and the data that comes through search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing everywhere and you're exactly right star page a\nIs a a search engine you get great results\nThey actually use Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that
