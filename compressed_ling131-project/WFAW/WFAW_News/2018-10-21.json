and subjective truth I Would contend that wild that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subject the truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling you call this in the cabinet or hearing the Democrat Senate the starting with Cory Booker used the phrase the truth\nWhen talking about the testimony from ... to fold buddies so telling the truth\nThere's no such thing as her truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is what do you get this post modern is on this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics to be divided into two groups those who believe there is well I'm sure the ...\nAnd those that believe everything is relative the those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the trusted to ease of the twenty twenty five cents\nIt's relative the those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the atrocities of the twenty of them twenty first century\nBut what if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states I mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would to concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction\nBut what I just said I wouldn't subscribe to but how was it was a believer in subjective truth telling me that my subjective truth\nWas wrong with theirs is right\n... you know the best they they'd have\nTo fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truthful multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically to deny your accusations so this is this is the absurdity of of the whole situation so\nYes it's it's a very powerful weapon that you can use against the the liberals the spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends I mean there's there's the theories as the the ... and then there's the practice so the question is what what is the practice or if if it's a Muslim who's living in America uh\nI'm I'm the behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's no problem if it's a country such as Bangladesh show or elsewhere\nWhere it's ... becomes the legal system where shall real law actually becomes the ... of the land ... such as Afghanistan than we have a problem because then the the\nTruth is that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes\nThese things fall by the wayside so\nYou know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies but as a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country and who we are actually talk about\nThe one thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left uh pushing harder and harder or to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat uh you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go I Do think that they overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] yeah it's a very good question I'm disturbed that in the upcoming midterms for the of the Democratic party candidates have openly\nLabeled themselves a socialist\nA in a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of American millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed in the name of socialism communism so yeah I think the Democratic party or rather the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party\nHave managed to socialize this word and make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to add this it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations advocated control of the education of our young people to people especially if the collegiate faculty level in many cases who have\nAn absolute axe to grind and an very anti American ... who are less and less likely to try to even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty who are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor and presidents of these universities have not been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America\nAnd demanded to know why such and such and such and such as and fired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more we abdicated the schools the high schools the colleges\nStarting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody as a as as as dangerous as Bernie Saunders becomes popular in America it's because we allowed the education system to be taken over by the radicals\nTogether working to create the best possible outcome for our program coordinators what'd you from preemptive education and through your ... members number the way to get you home\nThat was a bit of a social ... factions rapid recovery band return home or if it was one of the I was they were healthcare more to be the ...

oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with Bill O'Reilly\nHis latest in the killing series killing the ss co written with Martin do guard is are already working its way up to the top of the bestseller list and there were going to look a bit of just do what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is ... you look at the titles you'll say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what it usually is the case as you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the world war two Nazi Germany is collapsing\nAnd the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know what I did not realize until ah killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government\n[noise] sure um after Iraq killing Patton which I became an enormous salary a lot of material leftover be as pat and uh was an occupier in southern Germany uh before he was a killer met his death in the hospital in Germany\nAnd the prevailing wisdom from pat in and many other\nA powerful people in the U.S government was we've got to use these captured Nazis to spy and work against the Soviet Union\nWhich is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you remember him from killing ... actually fight them if you wanted to fight Stalin yeah so that's what the new CIA or that took over from the ... says did\nThey enlisted a lot of these uh ss people and gift shop all people to spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union and they didn't really much care what they did\nDuring the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich ... the head of the ss one of the most of our human beings I ever to walk the planet called Odessa\nAnd a family knew about a year\nA before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose and he ... he can negotiate a separate piece is kind of crazy delusional stuff from him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization and so they helped\nThese guys get out of Germany and we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened and also the America and not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped them\nA elements of the Vatican helped them and they got them from Germany down to a general way Italy and on boats to Spain and South America and South Africa\nA it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out and we took a big guys and we took it I men andme Angola Clowes Barbie the Bush early on and Martin Mormon\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kind of we proved that in the book by dental work\nSo it was a compelling compelling\nA story almost on every page um and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim ... the ... ss people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university\nYou win the world war two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the death said go on a cap\nAnd ... and ran a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people\nWho just ordinary people [noise] you know it's just amazing I'm ... and when you read it people that are that couldn't happen yeah it it it and it can happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise in your eyebrows right now the thought of that\nI certainly understand the motivation [noise] but I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification\nFor whatever intelligence these people may have revealed to justify what this country and others the Vatican and others did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that's what Harry Truman did ill and killing the assets we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black male\nTo go after Adolf Eichmann ... they had to say if you don't Mr President and we're going to lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who did that and then adding that\nForced forced Truman to do it\nWho who who blackmail on it who blackmailed him\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear\nWe named the man I'm that have Truman didn't sign the order for the CIA to look for um I ... that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened in a concentration camps and an insult true\nAnd then that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people knew it but he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it\nThe FBI knew that the Nazis were more wind down innocent people knew it but he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo I number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about them or just a a a a tad bit if you will or some or ... thought from his latest of the killing series\nKilling the ss and uh it is a a gang buster read to just published by the way by Henry Holt and company again our number one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six if you'd like to talk to bill about\nHis book killing the ss or any of the big issues of the day and of course we haven't even talked about mid term elections which we will do was billed as well so a standby more to come on the boat had a show and just a moment\nI don't think they had a horse and the Kavanaugh saying um I think that\nUh the Democrats are counting on this anti Trump wave but at the economy is booming for every one that takes a lot of the edge off that anti Trump stuff so um you know again it's impossible to predict there is anger\nBut there's also a you know let me give you an example Jim and this is a pretty vivid example of what I'm Talking about here with the rise of evil in this country after Kavanaugh is confirmed and the day that he was confirmed a writer for the cold air program put out a tweet that said okay\nWell maybe he got the Supreme Court job but at least we ruined his life\nYeah okay that by the way to build on his ... he said\nRight I'm going to submit that no one on your staff\nAnd certainly no one of my staff and Bill O'Reilly dot com who'd ever put out its we'd like that and keep their job because it's hateful\nAnd it it is an evil act and I'll tell you why because capital as children\nAnd he has a wife and a mother and father\nAnd this guy writing for cold there who still working at cold there to no action against it is is applauding the fact that we ruined his life like that's a good thing and I think Americans of picking that up\nThe picking at this progressive left movement and teeth are these people they're dangerous now\nAnd then there's nothing in the world more tragically ironic\nThan people calling themselves and anti fascist who's tactics would be recognized by any member of the brown shirts for the Nazi movement I mean they called themselves anti fascist is just tragically ironic and and sadly most of them would not even understand the irony yeah\nThe good news is the good news is that there's not many of them the the bad news is is that they're identical to the S. A. in Germany in the late twenties and thirties there were Hitler's bully boy so went out and beat up everybody that oppose Nazi ism\nIt's the same tactics are at the same same thing but\nIn America you know a lot of these people and they apparently they all live in Portland, Oregon\n[laughter] I have a lot of them do yeah yeah so\nI'll take a quick break come back with more from a Bill O'Reilly or get his new book killing the S.
