C. where one eight six six five oh jumbo and the Allen calls in from Dallas this evening and listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome Alan\n... going to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to live out in\nAll here he was ... spending that my experience has been I'm sixty one years old I've ... I've tried ... travel and most of the major freeways in America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWe're ... we're on an on the major freeways but then if you go into a situation where much of south to North Carolina where the Florence are gender flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou ... you need to make sure that when you're when you're going out do go on the major freeways first and they wait for the detour then that's when you should you should start on the side roads you transmit it because when there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay on the clear major uh interstate and then and then then if it happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side Roach that's all I'm saying\nAll right we'll live with those people in the Anthony go because to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to be Anthony\nIs absolutely correct buddy and poorly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to watch those rows you should at least be familiar with and so when you're traveling on leisure early um track\nTo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area and that everyone knows you know going to be a ban on other people that I meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several little bit of a major rose to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads so when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline\nIt's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say before let's say you're on a major artery and we are told in the ... place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey\nI'm taking this beach and we're going to do to through this direction to that location so this way family members who rely on\nThose even as the people on the other side cannot get that signal leaning that tax bill the email that says once that sour turns on and the people on the other side\nYou get that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone reaches that tower\nNo as a as a ... and ... thank you Alan for your call them ... and your thoughts here or how does the GPS here ah affect all of this\nUh makes everything so wonderful that we know where each of those are like you said and activate your GPS for\nYour family members so this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but in times of weather related problems such as Michael\nYou know the storms getting thrown down you know can take our technology\nAnd if the powers that the people that you're sending a signal to went down ...\nDance single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they hit another tower that active they will instantly receive those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you go in that way and on the other side\nIt's important to understand that they will receive at once of power\nIs connected to that cell phone they will receive the message and now they know what happens here\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for a radio and the good old ubiquitous overly your radio always there to serve you such moments we go to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the bull headed show with our guest disaster preparedness expert Anthony kovac good evening Patrick\nOr that evening gamble or this or this coverage is a very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise]\nUm [noise] and uh otherwise than being a good script for a movie [noise] um why not just bomb or a hurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific\nA print the Inuit killer it would rain radioactive [laughter] a waste of [noise] but uh\nMaybe a hydrogen bomb or\nWell that's a nuclear bomb too because you didn't know because it involves a a\nTrigger that consists of either uranium plutonium but beyond that if it is let's assume for the moment we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter [noise] ah I Am not sure about this but I Would say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other him practicalities of such an idea they're just too big\nAnd very\nWell you know let's put it this way let's say the United states less to let's say all of this you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and\nDo something with the storm and the storm goes towards Alabama well Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida are liable for the burning this storm and damaging to states the other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there was a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and they go straight through Mexico City and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nAli liable for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hit they got to be upset\nAnd I would note one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody will never found liable or even there was proof that in fact\nThey hit their head of the upset\nYeah and I would no one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody was ever found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action lead to one followed but this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding or part of the eye of a hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left turn them headed inland and the I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe that ever again that was tried so\nThe the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the end and the Anthony notes quite correctly or\nA mother but just simply changes course in damages somebody else in the ... who is liable and are you [laughter] it could be a painful lesson in the liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do with the exact precision will take some more callers will be an athlete Kobe\nWell but I mean it depends on where it hit so maybe it's just you just can't know that's certainly a possibility but but I mean you never know\nOkay well what other than all of the things you said so far about ... thumb drive your record for all of that stuff or otherwise already to them but you know or the other day I\nReally there or you know the water to\nOr or uh I'm here with all the work because\nYou wouldn't be able to drive anywhere anyway\nAnd that's not that's not necessarily true at all you may or
