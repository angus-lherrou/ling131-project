been talking about here from Steve Bannon's group\nNiles damage our guest is White House columnist with the hill newspaper [noise] now this is a a had a survey that was split into two parts one was about twelve hundred respondents nationwide another focused on roughly forty competitive house district with eight hundred fifty responded\nIn both cases the pollsters initially asked respondents about their voting intentions then posed a number of stark questions on contentious issues and asked if they're voting intentions had changed\nIn the national poll initial nine point edge for Democrats was reduced to two points by the end of the survey the bowl among voters in competitive districts expanded a negligible GOP edge of less than a single percentage boy up to a five point advantage [noise]\nBe change came after hard edged questions which sought to portray Donald Trump as a disruptor of a state's a stale status quo and the Democrats as the party of open borders the impeachment and the pillow see for example one question asked respondents whether they believe the U.S should have been\nIll status quo that the Democrats as the party of open borders the impeachment and below sea for example one question as respondents whether they believe the U.S should have an\nOpen borders immigration policy or whether it's illegal immigration is just that illegal\nIn the national both sixty five point three percent of respondents said the latter opposite lives closer to the interview only twenty seven point fibers that said the former now has a uh the notes on this poll continue the Democratic party does not favor open borders as that term is generally understood\nOr know that they simply favored no enforcement and then they would I suppose a look and wonder much or like Nancy Pelosi those all the time and say gee how'd it all those people get here anyway by all standards are our guests deceiving and the interesting thought\nI recall at the George W. Bush strategy an old for against John Kerry and rather than as the incumbent president rather than the reaching out so much his strategy and the closing days of that race a successful race of course for George W. Bush was to concentrate on his base so your thoughts\nI think that the country is so polarized acknowledge that there is a lot to be said for the bass first strategy\nThere's some disagreement between Steve Bannon on that one of the people who was a a\nConsulting business pulled Patrick ... you know Jim dates back to the Carter a presence absolutely to make a long story short balance of the view that this is primarily a base election on on the canal differs from that to some extent because they'll thinks there are people in the center here still to be won over\nBut to me it seems as if a President Trump is so polarized saying we have such a polarized media\nWe have such a polarized popular culture in many ways that\nJust trying to be objective and give my analysis I tend to come down more on the ban on the side of that question simply because I think that for both parties really clean up their base is more likely to be effective\nFor a long time I've been up for the ... that the number of persuadable voters in the United states has been decreasing and decreasing bean window designed\nBy all kinds of factors that not only President Trump or before the press and Obama but I sort of brought or a change in the in the cultural was I got used\nTo what extent do you think does Obama voters those on again off again Obama voters might turn out this time because of two huge beers at center around immigration and abortion\nAnd Obama would Obama voters as it turned out for that race [noise] mhm well they could ... in the sense all I'm trying\nI mean clearly ... Democrats democratic voters are very concerned about this current president and the fact that he has a unified government in the sense of ... Republican majorities in both houses\nFor Democrats I Do think that taking back the ... at least would be considered a a means to curb some Trump now fought issues they care about but most I Would need to see more more polling on not the point clearly abortion is a pretty fundamental issue\nTo ... which is goes I ironic because I like both sides make far too much out of Brett Kavanaugh let's assume that he in fact is is finally confirmed and that he votes to overturn roe versus Wade\nThere are people out there who think that means that the next say nobody can get an abortion anywhere Mm no of course it means that becomes a state issue that will be at least two dozen states where abortion will be wide open\nAnd are in those states that are suddenly take advantage of that overturn roe but ah you would see you probably have bus Kara bad you'd have special phones raised up and I dare say that if roe were overturned which I don't think it was a given\nWith a ... an automatic a confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh but if it did happen I bet you you could go a year after that decision and you wouldn't find a single woman in this country who was quote unable to get an abortion\nI buy country offer and uh I've well informed opinion on that Jim I think that would clearly changed the atmospheric stuffed the country very significantly if there were no longer a constitutionally mandated rights to abortion\nAnd and obviously that would be I think issues of women who were a less\nWell off or sexually and we're going to have to pause on that do to continue that thought when we come back in the moment\nAnd populist conservatism is not the same as the traditional conservatism on the Democratic side I never hear the term but I certainly hear the concept\nOr if there are rhinos then there are those out there who are dying those Democrats in name only in the view of some some of suffered at the uh the hands of a\nA primary voters within the Democratic party and others have been very fearful of that I think get Dianne Feinstein herself a for reelection was not endorsed by her party because Feinstein know coming from my point of view this as hard to swallow but she was

a\nIt was just about as far left as you could go in many regards to certainly acquitted herself or not that poorly or so I think a lot of Democrats are running kind of frightened right now\nYes and there's a lot of energy on the left of the Democratic party\nIn addition to the races that you mentioned gym the one where the laugh really warm in pretty dramatic circumstances was the highest crime

of the stage with his standing in the polls lead look to his left and they look to his right and you would say all these people are going to cut your entitlements but not me [noise]\nI mean as a as a deficit hawk I'm I'm rather surprised at that you are somewhat disappointed in the president\nI think he should have vetoed that omnibus spending bill I really do but the Republicans have a a responsibility to not drive our country into bankruptcy and they're not doing that and again they promised to defund Planned Parenthood\nThere it's really disappointing and I think this has got to be like two thousand and six in some ways because they haven't delivered they really have it\nWell that'll certainly help the president out a lot of a lot of people and I'm assuming you mark considering

is and and testifying with the lowest racial issues whether it's the cabinet off or immigration or we've public you know are Democrats\n... ... ... is an independent state just like when you have to make a law of their own name we should look at er or in your state and say OK\nCurrently I'm living in Florida because Republicans have a certain philosophy the way they would like to see things yeah\nMaybe we should make Florida simply a Republican state\nDemocrats have this certain way with which they like to see things yeah I don't know whether they care about the environment or support abortion or what have you maybe we shouldn't make um Texas Democratic state\nAnd maybe if we had each individual state have democratic philosophy or we've promising philosophy people handle philosophies belonging to crash the Republicans tend to live in that state and there wouldn't be all this animosity and great\nWell then as soon as the course of people really free mobile and also

leave when the others leave\nAgain that would be an optional thing either they can choose to me so well let's just say that would support their value systems are just the ... or choose to be a happy because hey\nBut of course you know election returns will change what a given state happens to do and then that's kind of an American viewpoint [noise] ah so you know again uh I'm not sure if I see that as as a solution do you draw the lessons from it to your um\n[noise] well I I I think it raises an important historical point the United states was\nAs you know originally Thirteen independent independent countries briefly and the is the deal that brought the United states together under the constitution was a was a deal that was supposed to allow\nExactly the kind of very very significant differences in a state character that how many in this talking about so all all of us are look back in our appalled at the at the question of of slavery\nBut we we tend to forget that for example Massachusetts and Connecticut at the time of the founding\nOr had established churches and we're we're very proud of their of their puritan tradition as being part of the ... character and culture of the states and that didn't mean that anybody was forced to leave those states have just messed up if\nIf you want it to live and that that kind of a place then then you would live in Massachusetts and Connecticut and if you wanted to live someplace else than you'd you'd probably moved to New York and um\nIt is\nInteresting that over over the last two hundred years the United states you can say has moved more and more towards a enforced\nA macho lady trying to force all the states to be the same and as I say I think it's very understandable on the issue of of slavery [noise] um but but when you get to a\nWell I wasn't sure if you're going to finish that thought but the clocks gonna make you finish it after this break\nWell I I I think the questions that we should look in a world of independent nations they're not all going to be nations that you like\nTo me that that that that's what independence means when you celebrate the fourth of July in the United states if if the Americans still do celebrate what you're saying is our country can chart its own course\nAnd the ... you can't you're not going to have England or China or Russia or anybody else and dictate what we'd do the theory of a world like that is is that different nations will have different forms of government some of them were not going to like\nSo you you you read a lot in in the American press these days about uh about a Hungary Poland Israel Italy criticizing these countries and saying well that that they're not they're not being governed the way we want them to be governed\nBut that's exactly the point the point is that\nIf if Americans going to be a nation state and national state\nAnd it doesn't want others to to interfere in its elections and to tell it what to do than part partly it has to allow other countries the freedom to determine their own course and so there's a certain ah humility in that saying we don't necessarily have\nThe the answers that we can dictate to every other country in the world invading Iraq and uh helping determinant new constitution there didn't work out so well some may may be may be American doesn't have\nPat answers for every other country should be governed\nUh obviously quite quite frankly there are some countries out there that just really aren't aren't fit for self governance and it'd be kind of a free status or culturally they are simply unprepared for that the I Wonder if some languages even have the the word compromise in them I I seriously doubt on Arabic includes the word ...\nUh because of the of the uh the the way that the many aspects of their culture a proceed so\nUh I I think that there was a much greater recall probably for this kind of thing back when the United nations consisted of a a lot of Western European democracies and we were willing to look the other way for the the Soviet Union and then suddenly all they had the the big\nBreak out of a of a colonial is a a areas that became nations after the Nineteen sixties and we suddenly saw the the likes of Libya leading me the United Nations Human rights council\nAnd we realized that the total ... of of the notion quite frankly I think the the the widespread growth of independent nations is probably what do the United nations because you you have within the United nations today what may be out of a hundred and Ninety some countries you've got maybe\nWas fifty or sixty there could be considered the genuinely a a fit for free self governance\nYou know most of those countries but the ones that you're saying are are fit our our country is in

capo subtitled when us an German soldiers\nThat was a British historian the author of twenty some books as late as being ghost writers published by the capo subtitled when us in German soldiers fought together to save the world's most beautiful horses in the last days of World War two and we haven't really gotten into this into great detail but uh\nWe should point out I suppose the importance of these horses just from the standpoint of if you will breeding stock because I gather advantage is why the Germans had them in the first place right\nYes I've seen the limits on a breed or very very special breed of a white holes are found in the interests of Spanish riding school\nThey have been carefully bred for hunting and severe hunger isn't hundreds of years by the Austria Hungarian empire or they performed a very special kind of a display which is known as high as schooling of whole says um is very very stylized and of course if you go to Vienna today you can see this they ... the palace and\nThe blood line was absolutely pure and the Germans grabbed the whole says with the intention of feeding them into a program to create if you like an area and that kind of super whole for the down an army\nThat's absolutely unbelievable but but nonetheless that was the circumstances that occurred so these wars was ... at the at great important from the standpoint of justice those who love horses but also from the German point of view of the master race even to and including\nForces themselves so as as we were telling the story or the Americans have reached the location of these horses\nAnd they're going to have to convert German trucks in order to transport them back to American lines and the in the meantime I gather that the fanatic German SS forces have not been inactive and they are suddenly aware of the presence of Americans behind German lines\nThat is correct to have this little outpost of the U.S army twenty miles behind the German lines uh the the other German troops in the area where of what's going on and most of them have stood down I'm leaving them alone however there is an ss unit moving up which has been defeated elsewhere and that coming up and groups have several hundred\nOr and they say this has some kind of a red rank to a ball or some kind of opportunity and they know in the capital of consented attacks on the little town which has defended by only\nYou know a couple of hundred Americans with very light weapons in the small vehicles and uh they have to fight them off and they have a couple of a ... serious battles if\nYes has had managed to break in and of course it would have led to a ... and\nAnd the other thing is it leads to the creation of something codes to its foreign legion which is the interesting part of this story\nAbout bleeds eliminate learn more about stewards foreign legion\nWhile the officer was asking that come out with a guy pulled a captain told us to that and uh you know he's any officer he's very combat experience but he's left with a really difficult situation\nIs simply doesn't have enough men to defend the town and the sad so he looks around and of course when they came in they all said liberated some allied POWs there was some Americans\nBrits poll subs French except for and they've been working with the whole says for some years and he is able to um some of those were captured Jon their weapons but it's still not enough men so he intends eventually into the German prisoners that they have taken and and he re arms field expedient\nA quite a number of German soldiers and then a non check points along the sign\nX POWs and us soldiers and of course this is known as students foreign legion ... where you throw the costs accent as well into this tiny on ... and of course when they are assets actually attack it is Americans fighting shoulder to shoulder with German and British POWs and contacts that everybody else to defending\nThe stand or the townspeople and of course the ah the women and children of the stuff so it's an app to him ... story\nThis foreign legion that this was a collection of people who if you put them all together in a bar or some place they would be very many drinks before some of these people were going at each other's throats\nIn the in in this period of intense pressure or were they able to get them to do work together without killing each other\nI think the ... was that ten they rule in in this together the whole is whether that ticket out behind they would fall into Soviet captivity the Germans can expect to a nice trip to Siberia and I do like\nA it's not being shot on the spot or for the others of course ah they just want to get out and get back to the American line so the host has become the ... of the men and women and children that are also there as well so\nIt's very complex on top of that we have one more play I we haven't mentioned which is the ... a communist pot in his hands who also operating in the forest they would light the match these whole says as well because they see them as being checked prophecy because they are on ... land so we had another added die mentioned to this as well\nDid they manage to to get on the way of the operation these are checked part as\nThey try to as the Americans were taking them out they manage some road blocks on the very edge of check territory on the very end border and a couple of American officers had fish a showdown with the guns were caught the limited and pointed\nAnd it was you know cases who are being fast fortunately for everybody the checks things tend to allow the Americans but that German or allies and everybody else to pass through the whole says into safety in that area\nWe have concentrated on the horses are a unique part of the story but of course as you noted the American forces discovered a lot of humans there as well refugees and the like did the everybody a person's horses that they all managed to get out safely\nKennel read them initially didn't want us how you count refugees because he thought it was a military operation but then when he came up in the south a couple of days later and he saw the clients of these people and he decided that he would turn a blind eye\nTo what was going on and if they could join this great loan straggling call on the people which was kind of name operation cowboy\nOr to move these people
