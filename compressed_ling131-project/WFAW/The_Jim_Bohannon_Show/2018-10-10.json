O. V. I. C. K. O. V. I. C. where one eight six six five oh Jim bow and the out of the calls from Dallas this evening and listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome Alan\n... going to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to live Allen\nAll here he was spending that much experience has been I'm sixty one years old I've ... I've tried ... travel and most of the major ways in America Ninety five north and south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith ... with on an on the major freeways but then if you run into a situation where like in a sub in North Carolina where the Florence are gender flooding a closed that down then you need them you need it\nIf you run into a situation where like in a south to North Carolina where the Florence arcane to flooding are closed that down then you need them\nYou need to make sure that when you're when you're going to do go on the major freeways first and then wait for the Detroit then that's when you should you should start on the side roads you transmit it because ... there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay on the clear major uh interstate and then and then then if it happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side routes that's all I'm saying\nAll right well let's see what Anthony kovac has to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me that he\nIs absolutely correct but importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to watch those rows you should at least be familiar with them so when you're traveling on a leisurely um track\nSo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area that everyone knows you know the only to be a ban on all the people are gonna meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several a little bit of a major rose gets at that location just in case you have to take one of those roads but when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline\nIt's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say ... ... let's say you're on a major artery and we are told that are being asked to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this the song we're going to go to through in this direction\nSo that location so this way family members who rely on\nEven as the people on the other side cannot get that sick no meaning that tax the email message wine stats our sons on and the people on the other side\nYou get that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone when it reaches that tower\nNo as a as a ... thank you Alan for your call them the your thoughts here or how does the GPS here ah affect all of this\nUh makes everything so wonderful that we know where each of those are like you can send an active a year and GPS for your family members\nSo this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but\nIn times of weather related problems such as Michael you know the storms getting thrown down you know can take our technology and if the towers that an evil that you're sending a signal to\nDown and\nDance single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they had another tower that active they will instantly receive those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way\nAnd on the other side\nIt's imports and understand that they will receive it wants a power is connected to that cell phone they will receive that message and now they know what happens to you\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for a radio and the good old ubiquitous over the radio always there to serve you see in such moments we got to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the boat handled show with our guest disaster preparedness expert Anthony kovac good evening Patrick\nOr the evening and gamble or this or that coverage and very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise]\nUm [noise] and uh otherwise to than being a good script for a movie [noise] um why not just bomb or\nA hurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific or couldn't be a new killer it would rain radioactive [noise] a wave of [noise] but uh\nMaybe a hydrogen bomb or\nWell that's a nuclear bomb to the case you didn't know because it involves a a\nTrigger that consists of uranium plutonium but beyond that if it is let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter [noise] uh I Am not sure about this but I Would say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other him practicalities of such an idea there's just too big and then I\n[noise] well you know let's put it this way let's say the United states was to say oh this you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with the storm\nAnd the storm goes towards Alabama what Texas\nNow is the state of Florida are liable for burning this storm and damaging the states the other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there is a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and it goes straight through the city and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nOh we live off of that so that's another area of issues that may arise yeah so we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hit that got to kind of be upset\nYeah and I would note one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody will never found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action lead to one followed but this was this is probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding or part of the eye of a hurricane this was a better game was off Jacksonville, Florida and so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left during an handed inland\nAnd the ... I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe that ever again that was tried so of the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly\nWell that's true if they if they keep saying his mind going to come along basically everything's gonna be or who are\nWell but I mean it depends on where it hit somebody it's just you just can't know that certainly a possibility but but I mean you never know\nOkay well what other then all of the things you said so far about ... thumb drive your records all of that stuff that we've done but you know what other physical ... kind of guy\nReally prepare for you know besides the water that type of thing\nOr is there a a ... year go it was cold but not really work because you wouldn't be able to drive anywhere anyway\nAnd that's not the best moments of certainly true at all you may or may not you just simply have no way of knowing if you're talking about\nA a an earthquake that it's a you know twenty on the Richter scale in every structure and road is flat and well I guess you're screwed but I mean I don't think that's a that's too likely and go kid is always a handy thing to have even under the most dire circumstances or your your advice for a gym would please Anthony\nAbsolutely I mean I don't get is just that so let's say you are you have to abandon your vehicle and you have\nYour whole trumps stolen go cats but you had your backpacking you carry ... central style\nA few days the food and medicine that other things that you can now walk and hide it to the next town or wherever it is that you can have safe lodging or maybe even just ... percent nearby and just\nYou know wait it out and so you know ... start putting together what's happening now think about it yeah when's the last part of a cane that came so far in laws ... states now are starting to take seriously\nYou know emergency management of these type of situation like in the state of Florida because we've had so many hurricanes back to back\nIt taking it seriously the money and management of each county each district each week gender date itself\nI mean we moved I think it was seven to ... people during the hurricane the ones that hit a\nI was it or my camera member from somebody names now think about how many people who are relocated\nNot only all of the state of Florida but to Alabama Georgia it was just ... you know we location of the masses and from what I remember no one was\nKilled during this whole process\nRight one eight six six by boat jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six week go to the break an important lesson to keep in mind do the best you can uh again or the idea of throwing up your hands
