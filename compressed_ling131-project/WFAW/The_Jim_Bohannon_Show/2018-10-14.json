such a high level as as he has most of his career is under size guy image tremendous what he's\nDone there's no doubt about that [noise] but you look at these numbers and and it's you know it's like funny money uh it's all well I shouldn't say it's all but most so much of it is fueled\nBy the changes in the rules are changing the style of play it may be a Marine I retired in Nineteen Ninety nine that's a I got my ... a math right that's a what is it Nineteen years ago [noise]\nHe's still fifth all time was sixty one thousand three hundred and sixty one passing arts Maria was playing today you

quantify all these years you know once upon a time\nFran ... then retired as the NFL's all apparently pastor what forty seven thousand yard he now sits limits on the list and he faced a far greater challenges that everyone I had him on that unless he put in an era when defenders couldn't Bob the quarterbacks and there is the reason why in the sixties and seventies\nJohnny last past forty thousand yards and you know I feel about Johnny you so how are we to rank rank and rape quarterbacks who play in the era of these artificial statistic\nWell I think that's a great problem I think it's going to be a great problems for process hall of fame voters going forward I think it's going to be a great a problem for anybody who really wants to sit and truly wants to understand the history of the game or because you're not they're not playing the same game\nI mean it's not even close a majority now as a you always played a lot less the games per season he played the you know when they get punch you in the face you know five minutes after you threw the ball to go into the huddle it puts you in the face nobody would say to you know I mean completely different game and as you point out\nWhen you see it reflected in all the statistics today was the latest statistics with receivers uh\nJulian Edelman a brave though he is and talented do years would not last one half of one game in the Nineteen seventies\nJak Tatum would have been decapitated him on one of those little shallow crosses and he wouldn't have been allowed Donny show would have been lining up right behind them you know I mean it's just a a different game and I think it really has thrown the record book out I don't know if they're going to come up with some sort of\nYou know we're new\nA stat that I Can't

along with Lester have formed what many consider to be the greatest quarterback cannon NFL history back in the super bowl days the Los Angeles raiders\nLike was nine time pro bowl selection of the time all pro selection a member of the Nineteen eighties all decade teams the NFL's Seventy fifth anniversary team was elected the pro Football Hall of fame in Nineteen Ninety seven\nHe's here with us today to discuss what became an instant hot topic or group of twenty or so hall of fame is led by our Dickerson issued a letter of\nSome see as a demand for three hundred thousand dollar annual pension or as well as health insurance or they would boycott future hall of fame or induction next year's ... anniversary\nMike was among the twenties so names on it less but I always know him as a ... says the voice of reason and illegal sometimes devoid of it so I wanted to give him a call and just see if we can sort of this issue of welcome back Mike [noise]\nThank you ride them that are always good to be talking with you really\nRead all those accolades boy they got tired just read them all the believable and stuff I had forgotten about some of 'em\n[laughter] yeah they do [laughter]\nFirst the first thing about this letter that struck so many uh was that these are the hall of fame seemed to be asking for this only for themselves even though the letter did at one point said they wanted it to be a sort of a template to eventually cover non hall of fame as I Know that bought it a lot of people\nOr how did you see Mike and and and how would you explain what your intentions you really are [noise]\nWell you know I think I'm going to do was to highlight the hall of famers but realizing that you know our question is really to help all retired players in particular the guy that played before Nineteen Ninety three um we we don't all all the players don't have the same type of\nBenefit package going going forward and I don't think the public knows that um we\nDon't have health insurance I don't think people know that as well\nAnd they're pretty surprised to find out that all the hall of famers aren't millionaires but they would I think people forget is\nNow the salaries have really skyrocketed over the years and I live in a long time you know I think maybe when\nYou know there was a time when the average guy supposedly only live to be like ... the guy who live in a lot longer and the guys who played when salaries were\nTwenty thousand dollars or I can remember when I play with a guy named by the hour that New England food the corner my rookie year 'cause on the other side and he told me a signing bonus for the new Pontiac GT oh\nSo you know I think those are the details in those days we're going to like thirty five hundred dollars even a Mercedes Benz was like five or six thousand dollars a beautiful home and in Beverly Hills was probably sixteen thousand dollars you know what I mean so um [noise] everything has changed that all the pensions were all based on\nThe money that the guys were making so they didn't make a lot of money you can imagine what their pensions where they didn't have a cost of living increase our inflationary a kick into it and so you know every year along and they live or you know the money goes down down down instead of going up\nAnd so so a lot of those kinds of issues that people aren't aware of\nAnd um and I think a lot of players they don't like to talk about their financial issues that too much cried and I get stuck and they get stuck in a place where it looks odd when they're when they're I'm Talking about these kinds of things\nBut um do you know the guys who are probably after the nineties who are doing great um but they're you know as a hall of fame as a hall of famer I think\nMost people are unaware that until recently there haven't really been in the hall of fame programs and um and you know the thing that you get is\nTo say that you're hall of famer to have a a jacket a ring of Boston can a and you know if you don't need an agent you know doesn't make sense to have an agent but maybe it does and so I'm a lot of guys in my era we didn't have age and so you know so we're going to make any extra money being hall famers\nThere was going to have to come from programs that either we started ourselves or the hall of fame started\nIn the league continues to to use those players um to promote those players compared today's players to retired players you know last night I watched um Drew Brees become the all time you know passing later\nAnd um you know and he passed up to ... hall of fame you know one of the hall of fame and one of the future hall of famer for sure [noise] um but all of those guys where you compare um you know back to the guy that played in my era they are they had different kinds of careers um you know monitor early\nAnd there's no nothing really that that can happen that the leak still uses their names to promote even these current players I'm using their images in similar ways and it's not it's not a bad thing is you know I'm not saying that the league has taken advantage of the guys I just think that the guys are really kind of woken up\nAnd realize wow you know it'd be great they're still continue to use our images are brand wouldn't it be nice if we could come up with some programs as well that the guys can use the the ... the hall of fame can use to promote the game and to help communities or help some of our retired players as well\nUm and pay these guys a stipend and um and so it's really I just don't think that uh the story is out there I don't think people really understand what's going on and looks like a bunch of rich guys are actually asking for more money and that's not the case at all\nMy time was some question whether that letter was never intended to be released for that matter even sent in the NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and it's become more Smith from the same mistake or how do you go public were you among those who later so they never agree to\nYou know commissioner Roger Goodell and more Smith from the same thing or how do you go public were you among those who later so they never Greta Van ...\nNo I'm not one of the guys that um\nThat any of that but I I was surprised that the letter became public\nUm we had several phone calls with a lot of guys that were mentioned in that letter um every weekend for for a couple of weeks and we talked about what was going to be in the letter but we didn't get a ... I didn't get a chance to see the letter before it went out\nAnd I was shocked that it was public you know I really thought this was going to be something that was going to be handled quietly hum and talked about what the commissioner and demar Smith at the players association and we'd be able to you know have a nice friendly conversation about it but that that didn't happen um but I'm I'm actually in some ways I'm Glad that\nIt is it turned out the way it is because you know now I'm Talking to you guys about it and we're educating bans about it um and and hopefully you know people will understand what the challenges are\nFrom like you know the you know the NFL when it comes to money nothing stays quiet but those owners to yeah I Know uh you know one of the problem is that the problem is the one thing that bothered me about it and and I talk to you about this right after it happened\nIs that some of the guys who signed it into your frankly a right to strike Lakers are members of the things that was called the quarterback club the broke the back of the union effort in\nTo win their federal courts the lawsuit ... strike\nA when you when the league appeal\nAnd those dirty sales a revenue was supposed to go to fund that the unions appeal to fight the leaves the field\nAnd then the league being smart signed the ... the top twenty or so quarterbacks and a few other stars like the like Eric and I believe on sale as well so in a way it just seems to be contradiction you mean on one hand some of these guys are now saying that\nThey need these pensions and so forth or or what should be getting some compensation a Thirty Years' ago when the fight was on they jumped the fence when he is sort of making that you've been involved in several those strikes when you were playing\nWell I I I Know no both those guys and um and I know a lot of those guys that were on that quarterback club and um I Know that they would never do anything that they felt was going to be bad for all players\nSo I I Know I Know I'm Eric and it's gotten to know him better since ... since our plane days I Know that he would never do anything\nTo damage an opportunity for all players or even a even this letter we talked about it and several several times and you know guys were saying well we don't want to look like the hall of famers are not part of it and he would remind them guys this is about all players who just got to start with the whole thing was so um [noise]\nI I you know I don't know what was going on back then and it would definitely know that there was no social media there was no way for the conversations to get across the country in a short period of time uh and you know that would be a good question to ask of Eric and\nDepressingly live with the past year [noise]\n[laughter]\nWe're not dead but at the end of our show you like to thank our\nGuest Mike ...

made it somewhat easier but it's it's never easy to let go of so\nI mean I was caught and certainly consider myself very blessed because of the fact that I had the opportunity to play a four one K. and my whole career I Know and not only one team I mean I play with the New York Yankees with a\nWhich is certainly one of the best things that you could I Would play for in my mind I tend to be a little bit by about it but [laughter]\nI mean it was it was awesome I was very blessed with the opportunity to play and being part of of some great teams and planning in many World Series a and having an opportunity to help some good years are often individual player\nA so it is very hard to let go of that I mean there's not a lot of things that I can compare\nIn the you know quote unquote real were world that I can say you know I can compare with the with the rush of of\nYou know being a major league baseball player and have that crime and how the competition on a daily basis you know facing a guy you know throwing Ninety five miles an hour or two and not knowing if you're going to be that go to the game or the hero of the game you know to have the fans you know\nA shouting your name and to live and you know to overcome adversity enough to slow you know in the game of baseball pitchers you a lot about life\nIn a very short period of time and uh it's it's it's a good guess exhilarating and it is it's a it's a great it's a great job [laughter] or to have the opportunity to do that for the time that I did\nA it was great and I certainly very hard to to go about\nYour latest album moving forward which has been nominated for Latin Grammys a collaborative effort with some green aren't as like Bruce Springsteen and\nDave ties and you played with great players in baseball as well I've always found greatness Hannah commonality to it and we know probably what it is in sports but how about in the music theory once the commonality green artist saw have\nWell I

a matter of fact he was being presented with the starting to walk of fame\nUh and uh I certainly would take the work of one of the presenters which was you know none of the life of the great Barry Manilow and he said something\nThat I made a lot of sense to me he said you know a great player the difference between a great player and a good player is a great player you know something about him you know something about his personality\nOr about his sense of humor about his uh ... it's something about him inside of him when he place you know it kind of like comes out you know\nThrough through the instrument a and I think you know that quality I figure if they wound up his finds you know the good players from the ... the great players added to the fact that I think a great player makes everything makes everybody play around him better\nUh I think you know the the group it it's more of a sense of a group\nOr in baseball I remember playing with great players like Derek Jeter you know and I think the fact that he made everybody else around him play better you know I think that to me that was the uh the fact that was the thing that made the difference between him that's a great player and ... and any other place that I played around\nWilliams is joined us on sports byline again\nThey made the difference between him that's a great player and ... and then the other day that I

outstanding musician as well you know let's talk about greatest for just a second because you said something\nAt the end of the last segment that uh I remember talking to Michael Jordan about the about the great players and he said something he said when the game is on the line I Want to be the one to determine the outcome\nAnd if I succeed I Want the glory if I fail I'll take the blame that is also another attribute of a great players are not Bernie\nYeah I think so you know kicking the responsibilities are and I wanted to meet our guard to just shot in the spotlight I think it's you know\nIt actually\nYou know backing it up as well or figure that's a great a great a that's a great point of it I mean uh I think that there are some people that have great talent and up but they're they're shy of the spotlight they know they don't want the ball to them you know and the moment of truth\nAh you know some of these other guys you know there have been proven or people you know obviously like echo Jordan you know anywhere so you know pick your chicken responsibility for that moment of the game and he being the one to pick the team to the end of it is certainly a qualifies as a sign of a great player as well\nYou know you're absolutely right about to him making other players around him better and I think the other thing too that I found with Mike going on when I was talking to him and I think even about Reggie Jackson and others is it they understand from a moment to moment basis what needs to be done in order to be able to be successful in Michael's case it wasn't always scoring he may be die for a\nA ball on the on the floor or maybe he and find the hot handled the team made that was out there on the floor with him and I've always found that that was very very unique would you agree with that assessment\nYeah you think your your develop a certain awareness of of your surroundings and a daughter were in office it's like a game slows down for you I agree with that you know I think there\nAre so many players you know with a quality and it really it really makes you know everybody around him a lot better because everybody has an opportunity to to\n... to ... you know that player allows for that to happen as well\nWere you always comfortable in New York was that bright spotlights some players are some players or not but I always sense that that was not a problem for berny Williams\n[noise] well I think you know the the one thing that really worked for me was the fact that I wasn't really trying to I I really wasn't talked to the volunteer information I think I might not know most most of the most of the years my motto was you know shut up a play\nAnd I think I always took a lot of ... on the way my talking on the field and uh maybe leading by example you know I I learned from great guys or or what I was a rookie gosh what Don mattingley and uh and people like that you know they weren't really very rah rah guys in the clubhouse you know just being very loud but when\nYou knew something was missing were they were not in the light up\nAnd and I think I I I Try to more myself after ... like that you know they're being

Sports Illustrated author and correspondent for real sports with Brian gumbo\nOn HBO and it was unreal sports that I saw a piece that he did recently about the future of newspapers particularly the sports sections and what's happening to them praying you might just kind of go over what you did in that report\n[noise] well it's very simple run and I think everybody has to mate with it on on some level that\nThe Internet has has just killed a mystery because nobody has been able to figure out how to make money on the Internet by the same token everybody uses the Internet\nUm news coverage it's also magazines like ... just killed gourmet magazine yesterday which I think it's been around for like eighty five years\nUm and and even local television has taken a hit and it's it's all because of any habits and what happens all the time and evolutionary and yet nobody knows what's gonna happen where we're going to go with the the business of journalism in sports journalism specifically\nWire newspapers in this shape did they just not adjusted times\nWell I think part of it I really do I remember years ago when I was a young man with his years ago [noise] going England and being how much more impressed by\nReading on how they were much more candid and much more humor you know you want to read them and I think our newspapers have\nMade so much money for so long I mean these were papers ten years ago were mad if they only make twenty percent they just made ought to kind of money right but it was real money\nSo they didn't make an effort to improve themselves to keep up with the taste of the younger generation I think that is all through on the other hand Ron I'm not sure that the newspapers that then you know written by Shakespeare\nOr Edgar Allan Poe that they could have figured out a way to blow up the attack of the Internet\nSpecifically when it comes to sports departments tell everybody what's been happening to the sports departments across the country and newspapers\n[laughter] this is another thing if it's that the circle guy thing when you're not making money so well we gotta do is cut back\nWe're going to fire some people in the sports department and get rid of a columnist who may be making the most money and we're not going to cover as many thing and of course then not as many people do it every day for [laughter]\nI mean we tried to get rid of the worst thing you do is get recovered and that's what newspapers have been doing that not just with sports sections but [laughter]\nBut with the whole paper I mean which is in and said well you're you're cannibalizing yourself\nOr whatever like the New York times I'm On a political pay everybody loves a columnist you may not agree with them but they're terrific and yet the New York times strapping sports columnist\nThat four or five only got two and George fed the wonderful writers Seventy years old ... forever [noise]\nSo I to me it just makes no sense whatsoever what you want to do is pick up your sports coverage make it\nA morning a more controversial yeah that's what people want and sports they they can get to work off the Internet but they want people who argue and turn into an athlete not just you know like some talk radio with just screaming but I Can't do that\nWhile the other thing that newspapers cannot do the Frank is they can have the immediacy that the Internet does or not the words and you pointed this out in your piece on HBO real sports story could break and it can be updated as many as a dozen times before the the newspaper will come out the next day and and that's the problem that I don't know how newspapers get over that\nIt can be updated as many as a dozen times before the the newspaper will come out the next day and and that's the problem that I don't know how newspapers get over that\nWas that they can ... that that's how you you you can handle that sort of immediacy so what you've got to do is be nimble and be quick to discuss the issue if the game ends well let's let's hear about it what what what are the controversy what do you think\nI I mean I think it was papers can play offs and news but no they cannot in any way shape or form compete with the immediacy of the Internet but show Ron we went to the same thing when television came in and it can be they should pick up the paper to find out what happened in the game well all of a sudden you could get\nSome guy tight with a typewriter to say that somebody at a fly ball to left field you fly\nSo ah yeah we've dealt with this before and I've learned to sort of roll with the punches a television was his dad was afternoon newspapers or was it a kind of see whether the Internet is going to be available newspapers\nWhat about the u._s._a. today and its style of being very compact in very short on India particles I mean in the sports section they always have the front page story that is in Denver and goes to the second page\nBut does that added to the people the way they are looking at sports the way they're getting their information that they're you know they're into thirty second soundbite type of approach to getting sports\nIt can remember when when um USA Today started a new ... who was the creative genius behind it\nHis idea was that it would all be short cake I Know and they found that people didn't want that that that they needed some substance and look at USA Today compared to what it was twenty twenty five years ago\nOr the article so much longer there is\nA much more commentary than there used to be um he must have today is is is great for people on the road I mean when I travel it's wonderful you pick it up you get a quick picture\nBut I think it's a I think it's one office they say in England I mean it it's sort of different from all other newspapers in the sense that it really appeals to travelers more than anything else you don't meet many people who say my hometown newspaper is USA Today\nSo I think it's sort of an unusual situation but I think that even USA Today has to have catcher writing um sharper points of view I think if it's going to survive it too has has it's got to pick it up a little bit\nI seriously wonder where the newspapers have any future at all not because I'm against that I really think there's a there's a generation of people that have\nGrown up are relying on the Internet reading off the Internet Facebook tweeting all of those things\nAnd so as they get a little bit older that's the only thing they're going to new or even want to know when it comes to information and maybe an older crowd will but I I just don't know that there'll be acclimated to newspapers and I don't know how newspapers overcome that\nOr or even a reinvent themselves in order to make them viable\nWell I think you reinvent yourself and and I basically agree with what you're saying I think everything points in that direction\nUm that uh you you reinvent yourself by going on to the Internet but I don't want people that have not liable to invent so far as how to make money off the Internet era member I had a newspaper the national right to okay it was a terrific newspaper we went out of business\nOr in Nineteen Ninety One because we couldn't distribute it which is to say it costs too much money to distribute it in a way we're kind of out of the times coming out and they say that if your if your paper just stayed around for a while\nFor the Internet my answer is yeah it would be great for the Internet but it would be great for us [laughter] I'm sure we'll add a bigger audience that everything else but\nNobody's figured out how to get people to read as on the on the Internet and I I think I mean there are a lot of ideas but the simple one has cable TV comes to mind when\nI tell them they just started you know with your rabbit ears are areas and everything um [noise] you you got free television right and then along came cable and you had to pay for what she was previously gotten for free\nAnd we do and and so it's it's not impossible to suggest that people will pay\nFor news on the Internet the way they have it in the past but they're going to pay just to find out what the score is no that that's that's sort of in the public domain but we'll say will pay for I think\nIs is a good interesting articles investigative journalism\nA God I Hope we don't lose that that would be the worst thing of all\nSo the ending and we talked about it again I Want to remind you about the award winning sports byline usa website if you want to listen to us anytime online or you have to do is go

I mean if it's not I mean it's a foreign foreign thing hockey when it starts up down there but they were able uh down in Florida they have a lot of New Yorkers are a lot of people from French Canada the you know ... down there and spend a lot of time\nSo you're able to get that part of the crowd but it it was a learning curve I think in in all the new markets\nThe antithesis of that of course is Montreal where the Canadians I mean that's like playing in the journal hockey or is there are also um I I guess a factor in which you're fearful that the fans will turn on you because they are so knowledgeable they've had so many great championship seasons there is that a totally different environment for a player bill\nDoping pressure there is nothing like it Montreal and there was a ... I mean from a guy like me a role players the pressure's gone to the extreme but if\nYou're one of the big name guys and you go in there a lot of the I mean which much is given much is expected and that sort of the philosophy that they live by in Montreal and you feel you're in the paper\nIm guys and you go in there a lot of ... I mean which much is given much is expected to love sort of a philosophy that they live by a Montreal and you feel you're in the papers every day and they expect\nExpect to win and they know what's going on so I think from that standpoint from a player it it's tough when there's no place tougher when you lose some somewhere like that but if you are able to win I don't think there's any plays better because I mean you are yeah the keys to the city if you're able to win like that and you'll be kicked out of the city if you don't win [laughter]\nWhat did the Europeans bring to the game\nSkill majority of skill a puck possession or they've been able to adapt and change the game and they made it the best way to get in the world right I mean\nBefore that we now have the talent pool of all the world and the national hockey league and everyone I mean with Russia or the people are able to freely come and go now and be part of our\nBe part of the NHL and so I think you have the best talent in the world and I think that's what makes it I mean so good for one of the player if you get in you know that you're you're truly playing against the best and\nAh they brought different dimensions to a game that maybe we didn't have puck handling stick handling and we the Canadians and Americans always always been known as the feisty group so I think you have a combination though\nWe've got about thirty seconds left but it was always said the knock on the Europeans was that they didn't like the physicality of the game has that changed\nIt's starting to [noise] I think in some aspects they they don't get they get away from it and that's always going to be into the system but I think it will never changed completely but the bottom that get overly come over and out of clay junior hockey but one of the play junior hockey are able to adapt\nMuch quicker and you're seeing more and more of that\nBill I Want to thank you very much for spending some time and talking a little hockey with us I Love talking about it and you bring such insight having played it for Thirteen seasons and of course doing a great job with the Panthers on television thanks a lot bill we'll check in with you down the road that anytime thanks for having me\nRide bill Lindsey played Thirteen seasons in the NHL a couple of times with the Panthers and of course was part of the reason why they made it to the Stanley Cup finals back in the mid nineties will take a break here come back on the other side as we continue across the country and around the world with you on sports byline [laughter]\nThis is three to eat just so\nHappy Yankees game wildcard game some idiot posted a video that is a person deliberately throwing a beer at a span right\nAfter the Yankees have\nWon the wildcard oh it was a lot of them are you sure you're on the wild they were acting like that one of the world series I don't want to say Paul Yankee fans parts of the bag slowly any pro beer for the ... we do apparently work with some debate Yankee fans\nBut we will will the ... when this new series telling me telling me about all your rings and\nThen they go to ... you know and then your baby yeah\nShe seemed to have to act like you've been here before\nThat's the thing the Yankee fans my age do celebrate while\nCars street heats with Patrick ... we see after news if five eastern on SB Nation radio\nThe nation radio next generation ... for more exclusive as we mentioned radio coverage got ourself writers nation radio downtown\nFor his followers on Twitter nation radio all the same voters' judgment\n...

bruises that he can talk about life as it actually is as well as shocking basketball and certainly you can talk basketball after twelve very successful\nNBA seasons in three times in the NBA champion as you know we're coming up and did you ever think you can play in the NBA was at a goal of viewers Bruce\nThat it didn't become a goal until after my sophomore year in college for a while I'm One of my co to\nGorge and he was an assistant ... you know saying you've got a chance to make some money and the and the sport prior to that point I never even thought about professional sports I always thought I wanted to come back and do something with kids and lack of boys and Girls Club or something like that but once that wants to see with planet you\nKnow I understood that I did have a talent or it wasn't the best talent but it wasn't worth I have room for improvement so as\nLong as our breath and I was able to continuously try to improve on that talent\nYou know as well as I Do with the exception of maybe they're truly great talents that you can see of the kids coming out of college it's a very subjective kind of profession and I'm just wondering when you were coming out did you expect to get drafted and when you didn't know what does that do to your confidence\nWell I I really didn't expect it I heard that I might be a sleeper but I hadn't even made any contact with any organizations or anything so that was a a long shot as as far as I was a fair for me to get drafted per se\nBut I Would always hear about how they talked about the other guys today are rider who says hairs prior Russell\nBlowout law and so it was it was enough for me to say hey okay well if I have to continue to work to get better I have no problem with that because I think in the process of working to get better sometimes you do actually end up getting better and you have a whole another perspective on things\nAnd maybe if I was thrown in the limelight early on who knows how it would have accepted it would I Would I look at it as as something that was God given or would I think I accomplished everything in my life\nI had a conversation with Chris Mullen one time and you know he grew up on the playgrounds in New York and I said to him I said did Chris you know you played with a lot of great legends on the playground why didn't they make it into the NBA and professional basketball\nI said to him I said to Chris you know you played with a lot of great legends on the playground why didn't they make it into the NBA and professional basketball and he said something to me Bruce it was interesting you spent\nA lot of those kids had talent but they didn't know how to play a organizational basketball they didn't know how to fit into the system and I I think that's very true statement what is the difference between somebody that makes it and somebody that didn't because you you talk to you mentioned some names there of guys that were just bus in the NBA\nOh well see that's the thing today ... it's not about the complete package it the the game is suffering for from a lot of different uh different aspects where\nSo many kids don't understand fundamentals of the game that's why Europe is so much further ahead of us that it was before there used to be a time where we were ahead of Europe but now as vice versa as far as I'm concerned\nBecause they're playing team basketball were blamed for individual rights\nThat we take the kid that can shoot threes for oh man he can duck or he can only read about it is we're specialists now and we're losing more and more the the complete basketball player\nThere are guys that that coming up that you remember in great great teams they just didn't laugh because they weren't as fundamentally south\nBut ... you look at it a great player like Larry Bird Magic Johnson people don't talk about how fundamentally sound they were they just talk about their talent and so here it is you have people trying to teach that talent instead of teaching the fundamentals\nYou get the fundamentals then everything else come in and comes into play it will it will be much more beneficial to the kids than what's going on today\nWhat's your favorite memory amount playing in France\n[laughter] meeting tone at a young age not a foreign rates for me because\nIt allowed me to get better\nI I didn't have the the the the\nThe desire as I did once I got over there I I really understood that it was serious it was it was a lot more to it than just coming out and just plain\nYou had to you know put time man and that and that's something that they do and you're you know you you have practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays ... practice twice a day and and and that that time people may say man twice a day that's too much no you go with fundamental things you know driven through the comb\nJump shots jump shot you know it's things like that work on your foot were\nSo many guys that are six tenths of they don't understand the importance of great foot work you know I look at Dwight Howard now he's getting better at it but he has one of the best teachers and again teaching them and Patrick Ewing you know they're the time were big man came into the league that is what they did they have great foot work\nBut now the man come in they want to shoot three point is not that that was something that that they could do but because of special people like Robert ory\nYou know now everybody's on for the next Robert ory to stress that the fed\n[noise] let me take you back to France with his perspective and a friend of mine that are playing hockey and was forced to start his career over in Europe and played to\nA hockey over in France and I said well what was that like after you know knowing what hockey's like in Canada in the United states is just well he was an eye opener you said the first time I'm you know we went into a game he said between periods we went in I saw players smoking and drinking wine and eating cheese season I knew I was in a different atmosphere\n[laughter] that that was the typical thing and France I mean we would come back into the arena and it would be full of smoke [laughter] and\nNobody was saying hey can we stop this it was just part of what they did and you can look at the end of two different ways hey I really enjoy this or hey I really need to improve the get outta here\n[laughter] what about the crowds themselves because a friend of mine that did play in Greece him you know Ron I almost made as much money from the coins thrown on the court and grace [laughter] my page [laughter]\nIt it you know the crowds\nWere fantastic it was it was like play off by idols atmosphere\nOr over there for regular guys and one gentleman told me this he said Bruce we work hard always so that we could celebrate and support our team on that weekend and I think that's fantastic it reminds me of the college spirit March Madness he now you have these kids point out their hard on the floor\nAnd and you have these alumni the boosters just supporting them because they wanted to tear their team on\nTell me about the march Nineteen Ninety seven and your NBA debut in Miami\nI remember that day because a lot of times you have to warm up or a workout before\nThe the games begin as I said you know and now I was talking to mark strict last out I'm a warm up after after I mean I'm a do my work out after we play because just in case I get in I don't want to be tired and mark let me get ... you're not getting in and them I just sat there listening\nAnd so ... we're playing Houston Rockets hat I get an went live committed and some change to go and you know I got a block sat that game but as I say that I remember most is damned Mali was chair and me on any looks that mark strict ... says huh he's not getting in a he's a young fellow I think he made the right decision\nYou had a reputation of being one of the best perimeter defenders or in the NBA and I remember talking one time was the late Dennis Johnson who was a great defender as well and he said to me Ron he said playing defense is a mental approaches a mental attitude can you explain a little bit further when he was talking to members\nWell the mental aspect of the game as understanding that okay he may have made that shot right now but it was a difficult shot he made\nA you gave him and it was difficult shot a five more ties maybe makes for a more of them and then you're on the downhill because it's all about your will can you enforce it will upon somebody even though they made the shot will you continue to be there and put a hand up on each and every shot\nI was watching some of the guys planned this year a Michael pitchers against Kobe Bryant\nAnd he was making Kobe work for a lot of the south but I'll wanting to tickle a play\nCalled we went up to shoot and he didn't put a hand up and I said that is a no no because oh he made is one good look at a basket to get going and prior to that he had been struggling now you've allowed him to get going so from that mental aspect that they\nHave rested on that particular play and he shouldn't have and and as you know the Lakers win the finals\nI Want to make an observation here and if I'm wrong amount of please feel free to correct me but uh the spurs when three NBA championships than I Would assume the not only winning an NBA championship in San Antonio ... repeating as they did was probably a little bit easier in San Antonio than it might have been", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort
