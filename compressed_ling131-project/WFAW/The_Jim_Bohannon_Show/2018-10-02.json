couple of drives tonight\nLet an eight plays sixty yard game winning drive kept up by\nKarim ... touched down into the play that everybody's talking about the play that as they are already showing over and over on ESPN NFL Network was\nA third and five where things look dire and he was able to throw the football with his opposite hand leptin and get it to ... kill who we get the first out one of many place and I we mentioned the third is to me the second is thirty or he scramble outside of the pocket\nAnd sat they had during the games that I had over a hundred and fifty two yard outside of the pocket passing which was the most\nNFL history which is crazy on the wrong when he was able to get it was like it was college Patrick moms\nAnd begin to do to be wider comparisons Tibet farmers well when he got drafted by Andy Reid who would know you know in in the comparison he is thrown out within because some of the place he may tonight we're not now so far as career the interceptions haven't been there\nThat's been amazing thing is well he is actually for the most part made good decision doesn't mean he has made bad ones that got lucky yeah there are probably two interceptions

the game behind the Steelers that that was a book for the last few years we've gotten past that um but they are to protest in Jacksonville at home and then on the road at New England\nOr this became a lot about the same I mean there are a pattern rooms facing probably has that definitely is tougher than the test it will be good to have tonight the Jacksonville will really give him a fight ex we can really see what the home just made a bad\nAnd then you know tape change to play the patriots pretty well and they beat of last year in New England or try and do it again or if you came through those

easier placed O'Reilly has\nThe superstar battery for you a rally auto parts that are hearts better prices every day we'll get to the trash the day in just a second what Andy read a short while ago spoke and was at the podium in Denver following the chiefs\nTwenty seven twenty three when over the Denver Broncos and here's a little bit of what you had to say about the compromise when and the performance of his quarterback\nWith although that was a great when I'm against it football team here of answers on a tremendous job with with the Broncos and 'cause it was just overall is a great game before we get started though I Want to congratulate Mitch for his\nFour hundred game down here so that's quite an amazing feat patrols hold this and a four games man that's a that's a whole lot of years for redheads he's done great um\nAnd then back to the game so you can point to a lot of people I like I told the team this was really a team win so low and our defense and needed to tighten up they tightened up before the house for at the end of the game the blitz it then you know next thing happened\nOn the mic turns it into a long field and inevitably it ended up in our favor and then on the opposite side yeah Patrick and [laughter] you know I've worked real hard\nOn that Lufthansa throw you know make sure you do that but there are some amazing plays Aaron long heritage situations were while there were just shooting ourselves in the foot\nWith penalties and we'd have a big game and then have a penalty in there and you know it didn't hurt us but um [noise] and then you came to this uh Irish cream just coming coming out and uh I'm having a a big day to a hundred and twenty plus yards\nCarrying the football and and I'm I'm In a tremendous job so\nBut I mean I can keep going there but it it's a special teams I did a heck of a job and you need to show or you know we've talked about having a lead and everybody's out about what if you're behind how's it going to react how's Patrick going to react and so um we got a taste of that ...\nGrow simple\nYeah we've seen it a ... percent of the practice but not under those conditions right there\nHe was a lot of you\nYou are no cause\nYeah so what he's accomplished kid he was confident before that it is not going to be will be overconfident from but\nI think it it tells you that tells everybody really the ... you're you're within striking distance or you know you have that opportunity to where the guy that can make play the guys around may plays too so this wasn't just Patrick put some ice which Washington\nOr you know while\nI'm I'm just trying to look for another place to be honest with you I mean it's a it's when you step back you oh that was pretty good um but really are just trying to figure out the next play that he could scramble running mate plays slapped\nWith some of the anti Reid post game tonight in Denver as she's got the victory you heard of a joke in there that you know you tie he did the same thing last week a after moms had to play ran around for like twenty five yards him through a dark to Chris Connelly for the touched on the back of the ... said I you know I told him not want Egypt again tonight about the left handed\nA past there on on third and five and that's that play in the second is thirty are the two that are just\nHe said I you know I told him that want Egypt again tonight about the left handed\nA past there on on third and five and that's that play in the second in thirty are the two that are just absolutely a incredible not often you you can see a quarterback make plays like that and big reason why the reason really they were able to win this game tonight in Denver\nLet's get to our trash of the day we read each and every night here on the go stand\n[laughter] garbage\nGets the trash of the day [laughter]\nOn the gold standard [laughter] All right\nBob ... edition of the trash today they will get back into some more thoughts on the Monday

standard on SB Nation radio and on the nascent radio dot com reveal Riley auto parts studios fears that like [noise]\nBack in here on the gold standard [noise]\nI'm trying to say about it we just talk about in the homes the rest of the show can I just descended sorry about ... the rest of the night I'll be fine with doing\nJust fine just\nFine talking about Showtime a home without ... Thomas a little bit we'll get to that and the second as well as for the fun night here on SB Nation radio ought to play a this is one of the touchdowns sounded tonight for ...\n[laughter]\nPatrick my home's\nFinal numbers for him this evening twenty eight forty five three hundred and four yards\nAnd a touchdown Karimov Nineteen Gary's\nOne hundred and Twenty one yard touchdown as well basketball was also would run for on touch and I'll go way back in the second quarter that was the first touchdown a for Kansas City in fact in this football game they come back from a ten point deficit in a\nPretty pretty remarkable I mean I I could go on and on with some of the the crazy numbers that he put up in terms of historical trends in the NFL like another one for you that I don't think I'd missions so far it's an eye on the show is this one from stats\nIncorporated patch your mom's five and I was the start remember he played last year as well\nPatrimony five and I was a starter in the NFL the chiefs of score twenty five or more points that all five of his games the only other quarterback to lead his team to twenty five or more points in each of his first five career starts was Kurt Warner in Nineteen Ninety nine\nThat's just one of them that that's the crazy thing is there's so many of these whether it's the the fourteen touchdowns in order sections as well\nI mean I can write off a couple of ways come from James Palmer of NFL Network\n... homes is just one of nine quarterbacks and the super bowl\nEra to start the Reno in a season and throw ten or more touchdowns in the first three games of the season for the previous eight went on to win MVP six of the previous eight lead their team to us are walkers\nYeah I understand we're only a quarter way of the season but what he is doing\nEight lead their team to us or well parents\nYeah I understand we're only a quarter way of the season but what he is doing has been done by so few if not nobody else in some of the in some of these crazy stats and I understand certainly there's always the carry out of injury because to some extent\nI I you can correct me if I'm wrong because you're you're in Texas and\nBody and it may maybe I'm overstepping my boundaries you're being a cheese fan\nI remember the hype last year after the first what six or seven games for the Sean Watson and he was playing at an MVP type level guy and he was the big story of the national football league right that was you know but he was okay here we are quarter the way of the season I Would say certainly on individual player standpoint\nMy homes has been the biggest story in the national football league just from an individual player perspective a quarter the way I think that's very fair to say\nAnd I would also say though his first for compared to what was it at first for seven\nIt's even a notch higher and maybe maybe that's me being a cheese but I Would say it's not tire because one their foreign oil into\nThese numbers or even better than what the shuttle Watson and while the shots in may have had the crazy game where they put they lost to the sea hawks by the way that game the one that everybody was talking about they lost let's not forget they lost that football game in which he was unbelievable gets the Seahawks unfortunately got hurt in practice that next that same week after\n... homes not only is putting of crazy numbers patrimony homes is also\nHaving some absurd\nMemorable plays that are just freaked athlete type of plays it virtually no other quarter back in the NFL can make other than last week I Would argue Aaron Rodgers on that one throw you had to Chris Connelly I Would argue today the left hand to pass\nAnd all that something that we saw from Brett Farr back in the day like to me what he has done is still the most impressive start to a quarter backs NFL career I'll go out and say it any quarterback NFL history star their career and I know a star of your career doesn't make your career or by all means\nBut it certainly beats the alternative and right now all we can see is what he's done and what he has done has been damn impressive and historical\nYeah innocence I'm okay how do I go I mean 'cause when big big came into the league he with with fourteen and no ... because it seemed like Fifteen and when and the years\nThan I mean that but he didn't have the numbers asthma homes tag that'd be a different\nThat's not just the way in in ... it's a combination of these freak plays that he's doing ... but also yeah the ... because it it goes both ways you can you go to some people out there that say All right the stats are crazy for everybody in the NFL right now Michel ... for God's sakes just through six touched down so I get some people want to say that\nBut they don't care if you want to say that than I was there I I test it for me a little bit if you your eye test guy he's now Donna initially people said All right he hasn't played anybody good\nHe hasn't gone on the road played against good defense like what\nIf you want to keep making excuses why you're not buying into um you're running out of the what what's the excuse now honestly if you're excused now is that hey I Want to see them do it in the postseason that's fine but it's also ridiculous because what's what's let him have that opportunity at even it's not like he's performed bad in the postseason he's never played in the postseason\nYou're running out of things to say about him if you're trying to doubt it if you want to knock any read that's fine you wanna knock postseason and say let's see the chief you know they start off good like this every year and that is the aim to read it when as a September Super Bowls I totally agree with you believe me she said will be the first to tell you that\nBut don't take it out on ... homes in terms of knock wood he's done already to this point in time that stupid\nIt is that it is kind of dumb I mean is this man has uh taking care of the football has inside the bottle over no zero ... fourteen says a pass as Meghan away or to to to lend\nThe games I mean the end it coming into this either use it um a gift city that she's the fence is horror\nThat no one is and that's and that's why it's still on under the words chiefs in Super Bowl I won't do it I Will not or you can correct I have not I may have done not summer homes and at this point in time I have been absolutely one hundred percent correct by the way yeah All right\nI I I hundred percent correct ... you can go back far before even worked here back when the homes was drafted and people said they were fools for drafting him instead of just Sean Watson\nI understand well fast for four years from now and have even clear picture for right now I can promise you the teams aren't regretting drafting homes instead to Shawn Austin promise you that I'm not saying Texas fans are regretting it yet although a couple more weeks of this maybe you are\nYeah uh I'm Ed Muskie perform in the way he's the foreman in the cheesecake when most people can't say I'm a ... as a ... yeah\nYou're right the defense is why can't under the word Super Bowl and chiefs together because this defense is so bad\nAnd you're in tonight yeah they came up with a stop when they needed to know what the defense is atrocious and they're going to get ... back at some point but some of the stuff's tonight has nothing to do with ... I mean you have linebackers missing tackles all over the plane ... stop pitiful tackling so that's a huge concern and that's why they aren't [noise]\nIt it's weird they keep doing this I think just naturally you have to say they will be a Super Bowl contender I'm not ready to say there are considered yeah but\nNobody out there they're undefeated and nobody else in the AFC scares you the patriots here you based on history ... but we've also seen them\nPlay the patriots if they play like they did this past week against the dolphins and yeah but the patriots or like the patriots from the first few weeks the no that doesn't scare you the jags showed that there are beautiful every team has father's not one team in the seat that you say is unbeatable\nNot the chief not the patriots not the titans if not you know what I mean not not the jagged yeah not the dolphins\nYeah I mean everybody can everybody can be be beats in in a a scene\nAnd like you say about the cheese on many key in assumption that really that interception changed a whole aspect of the gays especially in the second half\nWay bedroom house took over and drove the cheese down the food in school and it says now and then that the ball back and then drove this drug that she was down to the school it says on the gifts I mean the beef is made Ki stuff for the night is is yeah you question the beef is\nMoving forward with the Kansas City chiefs are they so we're both it's ended but every every ... every top team and a U.S he has a flaw\nAnd they can be ... ... can be being is so wish away form or fashion which we've seen week by week\nBy the way just wanted to look at this number ... ... C B and this isn't fair I Want some of the Bronx for a second because they should've won this football game and", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "02"}
