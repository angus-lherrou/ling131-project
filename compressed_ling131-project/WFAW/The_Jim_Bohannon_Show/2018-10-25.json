correspondent to talk of his new book\nMr Trump's wild ride published by all points books subtitled the thrills ... screams occasional blackouts\nOf an extraordinary presidents I Love the prologue here what I should have learned in your lead up with this quote major fantastic I watched it with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled\nUnquote the first words Donald Trump spoke to you know that's the exactly right yeah\nPlease continue with what you you felt you should have learned\nSo ah what I wanted to do at the beginning of the book Jim boat is approached my audience from a posture humility because I don't think anyone who writes about American politics right now who comes across as a full blown no at all or at aspiring no at all it's going to have that core credibility that our audience can feel\nIn touch and relate to you have to understand and you have to communicate that you're gonna miss things and even as someone who is professional inexperienced\nAnd been around the track is I certainly have been you can and do miss things and if you do you owe to read or a sense of personal accountability so that whole prologue is what I should have learned that I didn't learn or took me longer than in retrospect I think I should have taken me to learn\nSo with that sentence that you just read and I don't want to give it all away but I'll give listeners a sense I take that sentence apart a deconstructed almost word by word and said to the readers here with things\nIf the listeners a sense I take that sentence apart a deconstructed almost word by word\nAnd said to the readers here with things that Donald Trump was telling me about himself identified only taking the time to look at that sentence deconstructed and ask myself some basic that's super high level psychological analytical questions but just basic questions what is he trying to say what does he mean how's he coming at you I\nWould have learned about eighty percent of what I came to know about Donald Trump after sixteen months on the campaign trail if I just paid closer attention to that very first sentence and one example of it major fantastic what is that about\nWell it was a press conference before rally in Bertrand Michigan early August of twenty Fifteen so long long ago feels like a million years ago [noise]\nAnd it was the first big rally that Trump had after the first Republican debate and why did he say major fantastic because he noticed me in the pool of\nReporters covering its press conference before\nThe rally and I was the only network news corresponded in that group of reporters and the first one he'd ever seen any of his press conferences so major fantastic wasn't about me it was about you're here\nYou're a network corresponded I'm getting more important that's why it's fantastic that Trump\nI should have learned a paid attention to what he was telling me what what is that those two words actually mean and this sense as I say in the book of adjunct evil exuberance that is part and parcel of the way Donald Trump thinks about the world talks about the world and views himself with in the world\nAt your table exuberance\nAll the time in every example and then I deconstruct the rest of the sense and I say to myself they're all sorts of these great clues that Donald Trump was essentially laying before me and\nIf I had taken more time in more curious about\nThis different kinds of political actor and has different ways of dealing with language I have learned a lot more than it would have taken me nearly so long as it did during the campaign just to sort of practice lock well\nWith all due respect to you and do all the other reporters now you've covered\nAh let's see for presidency for three news outlets yeah let's face it this\nWas an entirely new experience for any of you you just were not prepared for an eye on them does I mean let let's let's just do your look at the at the circumstances of this man I I was wondering can you compare him not to any other president ... but not even any other governmental leader any other\nKey public figure that you've ever recovered can you compare him to anybody\nKnow why can't I mean he is one of a kind in the sense that he is this very large personality and as I write in the book\nHe was a fully formed celebrity before he got into politics politics as we've learned can make people into celebrities Ronald Reagan though in retrospect people think he was a big celebrity he was a B list movie actor he had some recognition for his General Electric\nUh sponsored radio editorials but he was not a fully formed\nTime celebrity Donald Trump was he was also a developer of real estate golf courses he had brand identity not just domestically but globally he checked a lot of different boxes\nHe was a completely different actor and different\nCompletely different instincts and orientation to the underlying rules of the game\nAnd I write it early on in the book that there was a kind of school of rock improvisation if you love that movie as much as I Do Jack Black or that Trump brought to politics and I describe myself in the book is one of those fussy parents in that movie those uptight parents who want to\nUm school to be as it always was rigid following the rules everything by the book\nAnd Jack Black topples all that and the movies school of rock on behalf of rock and roll and music Donald Trump in his own ways toppled a lot of the rules and I was one of these fussy parents say don't you know the rules why aren't you following the rules and\nWhy can't you a color but in the inside the lions and that sort of thing and it's I mean while to get out of that it took me awhile to get out of it and say you know what\nThe lines are different he's drawing them and look at all these people lining up to see it this is a new experience and\nTake it in you know we're going to have to pause on that note I Want to come back we're they look at how some other Republicans learn the lessons with major Garrett in a moment\n\nRendering of that conversation and I explained in the book that it it was important to Trump on two levels and hard to read\nIn one respect one he was grateful that\nPresident Obama took him seriously as a president elect said you won and you're going to fill out your a cabinet and you're White House staff\nAnd you should rely on yourself I'm\nPaying you the respect you've already earned by being in this office with me and I'm telling you as someone who is filled the slots cabinet and otherwise you're going to get all this pressure and you get all these people yanking your chain to try to do things\nGo with what you think you believe in what you think you know what works for you president elect Trump appreciated that like wow I'm already being taken seriously and giving ... given ... real practical advice by sitting president\nAnd the other hand he gets this Michael Flynn thing\nAnd he wanders well are you sitting up here or what is this about why you're just picking this one guy had you know I like him you know he was a surrogate of mine\nI knew he fired him President Obama when he was head of the defense intelligence agency because Michael Flynn\nBudget weren't being aggressive enough on counterterrorism I didn't think so either so I agree with Flynn not you don't really had a hard time as president elect processing this bit of information and yet as the book unfolds and as we all remember\nThere was a very short and very turbulent time with Michael fled he was bad news\nAnd it didn't work out and in retrospect now President Trump looks back on that in the main as a valuable conversation\n... major Garrett our guest Mr Trump's wild ride

of them went off and now the FBI almost completely stopped I Would imagine investigating them and it's running around trying to find out who said he bombs I think and it happens right before the

the the crown prince and now that we of course have some uh later perspective on this chapter your daughter\nSo I'm One of the things that our listeners gained from our conversation demos is that the answer to this question do we really need another Trump book which is not an unfair question and I would say in this sense we do why\nBecause we need a book about and that's the reason I wrote it and it was difficult to do while I was doing my day job don't take it wasn't a book about what's actually happened what decisions have been made\nWhat if you want to call them this in the White House certainly does what series of accomplishments of occurred in the first Eighteen months and whether you think of them as accomplishments or not things did happen that are likely going to be with this country to five ten Twenty years from now one of the things that is with us is this dramatic shift\nCarried out by president elect Trump there was a good offices of Jared Kushner his son in law during the transition to start a relationship with the Saudi regime and fundamentally alter America's approach\nTo that kingdom in that geopolitical read region shift away from Iran shift away from the Iran

together the media has a responsibility [noise]\nJust a simple as just the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes fall syntax and stores\nPresident Trump speaking at a rally tonight in most of the Wisconsin and of course it is there is a certain amount of irony obviously attached to the president calling for a a civil tone or it would have been a lot I think a\nA better for him had he not engaged in some of the tone that he is set in the past because that would have given a clear and moral superiority\nOr in contrast to a party which has stood by and a centrally in some cases are actually whipped up the Bob and in other cases that just sat back and ignored the mob but uh again the president is often hard pressed to ah\nTo curb is Todd so as a result he finds himself a dipped into the mix with the with the other is hear your thoughts on that a doctor Uber's we go back to some calls here\nWell I think I think when we talk about President Trump or talking about actually a businessman who's a political position\nNot a politician he practiced and I think that's one of the reasons why he was and he he was not a career politician and a lot of um middle America just upset and having to deal with\nWith both parties it seemed to become kind of a ruling class and they were tired of that so they put somebody in there are different and uh\nI think they expect him to make a mistake in ... and it doesn't bother to the middle of the middle group of America so\nI I think they feel used justified and that you know say\nA I'll put it this way he makes the enemies he doesn't need to make and that would be my friends at a complete a temple to David in San Francisco hello David\nTune in to your guest sure you know it's I've I've always had a fear of a a a fear based budgets are or something I Want to stay away from and\nBeyond race and I'm Sorry fair but it's budgets\nYeah like my main a lab and you know something like\nI don't know I don't know where the term budget that send but do you\nWrite yeah go into instead cost overruns and and usually know accounting so top secret budgets fear based budgets are sitting sometimes a bad science budgets are can clearly go out of just off the register if you're trying to check the books for Congress\nAnd you discover that some program is just looking at for all its worst or you know when you get whistle blowers we the people need to whistle blowers okay and and so this idea of getting every getting Americans to start spending that money on every Willie mentally ill as opposed to this whole incident\nThe Saudis are so guilty\nThese two versions of trying to be afraid of of people seeking freedom\nYou know I guess I tried to put your comments in the context of the discussion at hand we're talking about the uh the seven pipe bombs that were delivered to today various locations I mean\nI remember the Palmer rates are you familiar with\nIt I Know and I doubt that most of the people in the audience or one of the Palmer Raids and how does that relate to what we're talking about\nWell that's out there who've got his start and it was in Woodrow Wilson's day and they had these pipe bombs that went off in Vanderbilt\nActually went off in this case pipe bombs could have gone off I trust you are not not assuming the track you down these people would not be a legitimate public expenditure this was a I mean it may be legendary expense based on fear but it's a very reasonable fear\nWell after nine eleven they invented the Patriot act and they\nCame out here I Am about to that's why they didn't call just invent the Patriot act and point of fact we face an actual attack and if we in fact sometimes spend money because of fear if it's they founded fear I personally have no problem with it not can we go overboard I suppose I don't feel any particular instances we did Dr Huber\n[noise] I think anything that that is reactionary that causes us to give up our rights for quote unquote safety is a bad mistake I think we have to be cautious as\nCitizens and pay a lot of it as to what our government doing our politician now and we're the watchdog so I I see where he's coming from we need we need to have you made it slow down some of this knee jerk reaction and make it more of a thoughtful\nProcess new laws and and you know there are times and you know I Know it can ... that we just have to react because we all have fine yeah anything\nAlthough of course I Would note that in some cases we're not talking about taking away our rights for example we don't have a right to get on an airplane quickly\nCorrect but All right to dawn in Albany, Oregon now but hey you know getting them into Haiti\nEverything that I thought at least to me it's sounding like Sam wack job took President Trump's rhetoric for marching orders\nMaybe or maybe you decided that he would still be tried to smear conservatives we don't know\nThis is true that's true yeah and that it was like lord NATO So I don't know how much of a quote unquote white dog could could have coordinated\n... that's the thing that I think that you make a very telling point Dr humor that that this would require have required very well organized whack jobs plural and they don't come they don't tend to come in well organized groups exactly\nYeah that that that that I think to the doctor makes a very good point there that's for this to have been delivered to the manner that it was would indicate that we were talking about more than just a whack job which is even more disturbing because I Will take it they have given that we will always\nWell I I Do I Do think about it but I'm a deadly you about it right now what exactly uh\nWell this this uh these attempts to do that that will take our minds away from something else this thing is it less ... we suddenly discovered something weird like\nOh I don't know the the Saudi prince was behind these bombings or or or bombs or something weird like that this has got to go away and a couple of days I'm going to be right back back in the winter of election campaign and the caravan and all the other stuff out there so you know Linda I'm trying to think of what it was that this distract from\nAnd I don't know that and I always just look at that because these things can happen and it and we have a look back before and seen that that has been paid a seemingly and\nMade it could be how but I didn't look at all the you know you\nKnow I ... thought I again I look at it from the standpoint of if it was designed Dr Huber to take our attention off of something\nWhat would it possibly be because it clearly couldn't be the caravan which will be a story long after this bomb thing has gone away they can be the midterm elections that's Thirteen Days away and we're going to be all elections all the time leading up to that point so maybe Linda's right maybe there was an attempt to describe it is for something\nBut what could it be ah that ah that we're going to forget about it and the next couple of days which is about how long it's going to take us to forget the bombs\nExactly well historically terrorists and terrorism was used to uh oftentimes a terrorize a culture or a specific population and what that often did was you know sway people's fear of a cultural annihilation and and usually\n... those individuals up and made them move into action so if we think the idea that maybe this was a political uh the\n... and play that they're trying to get maybe more Democrats now to go to the polls that actually vote by saying look they were all targeting Democrats we almost lost a whole generation of our leaders [noise]\nAh maybe I mean as I say you were what were we we just at this juncture we just don't know I'm going to come

lord of the corn and wait till the metro mass media said it at ISIS dry show on the pipe bomb this trip so there was an amateur on the left or the right\nOr trying to make somebody look better trying to make a statement you at all that and that's I think that you're serious over history I've heard I've heard from anybody that part of the right\nWell I appreciate your a confidence it's a it's not a very well refine the theory that I have I rarely go over all of the the various possibilities it covers a lot of territory uh but I guess what you could conclude most\nFrom what I've said doc is the fact that uh we we are sure it could be an individual could be a group could be left wing could be right we could be ... could be a deliberate attempt but an inept one and actually hurting people at this juncture are only the authorities no more and I'll guarantee you this\nThey know more and do they are withholding information because they feel that will lead to the apprehension of the guilty

you know you get several packages as they want to take your bank lady based people realize it was a suspicious package [noise]\nWell that's a good question I have not been made clear ah why these ah these packages went off or uh or that they were suspicious now\nHillary Clinton has a has a I gather given credit\nTo ah their Secret Service detail or would presumably they go through packages that the Clintons received my guess is that the Obama Secret Service detailed does the same of why the others would have been suspicious I don't know\nThat that's a good question uh and and I guess it's not clear to me whether they they were open but didn't explode or they just weren't open in some cases they just weren't open to apparently\nThat's what you know that's what I was wondering too they know not open and but I just you know just out there what made these other people say you know I this package is suspicious that just didn't feel right doesn't look right\nNow ... ... ... you know somebody's you know what what's out there that made them think that way but uh that's my comment and I'm just enjoy your show and keep up the good work\nWell you're very ... thank you very much and I must say that you make a very intelligent comments there indeed of what stood out about these packages a good question uh is certainly if you get a heavy packaging a pipe bomb was a heavy package\nA write off the bat you tend to think was that something I ordered\nA that is true 'cause I don't tend to get really heavy stuff myself see even the somewhere in North Carolina Hello Steve\nGood morning

who will go to the end of the country and I was trying to do with\nThe Clinton machine is basically um mhm it's built around a whole group of people who just will not let this go they hate our president so much and they think I hate him too and that's the only one who's on the stomach\nOh I agree totally I I just I'm just worried that this isn't going to you that this is going to be something else that's going to escalate from one thing they're another next time a bomb could go off because of my\nMind is worrying if it's possible that this was I and I know this is my own speculation some sort of test run where it was sent out put out to these prominent targets designed not to go out but just to see how far can get to see if it would if it was plausible\nWell maybe except of course for one thing and that is that now everybody's on the alert so if it was a test run it was a test run you couldn't follow up on for several months because everybody now is a\nIs a on

lot of things to say about\nAbout the Trump record that uh have frankly been false like uh\nThe economic recovery started on his watch but I don't recall a lot of the\nThe confrontational type of of comments from Obama's so but the others yeah Clinton certainly Eric Holder certainly is a George Soros has been behind a ton of is a John Brennan who agreed Maxine Waters big time so you know some of them do that is true\nYeah hopefully that he goes stop a cat shelter and behavior ...\nWell I Hope I Hope so too I I but I'll be very honest with you [noise] honestly uh Louis I think it's going to take somebody dying before this behavior is checked I mean the shooting Steve ... didn't stop it [noise]\nAh and I'm not even sure that would happen and I certainly am not predicting in and I'm hoping

postage on under the first place but there are a lot of unanswered questions here\nYeah I understand that if you wanted to draw attention to the Clintons than you would put it through the mail\nFor I don't understand why why if you wanted to draw attention to the Clinton Jew would put it through the mail I'm missing that\nWell because of the secret service\nThe secret service checks everything that sent to the Clintons trust me and and the same thing with the Obama detail\nYeah I understand that but the one thing is it the one are drawn to whoever it is a who's a Democrat is doing it the law to draw attention to it\nI I guess I'm missing why using a delivery services as opposed to the Mayo would draw more attention if you send a prominent person a pipe bomb you're going to draw attention\nYou know I understand that he did a poll mind saying is if you want to draw attention to themselves they would put it through the mail there so the secret service would find it\nWell the secret service believe me any package that goes to the Clintons goes to the secret service trust me same thing with the Obamas any former president or they do not open their own male trust me on that
