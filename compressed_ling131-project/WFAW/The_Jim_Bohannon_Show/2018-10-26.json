I mean I\nI I watched it again level and they're showing it live and they slow it down\nAnd his hand is starting\nTo go forward yes nobody's arguing that his hands going forward Bobby but then as he's going\nForward he turns his arm before I even hit you do it before you even hit he is proactively turning his arm in\nAlmost like he's going to talk it soccer was exist but anymore but almost like he's turning it in and the ball goes\nBackwards [laughter] and that's what it was ruled live\nI don't understand how you can say that that's the case\nThat the ball they're not go backwards after the hit he's already hurting the arm and then the ball the way it left\nHis hand to it like went out he had an eye on the palm of his hand and it kind of just sell out and tossed out backwards yeah and\nAnd you and when he got he he still was holding on to the ball in it it it is he was going forward a little bit in these than on went to Britain most of the show they're really and they live in a way back so I don't\n[noise] I mean we ...

I thought today to Michael Silber of NFL dot com\nQuote I'm like the scapegoat for this team\nI'm totally at peace with that I totally understand that I'm like the scapegoat for this team when we play good\nThe defense played well the running back did good the receivers may great plays and when we play bad like morals of the worst quarterback on the face of the planet and I get it obviously that's not what I Would have chosen for myself and I'm sure it'll never stop but I couldn't care less\nI just want when football games with this team [laughter] what what do you make of that he's very self aware I that he's a scapegoat here's the thing you're not just getting blamed because people don't like\nYou and because all all a clearly out of and your fault no because it has been your fault you say oh embrace the role of being the scapegoat\nI'm at peace with it I mean it's good that he's not upset that he's getting blame if that's if that's what he's got to tell him self ... to get back out on the football field than you then you like it from that angle otherwise\nYou're not just a scapegoat you'd even as implying well now you're correct but officers will you follow the ball to time to turn over the other day you deserve to get even atrocious what you did in the post season last year was\n... you know was not representative of what you really are as a quarterback you fake that your own ownership gave you a new contract which they purposely worded and put together where they can part ways of you after the season and not feel that bad financially\nSo yes you can say you're not the scapegoat do you get a lot of the blame yes but it's deserved\nYeah amazed Glenn poorly or for the last three weeks now I mean\nThat you you you come in the season the jaguars are highly I'm expected cylinder a a cease out they started off through you know without that did they have ... down a light at me losing four straight games in the defense has been horrible he he's great they haven't been playing their best but it all started with the quarterback you got to get going on the office aside for the team\nI mean ... that's a big to footage eggs but\nAs you as you you got to get this off in school and you got to be able to perform at that level why they gave you that the contract in offices and why they gave you that extension you got to show why you while you are in a guy who played great in the play offs but\nWhat have you done for me lately is going into the regular season so is is you can't play that horrible uh right now I mean now the jazz last what three four straight scares me [noise] so I mean they're they're they're sliding down now\nYeah so we'll we'll see what happens with the uh Kennedy the officiating fraud and also the portal situation going forward is ... gets in the game on Sunday it boils and starting a but his castle again and again\nIf they're down be that they're down big I\nDon't even know if it takes much I mean honestly if if it starts and he has a turtle were on the first second drive at I think the leash pretty short\nYeah yeah it can be it can be cars that they've done around is willing to put less which like he did versus the ticks\nYes OK Marilyn it's been a while since we talked about this and I I didn't think it would take to October twenty fifth to get some answers we still don't have a full picture but DJ jerk and he's been on a ministry to leave since mid August\nWhen the reports of a toxic culture came out and Marilyn took full responsibility for for Jordan McNair and the tragic death there and they're still at some point going to settle I Would imagine on on a large sum of money", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "26"}
