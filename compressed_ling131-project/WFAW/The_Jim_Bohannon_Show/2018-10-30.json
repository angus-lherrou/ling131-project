next week oh I should not be on the table\nAll right ah and certainly I I understand obviously the motivation put forward by Mark Thomas Ross can or for the record I happen to believe that uh the definitely has a place in American Justice or many others of course new not your your thoughts about that\nI say it's a lowly sorry that police killed him in the shootout that day and ah I agree with or that or this or is he is tried and convicted which is right in this country because we don't want to give up the rights of of\nOf of trial by your peers if he is convicted than I think he should face the death penalty\nAnd something to be added to that we have a case of what I call stupid lawyer drinks in this country past a certain number of appeals in a certain period of time you are

the end voting and uh let's bring this to our guest\nI've I Believe the as the caller that there is a great deal of blame placed on the president when in doubt blame the president on the other hand\nA President Trump I think at times is his own worst enemy he makes enemies he doesn't need to make and there's sometimes more interested in getting an applause line from his base is in the thinking about the the way he says things he creates problems for himself in in my view a doctor banks them\nBut you know I think that can be said object cannot everybody who's ever served in political off it but he clearly you know we got our eyes on him but we have to situation here in San Juan where we had an avid avid Trump supporter\nAnd then on the heels and that that we've got a ...\nWith someone who gets spies us chaff so it's outrageous that ball cap blame this on the president's ... how the issues like this before it translates president ... hot\nAnd we will way well that is the state of the world that we live in right now unfortunately that attend blame that on somebody and then political office that's just kind of a cop out in my opinion\nI Would agree with you completely and certainly unfair to blame these incidents on the president\nBut it I think is fair to say that the president sets themselves up as an easy target for criticism sometimes may not maybe not fair criticism but as an easy target\nA and he could avoid some of that if you would ah would simply go about about doing so let me ask you a doctor banks than about the state\nOf a mental health care and facilities in this country right now I Would assume that you would be among those who say we need more\nOf everything a clinics money a therapist what have you\nOh absolutely rights and you know it it's not good for sure\nBut then there's plenty of room for improvement you know as a mental health provider in the field for Thirty years I've taken a pay cut every year because the rates of Medicare go down and the insurance goes with it and then we're ... we're asked to see more patient and a shorter amount of time\nIn a certain amount of time to make an accurate diagnosis that an accurate

rational basis for that got us good worst in American history only says one thing that you don't know much about American history of you believe that\nI Would agree with you can't buy anything there

the congressmen stand\nOn impeachment she got to feel about words you're going to do what it what it adds to the Senate I cannot get an answer and\nYou know Hillary was was a viewed here recently and

to take a lot of work to do all the damage that's being done\nI mean ... the American people are following a lot of voters set the tone of it's being set by all these politicians and you know during

short answer is ah I agree with you day than I Do wish that things were better a can of Pittsburgh yellow Ken\nGood evening I'm obviously a very sad time for a city but for the for the world yes um\nI I think that this this isn't this goes back much further and I find blame it on they weren't people the communications act to thirty four\nI think the Internet has become a a\nA place that people gather with like minded individuals and it's just like dogs too in a bone and they just keep going around and around and you don't hear different points of view I mean you probably got one of the last

people would stop thinking about politics for a while\nAnd just keep sink in the fact that these eleven people died and something has to be done [noise]\nTie I Would agree on one boy did you made Ken and that is that we do in fact spend a bar too much time talking only to like minded people uh most people today are spend their time with like minded people in person\nOr on line on social media and uh that does tend to create an echo chamber and I agree with you\nThe fairness doctrine a is a great way to see to it that the multiple voices are in fact shut down or the parent is not good it was a

my day\nBut being an older fellow I can recall pre air conditioning and we used to sit outside of a summer evening because it was a cool place to sit on the porch and neighbors would be outside and we would just naturally start to converse\nI remember when we got our first air conditioning unit\nIt was awfully comfortable in that house but I Confess at that point oh I I still knew the people I had
