bode to offer thoughts about this let's start with the Casey in the great falls Montana and the Casey good evening\nYeah I uh I was just thinking that there seemed to in my memory and there was a strong linkage to nine eleven with the Saudi regime or at least the portions of the population in that\nWell a lot of the people involved in the plots were from Saudi Arabia to my knowledge there has never been any evidence indicating that the Saudi Government was in any way involved\nLet me let me expand upon that point\nI'm not saying that there was any linkage directly but I think that there is a ideology that is exhibited by the Saudis have disdain and disrespect and I don't think the president should go to war or get carried away but he has to\nWalk a tightrope you should send a strong message that they can't just staying here\nAnd I don't think the president should go to war or get carried away but he has to walk a tightrope you should send a strong message that they can't just staying here is a\nA presence in his in our nation's help in there a dilemma that we're helping them with so that's my opinion\nWell All right a very good in the in the thoughts are that lead to a caller\nIn trying to think about different things that like can be done [noise] also and one might be just sick and if they can lean limit the number\nOf a diplomatic passes that any of the family has to come into this country at all\nMaybe reduce the number of people at their embassies here I'm not let them by as much land and property as they would like to buy I mean you know we've got to consider all the potential options that we have to make some\nSort of statement about this um but yeah so I mean I I see your point is there's this gym in our talking at the beginning of the show this is an extremely complicated\nIssue there are a good and bad nobody to us how horrible the Saudi regime is but it's better than it used to be in some way\nYes in some ways and better than almost any conceivable alternative on that peninsula a Luke in Madison, Wisconsin good evening\nEvening I'm I appreciate both of your pragmatic approach to the situation but I don't think they should give a fair pass to a group of people that intentionally paralyzed someone and tortured them for seven minutes by all accounts for\nI'm not giving them a mass either I'm just not sure why there is no law we can do about it\nAnd that that is what makes this complicated isn't it [noise] the brutality of their act\nFor the parent brutality again when we have so far or ... or you don't pass it off no no no we're just supposed to be clear about this loop we at this juncture does not have a definitive answer on what happened we have one is looking more and more like a possible outcome if that is true then you would be right but we haven't got that\nName and when you look at the Saudi response where they first said we weren't involved and now they say it was a interrogation that went wrong no one gets to be headed during an entire day or two yeah so I agree\nAs soon as I heard of that I thought okay that what that means they tortured him again that\nMany I thoroughly agree on that list have you\nAs it as if this was never had lived anywhere else on the planet I Am I'm ... I'm simply saying what do you do about it do you cut off our nose to spite our face\nAt some point when you have people who have sponsored the nine eleven attacks\nWill not wait just a minute or we do not know that the Saudi Government had anything to do with the nine eleven attacks\nHave won't Tanya heal the information that the FBI reports that and you know that too but that's neither here nor there no it certainly is and\nYou have a ... when you have a group of people that are basically carrying the world ... act you have to do something and\nEven even at even to the exclusion of our own best interests let's say that ... to shower and let me just finish by state with before we get your answer a let's say al ... took control of the Saudi peninsula how does that improve things either for the people there or for this country\nDo you think it's good to have a government that will take someone into a conflict poetry\nObviously and not and I I repeat and my question to you in fact I'm going to pose the question now without interruption and then let you respond to it let's assume\nThat the al ... or ISIS forces took control of the Saudi peninsula every bit as brutalization ... regime maybe more so and very ethnical ... out of that I go to the interests of the United states how is that an improvement Luke\nHow is butchering someone that\nKind of obviously you just don't care to deal with reality okay I understand your outrage but like so many people in this country today your outrage does not have any logical conclusion\nThe ads for of course the one I pose was it wouldn't be better and until you come up with some kind of have a better answer other than just were outraged and we're going to do something that will be\nA harmful to the United states and the Saudi people because it'll make us feel better I don't consider that a responsible answer a ... you know you start from use it needs to go to the next call here\nYeah we do have to be very practical about it and we have to put the interests of American citizens first both whether they be in the region or in this country right now in our our strategic military interests around the globe and everything else\nIt'd be a little different if this will be the only time in history that any regime as ever active then they brutal way well guess what it isn't that I'm so sorry that the human condition is as bad as it is but it is and the notion that never happened before and all of human history I Would say how outrageous\n... by a sworn enemy of the Saudi regime the Iranians would go far beyond any level of incompetence imaginable I mean\nIt may be right\nOr at least ... they get the Saudis and the Iranians detest each other and and how you would arrange as as the as Iran for such an action to take place in side a Saudi consulate uh I mean if they could pull that off\nA that would be uh the uh the double cross over the century will come back with more and they just just a moment\nFrom a

Charlotte in Durham North Carolina Hello Charlotte and welcome\nThank you very much and I appreciate it [laughter] and it's a real hot for me and has been for many years that failed to comprehend it somebody could even like me I Would love to know why in the world\nWe give billions of dollars every year to the Saudis Christiana pool report and she went in undercover in several places but uh you know we're late she could have lost her life but she showed where\nThe Saudis have fourteen carriages go find states in their count Barnes why are we sending money\nOr there's no question about the fact that they are not shall we say a poor and uh certainly uh although as I noted that suddenly Powell\nThey may be useful on occasion it is hardly a usefulness that would demand or that they get our money that part I must confess or is it is a little hard to understand\nBut I don't understand it all I Know I have absolutely no appreciation for any reason why we shouldn't give them a damn\nYeah again as I say uh if uh they were someone useful to us who needed the money that might be different\nBut they are someone who can be useful to us who doesn't need a penny and in that regard I think Charlotte sport is extremely are well taken a one eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six Rick in Tucson now and the good evening Rick\n[noise] hey Jim off just calling to see just a [noise] I'm trying to find out of the reason why the ... a wooden just ... when they've got this guy on the on the consulate\nWouldn't just for ... for a look at a certain way we're in there or did you do show\nA claim that he's violated multiple Saudi laws extradite him back to Saudi Arabia he goes into a jail in Saudi Arabia and his story on sex and the New York times [noise]\nAgain he would be just as out of the way at the end I think that again we have a a very rational thought process from Rick again it unless unless we really think Sydney Paolo the Saudis deliberately felt that only\nThrough a show of extreme brutality a good base in their message out I mean I Would think the what Rick just described would end up itself be ah shall we say I'm a pleasant enough faith to send a message to dissidents\n[noise] well it certainly should have been but this is as you mentioned earlier gentleman that evil sort of or shame and they are barbaric against women and all kinds of citizens of their country so I that's\nThey are barbaric against women and all kinds of citizens of their country so I that's what makes me think this was a deliberate message\nThat they are are barbaric again a is a given a that they were stupid and dealing with the United states this would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me\nThat they have generally been pretty adept at quote dealing with the United states and this uh this kind of arrogance uh maybe\nThat's why they're calling it an accidental death during an interrogation that we're supposed to do everything but killing\nYou know you know the ... in a number so this is a regime so brutal that they might very well think that that was somehow pass oh okay you were already tried to made me a little bit ah maybe maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong maybe they are the stupid Linda in champagne Illinois hello\nHi Jim I'm not saying that the Saudi Government are nice people or anything like that they are\nAnd certainly not at that and this this fellow um I Believe a came from a family of arms dealers the within the Saudi Government at one time I think a very close to ...\nHe's a Muslim Brotherhood supporter he is the other dog but as soon as that hardly makes him a savory character that's very true in\nLike a journalist in in Saudi Arabia having freedom chat right in favor of Israel he thought that shouldn't have been allowed\nAnd now everybody realizes that um and I honestly think that the government would offend so stupid it can pull a stand like that because they know it would come back on them and I wonder if there was a rogue elements of course we don't even really know what happened\nYou know we do but but I was thinking about this a rogue elements in a consulate I mean ... these are not just places like boutiques the shopping center where you just wander in\nNow but people can decide to do something that's not smart and I think that the fellow called in about John granted maybe on something and it may happen then partly make Trump look bad and dry and make a wedge between ... you know because\nOf that that that is the level of Machiavellian thought you will have to explain to me I don't understand and I certainly make no apologies about John Brennan who's been a negative influence in this country for years and years and years but I fail to see\nHow any of this benefits anybody on the American left especially given the fact that if in fact he is somehow implicated that this would rebound on the everybody on

position than psycho analyst and uh the subtitle apocalyptic psychology and the age of Trump or to a rod who calls him from a wire Hauser Wisconsin I'm ... good evening rod and welcome\nRod are you there yeah and you hear me yes you're on the radio go right ahead\nAll my phone is I gotta G oh well okay [noise]\nOh sure I I don't consider myself a really delicate first but you know what I heard on Wisconsin Public radio I listen to public radio a lot of it they were talking about George Washington when he became president he did not want to ... them and I just think that might help\nWhat a shame that it ... it out because\nYou know if it kills people that I don't care about their whatever letter or named up the base it on\nThat and that way I see it we don't need any ... other white\nBut a cap on hockey whatever something happened to the poor woman and I am at a traumatic experience like that but uh that Comey is not an issue right here in the fact that Obama when he killed somebody for the ... or ... oh we got to wait till after the election\nThat show it on the other for how to get it or the electric\nWell you've covered in a number of the issues of the day but I'm not sure this directly relates to uh the topic at hand I Would just make one vote before deferring to Dr Creighton\nOr it was very naive of George Washington or anybody else to suggest that there would not be factions factions are almost proof that we have a free government if you have a genuinely free society you will have differences of opinion\nAnd like minded people will get together and organize to try and convince others of their point of view it as an essential part of society Malcolm faction lives will be carried do far well yes it certainly can and perhaps we're seeing a manifestation of that\nWith the notion that you can have a free society without different factions is an impossibility and by the bird to Dr Creighton\nHas to agree with you entirely about that I think there's a a psychological motivation ultimate\nAnd I refer to Dr Creighton\nOr it has to be with you entirely about that I think that's a a psychological motivation ultimately for a\nUnified groups to ultimately breakdown to smaller divisions [noise] so I I think there's no way of avoiding traction is or what you do want to avoid as you mentioned this or the extremes of polarity is a between a two factions so that there's no workable a solution to the system\nAnd we'll come back and explore some of that here in a moment but ah right now a call from Steve in a chaplain county North Carolina good evening save\nThe name you know they are\nAlways enjoy your show in a shake your says thank you when you get sort of ... when you get on to a restaurant or or you go out and\nSo on I ... I don't go along with that person or the establishment is the last ... whatever the or I don't understand this really wants so a\nLot I guess the only way you can't you don't allow it has a reason to say without someone screaming match and spending on you know and you send things can't\nI really don't care of your\nDisposition just let's say let's have a reason to say I mean if we can talk without screaming at each you know ... which I which I don't do\nAnd yet I'm the I call the corn machine in the Clinton machine has is just you can use to give up the fact that two years two years ago that um\nYou know you lost the election okay I guess what if you love this country if you if you're being honest ... then you're going to try to build the not tear down\nWell again I'm not here to the extent although certainly I've had my differences over the years with both Clintons a specially in regard to uh honesty and and corruption I don't know that we can say that they are personally responsible for the uh the outbreak that we've seen a across the country\nUh I Do a Dr Creighton find one thing that I find tragically ironic\nThat is that much of what we're talking about here is conducted by groups that roughly called themselves antifa that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course if those tactics\nOf a silent senior opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect or most of these people but that is that is is the sad a problem\nAnd that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective that you are so few are\nAnd you are so virtuous that you don't have to listen to anybody else than the only answer in my book\nAnd you could certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as in my book is to arrest\nProsecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that he is out of bounds or you could not let society be reduced to to the level of ... who can put together a more of violence on the street\nYou know I I think you're going to several important point [noise] uh ... one of the points that I Try to make in the book has to do again with the underlying psychology of what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's good and for some time now that is an increasing degree of [noise]\nOf of the offices within the society and that increased St decree of moral perfectionism and obsession all thinking in society as\nA result when when one morning counted as those types of psychological structuring their goals or does it ... a very prone to what we call projection [noise] and that is that they tend to uh take aspects of the the denied a self\nMake up and to place them on people around them\nOr so and you have a group like a ... a\nA claiming that the anti fascist and you look at the half or it's very very obvious that that would be happier as if you're one would expect\nFrom the fascist group and so you see this constant accusation coming from the left projecting on the ride for everything that they're doing\nA and and denying that are claiming that it's the rights to doing it so that's I think that motivation for some of this behavior or in terms of how to deal with it I agree with you entirely I think one of the greatest problems that we're encountering in society today\nIs the lack of enforcement of the laws that are ... that are currently on the books are from a place like a\nPortland for for the mayor of port and to sit by and have people rioting\nOn the streets I mean she said to have the police intervened this is a breakdown of the necessary a legal sanctions and boundaries that are a free society must have and if that's gone then it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah [noise] uh again it it it is not something that uh that that can can possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that and there have been other examples of some time ago when there was a a police shooting that brought a rioting to Baltimore\nAnd the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to let it burn\nA as if to say that if people feel aggrieved enough that they get a free pass on behaving like civilized beings and that is [noise]\nAs as you say it I I think I'm not putting words in your mouth that as it is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not unacceptable outcome nobody is so agree to that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody\nKnow who has a yeah go ahead\nWell I I again absolutely but it's the role of the government are both at the local level and the federal law alternate fullest laws of the country [noise] and if they fail to do that then you can expect a increasing outbursts or from the east coast because they're essentially unable to behave badly\nExactly oh we are you telling them yes you're tactic and intimidation is working and are people respond positively when are they are told that or their tactic is uh is going to be tolerated I stay with us more to come\nUh maybe less than perfect trades get projected onto everybody else in order to protect one's self image and so I think this is what we're seeing in large measure in some aspects of the left you know they they see themselves as or at least superior early\nA virtuous individuals and they see anyone who doesn't agree with them as being a either evil or oh failing it in some a moral way and uh it's probably not in a way of being in the world\nWell it says this type of conflict yeah a a again a I suppose\nThat I'm hardly unique in thinking that uh that my viewpoints are correct\nOr they are by viewpoints that I've arrived that been by whatever thought processes involved and I would like to think that it as a rational analysis of of evidence and arguments that\nThat reflect the the circumstances in the world but for whatever reason yes I like everybody else would tend to agree with my viewpoint so it's almost a a a ... uh uh it it it naturally follows however\nI have never been so enamored of my viewpoint that I Would suggest that hey I must be right and therefore everybody else who disagrees with be must be wrong\nOr nor beat that no matter how right I may be that it's somehow gives me a pass on the rules of society that that is the level of arrogance\nThat escapes me even on issues where I'm very confident that my viewpoint is correct I just uh it's it's the attitude that goes with the viewpoint that escapes me\nWell we we've done a very poor job over the last generation or two at raising our children are children had been raised with this concept to preserving your self esteem a concept of self esteem is based on her criticizing never correcting\nAn individual in this carries on into the educational system so you've ... you've got ... now at least one maybe what what generation that truly unable to look at itself critically a as a result they they have to preserve this concept of perfection\nAnd anything less than that it is not even within this fear of consideration\nAs we go to a break and then we'll come back with some calls but I have to ask you\nIs this a terminal condition that has to say are these people beyond redemption is it impossible to ever a inject them if you will with a note of rationality or have they been so ... into this notion that my self esteem is in violent that they will for the balance of their lives which in some\nCases maybe fifty sixty Seventy years cease to be affected members of our society\nA well if you if you want an honest answer I certainly do yes or\nNo citizen and a clinical level is a very difficult thing to treat and I think that's what we're talking about drone ... the the prognosis for this generation is not good well and in fact most of the society is not good as a result\nIt certainly is well almost answers were exactly what we need right now will come back and talk more with our guest Dr Richard Creighton the

and this will some statistics of of record sales and a and top heads symbol like because the the numbers for the Letterman are extremely impressive Tony\nBut yeah you know Jim thanks for bringing that up because you know we have quite a kind of quiet career compared to other groups doodles just British Invasion music from the beach boys with the surfing in hot rod music well we didn't get all the notoriety 'cause we never get drugs and we never were bad\nBoys you'd never got in trouble we ever political we never got to go to\nThe waters weirdest ... three squeaky clean boys from next door that happened to go out there and do a good show so I kept pressing the media they only\nPut stories out about the bat boy so we were kind of under the radar all these years and uh I I kinda like it that way because we never uh we we toured with some of the biggest entertainers we were just a Jack Benny we took the Jack Benny ... with George Burns\nWe toured with red Skelton as well as doing a lot of his television specials and ah\nJackie Gleason dean Martin the Jerry Lewis and we were in that realm we were kids doing rock and roll a being that boy so I I like the fact that we had a clean cut career and we're still very healthy and still are out of his day\nWell it certainly is it didn't just a burn across the sky like a shooting star the Letterman have had to stay in power and I was amazed to discover this but in fact it is next year but it's not until next year\nThat the Letterman will finally get what they have so long deserved and that is a star of a Hollywood walk of fame you must be very proud\nOh my gosh there's so many you know you have a survey that's a very big but it shouldn't be in our little lie [laughter] that post I'll bet it's a very prestigious thing to have millions of people visit Hollywood and millions of people take photos sitting on the star of the great entertainer\nIn the Hollywood Boulevard so it's it's yeah we are very very proud of it that the cheating that\nWell you certainly should be now I have to look at this career this this uh this traveling around the country and the like don't you ever get tired of the tour\nAll the ways that you know I see people on television don't know Carson's show and David Letterman show and there's the other day talking and and they put their hands on there for the oh my gosh it's so hard and they try to get pity for themselves I think they're trying to get pity for all the millions of dollars they're making\nThat [laughter] I tell you what I always say if I'm On the road and getting up some occasionally but yet at six AM after one of the poor and catch a flight you know what I think at the alternative Ken his shirt beats digging ditches\nDoesn't do it it really does now\nYou have you guys have such a beautiful pure sound and yet you interact with an audience so well so I'm curious about this you've got the touring the live shows and you've got the recording studio and of course\nUh with the live show or you have that immediate spontaneous reaction but it's it's one take mistakes but all whereas in the recording studio while granted\nA nobody's cheering but maybe they and our guy behind the window but but you could do take twenty eight if you need to to get a perfect and so I'm curious which do the Letterman prefer the studio perfection or the on the road lives spontaneity\nWell you know I yeah I'm probably the worst interview were in the world is if you eat in the world because on the very positive guy I don't look for the negative and so when it comes to a question like that might I answer is\nI prefer boat because it does\nIf you're in the studio for a month or so and then you're on the road from it gives you that friday obscene country seeing the world that yet being able to get in there and and do some create Kennedy of your with your friends in front of my microphone\nDo you guys have anything that approach is also a a a bucket list that you've done so much and you have received these honors an accolades and I'm just wondering is there something out there but the letter but I haven't done the oh I don't know like a maybe a a Broadway musical or something I'm just curious\n[noise] yeah you know those are always wonderful things or if it would be great to have like the Jersey people they set up you know four seasons ever ugly show\nHere again of course they were controversial they were they were very ... uh offstage it did some things but yeah well I'll tell you what ... not really young because let me tell you one thing back in you know the first men on the moon Armstrong and John Glen they know the the L altering well yeah a Armstrong\nHis kid was a big fan of the letter and and his wife was a really big fan so when they won\nOr lost to the moon he was the first man to the moon Armstrong he they have this little plot they weren't sure if the\nTour is going to work there and they had in their capsule they would
