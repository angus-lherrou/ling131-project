interviewing if that's possible yes by all means\nOkay 'cause I'm you know all these elected officials they're supposed to be working for us\nAnd there is a way but I'm not sure I'm sixty eight now and I I I don't have a coup shooter and perhaps from one could call in and give us the answer there is a way\nThat we put things on the ballot and then they change as a because you know\nWell that depends on on what uh what type of changes you're talking about some states have a ... initiative laws are certainly no no way you could do that at the federal level\n[noise] [noise] okay well I\nAbout some states have a ... initiative laws there's certainly no no way you could do that at the federal level\n[noise] okay well I was ... I was thinking about here in New Jersey I worked with were taxed at ... unbelievable oh well I I don't know we can do that here but you know\nWell you need to find out I mean if in fact even Iraq there there is such a law in New\nJersey than there are rules by what you need so and so somebody signatures before or so and so many days before an election and if you could get something that I have a ballot while you can do so California has such a law and I'm not sure\nHow to go about doing that too I was\nWell you have to talk to you have to talk to somebody based in New Jersey or to find out I mean but but again\nIf other states could do that as well\nSo I'm here and you can turn things around well some can but but I don't think that every state has an initiative law but some can\nBut you know like er here you know perhaps if we take a hundred thousand dollar though their paycheck maybe yeah well you know like that I guess you should say\nBut when you're talking about amendments that would say Congress may pass no law that applies to the public doesn't equally apply to Congress\nOr that a low budget from Congress no pay for members of Congress or term limits these are all proposals that would never get past even a simple majority of Congress much less two thirds of Mets why\nA lot of the things that need to be done which directly involve the uh the U.S Congress will have to go through such a a constitutional convention has no other way they can be adopted\nAlso yeah you're right if if\nThe government shuts down your pay shuts down that's what happens to those folks out here and in the real world um you your job closes for weight you don't get paid for a week so I think that would\nThat work at a stop a lot of a government shutdown certain budget dispute should allow it I knew that their salaries was it involved also\nAnd it needs to be coupled with a a balanced budget amendment with teeth in it so in other words we are forced to do something this
