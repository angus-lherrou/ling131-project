she makes well he came back about forty minutes later\nLooking very disheveled and told me the loan was proved me closer made a lot of money on that deal and then we closed eight other dancers and that club and from getting to know the women\nAnd what they had to do to get ready the kind of conditions that they performed in how many\nCustomers they had to work with in order to make the money

lot of money or they may also understood that you can only make that kind of money in New York while you're young because as you get older and nobody's gonna want is gonna be younger girls got a better surgeon so they were out to make as much money as humanly possible as fast as possible\nUh the horror stories that they told about bad working conditions and creepy guys\n\nI never want to be in one of those places because that's just like this was like horrible and disgusting and like they talk about things fall more openly than anybody else would because they just do this every day\nThere were a lot of really nasty stories that I Would never be able to repeat\nWithout dragging and they thought they were funny\nSo no I Would never go into a place like that not unless we're doing money I mean okay with that like we're making money but a lot of uh no I probably could still do a lot of those deals today I just\n[noise] after going through the ... the meltdown I never want to ride another loan again\nAfter going through the mail down after going through everything with William and I was very happy to say you know what this is probably a good time to go back in the radio and I didn't have been back and radio ever since now\nAdmittedly I mean all make as much money and radios we did back in those days but I have a lot less stress and a lot happier in my job is definitely way cooler\nToday all the guys that I Know who are who are still in the business and most of them they don't have anywhere\nNear as much fun as we used to make the same kind of money 'cause you know you're not allowed to they passed laws ... stuff and I can't make that kinda money again but it was fun for what we did it and we helped a lot of people\nThere were some of them have you have the money you should be able to get a deal\nSuddenly had to work on their credit it's amazing how many exotic dancers have complete deadbeat ex husbands who don't work and are alcoholics

some reason guys have trouble dealing with oh my girlfriend fiance wife out earns me three to one so screw it I'm not going to work I'm going to go get drunk and he said I don't understand it but it happens Israel\nSo ladies make sure if you're going to date a guy that he brings to the table at least what you bring fellows if if you're not bringing things people step up your game\n\nBecause when
