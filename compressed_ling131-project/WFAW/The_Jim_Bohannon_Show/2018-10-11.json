and as dry as you can touch and thank you for taking time out\nAnd I\nThank you very much that's Natasha ... and Panama City Florida where the brunt of this storm struck into we return now to our discussion with Dr Brian tank and assistant professor of the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the university at Albany State University of New York\nAnd I was noticing a doctor time uh comments made by a Natasha regarding the relative a quick pace of Michael I'm Florence of course as we recall was guilty of loitering\nOut why is it the storms of vary in terms of the pace of which they move\nWhile you can even think of hurricane sort of like elite and extreme and that is a you know the the leaf is moving in the very slow meandering stream that that's sort of a certain ... not moving very quickly what like forest and there were certain linger over the place and that given period of time whereas a leaf in the past who industry like um\nLike Michael will move very very quickly through an area\nWould it be safe to assume that a a faster moving storm is more likely to bring with the wind damage as opposed to the water damage in comparison with the Florence where the wind might be less but the water damage more or or can you even make that generalization\nUm uh it's certainly if a storm is moving slower it will it will produce um\nA window or a a area for a longer period of time and that has capability in fact likelihood of producing flooding rainfall um but in terms of the when you can you can have a storms that are very intense much like Michael that are moving boat slow in the past\nI say so in other words the the speed at which the storm moves across the surface of the ground that is to say it's it's land speed is not necessarily related to the uh the speed of its wins no no it isn't\nVery good one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we watch\nMichael the remnants they're up continue to move across the Georgia having of course if the Florida Panhandle portions of Alabama as well\nAnd uh is uh still heading across the state of Georgia is our guest Dr Bryan that tang uh this uh\nDepartment in which you teach atmospheric and environmental sciences or that the people today I think uh they live at all these terms like a old lace we'll satellite pictures and we hear things like Doppler radar most of which of course most of his ...\nEarly know what that is but it sounds like you folks are are totally on touch a with a with what happened in the storm in other words I think we we may at one time we use to make jokes about the weatherman and and how little they knew and compared with today I guess it has no already live today\nWe act like you guys know everything and if you're even off by a little bit I think we get on your case for that ended it strikes me that there's a happy balance there that\nThat you know more ... than you used to but it's not like you have a complete handle on every single storm but every single moment\nRight it's it's the nature of the beef that weather prediction will always be uncertain to ... to some degree but in in the last decade\nOr two we we've really come up very very long way and ability to predict whether interdict extreme storms like Michael\nYou I understand you have a research that you undergo at Albany then focuses on tropical cyclone formation intensification and interactions with the the climate system looks start with a formation\nWhat is it that is the existing out in the open ocean that causes a tropical depression to form\nWell and and land tick 'em we oftentimes see these clusters of thunderstorms that form or in the middle of Africa\nAnd they will move off the coast of Africa and about um ten percent of them so really tiny fraction and then well form into tropical depressions usually in August September and October\nWhy that time of year I Know there is a season but they're going to be a wide\n... that's when the water temperatures are to warm is in the tropical Atlantic\nI'm also when the uh the atmosphere is is on a ... the the more most moist um and that is also when kind of the the jet stream which can interrupt the storms that um that that sort of brings storm winter storms that through our neck was over the winter that's when it's the furthest north\nSo um it's just kind of the best environment that time of year for storms to farm for hurricanes to far\nI guess it was maybe ten twelve years ago I was talking with somebody who worked with a of well at the time was considered I guess the greatest number crunching computer in the world and we were trying to lay people to get some understanding of of what this thing could do and I asked him and so is there anything\nThat this computer can't do any numbers it can't crunchy said yeah we can get a handle on the on all the factors in the environment if you count all of the wind velocity and temperature and high pressure and low pressure areas\nIs that you could put there are so many numbers there that that that computer at least the like I said about a decade ago that it it couldn't handle that can handle the other stuff that would boggle your mind but that it couldn't handle do we have computers today which can quote handle the the the amount of data that's out there\n[noise] uh yes it's it's it's always a chance\nHave computers today which can quote handle the the the amount of data that's out there\nUh yeah ... it's it's always a challenge because there's just so much data are on any given day or our satellites in space or take many many measurements are over the entire globe and that needs to be um put into these or whether addiction models\nIn order to forecast a lot on that as a as a pretty a daunting task to do but as our computer and get a a more powerful and um we we sort of learned about the Amish are more and more um we definitely made great strides in weather production as a result\nSo we looked a bit at the tropical cycle information now this by the way folks will be three credit hours at the end of the market [laughter] but now the other part of your research intensification okay so the little tropical depression\nWhy do these things and I guess not in every case do they but why do they in some cases become these intense storms\nRight and and Tennessee changes is one of the grand challenges a drop both sides on predicts and it's something that we we still struggle with um as we clearly San like all we we did not anticipate you know a few days ago that it would be making landfall as such a strong a tropical site found or hurricane [noise]\nUm so what are sort of ... we we generally understand kind of ... feel with trauma psychology data that as as you as you said for kind of the war ocean waters\nThat a light below the flow a boatload of hurricane\nAnd that provides a kind of the fuel gasoline for this hour when is it a store\nAll right and then that takes us do interactions with the with the climate system itself or are there uh are there are portions of the planet\nWhich are let us say predisposed to uh to the formation of a depression due to a storm due to hurricanes ah portions of the planets where a a all else being equal a it's a friendly environment for this kind of storm information\n[noise] yes there are the Atlantic actually is is not the most active in terms of the number of hurricanes that for the um Pacific particularly the western part of the Pacific I'm off the coast of 'em in China and Japan and the Philippines\nI'm getting many many more hurricanes are out there they're called typhoons by the same system there there's just different names for for them um and they regularly get storms as intense as Michael I'm a you know a a great number of them every year\nAnd that is another thing that I think confuses the lot of us okay hurricanes on the Atlantic and I guess about the Eastern Pacific typhoons in the in the western Pacific is that right\nYes tight and it's in the surface again psych phones yeah just sort of generic cycle on the Indian Ocean and in the southern hemisphere\nInteresting and those are just terms of convenience we are a centrally talking about the same phenomena right\nYes which is why I and the science community we're just referred to everything as a tropical cyclone instead of a hurricane because that's just kind of a generic name\nWherever the [noise] All right we'll continue our discussion divided your calls welcome of course uh either as a question for our guest\nA since everybody talks about the weather ah and ah also in the experience as you may have in particular if you are facing the wrath of Michael we'd be interested in hearing from you as well at one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five\nOr six to six our guest is Dr Bryan tagging assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences\nAt the University of Albany State University of New York back with more in just a moment\n\nI'm running into us at once I'm it's just a huge amount of energy and then when you're talking about you know trying to alter that I'm In in any significant way it's just that we we just don't have the capability to do that\nAnd we can tap into it I mean if we're going to suffer the damage it'd be nice if we'd get some some kind of a of benefit from it too but [noise] I guess that's not really really likely either at this time\nYeah yeah that's a that's why I think it I think that these are things you just you know you have one that this intense coming at you\nLikely either at this time yeah yeah that is that this fight I think it I\nThink that these are things you just you know you have one or two tenths coming out you kind of just how to get out a way\nWe have a call from Donna in Huntsville, Alabama all the jumbo how to do with our guest Dr Brian ... of the University of Albany State University of New York good evening daughter\nTied down to ... I'm a native New Jersey any and I can make a restaurant here I feel kind of like a hurricane knob and there's not much rhetoric ever given to hurricane Camille August ... right that was five and\nNothing after I had never been worse ah I think a lot of these other storm hit and getting a wrong ... edge comparison get Camille\nAnd my dad even had a hundred and twenty five foot wall of water come up from the Gulf or there were tankers here were African freighters barges on highway Ninety and up into the resident that area\nAnd get paid and have the type of coverage that we have now I mean we couldn't get on a computer or\nYou know Facebook or shellfish or anything how I was wondering if you can comment on the fact that um that given no ref rank as far as the ... of it and I really don't think any of these others come anywhere near it\nYou're exactly right Camille is kind of in a class in its own and then a lot a lot of people these days don't Reno remember a that storm because I did occur such a long time ago and you're you're right the pictures of of the the devastation along the coast or\nOr was absolutely tremendous um [noise] what's what's different today perhaps is that oh the one thing that has changed is that there's just so many more people\nAnd I'm buildings along the coast so uh when we do have any sort of major hurricane I'm heading inland it's just affecting generally a lot more people a lot more buildings a lot bigger portion of our economy\nI'm just I'm because a building on the coast to the very desirable thing people love to you know with a look at the ocean every day um and so that's their choice to do that yeah\nYeah and there was a tremendous amount of that ... I went through the entire thing\nAnd I went to all of it so I mean I'm well I got a crash course and I'm surprised that people are surprised to oh I'm going to lose my electricity and I'm going to get some water in my house that came to little not to ... or ... yeah\nYou're exactly right I think people who especially are new to the area\nI'm a tend to underestimate their risk sometimes because they they just don't have the experience and um you know they they assume they can for instance they can take their windows and um by some buy a bag of chips and just sit through the event and then there'll be yet but\nI'm the the there's always we always stress you know before the hurricane season began do you have a plan you\nPrepare and emergency kit and and it's it depends like this where

our lives even if uh\nMaybe investing or or playing or various a market games or not or shall we say your hobby but the fact is that we are all our economic being as to what extent or another and this is the kind of thing that can seriously affect your life\nLet's talk to or not only I guess Jordan Goodman America's money ads was mad but to see the new calls in from medicine lodge Kansas good evening Stephen\nGood evening Jim or or ... or the one night a night\nOf very for those who don't know that Steven was in the same unit I was in in Vietnam but go ahead\nYeah but you are or suffer and\nI Know I I was I was actually enlisted also but anyway what do you have it for a while you have for our for our gas\nAt about gold but it's it's been for me on the seven year old and uh I uh it's always been colder value for me\nUh it's it's really a\nState they're saying or get Terry rated in the last year and I was wanting to know is a ... if he feels it still place too old are you\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay it's it's against disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up goes goes down after many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting go go gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars an hour\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars announce even lower than that so I I don't say it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters of the world and do this not throwing up it's just not what it used to be if anything the currents become a new\nKind of safety valve and even I don't know if you've been working my way as well so it had a little bit as an insurance policy but I don't see going going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum or silver\nUm all the same ... gone down dramatically a platinum as kind of a of a place like a play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker lately so none of the national smells really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add thanks for your services well\nNow uh I\nThis is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another prejudice precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times on the on some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing decently we've got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know it looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so ah no goal just I'm doing well it's it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean the founders arms race race a lot and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury has now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent sort of had a big move out pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that has all bad for gold silver platter among the wedding\nBut ... do you see at least raise going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond fair market\nWe've ... basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bomb or interest rates peak at about fourteen percent of the Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute low was about one in three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to\nAnd I think it's going higher ... let me just they weren't a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve is doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOnto the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds not in that fire for political reasons another way they get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bombs sixty billion a month through the so called quantitative easing program that's over that's been over for about a year and a half now and now they're doing quantitative tightening some when bombs come do they're not buying new ones they're not renewing them letting them mature\nSo two of the big buyers of bombs are out of the market price and meanwhile huge new supply Jim we've talked about this before but the deficit is that we have are being finance with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars in New that just that corner around today there are options of the thirty year bond that ten year bond they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply less demand\nYields and we don't go up and prices go down\nThere you go to the old ah supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk to the more we will certainly return to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about that when we come back after this break going to take a a very close look at a bad gift that keeps on giving the student loan indebtedness\nOne eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Americas money answer as mad as our guest Jordan good money again money answers dot\nI mean you stop and think about it you know a college education is is a lot of things to do a lot of people\nUh but uh it it from a societal point of view that the important a reason for a college education is to be productive citizens indifferent fact you're borrowing up let's say six figures of that data nest in order to learn something\nThat that they're not going to pay you money for\nAnd as I like to say on the program and make sure the are the most articulate breach that Starbucks yeah the the society has no vested interest in paying for that I mean of financial aid should be based in large part\nOn the percentage of people that are given major who within twelve months of graduation are actually working in that field of work and that's\nHow he likes to stick around that Jim this twenty seven percent of the people who graduate ended up using something related to their major with twenty seven percent meaning Seventy five percent are three quarters do not end up working in in their major field in one way or the other\nEnd which case you essentially a ... it from a financial point of view you've you've wasted your time you've acquired I mean it's one thing if you have a hobby\nI'd say that uh our gay and lesbian literature I always you know their way okay so I'm interested in that's well that's fine but but but you shouldn't be paying out this kind of enormous money to finance a hobby and as I've also noted before that's why we have so many bowling leagues in this country people like to bowl\nAnd there are just simply an awful lot more people who like to bowl the people who can make a living and the professional bowling too are accurate and so I I mean it just always it amazes me at all these people who want to find myself or I Want to do this or that well why don't you do that in your spare time and in the meantime get a job\nYeah well I mean luckily we have a good employment situation right now and and there's a tremendous shortage of workers except the people coming out of college in many cases are not qualified or willing frankly to do the jobs that are available\nThere's something called the jokes report which is the job openings long term survey and the latest number was six point nine million jobs unfilled employers cannot find the people\nTo do tool and dye making are plumbing or electricity or climbing electric utility poles there may be the people coming out of college don't either have the skills or the interest in doing the jobs that are actually available in the real world\nWhich raises another point is too easy to sit on your body in this society there ought to be economic pressures on people like\nIf you have a lot of student loans you are under economic pressure to do something and a lot of people take jobs that are like but they've got a service those dinner that's over fifty percent of the people graduating today go back and live at home because they can't service the student loan debt and have an apartment in the car and kind of get on with their lives I mean it's it's pretty pathetic\nI mean if you wind up doing doing a job you're not particularly fond of a because it pays the bills this is I think called growing up with us we'll be back with more from Jordan Goodman America's ... man in just a moment\nWe'll see what our ... we are and more\nIf he's done costs um
