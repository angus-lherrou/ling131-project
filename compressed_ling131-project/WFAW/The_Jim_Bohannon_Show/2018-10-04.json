evening Marty\nHi Jim another good one man I'm think you'd be ... with the signal processing speed is that we see now and the um\nAnd and the ubiquity of connections around the globe I feel like the nation states are doing their best to keep up but I feel like there's a lot of NGOs if you will there's a lot of uh none of us and uh I'm\nA organizations of people you know at a at a at a hawk level that are doing a lot to exploit all of the weaknesses and the Web and that\nThat that's a big factor is any nation [noise]\nAll right uh non government organizations for those who are not into the alphabet soup or a nomenclature\nAh ah ah what about that Michael ... do you think that ah\nThat such groups themselves pose a a a threats as such\n[noise] well I Do but you know we have two hundred countries in the world that we have to sort of a coordinate with trying to get that side of the committee to agree on what to do about cybersecurity is an incredibly tall tale especially when a lot of them are criminal enterprises themselves so these NGOs that we call them [noise]\nGet a lot of them are just a ... they have a mask on an empty and really they are they the government that they get ... cat by the government I mean look at how the Russians train these kids to hack at such a such a young age\nWhich is a great idea for the call hacking but it's not a great idea for fun aspect all hacking and we we need to train our children a lot more and ethical hacking today can do great defense is that we have to have\nSex and this is the problem we we almost to the point where they have to have a world cyber courts\nAnd you start getting into politics and and and bad actors that are acting like good actors and he's right on the money I mean I agree with him completely I'm just trying to add that they they might\nLook like outsiders when really their insiders we talk about Russia all day long I asked her\nWell let me ask you a bit about that than the juice that you brought it up a is there any such international body there is of course they world courts and ah there are various or a bodies of the United nations most notably the Security Council and the like I'm not sure that I wouldn't necessarily in many cases be particularly prone to [noise]\nTo depend on such international bodies which I find in many cases it but at the end of the best and the\nAnd the hospital to U.S interests that read words but I I Am curious if if such a bodies even exist usually law and regulation trailed far behind technology especially in this day and age\nNow you're exactly right and it it always sounds wonderful that's really dangerous because there's a really really really powerful weapon and I'm as a ... you know pious plan of suicide how we all get along come by uh I I don't want this weapon given\nTo anyone that's not mature enough and the world is certainly not mature enough for this weapon and they will take it over they will regulate speech they will suppress their people they will they will\nUse it for propaganda and group thank I mean it's just way too dangerous which is why\nYou know I always thought the United states should a control most of this still\nAnd and we're saying this because they can if they fundamental lack of accountability we have a sign of wittingly put all our chefs and one big cloud and so you can punch sure that you can get a huge windfall you can find the fact that we have that\nAll sort of in one space it's almost like we should go back one eighty and do everything by paper [noise] 'cause it was harder to scoop up altogether and then you take the fact that things aren't really held that accountable because the bad actors are in locations that are making a fortune outfits that\nLying is acceptable normal\nSomething that's so it goes against the grain of sand people in this country you can't just can't be foolish and that would be really foolish and the United nations oh forget it or maybe they have but it's just so far away it so far yeah I think the real solutions got to be technological you know I Would\nHave to think so as regards what you've just said by the way this notion of a paper is oh so twentieth century [noise] well you know what a there are certain certain things about twentieth century that that uh we're better uh the mere fact that we have a technical capability does not mean that we should automatically embrace it and in point of like for example\nA it's been noted that there is no central computer in this country for election results are in which someone could hack and and also the out I'm well thank goodness for that I personally am not encouraged by this move away from paper ballots there is a perfect trail rides there of how people voted\nIf somebody ... something or something gets deleted you can have the validity of an election destroyed in an instant and I personally am of the opinion that the paper ballots are the way to go and if anybody thinks that that makes me a
