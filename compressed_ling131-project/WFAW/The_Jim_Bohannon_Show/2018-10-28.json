British Kansas City bad you know Lynn it down the ... ... ... I mean\nSo we are in that box well they tape everything at NBC back then\nThe whole show was on tape so if you screw up your stuff you could get perfect eventually because you just keep on tape in it\nBut at Fox it's all live with the exception of the football field everything's live when you talk the world is listening so\nChris has got it all down being a lawyer you know he's got it all down he's got it down he's got it memorized down he won't make all fall it's going to be perfect man it just sits there and I can't do that I I don't have any notes I just kind of got an idea and I go with it\nHow is listening to him and so this is like the first show and so Chris is going on he's got it perfect and how is it just interrupts and ... and what what is that what do you what is that what do you mean data that Cruz never been interrupted on live television show he didn't know what to do\nAnd how he said yeah he just started making\nFun of them is and I am absolutely off camera and I am on the floor and I am laughing\nAnd I ... and ... deaths because we didn't know\nThis that and that that they taped everything and so we're going to come and say well he's a man you just throw him off track they threw him out of his mode because he had prepared memorize the boom and how would you still rent in there and said what do you mean and then it just\nGot out of hand and I'll laugh 'til I couldn't find myself oh I absolutely laugh so hard\nWhen they come to me I just followed them a chair and go on to four times can you talk\nThat's the way it is behind the scenes with those lied shows the things you don't know or don't see or don't hear about it I was doing the Stanford games as you heard a little bit early Nineteen Ninety two game against cow the greatest ending to a college football game the quarterback in the game for Stanford was John Elway that was his last year there I had the fortunate\nA capability of being able to do all four years of John's games at Stanford and so I had firsthand witness to how great this young man was in college and how great he was going to be and now of course\nIn the hall of fame but one of the things that always kind of hinders an athlete is no matter how great they are as a talent\nIs if they don't win a championship the big one as you say are done a lot of people do think that there are their careers are complete well after John it'd been able to win the first Super Bowl and then a second Super Bowl we got together and he talked very candidly with me about finally winning the big one\nYou never know until you win one oh really what an impact it is on your life I think that uh I'd put Fifteen Years in pro football for years and in college as well as three years in high school that uh\nYou know you want to be a champion I'd never been a champion of football with one baseball titles in high school and and then and football at Stanford we were uh you know we're kinda mediocre we're right around five hundred and then\nYou know going to Denver we're in three superbowls and four years you know eighty six eighty seven eighty nine [noise] and then there was a big drawback there and and it really as far as my career was concerned entail I Won a Super Bowl or been on a Super Bowl team [noise] um [noise]\nI was not going to be the quarterback that people thought I could be and so this kind of put me over the hump and a was a great great thrill is one of those things that [noise]\nUm you know fairy tales do come true after Fifteen Years of hard work and it all paid off so it was a great great thrill\nCouldn't happen to a nicer guy or a more deserving town on the other channel and I had the chance to witness throughout his entire career and he's a course an outstanding player is Jerry Rice Yuri with the forty niners coming in out of Mrs ... Mississippi Valley state to school to very few people even heard of when he came on the scene he was raw\nI remember a particular ballgame early in his career against the New York giants where he dropped to pass across the middle of the really cost the forty niners dearly\nBut of course the time went on and of course he was part of what was a a sixteen year run for San Francisco forty niner franchise that turned into five Super Bowl championships and certainly no doubt about it the greatest wide receiver ever to play in the NFL everybody knows about his work ethic how hard he works in the off season\nAnd we talked about the challenges of football from his perspective and where he came from\nVery difficult to mentality going off [laughter] you can stay in a you know you can\nLive a planet [laughter] Bill Keller tend to think why am I going because I'm really afraid of failure you know a photo of Spain favor they drive me to a court hearing what hard\nYeah that's interesting you should say that I think I every athlete that I've talked to always say that they fear that and yet when you see them in a rough and tumble sport like football or people don't sense that fear is a part of their make up how is that a driving force for most athletes\nA driving force\nWhen all over I don't want to have a quick [noise] find my about you know the best shape of our life being able to laugh\nAnd that's why I worked hard kind of [noise] you know Donna and everything is naturally think afternoon during the season just stay in shape you know that I asked", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "28"}
