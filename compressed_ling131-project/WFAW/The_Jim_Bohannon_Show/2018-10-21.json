whatever your sports face our\nWe've got to show for you here on the sports byline network we're going to spend the hour talking with David Carr he was the first overall draft pick in two thousand two of the expansion Houston Texans\nWhere he played for five seasons the also played for Carolina the New York giants and the forty niners and of course his brother Derek also a quarterback followed it as ... playing in the NFL or ... with the Oakland Raiders he grew up in Fresno, California played his high school ball in Bakersfield you'd see and what they called the valley a lot of\nFarming and so we will talk to him about his upbringing as well but the thing I remember about David Carr is how tough it was because it was an expansion Houston Texans team\nYou know they they it was always like you know that those guys got to go to schools you know we ended up in Fresno but we're we're just as good as those guys and it was almost like a little bit of a chip on your shoulder you know for lack of better term because I really felt that my teammates especially that last year when they started to see that we had ...\nAnd ... you know I'd come back with a story that I was talking about when I was out there working with these guys and they would have stories about how they fight against these guys in high school a feed them\nAnd it was just kind of that that culture we started talking and Tennessee each other's play we realized we have pretty good football team you know so yeah you absolutely got that\nYou got to you and you're just in Fresno state you guys can't do anything you guys aren't getting up with the school as well it was almost like a challenge and something that you know what we've come pretty far in the last five years of high school I think that we both anybody and it was funny about that and do it with a with a group of guys\nI think it's also tougher any athlete especially if they've been on the cover of Sports Illustrated like you were and then you win the Johnny United schooled an arm of war and all of a sudden expectations come along with that what was your life like toward the end of your senior year in before you got drafted\nThat was hard you know it was as much fun as it was I I think that\nI don't know the president was really ready for a kind of what happened there is if we had we just had you know so much media coming from everywhere and it was every every day I was doing stuff that where it used to be you know just to go to practice you know go back home\nAnd then that was it you know where it will now than the obligations that we kinda got a little bit of a taste big time college football kind of coming to a small town\nUniversity was hard for me to even go to school that was the the biggest thing as soon as Sports Illustrated hit you know everybody in my in my philosophy class wanted assigned autograph the sports illustrated for them and their uncle and her brother and everybody that love everybody in my class and I wanted to do\nBut it was almost to the point where I'd have to get them yeah I go to the teachers I remember specifically blossom heaters stand you know\nThere and everybody that everybody my I Do\nBut it was all to the point where I'd have to get them yeah I'd go to the teachers I remember is there a lot ... than you know I Love it comes to like I'm being a distraction in your classroom so he would give me ... deal with the class we'd be privately and\nIt was just a really weird deal or something that was it was incredibly awesome and everybody's still to this day like that but we talk about that that time and that football team and how exciting it was and it was but it was all those overwhelming ... you know at times do you\nKind of get the good and bad but it was A L wouldn't trade it for anything it's great\nWe've got about Ninety seconds before we have to break I like in Fresno, California to be a little bit like what you see on friday night lights if you don't want to be down in the state of ... ... and maybe you in about a minute couldn't explain to people what's that success Tibet football team in Fresno state means to a community like that\nYou know the president like I talk about the beginning it's just a tremendous ... place to raise a family when despite you grow up and the the cool thing about it is part of the football is is really all they have going on sports wise there's not a professional baseball impression of football team you're kind of caught in between the ... are you a giants fan of your Dodger fan\nBaseball things are the football thing is kinda the same thing\nYou know in front of the state of their professional football team and so when they're playing well that stadium packs out though they'll they'll have overflowed people hanging from the rafters coming in there and they'll get excited about your football team so we just happen to be at one of those moments where we had a good team\nPeople came out they enjoyed it and everywhere you went it was like being a professional ... you were you were treated that way people will just one of the you know you and give you five and talk to you and it was a it was really cool because you do it but you know then\nI got to tell everybody that I did some of the games there I Know how ... they were about it and also I Will tell everybody that the Fresno state crowds in bands traveled very very well scared David hold on just one second we're talking with David Carr about his life and about his career as well\nAnd will continue as we move across the country and around the world on sports

like wait staff voices coming out of that now it's just bizarre because he has like a Texas accent is usually where we are catches many\nSeats they have like a deep voice withdraw he had a high voice

[noise]\nSports talk show more than my line us\nDavid Carr who joined us here on sports byline usa a David you knew that you were going to be probably the first overall pick in the NFL Draft and you knew that meant going to the Houston Texans as well what was your mindset on that\nWell I mean you go first and the draft it's your team's not going to be very good you know now is this kind of first stock what I was told the beginning of my mind that was no we were in Fresno also and we were supposed to be very good way to turn things around the only difference was\nWhen I went to the Houston is we just kinda got behind the eight ball you know we had a great recruiting class when I was a freshman at Fresno state and we ended up having some great football players\nIn Houston as we thought we were going to happen that ended up not working out and it wasn't from Alaska but you really want to be out there became good friends with them it was something that you really want to but he just wasn't able to get out there physically from then on it was just kind of a plug and play deal with ... I remember specifically us going out and\nWe'd work we were guys out on Tuesdays you know and we have a game on Sunday against white screening\nYou know Robert math is made an apple is called ... playing quarterback for the team and we're trying to figure out who are back we're going to be so and they were guys off the street and so we were we were kind of fighting an uphill battle and that and that happened for the first couple of years we ended up putting together some ... some decent these fences and right well that makes them up in a couple of years after that but\nIt was never really something where we ever got figure it out and fortunately you said it's still kind of fighting that battle you know just trying to have gotten better at office might have gotten better now they're just trying to find a quarterback so it's kind of a\nIt's kind of one of the situation in the NFL yet but it has to be the perfect storm you got to have the right quarterback got to have the right head coach you burn up then you've got to have every piece around you kind of work in unison so it's a hard thing to win that's what I found out and then I felt very difficult to what a football game so you got to celebrate it we can because they're they're hard to come by\nLet me share with you my personal story about Bob McNair the owner of the Houston Texans it was before he got the franchise and they were kind of a\nSquare him mia swearing him around the Miami at the super bowl there and and so I'm just talking to Bob and I said you know Bob I said it was seven hundred and fifty million dollars to be able to put the Cleveland franchise on the field and I said I'm ...\nTalking to Bob and I said you know Bob I said it was seven hundred and fifty million dollars to be able to put the Cleveland franchise on the field and I said I'm going to assume that with the expansion franchise is probably going to be close to a billion dollars how does a billion dollars make any sense at all when he gave me the greatest quote David I've ever had did Ronnie\nA billion dollars ain't going to change my lifestyle one bit\n[laughter] not many people can say that for sure [laughter]\nDumped capers was your coach down there and I'm just wondering putting together an expansion franchise or is it a little bit like the blind leading the blind a little bit\n[laughter] it was hard you know Don Was a down with a great guy I Love him still to this day we're good friends and uh he he he worked his butt off trying to make that things\nInto winter and he had we had a good

expansion Houston Texans and uh I mentioned before the break about the fact that you work with young kids today when you take a look at them and I've heard a when I've talked to a pro ball players baseball players from a different era\nAnd they talk about today's young baseball player\nYou're Morgan one said to me they're not as fundamentally strong as they were when I was growing up what is that like it and is it the same thing in in pro football\nYeah it's the same thing and we found working with guys and young guys around you know eight nine ten years old just on just getting their body mechanics right and a lot of times even at that early age they asked for imitation that\nAnd it's just sitting around honestly it's from not being as active as you know even other generations or you know we're used to go out and we climb trees and ride bikes and we'd be all over the place a lot of these kids that come in\nAnd they have an idea that they want to be this player or maybe their parents have an idea they want to be this player this player or quarterback wide receiver when a kid hasn't done much you know he has a passion for the game he wants to do it but they're just not as active they're not as ready so we almost have to go through this process of\nKind of seeing what they're functionally able to do fix those limitations that they have get them moving and get them doing things you know to where they're at least able to do something other than just throw the football or other than just you know whatever their sports specific thing is that's what I see a lot of his parents are trying to\nAnd kids do are are kind of getting to streamline that thing and you look at even the first round this year I think one\nWith the exception of maybe one guy they they threw a static when I was watching the draft that\nMost of these guys for like Ninety eight percent of them I guess played other sports they they were multi sport athlete so they weren't just focused on the one thing they there has to be this broader spectrum of just clay I think and that's kind of what we stress\nOut here when I get to work with these young kids let's just get moving around them and doing some things that we can work on this set of books and stuff later because you got to get the fundamentals of just just moving and be an active before we can even get to being a professional quarterback\nYou had been down the road of course before dairy and let me ask you a little bit about him because the David ... released a un out your ... your younger brother and you went out to play catch and the story goes uh he was Fifteen Years old is ...\nIn that you were ... released a un out your ... your younger brother and you went out to play catch and the story goes uh he was Fifteen Years older star quarterback and sugar land Clemens high school and even then he burned to finish what his brother had started telling me a little bit about him and what you saw on him when he was young\nWell even when he was around around twelve years old and I really started to notice that we were separated too you know by about eleven twelve years and uh and he you know we were kind of I was doing my own thing I was playing with protection and then he was kind of growing up and we you know we were brothers but we weren't super super close\nAnd then when he when when he decided he wanted to play quarterback and he started sitting next to me and we were breakdown film and I would get ready for a game of that by laptop by house he was living in Houston and come over for dinner and he'd say oh well tell me about this and I was trying to explain coverage to\nA doctor I start to explain how safe he's rotate how how defensive front to act and and how you can pick up tips\nAnd it was kind of at that time where we came we became kind of passive hip and we spend a lot of time together and he would come to practice approaches are great ... sit at a quarter background came to a couple of team meeting she drove all the Andrea Johnson that throughout these guys and they'd come out you\nKnow we'd have training camp practice and you'd throw at the targets we had some flags kind of hung up in the in the bubble and the practice facility and we'd we'd try and knock them off they were you know hooked on with Velcro on some PVC pipe and he would come out and beat everybody you know and he's twelve years old Thirteen Years old and it was just amazing to kind of see that mature I kind of at that point\nIt's kind of fun for me I kinda took them under my wing and kind of just\nYou know tried to bring them along you know letting him understand that it's it's enjoyable time it's a it's a fun time but the biggest thing I wanted to know is on youth haired for every level so when he was in high school I wanted to be ready to play college football mentally when he was in college\nI didn't want anything to surprise them you know that he saw from a blitz package or any kind of defense and the same thing when he was in the NFL I mean is he is playing against the New York jets the first came out of the box\nIt never seen rex Ryan says before never even set foot on the field but I've played against them ten times so I was able to get on the phone with him talking to was packages and the different things and they're right down the field in the first driving tour touchdown so ... and they ended up playing pretty good you know that that first came out it could have been it could have been very tough but\nIt was a it was always really cool to have kind of have him next to me and kind of watching me it kind of come down the road that I've been on\nThere was a NFC NFL report that said best natural thrower in the draft and then the scout went on to say if their make up is the same than there is concern how protective above you or sent you didn't want him to be judged on you\nYeah I mean it's it's tough because you know football is is the ultimate team sport you know and I think unfortunately a lot of people like you're talking about labels I mean you get labeled a certain way\nWhen in reality they were just so many different things in Houston that that we were battling against who's to say that there weren't other other players on that team that could have been pro ball players\nIf if if somehow we would have been able to put together better football team I think there probably were you know just we just didn't have enough not for the good parts to really make something happen so in dared was coming out and he got that label\nI don't think you'd ever bother them to see her that he's heard things like that part time and he said when he was you know Fifteen Years old so that stuff doesn't really bother him as much as\nReally just wanting to get on the field because every time something like that has been brought up and do you're just going to get ... or you're going to have this to happen well he's not going through an expansion team and that was kind of my biggest deal there is no expansion teams in the ... and I said it's multiple people\nIf you get drafted by any one of these thirty two teams any of these teams are good enough to put football team around him and they're not going to be climate is uphill battle that I had to go through and and it just showed him and he went to open to the last couple years they've struggled little bit but you went out there and played great but all sixteen games and and he's going to places that are this next year it\nIs just going to be about getting on the field for him and just over time people seeing that he's he's a good player you know he's done he's done some good things and he's his own man so yeah I think he's going to be just fine given time\nYeah the way the raiders were playing when he got drafted they were almost on the stand\n[laughter] right and it was as close as you can get my own words fancy that he ended up going to but they're they're pretty close but they're doing All right\nYeah let me ask you one thing because I was very close to the light bill Walsh show I was down at Stanford doing the play by play when he was down there the first time around and then I was involved to some degree with the forty niners in any debartolo uh in the hiring of him\nAbout head coaches because I think everything kind of emanates out of the guy that is a top he is the capital of the bridges to ship he sets the tone for the team in the locker room and on the field as well how important is that and can you give me some insight\nInto the coaches are good coaches because of that in some that you know they lose the team loses because they just don't have that leadership in the coaching right\nYeah absolutely I think I think the best coaches um I've Tom Coughlin just kind of comes to mind they obviously dumb capers\nHe ... he did he did a great job with what they hand was dealt and he's been a great the score Nader for the Green Bay Packers in August before that Carolina there but I think the the guys that struggled awesome I Singletary struggled at San Francisco and I think a lotta times it's it's where you get into a situation where you try to micromanage too much I think Mike is as much as she wanted to win\nI think he tried to do too much and I think the ... the greatest thing Tom Coughlin ever did was he has a pulse of the team he understands the players and I think he's gotten better just talking to to\nTo go to Michael Straight and then the guys that were there Kurt Warner that were there and I before I was there\nAbout how he's gotten so much better listening to the players I think Michael strain was obviously a big part of that and\nSo he listens to the players you understand the whole new team\nAnd then he'd in any delegates responsibility he doesn't try to captain the shit by by going to all the or you know he he led to other guys do it the past ... great coordinators and\nAnd and he just takes a an overall approach gonna understanding the ... the chief what's happening right now see the big picture I think the best but you see the big picture they don't get they don't get into this sprint each week it's
