coming a guy from a lighter play class I'm In a I have seen the video and go where it looks like a quarter or what could be\nA corner man on his way out I think actually might've been can be made I was younger brother um and you know that there's a big or social media thing going on right now they're ... and I'm a media is trying to cover yourself why in the corner getting or you know anything\nAny creature that he was paid a three million dollar type person could be ... made up on that I mean I I I kind of disagree with all that just because\nYou know at this point can be even over the fancy within gauging and for all west Connors or corn or if you see more people running towards their um I don't really fault Conor McGregor for what he did and I think that I mean he took the worst end of it and and getting sucker punch I thought that was one of the worst thing but the whole incident\nNow what what what really is the fallout from this long term 'cause I I think you think you said you already agree on that we're going to get a rematch if someone someone said I Will maybe I'll be able to get back into the country and all this and I I just I find that hard to believe when it comes down to what that these two don't fight again in the United states now what about\nWhat the Nevada athletic commission has the ability to do or what kind of their jurisdiction and what could come down on them\nWhile they're certainly going to look into it and make their decision based on that I Would expect some type of a monetary and suspension\nOr punishment for it can be very mogul laid off I wouldn't be surprised if he was even suspended a year but I mean we're still not that long all things considered I'm with you I think we're gonna theory match um I Know their investigation is underway there looking at it now I think certainly have a severe penalty the question is if you if you will do anything in addition\nThey didn't do anything to Conor McGregor when ah you know the whole bucket for dinner for Oakland I don't think I'll do anything additional that could be the one thing they may do as a strip him of title though if you're going to be gone for a long time because they like the way classes moving\nTalking with Stacy freeze assistance force editor for the Las Vegas sun and he joins us here on SB Nation or radio you can follow him on Twitter at sea for\n... and I guess a long time for McGregor I was my question now everybody's talking post five which is which is losing that fight and what what what are we talking here if he loses another one whether it's to believe or\n... or somebody else is a term that we find what a six year old but just in terms of where you stand when his power in the U.S see if he goes and lose another fight\nWhy I think that the crazy thing about all this is somehow Conor McGregor comes out the winter again now I Know there are some people calling him out and saying that he looked just as bad as can be even all this but at the end of the day I mean it could be even fight at the whole thing I think he's going to get the vast majority\nOf the criticism and ethical warranted Conor McGregor did a great job after his first law that can eat the commanding a remake you cook a accountability for the law that seems like you're going to kind of follow that playbook again with an Amazon may not know we've already posted something on social media are accepting the law\nSo I mean I I think he's going to have another opportunity or near a opportunity or to near where you know he's going to be just as big of a drawl or whatever and if you get back on the winning track or I I think you're just gonna see that a extend a longer and longer now that being said if he goes out there and fight someone else loses the mob sided fashion again I think that's when maybe you start worrying about or is wrong towers\nWere you surprised that he didn't have a kind of a to not to fight fire and my mom or Gregory you're obviously dead tired of this fight\nYou know I I Love the shock I Know I heard people say that but that's just really\nPretty unlike the U.S the and certainly on like a Conor McGregor I mean he's always been a guy that shot for the stars and shop for the biggest possible thing that I mean we forget now that the Floyd Mayweather fight\nAs it happened but when he first that it was like the most ludicrous thing anyone I've ever heard no one ever thought and em a fight and it would cross over into boxing make a hundred million dollars is arguably the greatest of all time\nAnd then the browns are better than we saw like you could argue I Would say they have seen or by far the AFC the most about a division all of a sudden football yeah\nI can I can agree 'cause the browns are not a pushover anymore they're not especially at home or you got there all not winning a crazy amount of games like some say that's that's I still stand by that I don't think it was a bowl of an opinion to me the yeah they're still not despite the with what you\nMean your promo will still that promos Bill Rhoden [laughter] if you think [laughter] acre Mayfield winning eight or nine games you are absolutely right yeah I mean he's he's making a ... year though\nThe oh now how about the record I'm Glad you brought that up how about the rookie quarterbacks all of the first time in history for no\n[noise]

New Orleans saints Jon Hendricks\nHe is there and I work all night\nFor Drew Brees and the same say all time passing yards leader and NFL history also just a touchdown away now from five hundred career touchdowns Drew Brees a no doubt even well before it than I was not saying much and we all knew Drew Brees no doubt first ballot hall of fame or what a career he has had and the thing is you watch them play by the way\nThere's no reason to believe that this guy can't wait for another three or four years at least like a health is always the caviar with any of these discussions whether we're talking about Brady or anybody but like\nMuch like we celebrate there's no signs of this guy slowing down either it's awfully impressive what he has been able to remember he was someone that was in the charters organization had the the big injury and the charters didn't want to keep them around and I'm not saying that Philip Rivers is terrible but still Drew Brees there's been incredible for the same we got this rule there\nAnd the dolphins out an opportunity to\nGet him member that was a Nick Saban was there and they decided let's stay away from this guy and so for him to do it after that significant injury and then\nTo add the type of career he's had and what he's mentioned New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina there remember the saints were a mess before he got there and him and his family what they've done for that area it's not only is he a believable football player but what he meant off the field has been tremendous\nLooking more like the Astros are going to head to Fenway Park for for game on it if it Red Sox can wrap this up the red Sox would host otherwise the Astros what House if they take on the Yankees but\nHow about Houston the bats are alive again and bats that were alive last postseason are live again more importantly George Springer in home runs again that looks familiar\nCarlos ... we'll see if it was a sign of things to come but certainly makes you feel a little bit that can can he get going here all my today and he's been terrible right and then you see certainly on the pitching from not\nNeeding to tax anybody that much to the series starting pitching was was fantastic Justin ... you'd have to worry about even considering the possibility of having him go on short red I don't think they would have any way but at even consider that because you roll through through today\nThey're filled awfully good if you're the Astros and right now the two teams that look the most dominant his postseason or the Astros Milwaukee Brewers because the brewers yesterday took care of the Rockies and were dominant the Dodgers we know we'll take on the brewers in that in L.\nC. S. now I'm a little glad that and in part of me wants the eighties but when the moral just so we get along Syria is not not for the Astros eggs I'd be good for them but I'm Talking that all these series of kind of the U.S has been there\nRight yeah they they you know they've been cleared and kind of flying by kind of wanted some good long series I you know it looks like most of them are going to you may be what we know we're getting four year lease but I after tonight anything can happen\nI Would like maybe the championship series will make up for it but I like some some good competitive baseball for a couple of games really haven't seen that in any of the other series I mean if\nThe Braves for the most part got dominated by the Dodgers certainly the Rockies couldn't score damn run against the brewers and the Astros for the most part dominated the Indians and really shutdown that oftentimes and yes the idioms that the starting pitching with a big topic there but\nWhen it came to the bullpen the Astros beat up beat up so we got our certainly made a lot of ... ask those fans happy and Andrew Miller wasn't very go to the bullpen either for the Indian store ...\nIn the Astros beat up ... beat up so we got our certainly made a lot of ... ... fans happy and Andrew Miller wasn't very go to the bullpen either for the Indian store Coney Island at all on and on\nAnd it was ... and one thing about the Astros was the main topic was the ... and how would the bullpen prevail in the playoffs are they only let one run go by and the three games a versus the Indians I mean so like you said they shut down often it's in the Indians were basically are falling the Astros style as far as the office of pick up the debate\nBut it didn't show up in the playoffs so I mean are they double up it was a problem all year a politically land is but I'm In the show today a tremor ... he spoke say things about that it shows an April and now they came to light in\nRight now so how's the ... games on the comments from Alex pregnant and who is of course at an unbelievable season and you know no big deal had a couple of more they get to today um post game as we knew that Astros fans employers were upset that they didn't get any games in prime time now I I still stand by what I said I with all due respect there\nWhen you had the Yankees red like they were always going to get the primetime match them but I don't fault\nAlex pregnant as a player and as with the Astros fan being using that to their advantage in terms of motivation I was pregnant pretty funny impulse game today kind of had a statement and brought up you know Tiger Woods if he's in the mix with a masters he's not teeing off early right\nAnd cut out of making a point that we were the the favorite if you will we were the defending champ and we got stuck or not being in prime time and and I get it they took offense it and maybe that use it as extra motivation well they'll be in primetime now that's for sure uh when it comes to the championship series not worry about that they will be a and prime time for a couple of games\nYeah I'm a uh is not to worry I mean luggage should take care of your business in the daytime\nUh with ... did I mean hey you can't you can't have it on the schedule and just play a game and that's what they did swept the Cleveland is now they're just waiting on the red Sox Yankees the ... so that it works out\nLet's take a quick break come back we'll get to the trash of the day also talked about the\nAFC North the AFC South in the NFC East we know the AFC North very competitive but who the heck wants to win the apes he's out there and see if we try to figure it out next\nHas to be they should have\nI don't know why I don't like the day Matthews and so did you say this is like nails on a ...

problems tonight on Monday Night football with the Washington Redskins eight forty three to nine teen victory saints won for in a row now for in one on the season to top that NFC South historical night in New Orleans for Drew Brees at sixty two yard touchdown pass\nFor the rookie each quants Mitt then that was good for history make him the\nLeading passer ... when it comes to yard each passing breeze and are passing excuse me far\nAnd manning tonight in to talk more about this dark all night and where are the same city and how they're rolling here with for in a row we welcome in John Hendricks who's at the Mercedes Benz superdome he covers the saints recipe nations canal street chronicles dot com and he joined us on the ... the site dot com inside line John\nThanks so much profit on with us here this late at night at what was the feeling like to be there in in the superdome when history was made\nA I I'd probably say overwhelming um ... motion going on and I mean look you know I was just happened to be a part of it that that's just a fellow at the end of that\nNow heading in this game there was a lot of build up everybody knew this was certainly are going to happen tonight when it comes to Drew Brees shortage and now just one touchdown shy of five hundred as well\nWhen you saw the the stoppage of play I'm assuming you expected that to happen and you saw the emotion from him and going to the sideline with his family ... you've had a chance to cover Drew Brees and what he meant to that humidity and I even saw on the telecast they showed fans a few of them with tears in their eyes just\nYou could speak to that moment in terms of what you meant in that accomplishment what even means to St fans\nWill look I mean even set it after the game a post game press conference talking about how much you wanted it to the band\nYeah well look I mean he even said it after the game and it's post game press conference talking about how much he wanted it to the the fans and the city and\nYou know you just said that yeah I mean he's a guy who's who's pretty emotional sometimes and I mean he's a father for wife\nVery good Christian man and look I mean he's a he said it best you know I cried a couple of times this week and for this he just he loves the fan base in New Orleans and and then feeling is reciprocated 'cause there's not a a person probably more little of it\nAnd this particular city and there is Drew Brees right now\nSo I'm with John Hendricks he covers the saints for SB Nation canal street chronicles dot com as the same skip the victory tonight I'm going to have football to improve to foreign one on the season and\nDrew Brees Tom Brady these guys that seem to be able to plant the same level despite the calendar year turning over at some point yes father time will catch up but\nMan I Drew Brees looks like he can be playing for three four plus years I mean when you look at his career and just his thought process is he a guy or you get the sense that he really will keep just keep on playing and as long as he really can\nYou know I I this is what I tell a lot of people is the fact that when you look at your ... stand there and training camp and stuff I mean this is the guy who's physically he takes care of himself\nAnd I mentioned the fact that he has you know for kids obviously that's gotta keep them on a toast to it you have any kids you understand but you know ultimately I mean from a physical standpoint is great on that um he's accurate as everything I mean look he is\nA perfect pass the rating going tonight for a while um but they didn't come out and he didn't miss much I mean he was able to throw the ball down the field\nHe's able to extend plays I mean as long as he keeps performing at the high level and this is a huge reason why they they had the makeup of their their office of lying getting somebody like Larry war for\nFor free agency drafting a Ryan ran check uh getting our Mayor Michael Thomas all these pieces coming together for this team is help your breeze become even better than he has been in the past\nI Know its nit picking a little bit and certainly a night we're we're the saints were dominant and look great but my only question what was it strictly because they were trying to get breezes five hundred touchdown and why was he saw in the game late I was saying that that's just not worth it from an injury perspective\nI I think there were some to it I think they wanted to keep the pope faced with what was going on um you know I thought that they could have pulled him earlier um [noise] I don't think you can make any argument for the school was closed or anything like that but I think with ... he's a competitive guy\nUm he wants to stay and he wants to do things he wants to be in there as long as possible and ah finally turned the reins over detecting water to the door and yelled at the end of the game\nWith Jon Hendricks he covers the saints for SB Nation canal street chronicles dot com the saints get the forty three Nineteen victory over the Redskins this evening in mark Ingram back how big is he for this team going for\nA huge I mean this guy is is a physical presence that things are just love to have and he's an emotional guy um he's very well respected in the locker room I mean the the whole general mood even after they've they beat the giants\nLast week was that everybody was happy to get twenty two back in the locker room back around the team um and it showed I mean he's just wore his emotions out\nOr that he was introduced in in the introduction pre games and stuff and the place just blew up so I mean that's just kind of impact that anger has on this fan base in this team and and it really show\nOther than this often so now the saints have one for in a row and sit atop that division on the defensive side of things that that was a huge story after after week one\nAnd and what they did with the box and given a forty points right to Patrick in and and certainly the deep in the last two weeks has played a lot better when you view this deep inside what what's the feeling around that unit and kind of going forward have they have some things out\nYeah and the biggest thing that they had had said after the first couple of weeks or look we're having problems with our communication are linemen and just overall some of these guys are brought in like a Kurt Coleman into Mario Davis\n... market stand for things like that\nUm they're just having a picture a couple of issues with assignments is that you and what those are things that you wanted to hear and those are things that obviously can be fixed and obviously they they were able to fix a lot of that they were able to bring a lot of pressure tonight I'm they last march on a lot of more due to a concussion\nUm they were down ... anti kale so look they had to kind of rely on some other guys um they lost Patrick Robert and Andrew reserve I mean so\nThey really battle through a lot of the different things and they've become more like what we saw last year for sure\nAs I mentioned that division at the same now for and won the Panthers three in on the box to into in Atlanta\nUh falls to one in four after their losses Steelers and heading into the season most consider this to you know the toughest division and ethically competitive division in football how do you view division now that we are five weeks into the season and see the same side in Panthers their top\nWell look you know I think a lot of us probably started laying it would be the ones that a top or a mini thought they were a Super Bowl favorite I thought Carolina could do some things because it always depends on what kind of came new shows up but you know look obviously I think the falcons are the biggest surprise\nUh the NFC staff probably the NFL right now with the way they're struggling on but look you know this is a division that's very tough\nUm you know so nothing's decided now I mean you know your your foreign one great you're wanted for well things can change on a dime here and um we've seen it over the years I remember twenty Thirteen states started really hot\nThey were able to do really well and and the Panthers came from behind and they were able to take the division for the same things have to go on the road play playoff games and they could only get to the division so I mean that's just kind of competitive division they have um I I think we're in for a long haul for sure\nJohn Hendricks he covers the same for SB Nation canal street chronicles Dodd's Tom thanks so much for taking the time after tonight's game I get some rest then I'm sure we'll check with you throughout the season\n... thanks so much\nAbsolutely great stuff from him ... pretty cool to be there
