deserved and we have a call for our guest Jason foot going from Lawrence in the champagne Illinois Lawrence a good evening and do welcome to the program\nOh thank you and good evening in both I wanted to share a some information about who it was it may have made that original comment a ten or more years ago I was watching a historical presentation on native PBS or CSPAN\nAnd uh what was portrayed was that there was no less than Benjamin Franklin who approached\nJohn Adams no less to uh make a comment that an apology was in order and debate for John could get onto apologizing or how they're he had spoken negatively about certain other members of the convention his wife\nA menu even said that a famous line apparently that a gentlemen don't read another man's letters to his wife\nWell who knows that may have been the uh the the original version of that it is a credited the Simpson and again in general but of course the the important thing is is the notion that somehow that to its own sporting a I guess in in times of rent a winning or potential war when in fact\nUh it it it may not be quote sporting but this uh this is a is a serious business\n[noise] well I just want I mean yeah\n... ... but again in terms of your agenda or perhaps so I I had not heard that particular story Lawrence but thank you for sharing a I'm going to go take a look at how you came across this story a Jason\n[noise] church so are you talking about surveillance and wiretapping and sort of American attitudes about all of that I'm In twenty twenty Thirteen I was reading about the Edward Snowden's leaks ah you know the Snowden story he revealed that the national Security Agency was gathering\nAh you know communications records of millions of sort of ordinary Americans commit says very surprising a lot of people surprising to me and I started to read about the end it's day\nAnd the history of being a say when you read about the history of the NSA all roads lead to this guy a William F Friedman Elizabeth Friedman husbands die he's considered to be the godfather you say\nIf you go to NSA headquarters at Fort Meade there's\nA large lord man by the way it was in Maryland directly between Baltimore and Washington\nBut go ahead\nSo if you if you go to and it's their headquarters there um you know there's a bronze bus William Freedman head outside of the auditorium is named in his honor and so he's he's considered to be the man but in reading about William a who was a code breaker famous code breaker I started his wife Elizabeth was also could break\nYou know that's interesting right how ... how many husband and wife or could raking teams can possibly be\nA and so I started looking for more information on most of that\nUm and there wasn't really that much out there but I did find a a a link to a library in Virginia [noise] private library that that happened to have twenty two boxes of letters and other materials that she had lost their before she died in Nineteen eighty one day I just decided to drive down I Lived in Philadelphia\nSo I drove down to the library and I I went inside and I said hello and your ... I I was curious about the Elizabeth Smith Friedman collection and\nAnd they were very friendly and they they brought out box one of the twenty two ah boxes but it was the last time I started reading her letters and I it was just one of these moments in in your career that you'll never forget because as soon as I started reading her her handwritten letter extra hundred years ago I was just\nA immediately taken with her and she's such a such a vivid kind of voice on the page uh and and the materials that library had where\nA or were the kinds of materials that any journalist and author would would walk to stumble across it was her original college diarrhea was there it was you know love letters that she wrote to William early in their relationship some of the letters were actually written in code was one of the\nAmazing thing I really love letter of yours who else would do that right\n[laughter] right yeah no I mean it's actually it's actually kind of a lovely because we we tend to think of\nYeah uh there were only a handful of women who are even getting PHD's in America I'm sort of the end of the line if you're a bright young woman a an educated was that he taught high school or you're taught middle school you're caught on entry score you got married you have kids and he died and yeah and she just wanted something more than that\nNo those are all added up to make a quote a woman's place unquote to at the time were there any instance when I came across in looking into her story Jason in the the woman who smashed codes of ah not just sexism but just flat out and out jealousy that she just saw stuff to other people couldn't solve\n[noise] sure ah\nThis was this was a recurring problem in in her career too is that she was a shoo in Salt lake spectacular\nCases are and and then\nShe would get written about in the paper because she was a story you know she was she was the American housewife who had two kids and yet ah during the twenties and thirties she was taking on these gangsters and she wasn't just taking them on in an office you know solving their messages and getting them convicted and she was actually a pending their trials and testify and\nSo they knew who she was\nRight the newer face they could see her and um it's just not necessarily the safest thing to be doing right you can you can uh you can imagine\nAnd um and so yeah so there were there would be you know there'd be gangsters or on trial a lot of these a lot of his running rings we're international crime syndicates those essentially the mafia and so she didn't she would walk into court a unprotected with you know a pink dress\nIn the end of an of a hat with a flower pinned to the brand and she would stare down these guys the defense table you know five foot three and she was a explain exactly how she had broken their coats exactly how she had essentially\nStolen their thoughts and uh you know and she did it fairly fearless we all all through that time\nBut it was necessary for her to actually get into the tradecraft in a court of law that that's remarkable again today of of course\nThe minute anything like that came up a federal agent would would would walk in with some kind of a of a federal court order and would immediately shut down that testimony at least in part of a public trial\nI mean that the free market you know these are things that were at least they are things that that uh let me put it this way when I left the army uh I took an oath not to talk about certain things which I have not that many many decades later I was even forbidden to visit\nA a a an iron curtain country for five years after I left the army and I was a a relatively small player albeit with a top secret plus clearance and the idea that she was ... the court and well this is how we did it I mean that that's remarkable [laughter]\nWell yeah I mean so you you are you in your career you you weren't able to you expose your sources and methods that would\nGet to the last thing that you'd be able to be a good way for me to spend some time at Fort Leavenworth Kansas behind bars and that is correct\nExactly exactly and and that and that's that was true that and it's true today but the fact the fact was at the time she had no choice she was she was asked asked to do this testimony by a federal prosecutors because the prosecutors needed to make cases against some of these international crime rings um\nThat were killing people and that we are controlling the the ... and so they they they wanted to get these guys in prison they wanted to take down me ... it's the only way to do that\nWell it's actually tried to make a case against them so in in would step Elizabeth and ultimately you know there would be a lot of publicity around these trials 'cause it's kind of spectacular\nVisual because he just petite ah America you know an American woman American mother testifying against these guys so she got all kinds of newspaper coverage that were front page newspaper stories about Elizabeth fell through the Nineteen thirties and uh and the tone of them were ... ... it's sort of was like a\nBut there was a woman doing things that men could into I'm looking right now at a at one of my favorite clips which is a story a true story published about Elizabeth and in a magazine called true detection a detective fiction we weekly\nOne of the true story about her out and the title was leading men out there and there was this just lining the story about um how small slender American Woman to step in\nAnd smashed crime where men had to sell [laughter] uh so she was she was a state tax and she was she was a spectacle\nFor ... and obviously that made a lot of her superiors very happy I'm sure okay we're going to come back and talk more with Jason ...

he's toned down yes he has and it's about damn time to be toned down\nI think he may finally got the idea that his job is to be president of the United states then to pursue certain policies not to entertain his base he's better than he was with the fact is he still engages in rhetoric that create enemies he does it need\nAnd in some cases may have impacted a twisted mind again that does not mean that he is to blame for the\nMethodology of a sick individual but it does mean that this does not benefit President Trump the Republican Party or his viewpoints and if he is in fact toned down
