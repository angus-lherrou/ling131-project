the tax will just to see how those former NFL coaches are doing this\nSo with former NFL ties and that's why we take a peek impact will just to see how those former NFL coaches are doing because you know you play to win the game you do in college where you play to pay the players\nA lot of those guys going to be for fifth round pick for to take pay cuts ...\nThat's easy [laughter] or\nA man the eight cheating and try and that's what the old saying is true\n\nThat part of it is true for the giants lose an absolute heartbreaking fashion thirty three thirty one on fixed fifty three yard prayer of a field goal\nNow this was a legitimate question because the giants got the eagles next week than there in Atlanta than their home against the Redskins before they hit the brake the by their one in four\nAt what point do you start shopping Eli Manning\n\nBecause look we are friends of line even though you spent all the money on sold all the other four guys on the line will Hernandez is okay but he's a rookie year the free got stuck\nA at what point do you try to get some draft picks for Eli Manning\nAnd who are the teams that you look at and say you are ... or you can play whenever the giants actually give him time he delivers the football where it needs to be\nAnd you know he never loses his cool no matter how crazy the situation is but the giants they literally wasted the last five years of his career\nBy surrounding him with a garbage wine and then last year they totally punted on the season 'cause they last for wide receivers in one week and then you know what will just use practice waters\n\nThe giants are going to rebuild they don't want to admit they're in a rebuilt during all rebuilt\n\nPlaying Philadelphia they're going to be one in five next week because the giants are offensive line is not going to be able to block the eagles just go on and as it is the Giants' line it's one of the six worst ones and football\nThey're not going to be able to block the eagles at this point in his career you've got to give you like on\nA lot of time but any time and there are too many times do you like can't finish the five that drop without getting here\nThere are too many times they go on bart was getting hit in the back of your life as he's getting a handle because the giants wind is really bad\n\nThere are some teams that should probably be calling the giants about ... we'll take a peek at some of them next oh\nHere's the force right this is really comes down to the success of the Chicago Bears have taken the same for me was the only reason why I

claws\n\nBut the giants are going to have to be real and understand that considering the lies age he's thirty seven this team is not ready to compete this year they're not going to be ready to compete next year either\nThey're going to need to move on and find out you know what they have on their existing teams backup quarterback position and they're going to need to start looking to identify a or

joining us right now on the news ah dot com you saw on the line [noise]\nI guess we're calling on the Los Angeles chargers\nThey're kind of like the nomadic chargers right now for the Orange County register he's running charge you what's going on right\nOn the bed me as far as I Know they are still the LA Chargers although there were more raiders than that for their own the stadium I hung up on it I\nI honestly I feel bad for the players because they are Eighteen without a home\nYeah it's the the video you know what you do it better than either to me the ownership situation is a really big problem in that they turn their backs on their fans went to a market that didn't want him\nAnd put secure a real stadium\nAnd now they can't get any of their own bands Everytime you go to a game all you see is the colors of the other team and the fans I\nDo think that one that new stadium opens in twenty twenty or we might be quick to forget about the stadium that choice and then and now everything played out at the START I think right now you\nKnow they they are in kind of a weird position I mean the timing was just strange to come into the market shortly after the rams now Iran you know looking like one of the best teams in the NFL the walk in Denver\nAnd the chargers or you know just kind of plodding along it at three and two that are making the best of what the ads and you know this is a potentially good team so if they go to the playoffs and you know they have enough talented and move on you know pretty hard for us I think\nThat the tables were turned pretty quickly but\nThe raiders job a pretty serious fan base here and one is probably bigger than than the charges have in LA already so that was pretty clear unfunded but it didn't matter when they gave it\nRunning this theme was was by a lot of people thought this chargers team had a real chance to win the west\nThe three into um [noise] how good is how good tennis\nThis chargers team had a real chance to win the west\nThere's three into um [noise] how good is how good tennis team legitimately be\nFine they get to a potential playoff seeing a at this point all of us is going to be a tough battle to win considering what they're up against the teeth are already by the now they have a window where the chargers\nI in LA so it you know to to be able to back them where they stand right now pretty doubtful but in terms of wild card teams were still talking about a conference that it's wide open so\nThe fact that they were able to win these past two weeks you know they had it into a stretch now with with Cleveland in Tennessee to definitely when a ball games for routine as talented as there is\nSo ... if you're a team at five and two coming out of the next to leave heading into the by ah we're looking at them very differently but at this point I still would put them on on a path that gets to the to the wild card but you know from their ... anything that was really\nHow bad is the news we both\nWork he's out through the by week which obviously is you know that's half to see them so that's a definite disappointment given that the initial prognosis was that he would definitely be ready for a week want\nSo that didn't quite work out as the charges will vote but\nI think they're that they're trying not to hurry him along which which I agree with and given how the defensive kind of bounce back of the last two weeks\nI think he can comfortably say that the chargers\nI you know won't need him I as well as much as you can not need a pro ball\nPass Russia but I you know he will be healthy as far as we know that second half of the seasons out and that's when the games are really start to matter a when we try to get you know near playoff time so I think once they get it back then we could be talking about you know I truly\nTruly very good charges even which hasn't been yet\nYou know Ryan Philip Rivers continues to just play really good football twenty twenty seven today three thirty nine to Paris touchdowns he's still has that lightning fast relief to get rid of the football\nOr is he he looked like you slowing down at all or is he so same old Phillip Rivers\nOdd to think about the river is is that I Do think he is probably lost all Armstrong I he doesn't quite move like you see those things that's the only true\nOh come on silicon rag losing ... couches he's always move like that [laughter]\nTrue true it is gearing three couches [laughter] he he did have a a\n... in the last game I sneak play they as you said he hadn't done in years but\nI but yeah no I I think you know the the part of top rivers game that was always the most dangerous was his mind anyway so he's a quarterback that could weather and change through or you know while he starts to leave from Saint Paul he loses for speed jihad\nI so I think you know if he was a place for you know the next three or four years I I see no reason why he couldn't get to at least this level\nAlright totally hypothetical question if the\nCharge them the giants never pull off to deal with the lion Philip Rivers bombing the giants are offensive line the last five years is still of rivers dead\n[laughter] the one about ... wherever it is what actually would make him a better choice than you know I ... I think even in the giants situation and then you get rid of the ball so fast\nIt's one part of a game I never quite understood it until I was watching him on a weekly basis\nI was just that he gets a lot of fast that he can make up for you know questions along as often find he's doing it already this season I mean today either starting left tackle was a backup from pick their starting right tackle was an on drafted rookie free agents\nI'm so they weren't operating with much on the edges today and the river is still only with Saks one time and that's\nNot necessarily as much credit to the the tackles plane went on as it is to fill up the rivers as being that good in the pocket and that's really then one of the most impressive press is game this year\nRound grungy Orange County registered covers a charge on the side are comp inside line Ryan you know when when people talk about the best running back in the NFL you know Todd girlie\nLevy on bill when he actually shows off\nYou know David Johnson maybe he was on a better team does Melvin Gordon belong in that conversation\nI he's definitely making it hits civil hung in that conversation this year I mean he's really turned himself into a multifaceted back east one of the charges most active receivers\nAdded another sixty plus yarger thieving today in addition to sixty are on the ground I he pretty much thought that every week now and he's not going to necessarily explode for a hundred yards underground but he's going to have a hundred and thirty all purpose yard and production\nSo he in terms of fantasy value I I can understand why people would I Would definitely love them and fantasy football and the chargers I Know are are really impressed with the step by step forward he steak and especially over this last year and provide him with Austin heckler who kind of\n... who is the more that shift ear a young speedier back I think the two of them make for a perfect combination I I'm not sure that that is that it's better that you know together in one back in the entire and so\nYou know and I worked in the news too you know have impacts on games that are forty four yard touchdown today a on a path to disturb receiving touchdown and a year", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "08"}
