Michigan has has had some pasta Ohio State to before everything changed as far as the rose bowl being the brass layoffs and all that sure if you look at what this program has done then oftentimes we talk about what Paul has done here since he took over but\nYou know what all the coaches have done very stepped aside and they've kept his legacy alive yup and I think\nThat's where your legacy in your group has grown because the fact that the program has increasingly gotten better yeah we've been through multiple roles bulls now that I think one very came in ... he was young\nWhat forty years old roughly forty one whatever was um when I had a plan and he knew how to win the big thing because he'd done it and I was Hayden Fry and damage ... and Bernie Wyatt and brought in some guys that were with some had um Notre Dame ...\nUm he had guys that they knew how to win and knew how to coach knew how to set the tone knew how to recruit\nUm and I think that's the beauty of the plan really hasn't changed the way you recruiting and type of players are going after it might be different facilities certainly are different um and how that impacts recruits than in a family is in the education you get here and they've done a great job of the department promoting\nA academic supports and and you across the board right um but I I think the the ... for us as the\nGuys that come here no it's it's kinda like we're going to grind we're we're going to play smash mouth um but we've gotten a skill guys if you want to go to school with us\nWe can do that too um and through the years you've had different players had different positions that have stepped up for a number of years we had great Titus that we can get some really good receiver and our kind of getting back to tie it into running backs a lime Lyman the banking system defensively we're a little bit short on the defensive back side with some young players what some good young players\nIt kind of the ebb and flow of things but when when we switched in transition from one to the other other guys are stepping up and that's where you see the death come into play and some\nGuys have bought into what's being sold their uh in that hadn't changed from year to year in Florida State has won national championship now they're really ... we don't do that will level off with things and I think that's because of the hard work and the way coaches approach things in the expectations academically and athletically the\nCoaches put on the kids and and it's not so much scream and yell right\nI Want the best for you I'm going to push you and challenge you to be the absolute best you can be in in all phases while you're here\nAnd if guys respond to that then you see the product on the field in the classroom and good things happen that way and then that's I think a credit to the type of coaches that we have this isn't just football right you see it with basketball we see with women's hockey the track and field for a long time with the nutty comb cross country who's going to be hosting the NC double a shirt a few ... I mean\nIt's really cool to see how this whole program has evolved and growing with the expectation that you're going to win\nI think it's also kind of ironic that when the program appear to be going a bit sideways\nCoach Alvarez didn't I'll always refer to his coach but he went back to the blueprint yeah and he went ... back pretty quick\nAnd he went out east and he knew what he had to do and he went and got Paul and he got Joe Rudolph yeah and you know really really well he was a part of that he was a key ... Ninety three Ninety four team for sure and those guys right at the ship quickly and other programs back to where it was before again\nHave to help those young guys get up to speed in a hurry\nOne eight six six eight nine to eight to five nine one eight six six eight nine to eight to five nine we should remind you to the badgers didn't win the football games that I Would just want to\nStress that it's more so [laughter] yeah it it's a good thing it was a great night forty one\nTwenty for the fun let's get a padded walking path listening in tonight my friend how are you\nKnow I'm a notice the order tonight it's first baby Ninety three ... years ago I don't know how much time I got I got to\nGo fast first badger football game was probably Seventy seven uh my older sister was a freshman Matt town\nI think it was probably against the buckeyes or sitting in the upper deck on the west side um\nWe probably lost maybe something like forty nine to seven um I'll never forget the first four I heard the stands though Ira Mathews I think he was number three ran a kickoff back for the red and white for the batters\nThat was that moment in the sun that day I was a student from eighty to eighty six day McLean uh started turning us around from Sandusky, Ohio I'm took us to some ball games I was there for the ... or any right to out soon\nTo be a chef no um but nothing compared to

the last\nSegment you mentioned the fact that it was not Kobe's fault that shack left town can you explain that a little bit further\nWell you know what happened with this organization was that they they got into that new CBS the contract between the owners and the players association and in the process of um\nRegulating how the climate that's what we're the we're in the fleet there was a certain structure which she could only pay X amount of dollars before there over the calf which restrictive move with the players and then there was a luxury tax if you will see the calf at a certain level\nWell we'll check you know making the salaries if he was making thirty some dollars thirty to three million dollars and the level of which Coby was going to move into with his free agency\nOr which would possibly take the Lakers into or close to you know sixty million dollars without even having any other players on the team\nThat luxury tax was going to severely down with the prospects of a wake of the nation [noise] um so the ownership decided that you know when when Chuck did not want to sign for exactly the type of money ends up signing with for the Miami Heat wave\nBut that you know when when Shaq did not want to sign for exactly the type of money ended up signing with the Miami Heat wave he didn't agree to those type of terms they felt like he would want the same salary or better\nOr that they would have to move I'm simply so that they can be a viable as tea and to be able to sign Kobe Bryant who of course is seven eight years younger than Shaquille is\nSo it it was the vice or they were caught between a rock and a hard place and they have to make that choice of rebuilding lower we've asked me will Steve Round Kobe Bryant\nNow we have nothing to do that they do the bans I'm you know sat there is a free agents assess forty wanted to do but the over the Lakers when they are ...\nAllowed that open door\nTo give him the opportunity to come back to the Lakers and with the promise that they would revamp the team and rebuild and we re establish a team they could win the championship and probably body and\nAnd in by in him coming back to this organization or staying with the Lakers or the onus was on the Lakers to try and get back into that level that they had\nOne spanning have off for a long period of their history that at the top notch teams in the league\nSo you know when they have that very a dismal season following a you know at the behest of the owner Jerry Buss you know I felt like yes I could come back and help us to restructure itself and get back in the winning ways\nOne of the things that has been said about you is kind of years then manner in which you kind of look at things a little bit differently a little more thoughtful you look at the big picture\nAnd one of the things that I wondered about and I really um I really have to compliment you want now is the fact that you don't know do knee jerk things and I when I was going through his legal problems\nYou were able to keep the ship owners straightened steady path that's not always an easy thing to do when you're dealing with players who have egos players that are insecure failure is a great motivational tool for players as well what was your what was your mindset and what was your plan to keep your team even keel during that troublesome time\nWell what we try to do is we tried to make Kobe's life as easy as simple as possibly be um that was an easy but we had that solicit from the players the fact that you know he was going to miss practices do the court appearances he was going to\nMiss team planes he would probably be able to catch up with a team maybe make it to the game\nAt a young and appropriate time yes you know he would have a chance to perform in the game some of the times he came to the games I Would say within an hour of tip off\nA to perform that year and so that disruption and a half a distraction you don't have any mental middle mobilized and we try to keep that I'm\nAs caused him as we did was we couldn't well remarkable things about Kobe is that you know when he when he didn't have these um overriding\nI'm no\nExcuses or demands on his life\nUh to do this trial work and to also have to ... and he who caught in the courthouse in Colorado\nA he uses for middle level was even more remarkable and his his performances art and night to day basis because um you know he's just that kind of person that steps into um problems or into challenges\nWith the uh the the mindset of a champion in you know to prove self writer to prove himself\nCapable I guess is probably what you do as a challenge to ... and you know he he was a he was very remarkable during that period of time we we had our uh we had our conflicts during that year because I felt like a you know at times\nUm you know he challenged the direction of the\nTeam and yet we ... we went to a championship and had our opportunities to with a you know for the championship that year which was a remarkable year\nI remember talking to Michael Jordan and I've heard this said about the great players no matter what the sport might be believes that the great players when the game is on the line they want to be able to want to be the ones to determine the outcome\nIf they succeed they want the glory if they fail they'll take the blame and Michael when I mentioned that to him he said absolutely and what Michael always did was that he understood from a moment to moment basis in any game what needed to be done in order to be successful if it meant\nBinding behind hands fine if it meant diving for a ball or whatever it was just totally possess some of those same things or all of those same things or is he still growing as a player\nI think he possesses Ninety percent of that trade you know the knowledge the ability to challenge the desire to take the risk than reap the rewards are fell you're not afraid of failure and um\nOne one of the territory is I think Kobe as well as learned ours learning more than anything else is how to be supportive sometimes ... percent of that caliber or those qualified or qualifications\nUm has trouble understanding failings of other people or the ... the average player might go through and the ability to uh\nTo compensate and to support the\nPlayer when he was going through a hard period of time or a salon for whatever it is a very important aspect of the leadership is always learning\nUm I think Kobe's at the age where Michael and his FIRST Championship if I'm not mistaken and it's kind of interesting to see um the level of maturity that started the forum when this guy's now and the back of a maturity that Michael had at that age\nUm you know there's so many similarities it's kind of awesome\nHow much of your success as a coach Phil is the technical side the actors in the ... and how much of it is you managing the team managing the personalities the eagles and being able to manipulate and I use that word in a positive way manipulate the players to do what needs to be done", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "07"}
