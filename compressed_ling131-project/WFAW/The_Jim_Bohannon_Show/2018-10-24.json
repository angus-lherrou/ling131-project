concluded that thirty one years ago with Mikhail Gorbachev\nAnd let's see what we have denied on the mind of a Glenn who calls in from Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a job Glenn the good evening\nThey chew first satellites to uh agree with President Trump would draw for the treaty\nThe boy had a job Glenn the good evening they had to for like two or three was President Trump's withdrawal\nFrom the tree and then also the general comments about John bold and I think he's a national security stood my comment is is when I was in the military all to the seventies and the smell of the purging to live so cruel my\nIn Germany they were saying that the European Union is going to allow these intermediate range of weapons that we may or may not produce to be put on their soil they scream bloody murder about this at the end of the ...\nWell I don't know I mean I assume the NATO countries that have a certain obligations Jed but you would know better than I\nWell I mean they certainly do but I you know ... where he's raising a very very good point I don't think that the NATO countries are going to allow a ... radio range of ground launch cruise missiles or any other kind of nuclear capable missiles on their territory oh so that's one of the reasons that I'm saying in my article\nOr that we probably don't need necessarily\nTo develop a tit for tat ... are there are a lot of things that are driving us to do so I mean certainly the defense against the Chinese intermediate range weapons could include a an intermediate range of our own\nBut I'm not advocating necessarily that we have to develop and field and I ended up violating type\nCruise missile ourselves are a lot of other ways to do this my preference frankly\nIs for us to bolster our missile defense systems\nWe have some very good in this all the system but they're not perfect by any means uh they're probably not going to stop more than twenty five or thirty percent of any missile attack and that certainly is not good enough so we want to do I think\nIs to offset what the Russians are doing here put a lot more money and a lot more time into perfecting are missile defenses\nThat deserves a follow up of course the whole notion of missile defense or so derided as the star wars by Senator Ted Kennedy and others the point of fact there is nothing about the notion of a missile defense that is in the middle east impossible you were talking about the speed of missiles and the speed of computers\nAnd ah the the the course of the speed of computers is increasing every second it seems like that and it's only a matter of time before we will be able to as the old expression went shoot down a bullet with another bullet that this is not something that has any inherent impossibility difficulty yes\nWell and you write about we've already done it I mean the question is how to get it better I mean we have systems right now our strategic missile defense system station and California and Alaska are capable of intercepting a ballistic missile in flight [noise]\nUh we have the fad a terminal high altitude air defense system\nOr we have batteries are and I think South Korea I Know we have in other nations to I don't know they're in Britain or not but yeah we have a lot of other places\nAh you know the systems work they're not a hundred percent sure what I'm saying is let's put the money and and and invest in the science and engineering and get a systems to the point where they're going to be a lot closer to a hundred percent effective\nDo a call from Zach in a western Nebraska good evening Zach\nGentlemen I'm calling in about the uh the boat and then today with two and a and a than a a little clip a quote of ... who was saying um about the American eagle eating all of the olives and all we have left as the arrows\nAnd or I Want to back up and and just tell everybody I did vote for Donald Trump um and the reason I did that was because of the non intervention all uh aspect that he was portraying during the campaign or and I heard that term Neil Combee and thrown around\n[noise] and uh yeah I think that's exactly what's happening here and you know I I don't understand why we the American people continue to let these banker wars dictate our politics\nI don't know that we are allowing any quote banker wars to dictate any politics nor do I see anything in tonight's discussion that Jeb that wouldn't be in reality a pulling back from war anytime you allow someone to aggregated treaty in this way you're almost inviting trouble aren't ya\nWell I've ... I mean even the Romans had his phrase for its use taught from rebel of if you want a piece for war\nAnd that's really what we're doing here we're not allowing someone to violate a tree and get away with it and whether or not we\nUpped the ante as you know a very different question and how we do it is a much better question so I don't know exactly by bankers sponsored wars or you know that that sounds a little frankly paranoid to me\nAnd it got up we'll build a little bit recently but the more we can push the price of oil down the harder it is for ... new company to do anything and we had a very big win a lot of people that are recognized this ... this week Angela Merkel was no friend of ours\nWas saying that yeah okay maybe Trump is right and she's going to try to put money into a new port facility to receive liquid natural gas ships coming from the United states and the lesson there then German dependence on a on Russian gas\nSo this is something that's a very big deal and that hurts pooling pretty badly too so yeah we've got a lot of different ways to respond to this soda reference you know it's a game of measure encounter measure and that's the way the world works in as from time immemorial\nI had to bring up the inconvenient fact but I Believe twenty seven years ago when Ukraine became independent that its territorial integrity was guaranteed by the leaders of of Ukraine of the Soviet Union\nOf a that well the U.S bill President Bill Clinton and Tony Blair the prime minister of Britain I is that just totally swept under the rug no\nOf course but Mr Clinton making enforceable promised him on Jim Idaho you know it's like it's like Mr Obama drawing a red line I mean he jak show it's night everybody's getting into everybody's having a good time\nIn ... the fast in baseball parlance what I just said you was a batting practice pitch is you go there you go All right\nDo what he ... around the subject of about places where ... might shall we say apply his own pressure that takes us two or three other portions of the former Soviet Union like Ukraine\nThe Baltic states of Estonia Latvia Lithuania were once Soviet socialist republic that has to say part of the Soviet Union not just a part of the Warsaw Pact but actually part of the Soviet Union and the other like Ukraine\nThey are members of NATO which of course has the article by guaranteed an attack on what is an attack at all I Am frankly frankly wondered if the NATO would be prepared to go to the match if let's say there was a Russian incursion Latvia\n[noise] well I think to a treaty would require I think for that reason alone I think that a ... not going to just directly attack a NATO member\nA you know he's got a lot of but I don't think he is dumb enough to do that on the other hand you might be crazy like a Fox and bet on the idea that we would not respond\nBut we had Mr Obama say and twenty fourteen but we didn't have a strategic interest in Syria and again as as ... points out is is ... ... there may be a lot of people in Russia some of the heads of their ah military establishment that think that\nThat indicates that we might not respond if something went on Eastern Europe as well so it's possible it maybe even true that putting would believe that I don't think he's I um I think he did a lot of other options I think he can do things like continue to try to attack our election process you can do an awful lot of things and\nThey'll all roofs and other places and you know there there are not a lot of places where Russia can't be trouble these days\nYeah

A. lives near the good evening Doug welcome to the program\nHi Jim thanks for taking my call I enjoy your show thank you what I what I wanted to ask the mayor about Pittsburgh gone through a similar answer may jump from having industries feeling the biomedical and banking cetera um and it's doing well the reason is doing well however the city school the Pittsburgh city schools\nStruggle year after year fewer and fewer families are sending the ... the Pittsburgh public school they'll go anywhere else private school\nA Catholic school charter schools et cetera ... how is the Oklahoma City public schools\nAre they doing through the transformation of the economy\nIn your city [noise] well it's it's a little inconsistent certainly\nWe're we're a little different in that we have twenty four school districts that are inside the city limits of Oklahoma City and so you have all sorts of different success stories inside those twenty four but the largest district as about forty percent of the population\nAt the Oklahoma City school district and it's it's a you know performing poorly a similar to what you're describing in Pittsburgh\nSo I mean the urban public school setting it's still very much a stressful situation across the country in Oklahoma City there are a lot of good public schools are out all around you know that center part of the city\nAnd people have gravitated and that's part of the you know the ... to that took place over the last few decades people were searching for a better education for their kid\nAnd so we're trying to get more options you know charter schools and and other options for kids that for for parents that want to come in and provide more density and the core of the city but I I don't know the single mayor out there that satisfied with the level of education and their inner city district\nYou mentioned charter schools I wanted to ask you more about how successful they've been\nWell most of our biggest success stories are charter schools are ... now I Can't tell you that they're all high performing but a lot of them are\nUm and um you know are like my one of my granddaughters attempts at a charter school downtown and you know it it's run by a board of our business leaders\nUm who you know kind of ensure its success and um you know there's nothing magical about the about the model it's not that they have a bigger budget they have a smaller\nBudget it's not that they get the hand picked their kids they don't any kid can go there that lives in the district a but they've taken out\nSome of the inefficiencies I think that our public school system is played by and created a model that puts more dollars into the classroom so you know in in that one instance it seems to be working better I I\nLiked the idea that parents have choices um and in in Oklahoma City there's a lot of choices\nYeah I I Know of course the your acquisition of the NBA thunder franchise and also the opening it part of the maps three project was the the opening of the new stadium where the Oklahoma City ran archer AAA a baseball team are sports franchise is a good way to enhance the city because I Know some\nSome urban areas have become a disgusted with the ... demands from most sports franchise owners\n[noise] well it's been a big positive for us I I think one of the differences is if you if you don't have a a major league sports franchise and you get one it is on a superficial level up a level of quality that she didn't have before\nI'm not saying it should mean that much but it does and and the fact that that suddenly your sports teams are playing teams in New York and Chicago and Los Angeles it and that matters because the image of your city to a certain extent as who your sports teams play\nAnd there's a level of quality that a major league sports team can provide to a city the size of Oklahoma City I think it helps our CEOs attract talent from around the country\nWhen you know you offer somewhat a job at a company in Oklahoma City that person no matter where they live in the United states they're going to think of themselves if I take this job I have to live in Oklahoma City or if I take this job I get to live in Oklahoma City\nAnd having a major league sports team is an asset that would get more people that would be more likely to take that job on on a millennial basis my my input from young people is that they want to live in a city that's culturally relevant\nAnd that includes a pop culture\nAnd a major league sports team mates you culturally relevant when Russell Westbrook and Paul George to name a couple of our players\nYou know choose to live here and and choose to sign contracts here when they're offered contracts by every other team in the league seemingly um that sends a message that this is a good place to live a ...\nI think that when sports starts to become tired in a city is when they have more than one franchise and people get tired of subsidizing one new facility after another new facility now and so I I get it you know if you have three sports teams like Seattle there\nWhen we come up with a break here that that does that move here I'm going to finish your thought

starting to purposely create inner cities that urban corps where young people could walk around and I am an environment that has fewer automobiles um more pedestrian amenities\nAnd is still you know looks set to call you by the cost of living\nUm and amenities appeal to that generation\nOr any you know it's hard to generalize 'cause every cities differ\nBut almost every city out there in the

Missouri a down toward do roughly the Memphis metro area and along the Mississippi River I don't think that the New Madrid influence extends as far west as Oklahoma\nOh your thoughts are Mr Mayor\nWell I I yeah I think I think he's just sitting there like there's a connection with Brian that will and gas exploration and uh-huh and the earthquake it does seem like there's a connection there so you know central Oklahoma was already on a fault that was probably more susceptible when these water injections took place\nUm and like I said you know they pretty much diminished at this point is I think the scientists to work really hard and they know that you know you you can't survive a politically um if you're the cause of these ... a nerve being\nBut I think most people in Oklahoma have been very patient with oil and gas industry it's been a significant part of our economy for a long long time and\nMost Oklahomans are thrilled that the United states is in more control of its energy future going forward that we've been through life term and oil and gas industry is playing a major role in our economy\nUm but you know at some point their their technology has got to catch up but and figure out a way to do that you bring up the oil and gas that they'd like to bring out a without causing harm on all the rest of this\nNow in the Oklahoma economy of course a of began a pretty much wants to uh uh the presence of a lot of oil was discovered in and of course the automobile really coming into its own just about the time that Oklahoma became a state back in in Nineteen oh seven\nOr ... the Oklahoma economy has been tied with energy for for many years is the the state's economy are still that directly tied to do energy or has it been in effect diversified\nYeah uncle in the city has diversify with the student is luck and so Oklahoma as the state is overly reliant on the oil and gas and the student and as it was a little bit it's a it's a common it's tax revenues cyclical\nUm based on you know how the oil and gas industry is doing but in the oil and gas industry is going through such a transformation right now\nAll of the technology of the advancements that they've been baking and made them more efficient industry or you know with the current price which is much lower than it was just a few years ago they're able to make a profit\nUm I I Would say we've already reached peak oil and gas industry it just simply takes fewer people to extract oil and gas on the ground it's more technology driven and they get more oil and gas that it was just the will use to ... um and so the result of that as a more efficient business model\nOr one day they'll pull and pull ... fewer people\nAre but that has really helped the United states determine its own energy future ... we need to be less reliance on foreign oil\nAnd uh I think the only gas industries you know it's there's been a wonderful job in creating a better resources for our country here the United states\nYou mentioned the progress that you've made from that one cent sales tax I'm Wondering the extent to which Oklahoma City depends on uh the sales tax versus let's say the property tax or is that one of those few urban areas which as an income tax even what what is the basis for Oklahoma City taxes\nWell most of our operations comes from a sales tax and most of our capital aides come from property tax\nThe or the maps program as a little bit outside of the scenario I just described as it is for capital projects as well but in general that's old government in Oklahoma but is funded

gardening that border is a proven over the years they suddenly decided that it's to their advantage to let people through but it's not as though they're capable\nOf defending that border they have done so very effectively over the years and they suddenly stopped which for whatever reason there's a new\nA new president in the in Mexico city ah\nIf I thought that that would make a difference and there was no other way to do it I could go along with that idea David but honestly I don't I don't think that it's necessary to do that and I do believe that that's the appropriate way to go\n...
