quote about Obamacare we're just going to have to pass it to find out what's in it or to what extent do you believe this could have been the rhetorical rambling on the part of Nancy Pelosi\nWell no I think I think what she did is give a window to her so I think you know you brought up Obamacare the fact that she and her party\nBasically we're willing to pass this massive bill without having read it and the war basically engaged\nIn a a a propaganda campaign to fool the American people at least a portion of them into supporting the American people were told by the president and by the

but I Know the American people were not told that their deductibles would go\nA phenomenally um higher to the point or the insurance was almost worthless which was the situation a with Obamacare and and of course\n... I don't think the American people honestly told that what they were engaged in was nationalized saying I'm a significant industry\nWhen is it ... you know health care system in the United states is

to achieve again the enjoyed advise the means the whole thing was like that so Nancy Pelosi is engaged in that\nAnd I think this has been the strategy of the Democratic party who we look at ... you

from Arizona\nAs something other than what they\nAre yes we've been hearing a number of things about the people of the most notably a Christians similar from Arizona Claire McCaskill from Missouri are

go here uh your response James\n... well you know brings up this idea or when he talked about his movie analogies and that as we were talking about a political party that has made it their position not to accept the results of an election\nUm they've they've tried every way they can with their allies in the media to essentially not only undermine the president but to remove him from office using governmental agency so and it's all failed\nAnd yes there there in a mental state\nOf kind of the uh the dealing with is when someone deals with that\nI I was that our guest to answer that I suspect that most of us want to come up here and grab whatever is available or be it a jobs for those were the work ethic or a or freebies for those without\nA granted good conditions were bad back in their home countries but one thing I Would add to those who are upset about being separated from their children\nIf in fact you had a husband and wife who happened to bring their kids to work and work was holding up a bank the kids would be separated from their parents once they were apprehended they're breaking the law entering this country if you do not wish to be separated from your kids don't break

want\nAltercation and injury this is a so it's a delicate situation but here's the big picture we simply have to stop the if he were to get into this country\nThere would be an endless number of caravans and ah it appears as though the people that want to abolish ice they democratic socialist so they called themselves the people that want to open borders seemed to never be able to answer the question\nOf how many immigrants is enough\nAnd so they seem to be on a trajectory to turn the United states into a third world nation because there are certainly enough people in the world that would love to come into the United states of America with to just want to walk across our border and not have any red tape and be able to get\nBenefits at the same time\nUm especially for example the state I'm In California they're ... they want to give them healthcare\nA tuition discounts and for all I Know probably proposing giving each one of them a condominium on the ocean [laughter] [laughter] it

[laughter] so you found your way to uh to Hollywood\nAnd the subtitles or the goals photographer Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of uh make believe published by a Adrian in live in I Believe\nYes which is a part of Simon and Schuster\nYeah ah ... what exactly are we talking about here in terms of uh the ghost photographer\nYou know I I Will tell you that at the heart of the book is actually a transformational Journey Through grief [noise]\nWas hoping it might sound on\nTo marshal tells him and his\nI Believe that actually makes it a the Halloween season and uh where do I do are we talking about those things just a tad spooky tonight with Hollywood executives\nWho has written the than ... book the ghost photographer Julie ... our guest at a she has put some considerable thought\nAnd imagination into the steel works the are the most uh I guess a scary or realistic thing you've ever seen in this particular paid\nWell and it's a really great question because there's certainly things that have been scary that I've seen and um and there's things that are scared that experience that actually didn't say\nI think that I had at one point and in the house I made back I I think after if you will the door kind of crash down\nInto the other side for me and had a lot of ghosts if you will that I'm kind of entered the house\nAnd we had heaters turning on by themselves light of and computer ... it was it was absolutely insane and and so that was probably more frustrating but probably the scariest thing was the first ... said I I I took a picture of\nBecause it was the idea of it actually scared me and this is where the holiday weekend in the play where the students that may hold her guy\nAnd so I'm thinking to myself oh no have I opened a portal and am I going to get sucked into it and you know start screaming out for Carolyn or something I I I really was petrified\nUm I have I have seen 'em some sense scary scary goes that look like they've been beat up a\nGhost I had no idea\n[laughter] I didn't I think there would beat up before they cross ... or ... I see okay yeah and so there was like eight of black guy in like a a fat lip um so yeah there's been some scary things for sure but I think that first one was more scary for me because I don't know what the heck it happened\nIs Hollywood doing more of this value had this to return to Halloween the movies with\n'cause I didn't know what the heck happened\nIs Hollywood doing more of this now you have this return to the Halloween the movies with a a a Curtis\nJama Jamie Lee Curtis Curtis yeah\nAre we going to see a return to those good old days of a of a scary this and the Freddie Krueger and that sort of thing\n[noise] you know kind of it looks that way doesn't it I think that guy's like say symbol on um have figured out how to make 'em really commercial um horror films\nUm and you know and it was so interesting I think about the horror genre and Hollywood is it really is that movie that you want to see in a theater because you want to be next to someone even if they're a stranger\nYou know it's a it's a really great reason to go and have a communal experience\nIn terms of of of how we review these things anymore you are the days of the the movie theater limited are we going to be downloading in the future\nAs far as I was asked that question a on a panel for my day job and um my answer was I Hope not\nBecause the way that we respond to storytelling at home is so muted it compared to the way that we respond to them in theaters\nSo for instance um if you're watching a comedy at home you might smirk you might have a smile cross your face but if you're in a theater and other people are laughing you laugh out loud and when you laugh out loud your body chemistry changes it actually releases endorphins\nAnd so you enjoy yourself more so I I Hope I Hope everything's not just download and we sit and watch things by herself\nThe the whole future of of Hollywood I suppose is is predicated to a certain extent ... on the on the various a revenue streams uh theaters for example a gift to an awful lot of their money off of the concessions no\nNah things so they do\nYeah does Hollywood do the kind of bad but if you're showing a blockbuster movie in the theater pools in the X number of dollars are off of popcorn and the and the candy to twelve dollars a candy bar or does the lives of the film producer get a cut of that that's where the money is\nI'm not that I'm aware of what you'd be winter I Would I Do yeah I Would be so I'm pretty sure we don't know All right yeah\nUh the terms of of the ... the creativity the goes into a Hollywood productions the seat for me to some of the highest concentrations of creativity leaves days\nGo not it to the TV shows or even the surly feature movies you seem so to me the some of the highest levels of creativity at least per se\nPer second of air time if you will go into music videos in commercials\nHuh you know what that's a really great question I you know I can tell you and I think it depends upon the film you know when it comes to cost\nThat it it really depends upon the special effects you know the cost per second on an animated film is actually quite extensive\nCosts for a second on something like a star wars movie very expensive Avengers very expensive so it's really more I think about the effects ... than it is anything else\nDoes does does Hollywood depend too much on affects how\nWe don't have much in the way of star power in the script sucks but boy we've got just a great computer graphic or a special effects are long as you're going to screw light and magic on your side can you sell the public anything\nYet now you can you you can't sell the public I think I got to tell you consumers are so smart they are so smart which is why you know I started digging into the the data side of things is to is to understand the Kuster was ... and there was a day when you could just make I'm living in ... to go see it [noise]\nUm this is probably more like twenty\nTwenty ... Twenty years ago um but now people are smart if they can they can kind of smell a bad movie and it's not that I said listen\nI from what I've experienced and I and I had to pretty you know the the kind of start with that because I think it's fair either not experience everything in it for every movie in Hollywood\nMovie no script ever starts out to be a bad movie you know and\nAll gone with the wind or some some games of storage [laughter]\nRight I mean and sometimes you might have a script that you might have helped me to not totally confident in but it turns out to be is a phenomenal film [noise]\nUm so you know but I I think people are are really smart and and you know I don't I Can't do we rely too much on special effects you know some of our most successful movies and the ones that I've personally the most proud of our movies like hidden figures\nUm fault in our stars there wasn't a single ... um special effects in any of those films um you know Slumdog Millionaire was a an Academy Award winner for the studio and not a single effect I you know I I think there are a lot of effect certainly more than we've ever had um but I I still think there's room\nYou know for those films that doubt at least I Hope so because of the some of our our best stories\nIs an article of faith among the good people in this country there's anything that comes out of Hollywood is automatic you'll you'll be left wing of politics preaching to the rest of his memory or disagree\n[noise] oh God is it preaching it doesn't feel like preaching to me\nUm you know I I I don't think that\nThat is fully accurate I think that maybe some of the stories that come to us might might appear that way um you know it's funny I you know I sit in these rooms every day and\nYeah I'm a girl from Oklahoma I grew up at his ... million and a Republican household\nUm but I can still enjoy a story\nWhether you know no matter what my political beliefs are or or not and I think that you know what I Would I just what breaks my heart is how politicized stories had become because movies like hidden figures should never be considered politicized because there was nothing political about that movie\nOr the
