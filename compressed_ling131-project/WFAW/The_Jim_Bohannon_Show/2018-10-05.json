available shortly online both Amazon and I\nDo still get to have a Facebook page\n[laughter] well you know it's interesting I'm a year to ... when we initially set up the trailer we actually had um some glitches or which we we have no reason to\nTo believe or said no that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over the shoulder I mean what's interesting is uh Robert upside is this a PHD used to always peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how Google could swing\nAn election uh well you know one direction or the other uh by shifting millions of vote spy controlling the information they got the Washington Post ran a story on this and the next day he was blocked from Google\nYou actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson who we highlight in the film you say a\nPsychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocked by Google or from accessing his Gmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has millions of people that have downloaded his concept\nSo it does happen to people or more often than you think and it just demonstrates the power that this company has to decide if they're aware of them\nAre how they are going to control what you see and what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites well [laughter] I mean that's why they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think that the example you just gave our our particularly no worthy I mean there's sort of thing I I understand it happens all the time and and and what the oil being that that I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claim that they don't do this\nYou know that well that's exactly right and and one of the\nResearch studies that up Stein good\nThat is particularly interesting we'd go to this in the in the film is during the twenty sixteen election uh you they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John a blind way um but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches um on both\nGoogle and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was over a five six month period and then they captured all the search results that people God now some of these volunteers were in red states where some were blue states some of the Republican somewhere Democrats independents all kinds of\nGenders you know all kinds of social economic status and what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know things seem to be pretty balanced but Google in every single search position of the\nTop ten search results\nIs the result favored Hillary Clinton said\nWhat they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the seed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump\nIn the same search results [noise] um and you know by his estimate this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't tell so results at the end of the day [noise] um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is that science is essentially a political but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty six teams are and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses\nHis real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that when\nDecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that when they start sort of go into the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for\nThat that as citizens we benefit from access to all sorts of information all voices in the information um and that is just not happening in this era of these large corporations that feel like they have a duty and a responsibility to censor certain voice\nYeah which is another way to put them none of your damn business they don't have either to do your the responsibility [noise] uh I mean that's the kind of we just have ...\n... ... if he were alive today would think boy I was born to sue this is the perfect tool for running a a Nazi said\nNo your ear you're exactly right um and if you think about\nAll the sort of just Topeka and knowledge uh novels about a totalitarianism it was all predicated on one thing Jim essentially the power of the state\nWas going to smash and control people so you know in Nineteen eighty four it's big brother and you have these you know large television screens or these voices that are sort of pumping information to us but it was simple it's kind of the you know the the\nThe clenched fist right in front of your face you know what we're facing now is not any kind of police state\nAbout what we are facing is this all this power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the test\nBut it's still there and the power is still there and I I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a ... imagine I'm Mao or stolen or a Mussolini\nThat had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we give them an enormous power and Google basically tells us trust us yeah trust us\nGeorge Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Linda\nHow long can and I seem to make a quick comment a lot of ... believe that the party has been building a Nazi techno state with still going on Facebook and all these people but what I really called us asking that want to thank our guests for what he's been doing and about search engines\nAnd they're used to be I click which had and they they have another one called start page the same company that they got rid of ex click and that was if he didn't want to use Google result he wanted other resolved\nAnd I don't understand that Google press did they make them ... X clinic or what happened to it and I use that that go\nYeah I Know that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in this space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year for the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that\nIt's an apple product and Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing their searches but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that\nBecause they wanted the information and the data that comes through search results because that can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing everywhere and you're exactly right star page a\nIs a a search engine you get great results they actually use Google algorithm they have an agreement with the Google that allows them to\nAllow the search is to go without data being president I think that is that is going to change your ... biggest star pages becoming more popular it was a deal struck a while ago Dr go is good\nIt's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges them best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google but the price that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you\nTo either steer you are manipulate you in a way for commercial gain or for other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there is even you know discussions about the fact that bang\nWhich is the Microsoft products which is sort of the great rival\nTo Google a centrally in twenty sixteen struck a commercial agreements a Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement we don't know exactly what that agreement is\nBut um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google and a lot of people believe that there is some kind of arrangement where they're doing a search they're cooperating and search so that's part of a challenge there really aren't that many great alternatives\nBe

ah to do this but I'm saying to myself how are these people are getting in and and I just wanted to make a point on the testimony of uh\nWhat's your name a doctor and grind it forward\nRight right Dr Ford you know\nFor her to be saying that the anxiety and post traumatic stress and all that the first thing she asked for where she sat down was a cup of coffee\nI mean and then she strength sixteen ounce bottle with coke I mean for somebody is so nervous and stuff like that in front of a committee like that on Capitol Hill she was taking that caffeine pretty pretty well\nIt just struck me and then the laughter was the one thing that she remembers a traumatized your in laws and the sweat Nick woman that did the interview on NBC\nShe said the same thing\nThough after the laughing at stuff and that just you know I the credibility is just ridiculous I think you have to have is well in my opinion because if it if it drags on any longer I think he's going to get it\nAnd or if he doesn't get all this stuff but I really do believe he's going to get it\nIn this country it appears so I I think that that that is that I as I say it's safer to lead the way that the not so yeah I'm I'm with you day but I think that you're correct uh absolutely again or if someone is genuinely sexually assaulted I'm sure it must be a terrible trauma that most of us can only imagine\nFine I accept that our sympathies go to you are and I will assume that that you in fact were sexually assaulted you'll have the benefit of the doubt but when you go and making charges against somebody else you've got to come across with the appropriate information they do expect us to take you seriously\nAnd this I don't remember where and when when and all who was there but that doesn't cut it\nWe may still have

interesting that that you couldn't even or even get a any takers on that I I find that remarkable\nYeah usually usually somebody will take it at least as a joke that Trump was out here about two weeks ago mhm and I was supporting of course the Republican candidate so uh it looks like he's right on the agenda if he works now I'd say he's gone\nWell it'll be very interesting to see how are the votes of these senators from uh from questionable states in fact a a a will affect their their election outcome as I say I I think Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota\nHas failed in a way almost liberated because she's trailing so badly that I think that all she wants is a cabinet position in a democratic administration I I don't know I Would suspect that uh that she probably cannot rescue that seat in North Dakota\nCurrently its value on Republicans in forty nine Democrats that's correct\nOkay for the ... the ... probably the least reports allow and\nKeeps saying that the Republicans could vote could afford to lose two votes [noise]\nUh I I I've heard some reports that say that and for the life of me I don't know what they're talking about either no they can afford to lose one vote which would then be a fifty fifty split\nWhich would be broken by vice president Pence is tie breaker that's in the constitution and the event of a tie vote in the Senate if the ... the vice president of the United states however they lose two\nThen it becomes fifty one to forty nine against Kavanaugh there is no tie breaker and Kavanaugh loses so I I have heard that that also said no they cannot lose two you're you're absolutely correct or their their stupidity here but it's not yours Steve\nThat was owned a nice break a and a half hour\nWell again the we don't provide the news on the half hour those come\n... I'm not saying that but you but a lot to say that they were losing and wall and because of a wooden uh so that makes it you know oh a lot more closer [laughter]\n[noise] uh we didn't need to lose ... on you know for for any reason but uh I mean I can I guess I can understand them playing ... or\n... or something of is important I think I Would say that my daughter I Hope you understand as the daughter of a senator the importance of this the voters come up this way we can move the wedding to Sunday but if we lose this vote it will affect the entire country I've heard people say uh just what you just said and and my answer would be no\nNo that that's more important I mean it's not like your your daughter is not going to get married later getting married tomorrow or are I'm In this case if you're\nTalking about Saturday able to get married Sunday uh\nHe does say that he will attend the his daughter's wedding in Montana and\nUh uh\nI don't know this is an interesting thing right here though there's been an unusual late night phone call in which a senator Danes of Montana Heidi Heitkamp colleague call Cavanaugh I'm personally a short and that he has made arrangements to be there to get him across the finish line as needed\nSo uh [noise] for whatever that's worth a I guess he's found a way around that is so uh and that that's the short answer on that one that he has a he has promised Kevin Aviv needed he will be there so again a law that\nMakes me feel better and asked me feel better too I got to tell you Steve a I had been the bothered about that and I just rechecked uh uh the wires here and ah the GOP could hold the session open bar they overnight and allow Danes to vote on Sunday if needed to be\nA a whether or not the cabinet or a a a whether or not\nDanes a promise to Kevin means he would appear for hypothetical Sunday's vote is not clear but the GOP can hold the session open overnight\nAnd that could happen a so technically are in the in the Senate parlance that would mean that a Saturday would be a Sunday would be redefined as Saturday or they could do that and and I'll guarantee you if it came down\nIn Senate parlance that would mean that a Saturday would be a Sunday will be redefined as Saturday or they could do that and then I'll guarantee you if it came down to the point where let's say it is a it is fifty to forty nine against Kavanaugh okay\nAh I'll guarantee you that is what the Republicans will do and then the Danes will fly and quickly making a fifty fifty tie and the parents would cast a tie breaker so that clarifies that for me I I had been the most curious as to how how bad could happen and apparently that's\nThe circumstance that day in ... above a Montana will be there for Kavanaugh if needed we'll be back in just a moment\nTechnology too small to money like oh you have fourteen Logan passwords and you can't remember any of them are one or two does is a is awesome one two three [noise]\nTruth be so easy to switch and save on car insurance I'd taco dot com is super cool and present underscore exclamation point exclamation points Nineteen eighty five ...
