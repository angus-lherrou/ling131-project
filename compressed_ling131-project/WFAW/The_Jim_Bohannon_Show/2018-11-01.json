be response I\nMean there's a lot of areas of baggage for Trump I get that but the economy is not one isn't it amazing in this election cycle the economy tax cuts knocking down regulations\nAll races

T. V. it's about a year or so ago they didn't expose a on a hospital now I remember\nSeeing this in the west coast New York area this was in Jersey\nA metal in a hospital a\nMetal and hospital yes marketing US citizenship and childbirth services\nTo Russians and they called it are you ready America mama I'm Mehra mama A. M. E. R.

I mean can you imagine how blatant essays\nAnd all these regulators all these Jersey arrived ... they're not looking at this though\nNow here is um Tucker Carlson last night on his Fox show making a point because Paul Ryan and Ryan's I've had on my show several times in Philadelphia is good on some economic issues but on illegal immigration and things like this is very very weak he's a problem\nHere says some Asian because Trump and Paul Ryan had been gone back and forth on this birthright citizenship\nHere's what Carlson said taking it to another level a bigger level about what this is about with the Koch brothers and Paul Ryan and some of the Republican elites and you if you object to things like this birthright citizenship here's Carlson\nObviously and some people say when they don't feel like making a rational taste for their positions because they can't really quote obvious that the constitution requires us to give citizenship to the children of illegal aliens Ryan has no idea who just doesn't want to have a conversation about it he wants you to be quiet\nYeah that's exactly right across and again tonight I made this point it's more of what some of these elites and certainly the Democrat Party but some of the Republican about um the rights and all the rest of it that people coming into the country illegally for whatever purposes that they have\nVersus the rights of the average American and this is what the Trump campaign was about echoing that it wasn't just illegal immigration\nIt was lack of manufacturing taking on the Chinese global is all those things that the core of it that's what the debate is they don't want to engage in that debate they just want to call names\nI read the fourteenth amendment pretty clearly now I'm a law school dropout I got into talk radio with a year left in law school but I can tell you the fourteenth amendment clearly was not about this and I love what professor Eastleigh instead\nOf how we may have gotten to this it was about trying after the civil war and all that carnage to stop the southern states from denying some form of citizenship to former slaves that's what it was about it's clear just like Lincoln the film we need to film that's what it is\nYou know what that's the idea that Lincoln film I Love whether it's true or not Tommy Lee Jones the whole thing I'm\nDaniel Day Lewis it's tremendous\nAnd you know Lincoln by hook or by crook was determined to get the thirteenth amendment so that the Emancipation Proclamation wasn't just a piece\nOf paper we need a film about the fourteenth the men I don't know what the title is I don't know who should start you can help me out a series make a film without that\nWould really be about people coming here illegally or would it be\nThat still the south well up until civil rights acts and things of that nature Jim Crow laws but this was even worse okay the states will determine who's the citizen were not ever going to say these people are citizens that's what this was put into do not set up\nA mirror mama American mom\nCan you imagine how the New Jersey not see that until n J TV got it because it's going on over the place they don't care maybe they even support it why would we do that just think of how obnoxious people flying in here yeah we'll get dual citizenship and medical care and all the rest\nNo you don't that's not what being an American citizen you can't buy that you have to commit to it\nSo help me out what what should the film be called\nAround this I guess a Lincoln was gone and so we don't have that seminal figure we've got to work with that a little bit here but we'll we'll make it work I'm my name is Tom junior dental producing a film in Europe swords or the fourteenth amendment sitting in for ... bond west woods one\nAfter that\nAnd that's the I Am pro death penalty except a couple of provide those that if you're on trial for your life death penalty you get the very top lawyer that we can find think of the Johnny Cochrane of lawyers you're on trial for your life we should pay for it is is that serious too\nWith DNA and experts research and all that we were going to pay for that we're going to do our best\nAs we want to make sure we get the right person will ... hours is allegedly it hasn't been adjudicated so that I'll say it that way wolf is asked hear what you're talking about how to respect this is just back our or ... hours does he deserve\nThe death penalty is that what should happen here now wolf has I think is opposed to the death penalty doesn't want to say it he's\nPut a four year moratorium in studying the death penalty remember governors are the ones that sign death Marts he's right in the trail if he hasn't signed anything he's not going to listen to how this weasel caught in this about how horrific this isn't he ought to get the full was penalty\nHow he tries to dodge the question was should he get the death penalty here's how it sounded\nPlenty [laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\nOh [laughter]\nI Know what I like about this is too many problems on both sides post site we never get clearly where one says I'm going this and the other says I went that I'm good with that then people can decide this little weasel going back and forth I mean I guess he should've bludgeon him a few more times\nHe clearly doesn't believe this guy should get the death penalty so he's prominent off the defense\nWhat about um Pennsylvania what about under Pennsylvania law you want to tell us our risk this is as governor protecting citizens do you want the death penalty yes or no he clearly does just the man and saying what citizens decide do they want a governor that's going to sign death for it yes or no\nNo I Will always be in favor the death penalty with those ... that I told you the thing the only thing that stops me is I Want to be absolutely certain as we possibly can that's why this is such a good case because I don't see how there's any doubt here although he deserves his day in court\nIs rights and the whole let's just do it quickly let's get his lawyers let's give him the full benefit and if you're even this guy if you're on trial for your life you get the very best that's what we ought to do because it's that serious that being said\nThere's no mistaken identity everything is here wealth should he get the death penalty yes or no you know if you're opposed to the death penalty the man step up and say no you shouldn't I'm never going to be in favor the death penalty\nFine I just would like to know why does the obvious skate like this could it be thinks people in Pennsylvania really are in favor the death penalty or you want a proud on about how a ritzy things are but then even this case doesn't get the death penalty\nEight six six fifty Jim ... I'll be clear about this too it doesn't take in a recent case like this my standard as as you take a life in cold blood for filling the requirements of first degree murder you get the death penalty whether it's a big mouth like me whether it's an innocent baby mother ... it doesn't matter\nAll life is precious if you take it\nGetting the death penalty under law under those guidelines that I get why is it so difficult to say if you don't agree with that fine then I don't want you as governor of bees I unique design death for it's eight six six fifty ... that'll get you on board down to your Dana sending in for Jim ...\nHigh blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if you want to fifty year old male maybe it would be for you or even with type two diabetes a million dollars um term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month of ... life insurance is out there called term provider and speak with big Lou and eight hundred for a one fourteen\nFifty eight eight hundred for a one fourteen fifty eight or is it big lewd Don come ...\nSpeak with big Lou and eight hundred for a one fourteen fifty eight eight hundred for a one fourteen fifty eight or is it big Lou dot com remember big lose IQ he's on meds to\nI used to ... to ... let me to be overwhelmed with resume which made it easy to miss a great candidate that whole process was not smart then I went to a zipper food gets technology find the right people hanging actively invite them to apply so I get a qualified candidates fast smart\n... read it number one by employees in the U.S try now for ... dot com slash free ... dot com slash free smartest way to hire a centrist by the reading of hiring side to the ...\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former foreign Lincoln and mercury owners are less sees can receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective take on it airbags in their vehicles\nTo see if your vehicle is included and to file a claim to the auto airbags settlement dot com or cold one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six that's auto airbags settlement dot com or one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six\n... and senior home care we believe your loved one should never have to give up living at home visiting angels provide personal home care I think twenty four hours per day including meals and light how where I think that our dimension here at\nHome you'll selecting your professional caregivers look up putting angels dot com or called eight seven seven three seven four lands\nAt age seven seven three seven four Lance\nYeah\nMan you know\nHe has an over by that makes them look like a cartoon character a slightly cricket I and then on commonly wrinkly neck\nAnd the red light he can look a little like a garden and he'll wear bow tie just because sure you might call them a little quirky\nBut that's exactly what makes them so perfect tuna is a three year old Chihuahua dachshund mix with more than seven hundred thousand followers on Instagram and it all started because he was adopted you can't buy a best friend like tuna but you can adopt one helped save them all at best friend's daughter or know\nDownload your local news anytime you want by logging on cash nine forty dollars you ever do you not calm you all all my morning magazines\nAre more\nAware of the hand is just a click away\nSo long on nine forty WMA W and check out the ...\nPage keeping you connected to Jefferson county's views and talks nine forty W.
