done in the wool giants fan yeah hate the Dallas Cowboys and do all the things you've been talking about the Dallas Cowboys as well they really they have one on offensive player that should scare the hell out of your ...\nBut for the first three games of the season is like you know they give the Baltics zero you know a little bit more\nHe use your best player give him a little ball beat him to Jay Scotland and him and the cowboys got their heads out of their post theory or\nChanges with the big one and now they're going\n\n[laughter]\nOne of the things that are ... was was my biggest point about the cowboys going into the seasons and they really have crap it wide receiver and crap tight and is this week yellow you need to touch the ball twenty five to thirty times again\nThat's how they're gonna when they're going to play defense\nAnd they're going to ride beak and he's got to touch the ball twenty five to thirty times per game\nToday is the Hilo you'd had twenty five carries for a hundred and fifty two yards that's over six yards per carry he also led the team with four catches for eighty eight yards and touched down\nTwenty nine touches for his IQ put twenty six points on the board and gave the cowboys\nAre double you look this is their formula don't give up a ton of points why\nZeke right into the damn ground then dig them up and ride them again\nYeah and also by the way they should have won by more in the red zone don't throw the tight end who converted basketball player give it to your best player especially with a fake come on that well in Scotland and you know and it's still Scotland of him\nBut he got the ball twenty nine times and they were now look at it almost looked like it was going to be a disaster\nBecause with\nA fourth quarter\nLate in the fourth quarter the cowboy defense well they poop themselves and they allowed the lions\n... this is kind of had the fourth quarter was back and forth the cowboys entered the fourth quarter up twenty that than after just weigh in had caught that one yard touchdown pass from Jack with just under three minutes to go in the third quarter\nCarry on Johnson at yard touchdown jets the lines of in three point to Seventeen\nBritain Mars twins who yard field goal after an eighty five yard eight minute in thirty one second drive the cowboys chewed up more than half the fourth quarter kick that field goal gave themselves a six point lead\nVery next position\nThey let the lions go six plays Seventy five yards three minutes and thirty two seconds Golden Gate thirty eight yard\nA touchdown pass from that staffer and they're down twenty four twenty three whip to Seventeen to go\nThe cowboys defense has been really good this year the cowboys defense went down there damn leg on that drive\nThat means that you can't give up that late touchdown Dr Seventy five yards you've been in front you know from your front for a while they were in front of the\nThen they got in touch down you go into the fourth quarter within ten point lead you can't go into the black two minutes of the game down\nThey gave up fourteen points in the fourth quarter what happened to the defense you know the lions\nGot three hundred and eighty two yards are offensive this game a hundred and fifty of which came in the fourth quarter\n\nAnd the only two times they touched the wall\n\nThat final drive it was the ... the recipe for success for this team\n\nYeah two minutes and Seventeen Seconds to go inside and swaying for seven yards Prescott does Danny ... recovers it frozen and completion his downturns for nine yards for a first down incomplete then he hits his IQ you'll Eliot on thirty four yard catching more\n\nThan they ran Eliot the line they ran alley and it's on the line they ran press conference on the line and Britain Martha thirty eight yard field goal as time expires\nAnd the cowboys Cape within\nTwenty six twenty four when it's over the lions\nAnd this was like I said this was a game that you're looking around the cowboys\nThis is this is exactly the recipe for the cowboys rides IQ play defense and just grind them into submission\nThat field goal drive that they had in the fourth quarter that lasted eight minutes and thirty one seconds that's exactly the kind of grinding out Dr ... the cowboys want to have this you\nKeep it on the ground pounds IQ grind them up grind the yards grind the clock\n\nYou you look at what the the cowboys are this year you know they're they're they're a lesser version\nOf the Nineteen Ninety giants who are just going to pound OJ Anderson down your throat ah they hit a couple of passes here and there especially ones Hostettler took over one Sims got hurt\nBut one's Phil Simms got hurt and Jeff ... took over a it was grind them into the ground
