joining us right now the idea is that a common sideline\nCovers the cowboys\n... blog and the boys is our General John sub RJ\n[noise] not a whole lot it's been it's been an interesting day I Will say that\nBecause it's been interesting the cowboys were forty points\nIn one hand [laughter] I mean\nIt's um you know it's hard to believe ah honestly I mean they ... or or you point jaguars of all the uh it was um best\nThe fate I N F L allegedly\nYou know and and you say that and and that was something in the locker room that they were very aware of bad people perceive the jaguars to be the best friends in the NFL\n... on his way in was orders mocking really asking Chris we're sorry for number one thing that really um so I think the ... feel like they made a case to be the number one day I\nKnow they were talking trash well hold on just a ton of McGregor there was a big number ... there I mean which you know when you're talking trash and you win orange ...\nUm maybe that's a good point um you know I found it interesting to honor with such a focal point bail talked about they all talked about how excited that got them uh Jerry Jones called it inspirational they're caught on macgregor was there but um but yeah I mean they um\nThey dominated they didn't just when I mean they flat out dominated it was quite the size\nNot now don't take this the wrong way 'cause I Love Jerry Jones but how much coke did Jerry and Conor do on the bus today\nYou know I uh I don't know about that I mean I saw them in the Reagan huddle with a defensive back so they definitely not that they ah they could do something special the that's uh that's about as far as I could go there\nBut my dream in life like this is the king of my bucket list is to be on the bus with Jerry Jones watching him rolling hookers into game\nI mean that's I'm there everybody's got aspirations or you know\nGuess that's the equivalent of forty point from the game against the jam or there's I'm telling you that\nIt's um yeah everybody's got aspirations of [laughter]\nYou know I guess that's the equivalent of forty points in the game against the jaguars\nDude I'm telling you that that to me that is the biggest surprise of the week is the cowboys Austin's\nFull usually looks more dysfunctional than anything else but today it was like this is exactly the recipe that we've laid out for the cowboys victory since before the season started Zeke gets a law twenty four touches\nJak just you know doesn't turn it over makes the planes he needs to make uses his legs defense plays good cowboys win\nNo and I would also add you know you get lucky you know the cowboys they have oh lucky today um you know the first ... they got lucky with that twelve man on the field penalty\nYou know um they got lucky with uh the interception that jak he's had that was a hit balls that that just find it in his arms and you're not even quite got got lucky I mean the guy bounce the ball why in the first half a you know it's a it's a novel on say all the odds of it out in back in his arms\nAre pretty slim but it happens sometimes it's just your day and that but that I felt like\nYou know Jack today and you mentioned you know he did bumbling twice but he was able to recover both of them\nAre fairly accurate pretty accurate or basketball otherwise today Seventeen and twenty seven hundred and three yards isn't a lot but he had a parrot touchdowns he also ran it for eighty two and a score the was the each\nAnd ...\nYeah uh you know um I thought it was really interesting after the game somebody asked democracy foreign if it was a challenge facing and play for the day and he uh he looked offended\nAnd and and he said that challenge instead we caught forty points and I've played limited snap or\nA you know they um I mean I mean you know the jaguars are good team and I I don't mean to belittle them by any means that it had a rough couple of weeks\nBut you know part of the in the NFL just supposed to win it gets bad team but I don't think the jaguars are back in but like all over the quarterback and so if you want to be a good defense you're supposed to dominate the bat quarterbacks accomplished it today I think the cowboys give people reason to believe as a silly that sounds but I mean we just thought something crazy you\nKnow and you know this was\nThis was shades of cowboys victory style of victory from two years ago two hundred and six yards on the ground jak made an outlays didn't turn it over but two oh six on the ground you know last year\nTablets took some greed you know a win ... Smith went out they they didn't have the right ... hind him to continue the line to be really strong and it was song this year you know Travis Frederick going out\nAnd you know having some struggles there in the middle of that line but two hundred and six yards and damn near five yards to carry\nThat dominant performance all the way around it is is this something that they've been building to or is this something that just happened\nAnd present itself to date anybody see the cowboys getting to the point now about two hundred yards but five yards a clip dominating on the ground controlling the clock\nYou know the the the formula for victory from this team from two years ago was was that something that everybody saw coming today\nWhy certainly know that that nobody saw it coming but uh you know I Do think this is the opposite end of the spectrum you know maybe they be used in the last week was the other side of the spectrum and this is the you know the most plus side that you can get this is as\nYou know this is Nirvana so to speak um you know this is\nEverything's going right and they were dominating the or were dominating their or making fifty five yards they'll fall off like there are no big deal um but I Do think this is your identity you know you're not going to play this degree we could in the lead guy you're going to play ... and the jaguars it is what it is\nUm an event that two hundred yards on the ground I mean with that I think comes the most important thing that they wanted to I I might be getting their strong but the jaguars held the ball for something like two minutes and fifty seven seconds in the second quarter that's nothing I mean we're talking under three minutes\nAnd that's that's what the cowboys won I mean they they want to just dominate you to suffocate you and it's as silly as this sounds I really believe something that has completely changed who they are in a very positive way\nIs choosing to defer when they when the cost they differ twice now this season and then they've won both those games I think that that's interesting comment a dominant\nAs you mentioned the OJ Dallas held the ball today for almost thirty nine minutes that's\nThat's insane\nThirty minute they're\nSaying that they they still scored forty point you know 'cause if you're if you're holding the ball for thirty minutes that's typically not enough of enough opportunities for forty points but they did\nYours jaguars had the ball for Twenty one points Twenty one minutes I mean they just literally dominated the game\n... which is\nYou know that's that's kinda what people want isn't that the cowboys formula hey we're going to dominate you along the scrimmage we're going to run deep down your throat that's going to hit some some key passes and you're never going to see the ... [noise]\nYeah I and I mean they I think they want a barrier you and I think they want to do that even on these fancy not today was the first time in forever that they had to Randy Gregory David Irving to Marcus ... thank God and the very first play that those three play together they got to play ball in a hurry David are being hit him I was a third down to the jaguars had the puck\nI mean today the cowboys were almost operating at full capacity\nUm ... and again I I Do think it was the state of matter of on I don't know that next week beltway in forty seven but I'm ... this this is proof that you know what they you know sort of built in their lab is possible I mean it it can be done if it was just done and that's certainly a bit of confidence vote and poet", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "15"}
