Bobby but it's going to be on pay per view and I think it's crazy I I don't know who's going to pay for it in November Tiger Woods so Mickelson are going to square off in Las Vegas over Thanksgiving weekend I see you know initially maybe a new Thanksgiving tradition but we already have football and all this I was willing to give it a shot\nWell now we know right that it's going to be on pay per view who knows what the cost is\nGoing to be some more news why I don't like it today from uh Las Vegas Review Journal apparently know tickets are going to be sold at all for the event\nWhich is going to be weird is it not [laughter] I Know it's interesting that the public can't go and watch this even if you want to raise the price that All right you want\nBut won't that be weird on the court like when's the last time still in tiger Gulf and there wasn't people in the gallery or anything like oh we're that's going to be I guess it's just going to be VIPs a small gathering of sponsors at this shadow creek golf course and that that's it\nDo they think that's going to lead to more pay per view by or something I I don't know like that she could be bizarre on the golf course and you're not going to see anybody on the TV it won't be as big a deal that is for the Gulf\nTiger Phil I mean I Know they they practice all the time and on a golf course all the time and there's not always fan but you know an actual tournament setting or something that's on the line like this there is supposedly going to be some bet for charity as well on top of the money that they get number nine million dollar match between the two\nBut that just seems weird is not that there's not that there's going to be nobody whatsoever in the crowd except for a handful of sponsors VIPs about no atmosphere not going to cool moments of them somebody walking up on the Eighteenth or anything like this thing just seems worse and worse\nKind of know atmosphere not going to cool moments of them somebody walking up on the Eighteenth or anything like this thing just seems worse and worse by the minute\nYou think it just fades away like most people will talk about it anymore or\nPay per view of it I think when it comes to thanks giving people a it'll get talked to a new Sony I'm not paying for it yeah yeah just to let her is Thanksgiving weekend my pain to watch golf it was on I give it a try I'm paying the wash it\nAnd even if it was like there are major\n... which of course is hypothetical would never be on paper people let's say like the master Sunday was on pay per view other than for my job I don't know Bobby if I Would pay to watch tiger would have to be the next I'm asked her son it for me to pay like I'm not paying for Gulf plus I'm golfing I think that's it\nSo that was my issue with the pay per view and then now [laughter] now people wanted to say it was in Vegas wanting to buy a ticket I Can't unless I'm a high roller maybe a VIP is the MGM resort who owns the corps I'm assuming that's the type of people that are going to be allowed to still be there\nYeah very debonair a long time yeah when people laugh so great to punch line\nIs that where you think the fact that is what's going on pretty much okay say I saw that today and over that stinks and I really stinks\nFinal thoughts on what we saw the night with the giants and the eagles eagles when thirty for Thirteen eagles are back to five hundred giants are one in five the giants certainly the big story and what we saw tonight everybody was upset\nYou know when ... comes on that and I've said it over and over tonight to me what we saw reinforced wide Beckham was right\nIt also proved once again that you made the wrong hits in that it was the wrong decision to go the running back route even if Barclay was the best player in the draft\nIn Berkeley tonight was unbelievable\nSome even I saw on social media saying he's a generational type talent\nWill find that out fairly soon if he is in fact that he looks awesome\nBut here's the problem he had two hundred and twenty nine yards\nFrom scrimmage yeah many points that got you search team the\nImpact that the running back position has eased so\nFar down on the totem pole\nTo other spots on your Wall Street just is it's a big reason why we've had this discussion all past offseason\nAbout how big a deal it was that Todd girl he got the kind of money he got 'cause it reset the running back market in how we got to view running backs differently\nSame with bell and while yes we got to you running backs differently it's still the exact impact they have on we were winning a football game on a consistent basis and winning a Super Bowl is nowhere close then\nQuarterback or finding a guy to rush the passer those are the two most important positions on the field\nBarkley is going to be great he is already great you can make the case for certainly but the impact that position has has so far down the total bull compared to others and that's why it was a bad pick\nYou can have the belief that Barkley is incredible in that he stood well also believing\nThe giants made the wrong pit bulls are correct you don't have to be on one side of the other you can believe both and that's where I'm at with this\nIn part of me feels bad for Berkeley a little bit because that's going to be the discussion in the coming days and already has been\nAfter a great performance everybody's debating still wasn't the right decision or not\nSo that's where I stand with it when\nIt comes to the giants\nAnd Barkley and again Eli Manning prove tonight along with it off the line that was the wrong pick\nMe right now who\nStill has a bigger impact on that team I Know Barkley is the one guy as a bigger impact you could argue than\nThan back to them yes but it should never be that way the quarterback on your team should be having the bigger impact ... more now than ever to body where we we're talking about the NFL changing being a passing league and I know\nBarkley can catch the ball and I feel like we saw we saw that tonight wanted that fifty five yards fifty five yard or was a off the screen was incredible\nBut you've got to have the quarterback teams are scoring thirty plus points a game that's almost becoming routine\nOr running back is not going to be the complete difference maker if you have a crappy quarterback and Tonight Show to Thirteen points\nWhat about the eagles and now they're five hundred you think this got them going tonight I I tend to think you can\nI really believe so they got the Panthers injects coming up too tough games but I I think this was a nice get well game of course who wins look good tonight\nTwenty six thirty six three touchdowns\nThe running back is still the ... to watch window small wood and Corey Clement combo there as they have all kinds of injuries small what fifty yards on eating carries only averaging that's\nLess than three yards though gory Clement forty three also loving carries\nComing weeks are gonna be in tune with the eagles do they go out and I think they do given that division Iran and what I saw from what's tonight if you believe you have a chance for the super bowl then you go out and you get the best running back I Know here we are talking about running backs but it's different\nThan Fifteen that already has the quarterback they can go out in the missing pieces are running back it's it's totally ...\nI go out and I get bell McCoy\nCertainly help your team but I go out and get bell I'd be aggressive and I do that especially when I saw from Jeffrey\nI
