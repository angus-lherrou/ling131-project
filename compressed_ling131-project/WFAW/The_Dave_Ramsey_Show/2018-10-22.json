schools on their own statements which goes I mean we're talking eight thousand eighty thousand a year\nSpread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of color just the same costs it's just not and it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money and the kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school we can't afford\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education that puts a curriculum and the high schools and colleges across America we are now and forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common some stuff for\nStaying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time is the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come along side and the community of business or an entity of some\nKind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've had about four million students go through one of the coolest things has happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens\nThe college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good\nNow Tyler Moore is with me on the line and Kyle is from the University of Wyoming usually associated vice provost of enrollment\nKyle White uh go man thank you for doing that\nWell it's a pleasure to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming can be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some\nPractical apple\nWe are certainly Saturday here and the state of Wyoming can be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable\nBeing for students to be able to apply that college search and ah and and be a real savvy consumer of higher education\nYeah cause you guys do have a low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lowest resident tuition at any public institution that grants doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the rooms are like so like you were cheaper than my University of Tennessee you're you're cheaper than the University of about ... dot\nThat's correct wow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole\nPromotion was behind this\nI immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you where am I doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys\nWe're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that can be anyone from any gender\nAny background but we're talking about that enters here we're talking about a curiosity independence vote in us\nAnd for some adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and books for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know\nIt's not a capital isn't what you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right that's correct\nYour football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right [laughter] that's good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first with this way to go man I Love it\nIt's a great motto or does it says so much in unjust are so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you got sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\n... as of coming up soon the the high school curriculum but cause the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool Kyle thank you ma'am\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we we are we are a state that is very practical where state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with their money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunities to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation in the state of Wyoming through the Ramsey education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're\nYou know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this and they're going in there we're we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that\nI'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college there's sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line\nI talked to a lot of Provo surround the country I'm my own chancellor and vice chancellor of the emergence of Tennessee and it's a constant thing the ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta\nGo after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state but you have to be\nSmart you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition of doctor are renting institution\nWe are near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south we can be a solution that\nProvide students and incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping a student be successful not just student success and part of that is not racking up a lot of death at the end of their degree completion\nMeant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we have a little over a twelve thousand so it was twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called himself cowboys\nNow that's a good size school that's not too big and small and so that's that's just right those are ... deal to us right very\nCool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again rather thank you for coming on with us\nYou very much a best wishes to you and your team there in ah in Tennessee and we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nAnd I love it I Love the motto and I think the world doesn't even more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a little picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but\nA bottom line is lesser mascot and so\nNow it's ah that's very cool stuff I Love it and what a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school now if you're a business or a university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the state\nSome states have more on the schools and others can you imagine\nYou know but um you know maybe you just want to do it it'd be to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to them in the building

I feel like I made one of the worst mistake some a lot of [laughter] I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how it would affect me if I were to return a leash car\nTo the dealership or at this point do just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nMe take your car back that you owe money on or signed a lease on that's effectively a voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb because they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it and there are an aunt repossession lot and then they're going to sue you for the difference\nIf you don't pay them the difference immediately\nAnd you don't have the difference goes you're broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car free ... company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the total of your lease payments pleasure residual value at the end it should be less because you're these leashes or very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off on the line when it doesn't include all the interest from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time\nShow the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that one that's what struck by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that to K. Bebe dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sale what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would be four thousand dollars in the whole ... probably not far off of what you're going to find\n... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole the tree and the amount that you are upside down and the way you would do that is obviously alone\nAnd so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank and you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show it for them to read a lot to the bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences greater and you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession on so\nYou cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather you'll be four thousand dollars in depth in twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are so um\nThat you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars in debt them twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are so\nUm they robes utility to borrow money no diver and just telling you to move some of the dead and get rid of the majority of the doubt by doing that and so you borrow and cover the amount that you're upside down [noise]\nYou know guys we been talking a lot about this millionaire mindset around here and why it's so important to be intentional even with the little things there\nIs

we finally settled in Cape creek Arizona Erica hurt a on a construction job he was builder\nUm and when that happened that changed our life because he chose to go to college she said you know we need to go to college and that's what took the income down because I had to work and we cash flow to it you know and then once that was all done\nI printed the amortization scheduled for the house and I brought it to him and I said I think we can pay the house off in two years and\nI said you're crazy yeah [laughter] but\nI really thought we could but this last two years has sucked it\nWas hard on
