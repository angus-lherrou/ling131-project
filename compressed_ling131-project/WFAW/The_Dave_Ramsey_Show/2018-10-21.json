Allison were welcomed into this church in Nineteen eighty nine we were quickly recruited to teach Sunday school for the next twenty four years I travel this country for Monday through friday [noise]\nOne or two evenings a wheat farmer using the hotels Gideon bibles in my laptop to plan lessons\nThis routine gave me a unique perspective on how God's people rely on their face to celebrate joyful and try and some moments as well as times of trial disappointment and tragedy\nOne example is a farm family were just lost her young daughter and a farm accident\nI heard the news from their neighbors and expected my appointments be canceled when it wasn't I ride the farm and clearly saw just want was transpiring the family was still in shock but each one wanting to keep putting one foot in front of the other trusting God that their faith would see them through\n[noise]\nNine years ago our son Michael was involved in an automobile crashing suffered a serious brain injury [noise]\nThere were two separate bleeds into the neurosurgeon removed the bones slap from is called to allow his brain to swell pastor Chris police in Aden arrived at university hospital in no time flat surrounded by my close friends and family Chris prayed to God for a complete recovery\nFeared for his congregation of Michael's fourth grade teacher Marcia Anderson and her fellow pro quo ministry members made a beautiful blanket\nYou tighten your prayers and continue praying for weeks months and years during his long recovery and Michael met with a multitude of social workers and decide that this is why you want to do with the rest of his life this December Michael all graduated from U. W. M. with a degree in social work\nToday a stewardship Sunday as we dedicate our pledges and time and talent commitments let us remind ourselves with the power of prayer and the way God in Christ Jesus can transform lives I'm reminded of a quote from the source I Can't remember but it was shared with us by pastor John how\nIt goes something like this Christian should arrive at church on Sunday mornings wearing crash almost protective gear to shield them from falling rocks running down for moving mountains\nSo here we are\nColder some shorter but we are God's own people on his promises to us are still valid and true\nThank you for your given your commitments and I'll let you do for our family and faith\n[noise]\nOoh\n\nWe have a sign\nPainter prayer in to\nA a\nBully graying attack\nWay it was about\nA a a law that\nWe all\nLive in a way that we\nAll knew\nFlag or in a a a a\nShovel all all the time\nI had a really bank paying my times\n\nSo I asked the questions now of the parents do you desire to have your child baptized into the faith and family of Jesus Christ if just say we do\nAs to the sponsors and family will you encourage this child to renounce the powers that be able to receive the freedom a new life and Christ is so say we will with the help of God\nHelp [noise]\nAnd so all will you teach this child that he may be less to profess Jesus Christ the lord and savior is to say we will with the help of guy\n\nAnd this is for all of us would like to\nParticipate you promise by the grace of God to be Christ disciples to follow in the way up our savior to resist oppression and evil show love injustice and to witness to the working worried of Jesus Christ as best you were able is so let us say we do with the help of God\nWe do without and again to what\nYou promised according to the grace given you to grow with this child in the Christian faith to help this child to be faithful member of the church of Jesus Christ by\nCelebrating price presidents by furthering Christ's mission and all the world and by offering the nurture of the Christian Church so that he may from his baptism if so say we do with the help of God\n... how I get to a big man here we go I'm going to do with this way I'm a lefty hey buddy I was waiting for this moment what name when you give your child [noise]\nYou and Thomas you want so sure I was guessing on the un Thomas you and it's a beautiful name it's a Scottish name\nAnd you can actually means the yew tree tree if you're not if the ... so it's like a pine tree and in Scotland um these trees were mostly found on holy ground meaning at churches charts\nNow the name Thomas of course means twin and we're blessed today we only get one of these\nBut there are many other Thomas's in his life and in his ... his father's middle name is Thomas his great great grandfather was also a Thomas and I believe there are many Thomas's before that so our twin today who is a ... first wonder [noise]\nWe blessed with water and baptized you un Thomas\nAnd in the name of the Holy Spirit oh man\nNow we light a candle in honor of that ad I get to bring him around as we sing our Baptist\nMost song uh listed in the bullets and you just have to be wonderful do your thing in\n\n\nLet's pray you almost get among them a little longer [laughter] I may not get less\nLoving God we thank you for you and and his family and all the friends that have gathered here to to offer their love and support to him not just now but forever and so lord we ask your blessings on him\nThat he may growing your light and he may growing your grace we pay the price holy name a map and I'll be back [noise]\nAnd ah we have a certificate for you [noise]\nAnd congratulations that's welcome them with a [noise]\nGuys graduate [noise] God thank you guys [noise]\n\nNothing more fun than that I got to tell you [noise]\nIf you're really nice to them after the services they may let you hold them I don't know we're going to do it as part of our stewardship fundraiser so uh [noise]\nHighest bitter gets no [laughter] probably should have checked with the family first but you know\nWe go with expiration here so [laughter] that's right [laughter] [noise]\nToday we have many things to be a lifting up in in prayer of course we're lifting all of us up in prayer today as we joined together in the stewardship\nTime and we ask blessings on your gifts of time you get some talent\nWhich has really been on display so far this morning with our fellowship sounds with our organist and the communist or they will be heard by the bells today um and uh so many others who have participated we also have very creative people who have offered their talents to help\nAh decorate our table today so Sandra Gilbert and Judy ... while and others we thank you for your creativity also you will notice a brand new sign that we're using for stewardship this year the lows in fishes are done by the ... family so we thank them for their time and their talent\nAnd we thank all of you for everything that you do on behalf of God on behalf of your love for Christ that we share together through this congregation so we are indeed blast\nAnd one of those things just to be able to have baptisms\nUnwelcome new life into us so again we lift up in prayer today a un Thomas and his family as we celebrate this wonderful day with them and this is always going to be a part of his life\nUh many many years from now when he's old and gray he will still participate in this moment forever\nOr there's another moment that I was blessed to participate with because of your gifts you're against the stewardship your guests of of offering to the church that does allow me to be a pastor also allowed me to officiate a wedding yesterday in Cambridge\nFor um the ... family you may know Jesse a top well he's been coming here for many years now with this family or some of his his sister Katie was actually confirmed here but the family moved here from like males they came here to participate in our in our worship in in our fellowship and they've been very active\nSo we want to lift up blessings for Jesse and his beautiful bride be dropped helpful or they were married yesterday so I as I mentioned I wouldn't have been able to do that without you are so you're the reason that we were able to participate in that so in many ways you just did a wedding\nYesterday because of your guests and your time so there is much to be thankful for so let us join our hearts and minds together in prayer\nA loving God we do thank you for how the water a baptism\nThat unites us off\nAll of us are touched by that living stream of water\nIn fact lord you described yourself as living water and understand living water that base with law and grace filled with hope and joy\nAnd so we asked that blessing today as we remember our own baptisms even if we were babies we remember that we are left\nAnd so lord we thank you for the witness of un today as he came forward and\nReceived the baptism and this was his moment to witness his moment to share his face\nHis family's faith with the world and so we ask blessings and uh the ... family their friends all those that have come to support you in today and for the rest of his life we just offer blessings of gratitude and lord we left that plus years of gratitude for Jesse ...\nWho are on this they celebrate the first day of husband and wife and so we're grateful that we do this congregation were able to participate in uniting this wonderful young couple\nAnd holy matrimony blessed by you and we're grateful and our own small ways to have participated in that service and mark we lived up to\nBut somehow there's even July found in there how was that possible what is it that makes us happy\nNow this past summer I er during the summer where she called the blast I let a seven part series on happiness the seven keys to happiness you don't have to open all seven doors of happiness today I'm going to put a lot together into one simple key what\nIs the thing that really makes us happy thing of all those things that you find joy and happiness and and you can probably say that the thing that brings you the most satisfaction in life probably even if you're happy and your job even if you're happy and and your profession even if you're happy\nWith your house your car your neighborhood um your extra homes your other place things that bring you some moments of joy and relaxation in this life which is a good thing the thing that makes you the most happiness do the most contest gives you the most joyous each other\nIt's relationships it's family as friends it's sharing in the baptism of a baby and that really more joy than\nEven eating a nice piece of pumpkin pie it tastes good it's good it's a moment but there's so many things that God Bless us with and the scriptures are filled with these gems these delights of joy\nAnd one thing I Want to point out as we look at our gospel lesson today it's a sharing observation that one of my professors made when I was in seminary many moons ago\nA he said that as far as we know and the gospels we only have about ten percent\nOf what was written during that first century time during the people that were the first Christians they wrote more than we have can you imagine that imagine the last gems that we have\nBut we have ten percent a small sample and you remember what our great ... a moderator Roy told us little as much when God is in it and even that little ten percent packed wall up doesn't it\nThere's a lot to feast on in just ten percent of the gospel think of all those things that have touched you and your life that have maybe guided you\nOr maybe during a time of indecision or just the time when you were were hurting or wandering and somehow you heard some message of Christ some gospel message that somehow\nYou hope right mentioned a couple and his life one with his son or when we prayed together in that moment and uh we didn't know\nWe didn't know how things were going to go in fact uh the staff at the university hospital was not as enthusiastic about his recovery as we were they thought he's just going to be a vegetable that's what they told us to prepare for that the inevitable\nAnd yet\nHe's graduating he's going to be a MSW I mean he's he's going to have his degree to be a social worker and to help other people get through difficult situations field by say\nThe faith that we have as a ... little much when God is in it and some of this morning we encountered a little moments\nAssume sampling of the life of the disciples and that particular moment that includes a couple of brothers James and John and this is what's really interesting here is ah we don't know the name of a single other disciples father who was Peters father\nPeter senior we don't know\nUh we have no idea right who is Jesus his father what we know what's Joe's of how much you know about Joe the well he was a carpenter and then he just disappears [laughter] you know right right away we don't get a whole lot in fact we don't get anything really about Joseph and the gospel of mark now\nWhat do we know about the fathers of the disciples nothing except for James and John his father's name is ... and it's very important\nDevotees named must mean something right he must have been known in the community in such a way that this makes a difference in how we hear this story and what the story means for us this incident with James and John devotee sons of thunder\nThings an accident they call this guy this son of thunder do you think as parents when they were holding their little huge tree and their arm\nAnd getting that wonderful sense of that you thought\nThis child has the thunder bolt you know this child is gonna really rocked the world's every parent wants their child to do that by the way but somehow this ... this thunder brought a powerful voice to the world he was a man of authority and power he was revered respected thunder\nKinda scares you too doesn't it\nYou know there are certain people in our life that scare us right um you just kind of shake a little bit they have a very authoritative voice or something and you kinda know they mean business my dad was that guy ah he'd come home at the end of the day and anything that we did wrong we found out about it [laughter] when my dad came\nBusiness my dad was that guy or he'd come home at the end of the day and anything that we did wrong we found out about it [laughter] when my dad came home he was under a at our house mom got to be the sweet one you know dad got to be under a in that situation but we you know we knew that was coming and we knew what it meant\nI'm so James and John of the sons of this man\nAnd some people probably feared them to some extent they were probably encouraged by their father to speak boldly you know the squeaky wheel gets the grease right and so what they plan to do is to simply state what they think is obvious they've given up their lives to follow Jesus\nLittle as much when God is in it but if you're asking me I Want something out of this right that's what James and Jonathan yeah I gave up a little bit but I Want something more out of this you know this is an investment in my time I'm giving you my talents I'm giving you even\nMy money my my job my skills you know I I haven't been working since I've been following you lord I mean my brother and I were given up everything our dad is doing all the work without us so\nDo we get a get out of this isn't an honest you think about it I mean if we really look at ourselves how many of us honestly would say we're here for nothing for ourselves\nWe don't come here seeking anything for it's all about you folks I'm only here for you even me I have to be honest with myself and say no I'm In it for me\nTo some degree I think that's a part of human nature so in this little ten percent snippets and this is a small sampling of the ten percent that we get we get a sense that\nPeople have the same ban as they are now we're up pretty much the same and this way we are kind of have a way of looking at what's in it for me\nWhat am I going to get out of this disciples ship thing out of following Jesus what am I guess that's the normal world's view of anything we do you try out for a sports team what am I going to get out of it I better get on the field\nIf you try out for music I better get to play an instrument you know at least give me a belt rang right if you're going to come to practice you're going to expect\nRight you want to that's a normal thing so why is the cycle ship any different\nShould they not expect something for their efforts and sacrifice so James and John just put it right out there they got appreciate that and not only do they put that out there one of my professors wants set and look what they're doing they're really the first these James and John they're standing or a ... face\nThis is a creed in a way they're putting out there that we believe you lord we believe you are the messiah we believe you are going to do everything you said and when you do we want to be there with you\nOn your left and you're right that is a reasonable isn't it for people to declare their face that way to say I believe you lord\nBut what they are also sang is maybe these other ten do [laughter] maybe the other time that are well let them worry about them that's not our concern our concern is taking care of what's ours right our family were James and John the sons of thunder\nThat's who we are that's who we gotta look out for\nThat what happens when the other ten find out about that\nSame thing that would happen in your home can you imagine a situation and this actually happened by the way but I'm not going to blame my parents 'cause they're listening now can you imagine a situation actually they bought a soccer but anyway uh my oldest brother or Herbie\nA got a car when he was a kid my my parents helped to provide my father helped to provide [noise] it was a love bug\nHerbie the love bug\nNow they didn't mean anything by that you know like he was in high school then that's not what they wanted this bug to be [laughter] but anyway it was a Volkswagen was hurt me ... ... it was powdered blew it had flared centers\nAround the sweet ride he took us out and that thing but you know what you know what do you have to do with the rest of the kids I mean just because he's the oldest he gets the car where do you get you get a ride [laughter]\nNow you're okay with that I Know everybody here and all the families of your sibling car all you would think is good for them [laughter]\nHappy for them [laughter] I'm so glad that they got that don't you think boy I get one too I Wonder what I Will get and wonder if that doesn't happen now my parents case they got us all cars to that\nBut if you didn't how would you feel how would you feel if one of you got something on the other one didn't my parents were very careful about that especially around Christmas Time his kids are funny around Christmas gifts right they wanted us to know that they spent an equal amount on each child all four of us got\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for sharing this hour promise prayer and praised with us\nIf you desire to grow in your relationship with God or learn more about the Bible and living faithfully each day and enjoy the warm friendship and hospitality first congregation all United Church of Christ deport asking please join us for Sunday Morning worship at

be happy to welcome and served you in any way possible remember God loves you and his blessing you today\n[noise] nine forty W W ...\nHand on line at nine forty WMA W. dot com\n\nThey all about\nThe argument this will be the election capital the caravan\nCuts and comments and Republican candidates get the message while Democrats focus on health care\nProtection pre conditions freezing conditions and\nMore Republicans in out of the mainstream type\nDemocratic minority\nRepublican Senate campaign committee Tom tell us up north Carolina but in the Republican post catalogs are real or we just seeing that natural closing of the mid term we have a brand new and be seen as Wall Street journal poll out this morning was unusual\nResult that you make a little nervous\nTo work during the Marines I envy wanting\nEugene Robinson Peggy Noonan a columnist for the wall Street Journal and David Rohde emerging political analyst for CBS News woke up this Sunday meeting the bragging [noise]\nGood Sunday morning and welcome to the choose your\nOwn adventure mid term elections is there a democratic wave coming we've got data support that as a surge oppose Kevin on Tuesday has them for Republicans turned back the Democrats momentum there's data to support that or could this be a typical midterm with Democrats making just ... there's data to support that too\nAnd we have plenty of new data this morning here's what our brand new NBC News Wall Street journal poll shows with just over two weeks to go until the mid term among registered voters\nDemocrats only seven point lead in the generic ballot forty forty one that's down significantly from the twelve point lead Democrats held just a month ago pre capping off when it was fifty two forty but wait there's more\nAmong likely voters the Democrats lean gross not shrinks gross to nine fifty to forty one here's why that's interesting\nIt's a first time ever in our polling that are likely voter model show they better number for the Democrats than the registered voter number normally\nIn midterms Republicans have the likely voter advantage so what's different this year it's the heightened enthusiasm for Democrats among millennials Latinos and younger women groups that historically have had low turnout rates that are making it into a likely voter model to share\nAfter President Trump he has his best numbers yet in our poll among registered voters forty seven percent approve of his performance in office or forty nine percent disapprove of\nThat substantially better than his numbers last month in our poll forty or fifty to approve disapproved but again among those likely voters his numbers didn't get worse forty five percent approve fifty two percent disapprove\nThere are a lot of questions leading up to this year's midterms but here's what we do know there's a higher interest in this election than any my turn we'd ever measured turnouts can be through the roof and the divide between men and women is growing with the Democratic strength the result of unprecedented support among women\nNow will be enough to stop the Republicans post cabin album that's going to be the story of the next sixteen days\nDemocrats produce mops Republicans but just just\nPresident Trump's closing argument is all about the\nWant Israel your voters wide open to deadly drugs and ruthless gang\nAnd Republican candidates are sounding more and more like Mr Trump repeating dire warnings on immigration remember it's going to be an election of the caravan the caravan is coming from Central America\nJust migrate caravan pretty\nAt times using violent language and the guy that your body slammed Mike [noise]\nI'm going to stop all over your face with golf spikes candidates or even recycling Mr Trump's insult to what this is a low energy person\nAnd you can tell the truth is\nWith the fight for control of the Senate playing out largely in states the president won\nThis base first strategy banks on Mr Trump's ability to bring up voters in more rural areas where he is popular but the president's rhetoric is unlikely to help Republicans in the suburban house districts where they are already at a demographic disadvantage and for the first time ever\nIn two straight NBC News Wall Street journal polls women favored democratic control of Congress by a whopping twenty five points\nMIT now we're going to hell in the hand that you know I I Can't believe some of the anti\nThat go on to the United\nSeventy Seventy five house seats the cook Political Report racist competitive are held by Republicans including twenty five that Hillary Clinton won in twenty sixteen\nDemocrats need to flip just twenty three of those Seventy five to win back the house but the Democratic enthusiasm advantage has narrowed after the cat but I'll Fight and the question is whether those fundamentals will be enough to produce not just to take over by the way\nYou existing conditions Andy meanwhile Democrats are over\nOther close fundamentals will be enough to not just the takeover away\nPreexisting conditions Andy meanwhile Democrats are avoiding have broad national message remaining laser focused on a single issue\nProtections for pre existing conditions protections for preexisting conditions for pre existing condition preexisting conditions existing health condition\nAnd with President Obama largely absent from the campaign trail and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi unpopular with independents Democrats running in states Trump won or running away from the national party\nAre you a Democrat Tom from Democrat\nTo the town I live and I said if he has had a tiny thing anymore\nAnd even running away from democratic leaders changing players make some sense I think we had a chance to players\nJoining me now from Chicago as the Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin Senator Durbin welcome back to meet the press or good to be with a ...\nI I Know you couldn't see that package but you can hear it that last voice in there was the former Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen who is running for that US Senate seat in Tennessee are calling for a quote change of players when it comes to the Democratic leadership\nOr you're a member of the Democratic leadership when you hear that is they're going to be a change of players fingers south Senator Schumer Nancy Pelosi or make your case for why it isn't necessary\nA truck that's tomorrow's newspaper today's newspaper election on November six\nAnd let me tell you what we're doing we're focusing on the issues and make a difference I Know that you probably have the preexisting condition phrase ... dozen times in that leader and\nThat's because the American people put that is the highest priority they want protection for their families they know the Republicans voted consistently to take away the protection and file lawsuits to end it\nThat's why it's such an important issue over and over again a local basis\nBut let me go back to the leadership issue you heard that the other voice and there was ... Senate or the Democratic nominee in Arizona saying people don't like parties anymore and obviously that both parties are unpopular our poll right now um is that a problem for you that there are voters out there that you need it went over who don't like the Democratic party\nBut you're having to basically make the case may you may not like us but don't you like the other side and we're a last\nWell it gets down to this truck to her more and more independent voters and I think ... correct in making that assertion but the bottom line is we are doing well with those independent voters take a look at what Mitch McConnell gave us this last week an insight into where the Republicans are going if they continue to control Congress\nUm matter ended up increasing intensity on our side but the only slightly we typically have greater intensity going into the off year elections but I think this is about\nAh economic security economic growth those are promises that we've made and we've fulfilled it's difficult to get some of the things done we want to continue to work on infrastructure but an F a a bill that\nThe jobs the economy those are those sorts of things matter to the voters and I think they're going to put us in a great position and the Senate\nOne issue you didn't mention that Senator Durbin mentioned nonstop was health care and these are pre existing conditions in twenty fourteen you ran I remember covering your race down there it's when we first met you ran as a repeal and replace Obamacare Republican\nWhy aren't we hearing that this time around we don't really hear Republicans talking about repeal and replace is it because of the popularity of the pre existing condition clause\nNow what for one thing it's a false narrative to say that we want to remove preexisting conditions I follow the bill got several cosponsors to try and and and the vet than a lawsuit throws out the Affordable CARE Act we have to have a place for people with preexisting conditions to land we also have to allow\nA young adults under the age of twenty six to be on their parents' health care plan it is a false narrative to say that Republicans want to kill that it's simply not true\nSaturday I was asked to do but in fairness you've had for years and the majority in the Senate to come up with an alternative in two years with full Republican controlled Washington\nYeah and I know you know how do you say ... probably better than I Do you got to get sixty votes to make that happen we did to reconciliation get rid of the individual mandate and take some of the underpinnings of the Affordable CARE Act out\nWe've got to replace it and the same way that we've got to make sure that shows the Social Security and Medicare can be paid for and medicate over time what what the Democrats are not mentioning are widely publicized reports\nThe charity and Medicare can be paid for and Medicaid over time what what the Democrats are not mentioning are widely publicized reports that say if we stay on the current trajectory we're going to have a crisis in funding and those programs\nNo one wants to take away Medicare Social security or Medicaid from people who need it but we have to have a sustainable solution and we need sixty votes to get that done\nMath is a funny thing here in Washington nobody seems to want to ever site it but we have a record breaking deficit\nA record breaking dead every day when you watch the debt clock but a record breaking deficit this year that may surpass a trillion dollars you're now annually nevermind a obviously a the multiple multiples of that in the debt the president yesterday talking about a new tax cut you're talking about reforming Social Security and ... and Medicare ...\nWhere are you how you got to pay for this tax cuts that the president is apparently proposed\nWell we've got to make sure that it's at least a support it by facts Ron dynamic growth that has to pay for itself we can't go further in debt I voted against the spending bill I'm the most recent one because it was just too much money being spent a\nAnd and so we've got to we've got to get the American people to recognize that we had a powder keg of dynamite and a debt that continuing to grow we're reaching a point where the service to our debt service could exceed\nOur contribution in our investment in the military we've got to make sure that the American people understand we've got to balance our our books we got to be on a budget just like the American people\nYou just said you wanted to any new tax cut to pay for itself up this current cat tax cuts clearly not paying for itself the depth increasing not decreasing and there's no sign that it's going to decrease but if you take a look\nAt those scoring for

here\nPresidential job recruiters all connected to seats lost in the first midterm we go back\nHere's President Trump sitting at forty seven percent that seems to be an improvement perhaps what what forty seven percent job rating mean in the past when it comes from the term result while President Obama at exactly that at forty seven percent job approval rating and twenty ten\nIt's probably about

that we knew was coming and who's going to be very significant\nOne not quite talking that way anymore it looks kind of more interesting and complicated didn't state by state\nUm the continuing mystery that is not a mystery is how a president and ended ministry ration can have\nWhat is essentially peace and prosperity for economic growth and no new wars and still be struggling to get to ... percent which in the approval polls which you can't instead dragged on and all of here people just is a central\nFact I think of the set standard political gravity and I don't think you can do that with Donald Trump and I do think that there is an argument to be made\nAnd the right light he can look a little like a garden and he'll wear bow tie just because I'm sure you might call them a little

turnover among staffers on the west wing justice week White House counsel Don McGahn left his job\nAfter months of speculation that after successfully shepherding Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the U.S Supreme Court already to White House is on a second cheapest at its third national security adviser and its ... communications director\nThe person with me or most noteworthy and shorter step in the west wing is one of those five Anthony Scaramucci let the White House media shop protest eleven days is out with a new book about his time though and President Trump's orbit particularly before he became President Trump the blue collar president\nAnd he joins me now Mr Scott which can lead to press happy Sunday\nSo the timing of your book are coming out comes as we get reports of a screaming match between a a former boss of yours John Kelly current chief of staff the national security adviser John Bolton was over the issue of immigration was clear according to our sources it was\nOver some comments and national security adviser made to the secretary of homeland security a former deputy to the chief of staff\nJohn Kelly apparently walked out furious there were rumors of a\nA potential resignations out how to layer was at St ... was that same to you was\nThere any profanity I mean that could have been right so we are possibly some profanity ... really not that familiar to me and you have to remember my incident was a phone line with a reporter who I shouldn't have trusted in so that's my fault and I totally on that but I think with the more relevant thing is\nYou know people are playing in the NFL and verbal contacts and so people playing very hard for the president um I don't know what happened in that specific incident and um but you know I I Know that the west wing and the way the president set up the west wing it it's it's tough in there for people\nYou were pretty tough though in General Kelly in your book I'm going to put up an extra pair the general style\nWould be in direct conflict with the way Mr Trump had always conducted business President Trump doesn't work in a precise way right never has never will it's been over a year since John Kelly became White House chief of staff but my scouting report early on proved to be quite accurate his personal security has proven to be a poor match with the self confident gregarious president\n[noise] he'll look I think that's pretty self evident I mean just even this past week you know I applaud the general service of the country I'm obviously forty years in the U.S Marine Corps but this is a very different job this is a civilian based job and I think he's tried to apply\nMilitary like management style to corpus civilians and so that doesn't necessarily work in ten and by the way you know the the president as a free wheeling style is very different from a a John Kelly's\nYou feel personally mistreated by John Kelly they seem pretty you've seen pretty upset\nAt him and his book well you know listen not you know she didn't need to ...\nThat was very different from a a John Kelly's you feel personally mistreated by John Kelly they seem pretty you seem pretty upset at him and his book well you know listen\nNot you know she didn't need to fire me the way fired me and I had this conversation with the president you get it done it in different mentally I mean come on I gave a tremendous amount of money to campaign raised a tremendous amount of money or did countless hours of media ... during the campaign and the transition and even after\nPresident was inaugurated a there was a better way to fire me but he was trying to make a spectacle out of it and so he got the spectacle that he wanted and it\nSaid it was it was upsetting at the time uh I write about in the book um what I thought was an honest assessment of him and I'm I stand by the wars in the book should the president even have a chief of staff given the way he likes to work [noise]\nSo I think he needs the cheapest stab but he needs the cheapest David really likes him and and gets his personality you don't think John Kelly likes the president do you\nI mean I I I don't I don't want to I don't want to ... let me say I travel around the country and I asked people that rhetorical question or does it doesn't come across lady ... he does and and by the way the the Bob Woodward book\nI don't know he seems like a pretty accurate journalists to me and so I don't like John Kelly calling the president thinks that he's called them I think it's I think it's wrong and and so for me I have no problem standing up for myself or or telling you what I think about John Kelly or the situation with the president\nHaving said that I applaud the guy service but it's not just me you know he he hurt the morale inside the place and he's he's hurt the president and so and he has his he fits you know he he left last week after the\nUh the report that he had with a ... that's a personality I mean sure you know the good news is I'm being vindicated by that because he's demonstrating his personality now the way it really is\nI'm curious if you've interacted with what President Trump as candidate Trump you weren't quite on board at first with the idea of him president you had other candidates who were interested in first I think you were morally with Scott Walker that the current governor Wisconsin a toyed with going with Jeb Bush what finally convinced you that Donald Trump had what it took the Scott Walker and\nSo I actually relate to send the book I met with the president the day after The Apprentice finale or we sat in his office and we were joking about him running for president I didn't believe him at the time and I was already hooked into Scott Walker\nBut what I liked about the president and he's a very loyal guy when I explained to him that my loyalties were to Scott Walker and and Jeb Bush\nHe then said okay well after I clean their clocks or when you come work for me and I said absolutely and so a after the south Carolina primary I went to the president's office was Senator Scott brown\nWho was a friend of mine from tops nah we went up there together and uh we had a great conversation and we begin building blocks for the financing operation and then when he brought in Steven\nSteven Mnuchin things really\nStarted kicking you know watching\nA bunch of Democrats thinking about trying to run against President Trump and twenty twenty and we've seen different\nPotential candidates try to go after him in different ways Michael ... someone who I think people have been trying to put the two of you together for some sort of talk show and he's been she's tried to go out um directly Elizabeth Warren responded that some of the criticism the crazy nickname stuff uh more formally\nUh what is the best way to go after President Trump what advice would you give a Democrat and how do you go after hit and all those guys\nYou know is is you know I really care for the president and I'm a big supporter so I don't like giving them advice but I think a big mistake that they're all making is they go right into the Trump\nInsect Twitter light and so the minute he shoots at them they cannot help themselves and they drive themselves right into that light and then they get vaporized by him and so the incident with a Senator Warren she should really read my book so she can understand\nHow the president you think about the miracle what he did\nHe hijacked the Republican Party to get the nomination and then he hijacked the base of the other party and moved over to the Republican Party a and I try to write about that in the book because I haven't experienced as a kid they grow up in a blue collar neighborhood with the blue collar family and I think I've seen the whole band whether this sort of stuff but my recommendation of people\nIs a don't engage them in that area because you're going to lose more I was just way more talented than you in that area\nFor let you go you send your team you and your team from sky bridge capital citizen district you were still going to go to the Saudi Arabia um\nFinance conference yeah I'm Still is that still your final answer ...\nWell you know all of a sudden sky bridge is not a political organization I I'm not getting any American ability to them right now\nWhile not really trying to give them credibility remember I have a ton of business and Saudi Arabia unrelated to the government\nHave a Kuwaiti a resident that services sky bridge out of the region and I'm a pretty big delegate er and I let those guys made a decision on whether or not to go or not he's visiting with people that are not related to the government those meetings were already scheduled\nA he suggested to me is the managing partner SKY Brazil allow him to go I'm a big delegate er and believing accountability from all this stuff\nI'm I'm comfortable with him going I'm not comfortable with what happened or what the Saudi Government did to the journals I'm not comfortable that all\nAnthony Scaramucci had to leave it there that we look like a blue collar president congratulations or would like to thank you
