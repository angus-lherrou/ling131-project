thought about it but we didn't do that we in water and we have the same we're going to talk about that today when we have about that\nIt mean that you're baptized\nAnd what we realized that really means is that Jesus loves\nThat Jesus loves us\nAll about and so we thought it would be great to think what you're doing always thinking about it the baptism song but it is Jesus loves me and if you want to sing along with us\nBut they sing really loud so let's listen to the\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nMe yeah\n\n\nNot only that the Bible but everyone tells you saw a mad\nAnd I\nGot to get to say I get a

as their family and got parents to come forward um all of you just come on Fort we have plenty of room up here\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSure I get the right time we go [noise]\nOne of the exciting exciting time for us to have a the Sawyer family witnessed and their friends and the parents will see are their names are listed\nIn the bullets in today and you're all going to get a chance to gaze upon these lovely children's faces a during our him that follows the baptism but I wanted to share a little bit about um what were wearing today it's very special we have some um\nBaptist small towns that were actually handmade by their family and they were worn by a great aunt who happened to be a nun so their extra blessed uh but anyway they were weren't and they have been used is this the fifty seconds\nFifty one fifty two today that's how many children have been baptized and these ... so let's just give the gallons a hand we don't normally do that\n[noise] but uh [noise] great\nAncestor deserves great ... sister happy Catherine probably right sister Capra ah it's easy for me 'cause I have a sister Mary Catherine but she's just assist or not a sister sister [noise]\nNot sister says that's right so I Want to author share about myself today I didn't know marry a was here she recognized this is Jack barely stole and it's a really cool one because it's a\nKind of got the dog if you see that Adam and it's got the flames there but this is the guy you didn't know but he baptized just hundreds of kids and he did a lot better than me he remembered every kid\nAnd so there were times when you know ... years we'd go by people would come up and say remember my kid he would do the name that's cheating isn't it [laughter] but anyway he did that so I'm wearing this an honor of someone who really love this was one of his favorite thing so\nWhy are we year\nBaptism is the sacrament through which we are United to Jesus Christ and given part in Christ ministry of reconciliation baptism is the visible sign of an\nInvisible that it's the reconciliation of people to God it shows the death of self and the right thing to a life of obedience and praise sister Katherine would have liked that one\nIt also shows the pouring out of the Holy Spirit that you can see on this beautiful stole today\nOn who's on those who got has chosen and baptism God works in us the power of forgiveness the renewal of the spirit and the knowledge of the call to be God's people always\nNow we have two children that are going to be baptized today and we're going to introduce them later but first I'm going to ask the parents and then the parents uh certain questions to respond beginning with the parents do desire to have your children baptized into the faith and family of Jesus Christ if so say we do\nAnd to the parents will you encourage these children to renounce the powers of evil and to receive the freedom of new life in Christ is so say we will with the help of God\n\nAnd to both parents and got parents will you teach these children that they may be led to profess Jesus Christ the lord and savior and that's also a spur of the congregation is to say we will with the help of God [noise]\nAnd to all of us here today do we are promised by the grace of God to be Christ disciples to follow in the way of our savior to resist oppression and evil to show love and justice and to witness to the work and word of Jesus Christ as best as we are able it's so say we do with the help of God [noise]\nAnd the promise according to the graves given you to grow with these children in the Christian faith\nTo help these children to be faithful members of the church of Jesus Christ by celebrating Christ presidents by furthering Christ's mission and all the world and by offering to nurture the Christian Church so that they may affirmed their baptisms it's so say we do with the help of God [noise]\nAnd I'm going to begin with our little Clara\nAt Fisk the disciples were completely amazed and asked one another than can be saved\nJesus look straight as famine answered this is impossible for human beings but not for God everything is possible for God\nThen Peter spoke up look we have left everything and followed you yes Jesus said to them and I tell you that those who leave home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and for the gospel\nWell received much more in this present age\nThey will receive a hundred times more houses brothers sisters mothers children and fields and persecution as well [noise]\nAnd then the age to come they will receive the turn of life\nBut many who are now first will become last and many more now last will become first that's and the reading [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\nNo\nNo\nGetting\nTo tell you\nGreen\n\nWant to be you\n\n\nLonger you know\nHe made a\n\nBig\n\nNumber though do you\n\nAt and let us pray God made the words of my mouth and the meditations of all of our hearts except the villain your site or do you are a rock\nAnd our redeem or a mess [noise]\nWell I have to say I'm very humbled today or by all the words that so we began the service with today a forty five minutes ago [laughter]\nA long time ago but I'm Still thinking about and so grateful for this place and this time of what a wonderful way that we spend our life together in this ministry and with our gospel lesson today it's all about investment it's all about\nHow we choose to spend our time here are capital if you will and so\nOne of the ways I was during that is um I\nA birthday this past friday to this is a big weekend for me and I'm so grateful that my brother and my sister are here but also along with them came my mother in law\nAnd we all travel to a La Crosse where my son is in a bitter about university where they were performing cats the musical and he has a really cool role in that so not\nOnly were they coming of some of you know Tina back then she came along with us and then Cindy and Dave Hersman came along it was a really a neat\nAnd that and so not only are they coming of some of you know Tina back then she came along with us and then Cindy and Dave Hersman came along it was a really a nice time to be there and\nI have to tell you though um I didn't know much about cats and and when eight and my son was saying he was going to be doing cats even eight and said what is it about and he was asking friends and they looked at it and said you know what I don't think it's about anything I think it's about cats\n[noise] and so that's kind of what we thought this is just weird I don't know by like this and how do you have a musical about nothing but cats\nAnd so I went to the musical and uh you know I I had seen it in the movie I rented a movie and you know it was like a you know I'm I've got to go and support my son you know that's what I was thinking but then the live show comes out and you begin to feel\nUm moved by the stories like these kids become cats and you're kind of captivated by that and if you're not\nFamiliar with the musical although I Will tell you what's the most famous musical of all time\nIt sets on their poster that they have but anyway uh more people have seen that musical than any other musical and uh the story itself is really about what our gospel lesson is today\nIt's about how we spend our time and that's about eternal life you know the famous song from cats is memories\nRight memories and we were sharing some memories earlier now you know why I take Monday's off by the way [laughter]\nBut anyway there's memory share it and we have really important meaningful time together and that's where we began our gospel lesson today sort of with these memories and there's a man now what's different about the gospel of mark than some of the other gospels that you may remember the story from\nAnd in my mind when I think about oh a it's the story of the rich young a ruler so many of us think about that the rich young we identify him as young and when we do that it changes things about investments see I mentioned that I had a birthday\nOn a friday but I didn't say which birthday a big one but getting bigger all the time apparently\nAnd one thing I noticed about this particular birthday\nI'm ... noticed at first 'cause she's two weeks older than me but anyway what we noticed this we're no longer in the same\nCategory anymore you know what that means that's that's a horrible thing for so long we were in this you know forty though you know we're in this age\nAnd with just one\nOne passing I'm now no longer with the forty year old I'm up there with well some of you\nIn the [noise] and I'm like\nWhy don't you get to choose you know where you're categories are but that's not how it works I'm now in another agent are tells me that all the time you're getting kind of old you better be joining soon you better be joining soon but one of the things I notice\nAs you get to certain ages you start thinking about similar kinds of things on the shows that we watch we we noticed that things start getting ubiquitous like we noticed more about investments and stuff like that like retirement begins to come more important than like right around the corner my brother's retired I mean what's with that\nYou know I mean that it happens people do retire I here but not generation we're still young forgot lots but were retiring and you start seeing things in Harry things and and um it's about how we spend time and so this morning we have this this guy\nWho's thinking about his life\nIs this like meaningful he's done well he's got lots of possessions and he comes not walking but racing up to Jesus he falls down that Jesus and he has a really important question to ask\nYou know one day Charlie is going to ask this question one day Claire is going to ask this question what do I have to do\nTo inherit eternal life\nWhat am I have to do to an ... an internal life and the funny thing about this guy whose whose wealthy seems like he's got it All right I mean even the disciples\nSeemed taken aback by Jesus Says response here but we'll get to just a minute\nBut they all sumo you're wealthy you're already in\nThat's kinda what people thought you're already blessed by God of course you're going to be one of the first in that's what was going on here and so this guy we don't know how old he is we don't we don't know if he's older than a new category like me we don't know that\nHe could just be your categories that is what's wonderful about this gospel take him as you is the same age as you probably not under Clara but he's the same age as you\nSo he has some of the same thoughts and things what is the value of like what is the meaning of life how do I make sure that I assure my place internal life now in the first century\nUh eternal life was kind of\nTalked about in the Jewish traditions by two main branch is the first was the ... we made the sad to see sometimes in Jerusalem near the temple they were one of the big uh groups there but they weren't as big as the other group the fares that we'll hear about in the second but the sad just sees a didn't believe in a bottle the resurrection\nPlease rise\nThank you for sharing this hour promise prayer and praised with us if you desire to grow and your relationship with God or learn more about the Bible and living faithfully each day\nAnd enjoy the worm friendship and hospitality first congregation all United Church of Christ deport asking please join us for Sunday Morning worship at ten o'clock for our

I think you and I both lived down here during that period of time and it is the closest thing that I can remember in terms of Panama beach and what it looked like Panama City I'm Sorry what it looked like when I saw it\nI didn't get to Mexico beach I've seen that I was at the you see down there the emergency operations center the Jonah just come back so we have the fresh images\nAnd then basically as a total wipe out and it and it's hard to imagine that ever really being able to recapture the exact identity at one side it'll be rebuilt it'll all be rebuilt at some point\nBut it's going to take a long time you know in terms of electricity in Panama City uh that whole some great has to be rebuilt not restoration but I Want to tell you what I'm really most concerned about it I'm concerned about all of it\nThere are a lot of inland areas some of these poor rural counties rent or to the north of there these counties took a devastating hit and we're talking about the poor people many some older\nMiles from each other isolated in many cases from rose including some dirt roads are cut off right now because we haven't been able to reach those people on a number of days\nAnd I know they're doing the best they can to get to them but I'm really very\nDeserve more than ... is there more the federal government is there more research as you want from the feds here is it a is there some military support that's necessary here in order to to speed up the ability to get to some of these communities\nMay be and it's available I what people forget here and I always want to remind them is when it comes to hurricanes the state government is in the lead it is the state government who's in charge of the response the\nFederal government stance and support the state government tells the federal government we need this and we need that so far I have not heard of anything the government has asked for that the federal government has not step forward to provide whether there needs to be more that's something that will see in the days to come but I Know the federal government including the department of defense\nIs standing ready to offer even more if the state says it needs it\nI Know that a political norms skinny race all the time now but one of the ... race in Florida which was\nIn the middle of a hurricane coming and hitting the shores there was always this cease fire on television no political negative ads that didn't happen this time he had the Republican Party running negative ads against Andrew Gillum some superPACs running negative ads against both Rick Scott and Bill Nelson\nUm is this just par for the course or would you like to see this sort of\nPut back into place should the candidates be more steadfast and taking politics out of hurricanes\nYeah look I don't think anything's ever going to be the way it once was appalled especially at the even the election were four weeks away I might might fundamental question is whether politics is standing in the way of dealing with the hurricane that would be the one thing I'd have a real problem with and I don't think television ads whether they're right or wrong from a moral perspective\nThe strength of the U.S Saudi relationship goes back many many years of but I think in particular NBS has been embolden he is a very bright ambitious and aggressive individual and clearly is trying to make changes in Saudi Arabia but his relationship with the White House or with Donald Trump as well as which are Christian or I think probably gave him increased confidence\nUh to do some of these things and a more aggressive way look what has happened in Yemen and that awful awful tragic war but I also think that Donald Trump's uh I'm\nSigning up to authoritarian leaders and around the globe the ... and others are Donald Trump's condemnation of the press that's critical of Donald Trump's continued dishonesty and denials of the reality even when All Facts point against it I think that has encouraged and be asked to go along this row\nDid you put MB us in the same columnist ... and ...

Charlie uh take away the word Saudi Arabia and insert the word Russia yeah\nEspecially like named feels like it's the same thing but hunger says United yeah the president is isolated\nWhat strikes me is NBS is a lot like the early ... which just say there were moments when people found him to be a performer a modernize or there's hope that he was going to be somebody who could be a friend with the west but in fact\nAt home he was cracking down pretty hard we're seeing the same thing I think in Saudi Arabia the difference is when when Russia\nA poisons or former Russian agent on British soil we can unite against Russia because Russia is not an ally is Andrea said Saudi Arabia is an ally it makes it much more complicated we're stuck between two friends here a NATO ally turkey and Saudi Arabia who's been friends since the Nineteen forties would put any president and the top position\nAll the way we treat Saudi Arabia well but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that there are some regional dynamics are that are very complicated and granted we certainly have an important alliance the Saudis but let's not forget who benefits if we somehow have a fracturing\nOf our relationship with the Saudis right the Turks are ready to step in the Qataris care as well and don't forget Ron right so this whole region actually is very complicated to the extent that we believe the Saudis did indeed do this huge problem and we obviously have to do something about it but that's not forget there are other players in the region that adventurous as well so let's not be so quick to render judgment\nHuge problem and we obviously have to do something about it but not forget there are other players in the region that have been trust as well so let's not be so quick to run the judgment unless we have complete and thorough evidence of justice actually happened\nWell I Would also say that if you step back and look at um the way that some officials in the government particularly in the ... community viewed NBS there was deep concern about his the way he operates in very young he's thirty three years old he\nIs ruthless he seen as a little bit reckless he's seen as somebody who\nHas this a lot of rope from this administration in particular and yet as somebody who because of his impulses needs a check from the United states and so we hadn't had that and this is the kind of thing that intelligent I mean and the officials had been worried about for quite some time\nPart ownership a little bit the President Bush by the way I think ... and we're realizing I mean is does care what the elites in this country thinking boy ... which turned against him big time after in voting and community well we'll see how they react and the next couple of days and we turn to the president here because he does seem to be\nBut as you know if you get rid of this law you also get rid of the protection of pre existing conditions\nAnd and well I I Know that if you believe that can be passed but frankly it never has been as you know I'm In your lawsuit as attorney general you'll find you could have severed the issue of preexisting conditions how do you plan on protecting preexisting conditions\nYou a check I think that we can do their number number of ways to do to protect folks with preexisting conditions Congress should mandated my position is insurance companies should be required by law\nTo protect folks with preexisting conditions my own son I've got two little boys at home do you think that five year old who should have your old by the way I Do oh yeah I Do absolutely I Do what's what's not constitutional is the requirement that people buy health insurance\nThey don't want but it's absolutely constitutional say that insurers have to cover people with preexisting conditions Congress should mandated people like my own little boy who has a preexisting condition shouldn't be covered under the law but apart from Obamacare we don't have to have Obama Care to do it and that's the big difference here Claire McCaskill wants to protect Obamacare\nBy with any condition by any means necessary I think we need to clear away the failure of Obamacare and put patients back in charge of their health care\nI found a question for you we found a clip of a TV ad Iran when you're running for attorney general\nIn two thousand sixteen here's what you said in that at\nSome city is whole career ... just climbing the ladder using one office to get another I'm ... I think you deserve better\nYou within two years immediately ran for the U.S Senate what would you say to yourself in that\nI Would say that the future of our country is at stake and I always said you could see it with the hearings that\nJustice Kevin all you can see what we're seeing out on the streets now the future of this country and our way of life here is at stake and it's incumbent upon all of us to do all that we can't I'm trying to do my part to make sure that we fight for the future of this country and fight for Missouri Claire McCaskill has not but I Will All right\nJosh Halley Republican nominee for the U.S Senate in Missouri appreciate your coming on and sharing your views be safe in the campaign trail way\nThank you so much thanks to you got it thank you and joining me now from Atlanta is Stacey Abrams welcome to meet the press thank you for having me let me start with the impact\nOf hurricane Michael particularly on southwest Georgia I Know your opponent is going to be two in the area or this week and its capacity a secretary said he says to to see how a local officials are going to be able to see if they can handle the start of early voting tomorrow\nOr let me ask you what do you know uh about the area\nHow things are going are they ready to to be worrying about early voting yet or do they need to be worrying about getting POWER UP\nI I think it's going to be a combination ah areas like Albany hourglass county Carolyn parts of south west Georgia were very strongly devastated\nI Know that Georgia Power and the AMCs are doing the best they can to turn power back on and deliver it to as many people as possible\nBut luckily early voting allows for nature centers to except to vote and I hope that the priority will be in terms of voting making sure that those places are ready but I Know all of our hearts are reaching out to everyone in this area\nI go down to hurricane it's a devastating process and it takes months for recovery to happen but I think that the governor and at the state leaders who've done a great job of responding very quickly\nCurious what your message to residents in the area you could be the governor and a cup you can be elected governor\nAnd done a great job of responding very quickly\nI'm curious what your message to residents in the area or you could be the governor and a cup or you can be elected governor and a couple of weeks suddenly the task of rebuilding\nOn this part of Georgia is on a is on your to do list what's your message to those voters or why you would be better prepared to lead the recovery than your opponent\nNumber one I've been through this myself I understand that it's not just the physical plant that's a problem it's making sure that people have access to the resources they need\nAnd also when the camera's turned off and when people go home and stop volunteering that's when the real trouble start when people who have been unemployed are continuing to try to figure out\nHow they can make a living and take care of their families and so I Will leverage the responsibility of the governor the ability to connect with state and local officials and federal officials to make certain that resources don't just end when the memory of the storm passed the tour of the average person\nAnd I think that's what you need someone who's thinking about this not as a three day or three week return but really as a ten month twelve month recovery period\nLet me ask you about an issue that's been front and Center for your campaign over the last week to ten days and that is a this issue of rejected voter registration forms due to this issue of exact matchup of it is an exact match then suddenly the registration gets thrown out Seventy percent of these registrations belong to African American voters\nYou believe this is an intentional decision by her by her opponent in the opposite he runs\n... absolutely I was part of the coalition that pseudonym and twenty sixteen to force him to stop using this process and a federal judge agreed with that said that he had unlawfully canceled more than thirty three thousand registrations and they force them to restore those registration\nAnd response the Republicans passed a law and the twenty Seventeen legislative session to allow him to do it again\nAnd so the challenge is two fold one is that we know this is a flawed system that has a disproportionate effect on people of color but it also has the ability to erode trust and our system I know that\nSecretary camp is well aware of this and it's part of the pattern of behavior where he tries to tell the playing field in his favor or in the favor of his party this should not require the erosion of public trust\nAre you confident this was going to be a fair election in November\nAm and here's why the fifty three thousand that we know about do you have the ability to go and cast about the problem is it's a subjective system with a hundred and fifty nine county and thousands of precinct poll workers being asked to substantially verify\nThat's why this is problematic because we're creating another set of hurdles for people who simply want to exercise their right to vote but my organization working with Democratic Party we put together the largest litter protection effort and the state's history and we have national organizations that are also paying attention and I think we can make this work\nI Want to ask you about a comment that Eric Holder made former attorney general he was campaigning for you are\nAnd it's sort of blown up into a bit of a national story a and essentially said when they go low we go I no no no no when they go low we kick 'em he goes on to explain what he meant by that that it was more proverbial than anything else\nBut where do you come down on that show you on that Michelle Obama side when they go low Hugo high and you stick to it or what Eric Holder's preaching no you know every once in a while you got to ...\nI think there's a hyperbolic moments that happens in every campaign\nBut if you watch my campaign from the beginning\nThrough today I've always focused on three issues education jobs and health care I don't point shot guns at people in my commercials to try to ... and I don't use slogan nearing to try to get things done\nMy responsibilities to show Georgians how I Will lead to state and if they watch my campaign from the very beginning of June twenty Seventeen\nThrough November ... they will see the same consistent leadership that I Will bring to the governor's office\nSounds like you're siding with Michelle Obama won't put words in your mouth but that's what it sounds like to me ...\nI Am the siding with the people who Georgia that I intend to be a strong leader\nStacey Evans I'm going to leave it there are we safe from the campaign trail I appreciate your coming on and sharing the reason I meet the press I appreciate your time when we come back to me issue that was once in a big selling
