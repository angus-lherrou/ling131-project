that is not considered earn income it is considered investment income and ...\nAnd income\nOr that is not considered earn income it is considered investment income\nAnd it depends on what the money's invested in as to whether it'll be capital tax capital gains rate or tax on an ordinary income right if the investment is paying off on something that is less than a year old that will be at ordinary income if it's coming out of a traditional i._r._a. or it's never yet been taxed\nIt'll be on an ordinary income if it's coming out of a four O. one K. traditional not Ross it will be taxed at ordinary income as it comes out um all of the money will be\nA hundred percent not just the returns because none of it the growth has never been taxed nor the money you put in has never been to act on a traditional so you'll pay ordinary income on those\nIf you have investments simply invested in the piece of real estate you don't pay any taxes until your salad and then you pay taxes on capital
