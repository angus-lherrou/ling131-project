and\nOwn our house payment and I'm ... thanks for the smaller and I think we had well we out the smaller nice but we're still have a hand on our house at out to the Avon lone people and they're working with is\nThat we're having to pay extra I'm not on our mortgage payment sure how old are you taking on the eight to nine and a thick and mom than again okay\nAre you guys on some kind of a

class is ... and he also had a trip back surgery a few years ago when he had the lighter and he's got like twenty five percent of his heart mhm\nMhm okay um\nWell what what you guys have more than anything else is an income crisis right due to the fixed income and that's why I was exploring that question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations\nUm but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes is what you kind of started doing there with the crafts\nAnd even in his shoes are obviously none of you all are going to be involved in physical labor of any kind right on crime but if there was something that you could\nDo like I talked to a lady the other day who was just going to garage sales and she was buying clothing for a quarter Anna Nicole and selling it on ... for a dollar and two dollars and she had done that like ten thousand times and made like ten thousand dollars\nOkay and that\nDoesn't involve any heavy lifting obviously it involves a keystrokes on the computer to shut up and ... by account and sell some stuff on ... but I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is\nThat that that is in the line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only your world it would change your life\nWouldn't it be dramatic and how old is mom\nSeventy nine\nAnd how much of this thirty four forty two comes from her\nEleven forty head\nYeah she passes away you don't get a real problem correct\nSo we've got to solve some of the income issue one way or another here um and how much is your house payment\nWar forehead NBA right they didn't create\nBut that's kind of that's on your taxes and insurance going up\n... what Iraq now okay and what's the home worse\nFor a ride at hundreds and hundreds of Wally ... bad only\nWant to go and you know I sure would be good when you know\nSo I think more than anything that the the magic wand here is some kind of an idea for you to create some income and I don't know what that is what I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do\nA ... year obviously not going to do anything this physical why gift that you got some serious limitations I understand that\nAnd I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you a buddy man a thousand dollars a month would change your whole life\nThousand dollars a month for a year and you pay the house off\nAnd that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem and right now you being a serious problem two thousand dollars a month and come change\nYou feel like you were rich lucky we're multi millionaires or something it would change your life that much\nAnd so and is that possible yes that is possible it's very possible but you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or whatever\nAnd again it done I don't want to put a bunch of strain on you physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation with you over the phone so you could have an intelligent conversation was on my own sell them something\nRight and that that's possible thing you can do um the you know and it doesn't cause you to\nWork forty hours a week necessarily but if you could do anything that creates a thousand dollars a month it would change your world and that's that's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem\nThat you've got what that is a symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income and legitimately ... you're struggling it's not 'cause you're lazy or something like that but it just hand\nIf you could come up with any kind of a small business idea that your husband and you can do together um and just get them to get the needle to move a little bit here\nThan it would change everything for you and thank you for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five

of view of more than two thousand dollars a year into that account\nSo that\nYou can in a five twenty nine but more than that but you know we're not talking about that being a problem we're looking at the minimum and you've just got to get some money scrape together to do a lump sum to start the\nBecause when you just had one\nSomething worth by your\nActivities the level of starting to see something say something [noise]\nThank you for joining us America ... is with us in Singapore ... how are you [noise]\nI'm doing well thank you very much and good afternoon how are you doing better than I deserve how can I help\nYou know so uh first of all I'd like to thank you for everything you're doing a sense of listening to actually have a few dollars truck together\nGreat um\nMy question is basically about I'm a ... a voluntary retirement scheme that um is in Singapore so I can put up to thirty five to seven thirty five thousand seven hundred dollars a year and I would get tax relief on that\nOr the calendar year ... which translates to about four thousand dollars of doctors mhm now I Want to take half my emergency fund and put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand just gosh blowing it felt my salary mhm\nLord of the penalties for withdrawing or should I Do ... what are the penalties for withdrawing I don't read it for\n... yeah it's about fifty per cent on taxes are but I I really don't need\nFire emergency fund I currently have thirty thousand I'm a picky picky picky\nBut I I really don't need\nAnd fire emergency fund I currently have thirty thousand I'm thinking thinking Fifteen thousand and put it in for that I can rebuild my retirement my emergency found in about three months\nIf you don't need it why would you rebuild it\n\nI mean I don't have to have all the thirty thousand I just built it because I feel very comfortable with having that is of course you're\nRight and what is your income a year\n\nAbout a hundred and sixty\nOkay so what is three to six months of expenses\n\nIt is about joining the three thousand\nOkay that would be ... that'd be three months or six months\nThat will be fifth month\nOkay All right so you can be within the range of three to six months of expenses at Fifteen thousand and um if you want to use\nSome of that money that's fine and if you want to build it back up to six months later that's fine but it doesn't sound like you need more than twenty five thousand ever in your emergency fund\nYes but I'm not instead of sitting here I'm also not a U.S citizen I'm\nI work here on my now ex patriot and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to leave the country I have about sixty days to get all my affairs in order and leave\nMhm\nOkay so you're just going to keep a little extra will show what out and that's why I feel more happens if that at that event occurs a while you're down on tax because you funded this thing\n\nBut it's very unlikely um I just received any role and at least for the next two years I'm probably very safe and my wife\nMhm yeah\nWell the thing is is here here's what's bothering me is the proper amount to have in your emergency fund there's thirty thousand dollars and the answer is no\nDon't drain it down because this is not an emergency use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount to have in your emergency fund\nWhich means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later\nSo you decided what the proper amount in an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears but don't tell me you're using your emergency fund to fund this and then you're going to put it back\nTells me you don't agree you know you've got to the in your mind the proper amounts thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money in retirement don't use your emergency money\nTo do that but if you're willing to reassess your emergency phone and say I've got this thing over funded I'm going to back down in the twenty range than I might go ahead and do this deal\nA because we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around ...\nAnd don't monkey with it is emerging sheets on is is is foundational before you move on to investing of any kind so you gotta decide your definition that's what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash want and it sounds like emotionally given the unusual situation that you're in you want to keep thirty grand around\nAnd so you should keep thirty grand around sets it don't mess with that\nBut if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a cage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage how're you\nDoing how's it going better than I deserve what's up [noise] hey thanks for taking my call today I'm I'm a college student\nI'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance [noise] um but the more that I go through school and the more that I listen to you and makes me want to really make a living being a financial ... many years ago and still here today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I wanted to get your advice on whether you think it still possible or somebody like me to run their type of business that maybe you're biased on that is nice model to maximize success on the early going up starting\nTo [noise] well the um\nYou know see based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you a fee just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we go we we have a program where we certify people to do that that comes to our training to do that\nIs it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that\nUm because it's it's a very much uh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours in the day for enough money to equal a good living\nAnd I can be done but are coming straight out of school difficult to do\nI'm not saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay it's not an eighty thousand dollar your job your first two years out\nIt's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like one of our smart Mr prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals are in the business of selling investments\nAnd there's nothing there's there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact that it's almost paramount that you do coach people while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're selling so I'm On a home you're coaching them and this house was gonna you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that you're in a sense your financial coaching them\nAnd so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house and so uh you know this idea that some people have that everybody gets paid a commission has a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd\nThere's plenty of people on strike commission with high levels of integrity to do the right thing [noise]\nSo you might explore that angle because truthfully you can make more doing that\nThen you can\nJust doing a ... billion by the hour and I'm not saying making more as a whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as a financial coach you probably don't have to get a little bit a mile zone you before people are going to trust you\nYou know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know you're no you're stuff than you'll you'll get business but uh I'm just saying it's it's a tough road\nTo just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not is one reason we quit doing that as our exclusively what we did\nYou know we started doing events we start having a class where we started\nDoing other stuff to go with it uh because it's difficult to make a scale up when there's only so many hours in the day you can bill out\nAt an hourly rate open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Amy
