got back shouldn't\nHave been my fall you mean for your when that's just you know just a little have jobs Scott next time give us a call before you go [laughter] I mean he said yes I sure do but we're planning on going back and it got me thinking next time we go to Russia how can we prepare ourselves to be secure OK so\nA friend of mine who lives in London in ... or you know okay is that um she was telling me that she went to Beijing\nAnd so she had her windows laptop they're connected to the hotel live fight right okay and she said all of a sudden the the hard drive light like when okay\nAnd it stayed constantly illuminated for the next eight hours wonder why\nDo you think they were copying the entire hard drive not the Chinese told they would not do that at all gosh God neither what the Russians what are you worried about\n[noise] [laughter]\nWell I Would love to have the option you talk to you before we called but was not an option and in fact I have a kind of a two part question number one\nTo the rumor is always been ours devices or less vulnerable the Android or PCs now if you just first come from that and then I Want to talk about the peons\nOkay um [noise] the reason why then people say that Iowa devices are more secure is that there are ... that apple keeps a hold on everything okay so\nIn order for you to penetrate through the operating system is that you have to go through multiple levels of encryption you can jail break\nAn iPhone if he wanted to and basically take all the security and the trolls and right away but if you are trying to get a piece of now we're onto an Iowa device that it is more difficult than say Android or window so yes that is true\n[noise] [noise] well what I did do sorry on this trip\nWas caught a little bit of a fold\nDo us a it's a VPN but I wondered if that was enough or if there was more the U.S should be doing in the ... [noise] what\nDid you do everything while you were overseas I mean did your bank can pay your credit cards and checked pays for in business and stuff like that\nI did have to check my bank once or maybe twice but I Try to avoid that didn't do anything with credit cards except could obviously to pay two beers with a it was mainly just to cooking meals\nAnd then did you do everything through the VPN or did you fall like that where where you got like well just can check my email one\n[noise] it was so much that if there were several types it seemed like the VPN prohibited me from getting on a website and I don't mean that particular website it it just like anything getting on the Internet period\nIn and try to do that depending upon what lockdown can be in a particular community and a particular country\nAnd so I'm a lot of VPN when if you look at their coverage maps\nAnd then you want to make sure that they have multiple access points within one particular city\nAnd so that this way you can get out if you want it to ... you know it's it's a it's a really interesting topic because in my email this past week I also had a note from a gentleman who was in China and couldn't go anywhere because he was in China you know of course they they they have the great firewall there\nAnd they're stealing anything that they can but that's a whole another topic\nWhen you are ... traveling in countries like Russia and you do come back you know the general rule is that number one before you go is actually make a complete backup of everything [noise] uh so that this way if you need to restore it and then you'd be able to because sometimes coming back in the country or going to a country believe it or not that you may have your device confiscated\nAnd if it is confiscated weather here or abroad uh three or six months you might be able to feed again but quite possibly a year ... and nobody wants that to happen so that was not your issue I Would recommend that you change all your passwords to any account that that you have had access to\nA especially your even though you didn't use a VPN because I wouldn't want you to take any unnecessary risks and then be sitting here thirty days after a trip and typically they're going to wait until you you're at home for thirty days and then you start seeing some weird stuff happening you know what I mean\nUm and if you haven't already set up some type of authentication on your bank account I Would definitely encourage that went in my wallet I carry a\nAbout the size of a thumb drive I don't know if you've ever seen the news\nAnd the sun Dr has a rotating code on it and even now I can tell you can show too that there's a coat on it and every thirty seconds I get a brand new code if you don't have that code you can't have access to my bank account so I Would\nTry to ... I Would encourage you to see if you can still some of that type of\nAh extra layers of protection as well and I think before you just give us a call we're here for you um but congratulations on a great trip at a safe return but again just spent some time and change all those passwords and listen I have to tell you haven't heard about the brand new commando ambassador program was super excited

Andrew Randy in Oshkosh, Wisconsin Oshkosh NASCAR ... gosh what is it\nWell he's in our car yes the Oshkosh my gosh oh my gosh darn she's totally better I remember the ... the kid's clothing or maybe that's that's what I mean before you know well before we put them on less than half guy\nRandy how do you say where you're from\nOshkosh I Am Joe Joe I'm Jim he doesn't know enough so the Oshkosh\nAre not just a scotch [laughter] dodge ... named after as a leader American or a tribal leader so\nBecause the there's a little fun facts for you I Can't do learn wrong or not\n[laughter]\nAnd Randy [laughter] she's on the line he can tell you is Dorrie someone trying to feel Fifteen thousand dollars from it Fifteen grand Randy\nGod and then he he you know and in that too yeah what it is it's a it's something you'd rather it seems like something rather new and so I just wanted to get the information out there so so because you know as you know hackers that are finding new ways to probe into your uh to access your money\nAnd now just a few weeks ago we got a phone call from our local um I'm a credit union and they know our habits anyway they they they got a um a um\nCheck that said a so called purchase said it was near Fifteen thousand dollars from the popular a sporting goods chain and uh they produced we went to go see and that they produce that satellite upstairs it's our check we don't use two minute checks\nBut somebody was able to take our check and and there's er there's there's or address there's are routing number there's our account number the the the check never was a little bit different\nBut there was it was like fourteen thousand dollar coins from from this this place and I called back and say the name of the company\nYeah sure go ahead yeah it's a ... okay so I called them\nA lot older that's a lot of fishing gear by the way I was in the same boat [laughter] All right but wait before you continue I Want to know some of the check looked really good\nIt was it was er it was our check the only difference was that had a different name on it [noise] and uh yeah so yeah we had that so what I I contacted a they they were most interested in and saying well as well because I told her I said that it it's it's not just one\nBut I suspect that there may be some other things going on maybe just not only with our account but with other people for counts as well sure\nAnd sure enough he out there it was and so they they put a little um a stop on it but the guy said that he had his experience\nThat this was the second or third ah like\nI'm a I'm a ... a problem that he had seen and so I don't know if this was if he had any awareness arts there is something that you might be able to offer because the next day here where the credit union and and to do the fraudulent paperwork and we'll All right how\nWell the the bank manager right then and there she got some information and she says hey they just took nine hundred dollars from your\nChecking um she yeah yeah they were\n... so so that the number one I'm impressed that your credit union called you I mean that's really something right there I don't know a lot of banks that might do that a number two is that they were able to potentially passed this check through so what what the banks say that you could do as a precautionary means right now\nWell the only thing that we had to do was to actually shut down the the er account number and switch over to another one not the routing number wasn't anything um Mozart like because we wanted to maintain a we'd been there for years and\nEr and switch or to another one another the rather now that was a good thing I'm most certainly cause we wanted to maintain a we've been there for years and again the newer habits but that was a kind of a defensive player\nI so I guess that's the big thing take take away message here is that a lot of people don't like to keep track of their checking accounts right I mean\nWell sometimes it's just very easy not to think about doing that and I and to be honest this con us at the off guard a bit because we were right smack Kim lights like a little while but just solar house in a house but we're we're right in the middle of moving there there's like ... constant\nAnd you know and and then when you're moving like that I mean jeeze I mean the last thing you want to think about is if somebody who's trying to steal from you know what I mean it's crazy\nUm you know what Randy thank you so much for your call today and thank you for spreading the word because there is any takeaway take home message from this is that if you have not been watching what's going on with your checking account\nThat he hangs up and then he looks at his account\nThere were two fraudulent charges on account from the day earlier totally three thousand four hundred dollars [noise] there was a twenty nine hundred dollar charge from Kroger near Atlanta there was a five hundred dollar cash withdrawals from an ATM\nAfter everything was said and done yeah just three hundred dollars in his account so what this scammer head was every single thing about him except for the PIN number [noise]\nAnd so by her going through all these gyrations with the card they were able to duplicate the card obviously they had to duplicate the card she had the number she had everything\nIn front of her but she didn't have the PIN number so by going through every step she had the PIN number isn't that shady Andrew isn't that\nWhere would they get all the information that is our dog when it's on the dark Web crazy stuff don't do any banking on the phone [laughter] ... bank calls don't dancers green color green color hang up and go to the bank that's it [noise]\nAh Chaz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin chess\n[noise] has to protect my call I don't worry today I'm good what's going on\n[laughter] I just wanted to call up and um this would be a good follow up to the story you just mentioned I a work in the banking industry do okay yes I Do\nA do Internet support for people to call up and have issues with their website or unable to log into our phone up and things like that and a lot of times you know people are when they are on hold bill push this button the buttons to try to get a life you know\nAnd I've actually taken calls just like what you're describing also\nLiquid Randy called in probably about ten minutes ago right so\nWho in light of all these things and you just mentioned about technology and you mentioned about monitoring couch\nWhen I'm you know primary the large amount\nOf the people that call and generally seniors are they tend to be a good target for fraudsters wouldn't you think is probably the best reason for them to get involved or stay involved on line with technology what's the biggest reason than your mind that would be beneficial to them\nAnd what why do you ask [laughter] I'm personally I've run into one of the worst um I've [laughter] I've\nSeen and heard it all over the many many years that have been doing this uh I've talked to many Rand is over the best um [laughter] I've dealt with the ... that you mentioned um and all of those are very personal one universal thing pretty much comes into play and unless something dramatic\nCap of ... so vast majority of these things I've discovered after the fact that they are somebody who still gets a paper statement than the good at at the end of the month [laughter]\nIt's it's for the money is long gone right to build it or cover is is\nJust you know that that's a good point you're right Korea's position that that's a real chance that's a really\nGood point is that I'm thinking of even my mother she gets a paper statement\nAt the end of the month right by the time you get the statement your account can be wiped out an exactly so if you don't do the so the whole thing is to educate the right\nGet to and how are people so and the power seniors and this is what's happening these are things that you need to be careful of these are things that you need to watch out for if you have a family member who's elderly these are also thing\nPutting these are things that you need to be careful of\nThese are things that you need to watch out for if you have a family member who's elderly these are also things that you need to pass along because they are the prime target\nBecause they are lonely they're vulnerable\nOr they may not necessarily keep track of everything they may not get a text message like we do on their phones every time a transaction happens right\nThere's a time and so now too it's you know so a lot of the the onus is on people themselves to have that type of knowledge but unless they know where to get that knowledge or how to get that\nHave you ever thought about writing a book\nI'm not particularly I a participant in the market county area was the uh all get counted senior center program and I do try and lectures there all the time to try and get people up to speed it into what we're talking about a such a long row to hoe sometimes ... the benefits are worth [laughter]\nYou know you might wanna he might want to think about writing a book that I'm\nNot saying like you know write it to make thirty thousand dollars or what have you I'm saying right and so that maybe it's even free from your organization and that anybody who come to that the you know they can go and they can download it onto the Kendal or if they can't get the candle just you know here here's the PDF\nSo you can read the media and also for people to share it with their family members and friends and so it's like you know maybe give it like you know ten safety\nTricks that for seniors need to know right now or or authored girl ten hacks and weigh that hackers are targeting seniors right now whatever may be\nBecause it it really gets down into dollars and that's one of the things that we've been trying to do here at the show for a long time and you know that's why we have breaking news alerts and we do news and tips
