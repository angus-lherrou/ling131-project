I'm just not sure where to go [laughter]\nOkay and um [noise] so uh what do you make\n[noise] now I Am not working I recently moved back with family\nSo you're separated [laughter] okay and family is in Los Angeles yeah okay and um do you have children now\nSo I'm I'm guessing based on that separation that the divorce rate is going ahead or not\nIt'll be okay right\nWell whether you agree on filing for bankruptcy or not is irrelevant um he decides what he's going to do and you decide what you're going to do if you're not married\nAnd even if you are married technically because you don't file bankruptcy as a married couple um in other words when I filed I could have filed insurance not filed accepted sheets on some of the papers or she got to file too but um and we had to follow them all the different corporations now well sees that we had at the time that was Thirty years ago\nUm okay so in this case he could file and you not file\nThat's possible whose whose name is the student loan and mine okay so that doesn't affect him anymore that's your during one either way whose name of the credit cards in\nBaltimore evenly are all our you're both on all of them were both on all of them\nWere he to file and you not to file you would be left last man standing and get to pay them\nOkay okay that's how that would work whose name was the car in Baltimore who's got the car\nThey're two different cars and we're both on them and he has run an eye on the air\nOh it's so twenty five is cars and where the breakdown of the twenty five break it out for me\nUh Fifteen in ten\nOr ... okay okay the rule on a an asset that has [noise]\nOh jeeze okay\nOkay the rule on a an asset that has um ... that has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset\nOkay so you ... you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt double it's not going away you got your student loan back that's done okay the cars then you cannot keep the car unless you keep\nThe bat you can ... from the debt okay\nYou've found on me but the only way you keep the car and so sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of debt and that in the ... the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they lean on the car okay so they either get the car\nAnd wipe off whatever difference there is or was a I'm\nA ...\nOr in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard show which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the town\nAnd it can do and what does that car worse do you have an idea [noise] I'd say about ten okay All right\nAnd so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan debt you are going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he files and you don't you've got that\nAnd then you got the other car now in the event of a divorce what I Would demand is that if he's going to keep a car that he refinancing and get your name off of it\n[noise]\nOr if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car the he's driving is it worth at least one vote on it\nAnd say about that okay so you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay Sam so the scenarios are\nThat um you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\nA veterinarian and so I Would say about Thirteen an hour and working fulltime\nAre you a D. V. M no\nOh no I'm attack your attack\nOkay\nAll right and so I'm In that's in the Los Angeles area or you're going to somewhere else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going to clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the car debt if he walks on all of it\nYeah okay now if he chooses not to file inside through it than the two of you gotta work through this together and you're going to be [noise] what does he make\n[noise] ah last year he made about a twenty five\nOkay be coming out of the military\nIs still in his share in the military [laughter]\nYeah no no security clearance you understand that he understands and I'm sure yeah you file bankruptcy or security clearance has gone\nSo I mean his chances are moving\nUp in the military are are are harmed pretty dramatically if he finds a bankruptcy but he didn't make any money should man and he just came home all of a deployment and he's lost his mind to show it was like\nOh my goodness yeah [laughter] ... I'm Sorry I didn't care\nAnd I just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to be how old is he\nGoing to happen yeah okay\nWell um I I think you sit down with your pastor and if you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine\nUm I think if he files and you don't you've got to force him\nTo sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to sell yours too okay I'm In and get through it you know get you a five thousand dollar loan for the difference and then you work your way out of the credit card debt the little bit of a car loan driving a beat her and the student loan debt is going to take you a little while with your income\nBut you can do that it doesn't mean you have to file just because he files mathematically or legally\nOkay this is just making sense to you here so I'm Sorry your face and all this one of ... listen if you get in the middle of and you're going to the question you call me back I'll help you okay\nThank you thank you Chris is with us in Minneapolis Hi Chris how are you\nGood to have our you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nWith a question about life insurance or I'm not very uh ... uh I spoke with your ... ... and ah [noise]\nYou know they had them kinda borderline whether or not and get a term life insurance [laughter] I've got a wife to kids at home and I'm the premium it'd be pretty expensive uh [noise] if I Do get approved so I guess my question is to part [noise] into I still go for it even if it's you know\nThree four hundred dollars a month premium um three or four months for how much coverage\nFor a ten times my my pay million\nFor a million dollars okay ... what is your medical problem\nUh [noise] I mean basically I mean if\nWe can get you okay are you are you overweight yeah okra that'll give me too [laughter] yeah okay\nYeah that they can help you more with the diabetes if you get the way down which also by the way up to the doctor already told you that you knew that right\nOh yeah I'm working on a good good for you so hard struggle um\nSo what I might do is make sure my family's lot left with nothing and buy a smaller policy\nUntil we can do those two things and let let's get the weight off and get the diabetes more under control at that point and see if we can get a better rate two years from now or something\nAnd um you start to see those are the actual economic value of taking care of yourself in those situations in addition to just oh I get to live longer hello you know so [laughter] you already knew these things right you know um yeah\nUh but but I I mean what if you took half\nAnd at least you know she's are or how much you own your home [noise]\nUh to lady what does she does she work outside the home now she works out she was you know\nNow so if you had like five hundred and that would pay off the house and Senate come onto the market if something happened to you that's better than a half million or something for a male but at least you got for that [noise]\nBecause you're both grown people you're grown your parents are grown\nAnd they're being obstinate about something and you just have to watch somebody that you love do self destructive stupid things like I've got a friend is an alcoholic and he's going to kill himself if he doesn't go drinking\nI mean I and and I've talked to him and people will talk to him people dumped on him we love him all that but I Can't make him want to stop drinking he has to decide that right\nAnd it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff that kills themselves you know I mean money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's any one that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money is does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or is do they have a friend or a pasture that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their life\nThat's a possibility the other possibility that probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your story\nMhm mom we were so scared mom we were freaked out mom we were fighting about money all the time we were so overwhelmed I couldn't breathe\nManchester is getting tight and you know what we did was we got on this budget and we cut up our credit cards and we're not there yet and put man I feel so much better and I'm On my way and no one can argue with you about your story and your feelings\nRight but don't Wagner finger at her and say no you need to do this to instead of just just keep talking about what's happened in your life what's what happened with you ... what's your deal and eventually they're going to say something like well\nI Wish I could do that will you know it'd be nice it'd be nice to get control and they got to do that\nDebbie Downer ... party thing right the martyr thing arrow and people do that all the time and as soon as I Do that that's your opening jump in and go\nI think you can I really am because I felt the same way I didn't think I could do it but I think you really can I think you can have\nIt when they found that if they do at\nThe University You're already you already jump to the front of line and you got slammed down as you start saying that and that conversation she gonna shut you down ghetto\nYeah and all you got to do just talk about what if you did for you are or not\nFor her just about\nEnabling like make your alcoholics and obviously you wouldn't know allow for and drink\nWhile him to a bar knowing what I Would I have money to drink\nRights and my parents they're basically eating out ten batch ... times a day for all that is and and my dad got ... tired and they only have one income that are living on killing communist yeah and and\nSo when we met that they don't live in our and our state and so we don't ... them and my dad he wants to take out the fancy dinner just show that he loved that and we left handed down much but I just want to scream absolutely not\nSign up for our kids that I don't want to drain our relationship well\nIt just said that you know what we're learning in our story as we're learning that we can't do that and so it makes us very uncomfortable to do that with you so let's find another way to celebrate our time at home\nBecause we don't want to go out to eat it won't be fun for us\nBut don't go that you only take us out to eat or to broke that stupid if you want to say that that's what you're thinking and I'm thinking yeah right I agree with you but if you say that kind of stuff so you got to direct it all back to you back to you back to you\nBack to you talk about how you feel about this not about how you feel about them or their behaviors but you just back and talk about you used to feel the way and you turn it loose you used to feel and now I feel good I used to be freaked out now I'm not in you know of course had only to be the truth by the way and you know tell the truth and\nYou know but I used to I I felt that way too personally I mean I went broke Shannon I went broke we killed each other I Know how it feels to fight\nAbout money and um we don't fight about money anymore and have it in years uh and so how do you\nHow do you fix that what do you do and you're just share your story talking about your story and they will start chasing you eventually to get that and go if if they ever reach out and say well we should look into that hey I can show you how you want me to a show you what we're doing but don't ever returning go deep one step deeper and go because you're stupid\nBecause you're doing this wrong you go out to eat all the time he got stopped that don't turn into the instructor\nBecause the instructor or you're you're not in a position to be the instructor all you can do is lead them if you want to go to financial ... my my pay for it 'cause it changed my life not because you're so stupid you need it\nYou see the difference and you just keep directing it back through you through your story\nFor it because it changed my life not because you're so stupid you needed you see the difference and you just keep directing it back screw you through your story that's your only shot and just talk about what it's done for you not what it'll do for them and then pay for it for for them to go through and um\nWhich I mumps someday when you're rich you can pay for the rest of the kids to go through or something if you want but right now on to this is my gift just because of what it's done for me and you know it might not work for you but I worked for me you know and just kinda keep playing it off and making them chase it a little bit sort of backing them to be smart [noise]\nHope that helps you open phones a

a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter

die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed paying for the mortgage\nUtilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every

Iran to oh I Know you're in one\n... ... everything's expensive here and so a bomb under is Iran to oh I Know you're eating and one of one of the things I just I just want to [noise]\nI kinda wanna walk them and throw it away and\nI'm One of the things you could look to be a Christian health share ministry and I think for a while you might have been your door from on for a while I Can't remember but we have ways we're we've got it from other families in our class or your finger on income housing thousand dollars a month for\nPregnant for helping hand combat yeah and you know we can do a family on the health care mystery strike for your mind nothing by ... I just\nI wanted to get your pay can you know something personally in baby steps here you know where my wife and I talked about a little more comfortable you know when we have a fully funded emergency charmed by\nNow I don't know we're just trying to navigate that and I want to get your take\nOn the uh we do indoors a Christian healthcare ministries is one of our ah sponsors for the live events and for some other things over the years I'm full disclosure I have a group health care plan at our company here this Blue Cross Blue Shield that is my personal healthcare\nSo on and I'm real careful on the show as you know or even through financial ... not recommend to people to do something I don't do that kind of a thing but I'm In a little different situation I've got a decent program a available arriving me um and so a Christian healthcare ministries um the the\nYou know the bottom line was the thing is it's technically not insurance as you know it it all sharing and it is based on the book of acts we're Christians band together and share each other's burdens or in a sense becomes cooperative then is what it's doing 'em and uh the the\nYou know I Would never suggest going into something like that that did not have a long or even the possibility of going into something like that that did not have a long track record and these guys have thirty forty years of having never missed\nA single claim now\nYou have to read and you should read very carefully to what it covers and what it does not cover\nAnd know that and they've got a couple of plans you can buy the upgrade plan that covers different things and that kind of a thing\nFamily plan their singles plan all that they've got a normal you know an array of products so to speak to learn what's covered and what is not covered learn how it works um because it is technically not insurance you're technically if someone else in the program chose not to share\nIs in war would you be you know technically but they've never failed to make a claim\nSo it's worked for forty years you know I mean or whatever number of years but decades right so I'm comfortable with its credibility in that regard it is different than insurance and we get our brains get dolled into how health insurance works and this has got some nuances some differences to it so learn what those are\nNumber one number to know that I don't personally do it even though I Do believe in at number three and the only way I Do it as if they had a long long long track record which these guys do and it is a Christian\nHealth care ministries and so a ... and the ... ... their definition of that is is that if you use tobacco\nOr our alcohol then you don't qualify\nAnd so they're hardcore in that regard um and so you need to be aware that that they are and that's a limiting factor as well and they ... you know they want you to affirm your face as part of the process you're Christian faith\nAs a part of the process and so that's what it was four and a house laid out but all of that and once you know all those nuances and you know those differences and you can see them [noise] um we would not have endorsed that if we didn't think it had credibility\nRight and that way and and I guess if I could ask one follow up question how we were to go through that being in baby steps to and all that kind of one of the things that my life with a little concerned about\nOne of the ones we're looking to the as the long term track record and and we're okay we're all the requirements we're yeah we're we're evangelical Christians all that out of there were ever normally pretty healthy [noise] seems like a good for our family\nBut like one of 'em you know you pay out of pocket kind of like the nature of faith for Fifteen hundred bucks and stuff so if you're a baby here with you recommend it when you go that route\nTo set aside that they're going out of dollars to insulate you against those\nAre now you've got an email already got you've already got a thousand in baby steps on so you're close enough\nI'm ... and if you run up over just budget your other five hundred into your budget flow or you might have to slow down your debt snowball a little bit in baby steps who covers some bills if you had an event right Brian or it's just like carrying large the duck the ball as you said in a nature or something I'm but I'm going to take that part of the risk gone\nFor sure and so forth but but yeah a Christian healthcare ministries is the one that we endorse hey man thanks for the call April's weather's April's in New York City Hi April how are
