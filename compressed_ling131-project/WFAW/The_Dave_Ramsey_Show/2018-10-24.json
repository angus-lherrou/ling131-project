that's the other thing you've got to look at it or it could be unreasonable but I'm diabetes is a real tough\nDiagnosis for life insurance really tough\nSo um anyway\nThe answer your question overall is if someone's uninsured ... she would keep accidental death\nAt forty something years old you know the probability is accidental there would be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue um but otherwise I mean you you statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidental death as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kind of gimmick insurance is what it is a definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment and if your term is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nYou can also find brown build on your mobile device or online at ... field Agnew dot com Rome feel bad news for America\nFor joining us America we're glad your ears\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five\nFive two to five Chelsea is in Los Angeles high Chelsea how're you\nDoing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up in your world\nI had a question for you in regards to um\nOur the papers the salary ... my husband is traditionally trip condition I'm aware they're going to be giving him a pay raise\nBut with that pay raise their um say that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him into salary pay she usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week so I wanted to make sure that when I hear they haven't given him an art form I forget that when they do want it to make sure that\nHow would you how would you recommend to calculate whether the salary rate is comparable with for example the hours because she was working for and the pay that he would get what overtime\nWhich sounds like it would be simple you been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that in overtime correct correct and so what was his income last year including the overtime\nWith about forty\nBeen paid for that and overtime correct correct and so what was his income last year including the overtime with about forty thousand and how will that compared to the salary\nFound out what that could apply that we don't know yet is\nKind of short end of the salary as if the salary is fifty that's raised if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours or expect to be work it's effectively a\nPay cut right\nYeah that makes sense it's like I like to be where I was kind of weird because it's just more of his way into the ... member cheer mhm um I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was kind of very\nYeah but but the question was the question and it's not just more hours the question is is this a good deal for him\nApples to apples and not a ... and\n... and has he got the chance to move up in the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be moving into management because they shed no\nBut I mean further up later oh okay but let's say they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary will we be dancing wouldn't we\nYeah okay\nThat 'cause that's like that's like getting paid a lot more and I'm working in the same number of hours you know as like ... it's almost like he picked up more hours but didn't have to work um usually what I'm saying but it but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did him a favor and it's been and he gets paid forty\nBut he's working the same number hours where he's working when he's making forty eight then that's not a blessing\nYeah it's just making sense to you yeah that makes sense\nIf it's even if it's forty eight to forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward potential\nOkay\nLong term it's a long term good career movies moving into leadership into management and that's where he wants to head toward its long term\nBut um you know yes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so the whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand\nWhat's the salary do 'cause that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently Chris is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how are you\nI'm doing good they taking my call sure what's up\n[noise] uh well right now I'm a I'm a income about thirty one thousand dollars a year [noise] I got a fourteen hundred dollars in credit card debt I'm about eleven thousand a student loan debt that it that\nBad about six months ago was a lot about Nineteen thousand [laughter] I've been working working hard and save money and paying that often much as I can good a lot of cooks right now\nI came up with the idea for an invention mhm\nI don't know whether to keep\nYou know steam rolling my debt plan and doing all that are just you know kind of jump ship and say hey this is something that could you know be my future and potentially mhm [laughter] so I'm kind of want a young lady and financial advice from you\nKnow what to do with the remaining dead I have ... and yeah my aspiration [laughter] because I'm In the process I've been have into a v a home loan now is just about ... any advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciative\nRight well I'm going to avoid buying the home until I got the debt cleared the only question is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now because we don't need to make a bunch of money five years from now we need some money today\nOne of them twenty thousand dollars cut a show the invention you came up with as a physical product\nYes sir they say a odor the odor either slash a mold um it's been real small machine that um people getting on their own\nOkay and you've made one\nI made a very um rudimentary proud of the tight mhm the next the next phase I've got is like either the at the end of my rainy day fund started coming in my regular cash flow\nAnd like buying a computer and get my three D. modeling and get me a couple of silicon prototype so I can go you know take it to a you know take the next level and I want I Want to do so again Dr jump off my my dad plan more do I have a case my invention\n[laughter] okay um\nWell what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it\nThere's really no in between I mean you could just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot of money to be spent on something like this and if you were a billionaire and you you know you ... what you would do is you would build a couple of them and you get them out there and test them and make sure that they work and that there was a market for it before you went into production\nUh-huh 'cause you don't go into production on prototypes that our own tested or from an R and D standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no market for not been able to sell it\nBecause you can let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your basement or if you had unlimited sums ever be able to sell them\nYou know ... went on for I like trying to ah continue to do with the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in there in the property and a commercial applications\nAnd let's say let me give me just let's just make up a pretend example okay be like your ideal thing you build one or two and your garage\nAnd you convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works and if the deal works and and what I'm going to want you to his place in order for ten of them or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations\nOkay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside to test it and then if a place that order that just plays such a positive way too large enough\nTo build the order ... and it finds itself that's called organically cash flowing something in other words\nYou you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order was enough of a deposit to feel to manufacture your first order out\nWhat they think I should dial down my rather than just\nBeen all my extra capital towards paying off my credit card debt and my student loan debt\nHow do you have to China and much capital on this you've already you're already built one in the garage yeah build another one okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right\nAs the person that but I I just see I'm a perfectionist I wanted to be you know I've been looking at\nThat time now that it's probably lived there on Oprah factions [laughter] very very purpose of a prototype is find all the crap this broken [laughter]\nYou're not going to get it perfect you're going to put it out there in the end the marketplaces gonna kick it around and you're going to learn form and function changes informants function changes in the switch has to be on that side in this which has to be made out of this system of that and you're only going to learn that if you beat up about a hundred of them but let's get two of them in somebody's restaurant\nIn there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later or two of them in somebody's industrial lap\nYou'd up about a hundred of them but let's get two of 'em in somebody's restaurant\nIn there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the ... I'm ... and then they give you enough money\nIn their deposit for the initial order for you to do your manufacturing and basically you got almost nothing out of pocket [noise] except your brain power and you're sweating\nAnd your smile out there selling and that's how a lot of these things get off the ground\nThe way a lot of people lose a lot of money on them is they're going to mass production or something is proven into the marketplace for the actual prototypes\nAnd you're talking to a guy who's lost money that way those stupid stuff so [noise] do easy man go easy this is that Iran to show\nAnd she knew that are very good I like that\nWow that's fun yeah and so there's ... there's zero base budget was born at your house ship and its game on\nHim on a few months later we take the are actually coordinated team and the first while you know and we've done in about five times and for how\nYeah thank you how may cost saving I I just take a few moments you know to the to the listeners and and those are you watching on you to coordinate in a few class you don't have to have the answers Dave and his team on the video have the answers you know it's nine classes over nine weeks just take two hours a week that's\nEighteen hours you know instead of binge watching TV and keeping up with the car dash in how\n'bout you teach people how to keep up with the Joneses so there were no sign you are [laughter] come on doing it infomercial nobody regularly scheduled programing [laughter]\nThank\nYou very nice well it is fun because not only and hold you accountable but you get to watch people you really get a front row seat to watch people change their lives\nAnd those nine weeks you know we've had stories folks come up to us and and and and one of the older gentleman or a class with tears in his eyes just saying you know I've never stuck to anything in my life and\nAnd I'm doing this and it's working I'm seeing I'm going to follow this for a while just it blesses you and your name and now it's more than the facts the figures in the ... it's really changing lives I I Wish we could put our Congress throughout history you know they need it\n[laughter] [laughter] wow you guys are fun this is great so uh what kind of that was the Ninety eight thousand\nOr dumb that it was a credit cards cars and the student loans loans are the most\nIn our one death that you hated and when you got rid of that you went to people\nMy student loan thought yeah I had it so long it would have been in middle school like I was twelve years old I had this woman\nShe filmed green when I finally click to pay this off but and I was just like I I Can't believe that's gone it just gone just gone yet\nYeah wow so when somebody you knew the clash and they're like I don't know this ... stuff what kind of like you were kind of feels weird or this budget stuff feels weird or what do you tell them the main\nThing they have to do if they want to get out of that together these two things are these three things what do you tell them\nThat um I Would say the budget budget really set up for success for the rest of it really even just the one I haven't done your budget I think that's the key\nAnd the other thing is in the same age you're married ... and just knowing that you're on the same team that any one person doing it alone it's just it's an awesome brown you say you have to be on the same team and going for the single\nYeah and I and then and then I Would say the other thing that you know God was great to us throughout the process and one of the things that we were constantly communicate about is what does it looked like when we're debt free like that go what's that dream what's that saying we want to do small goals ... along the way and then the long term goal you know one of our small goes again\nWe discover you right when we got married so we would like to remind me throughout the process and should get a little frustrated she'd like they ruined our honeymoon we tend to\nHunting mounted on running off I Know I'm just a couple of weeks ago cash flowed our honeymoon to London for a job that's in there and uh so that will shallow wait yeah and we enjoyed our time there and there was cast\nAnd we were still you know like say we're bowling on a budget like we we cash flow to even dare when we ate we didn't spend a lotta money thing and you know just keeping those little short term goals in our long term goal we always talked about is we want to get to that baby step seven where we can just given our goal is to live off the top\nYou know just keeping those little short term goals in our long term goal we always talked about is we want to get to that baby step seven where we can just give and our goal is to live off the ties and gives Ninety and and so that's our long term goal is to just get our first time there were ... and just\nLook at it she found it on your generosity that can be awesome oh very cool we're very proud of you

[noise]\nNew I don't ever gone on [laughter]\nYou could change it and this is Dave Ramsey show\n[noise]\n\nI get asked all the time about what people need to do to improve their families money situation to the most overlooked things are term life insurance and disability insurance both plans to make sure that you have the income to pay bills\nAnd take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen for term life you need to carry ten to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families stay away from cash value or return a premium plans there just a rip off\nDisability insurance is just as critical how are you going to pay your bills or if you're unable to work disability is the leading cause of bankruptcies foreclosures\nThat's why I send you those and their insurance they've been helping my listeners find the right plans at the lowest cost for almost Twenty years called eight hundred three five six
