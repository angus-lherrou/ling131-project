world\nSo recently this week that uh my wife and kinda racked up about forty can a credit card debt behind the scenes so kind of this\nKind of found out this week this last weekend so it's pretty pretty tough\nMm\nFace you know it kind of found out this week with this last weekend so pretty pretty tough to swallow\nMhm [noise] so she was hiding it from you\nYeah I'm ... and I you know I Can't just blame her I mean I I got to take some credit because I never kind of went and looked and kind of a paid any attention and this is the second time so about two and a half years ago\nAnd in the same thing and I kinda laid out a budget and then kind of slipped away from that budget and I think it was just kind of roll back into it I filmed everything was going okay but it just kind of wasn't\nOkay so you gave her a all of\nThe responsibility of handling the money and you weren't involved in the money\n... percent okay yeah yeah it is your fault yeah yeah um\nAnd it's her fault a but basically she was out of control didn't know what to do and uh just borrow it her way into a mess and\nNeither one of you had your head and the game\nCorrect okay\nSo ah are you already to stop the cycle I'm show you how\nYeah a hundred percent and as a this this week and so there's a lot more to the the problem and I kind of a solution but\nAnd hogs today are higher supported by short covering and most contracts discount the cash October's up thirtieth sixty seven eighty and establish one forty hired fifty six Seventy two [noise]\nAnd I mean while we're on Wall street it's been a kind of an up and down day for stocks as well so far crude oil is from John Perkins brown field [noise]\nCall is very interesting topic this topic of financial infidelity read what magazine did a survey said thirty eight percent of you lie to your spouse about money [noise]\nWow\nAnd you wonder why you're marriages in topping out is uh Dawson\n[noise] now I mean it can be little white lies the target bags under the bed\nSnickers sneaker right ah or it can be big Tom credit card debt\nIt can be one of you is running a business and is running up debt down at the business and not telling your spouse\nIs you're trying to live your dream and it's turning into a nightmare let me just kinda clarify this for you there is no positive effect to your marriage when you lie to your spouse\n[laughter]\nWas that helpful you didn't already know that did you [laughter] well I'm trying to avoid it by ear you're all you're doing the cooking it up it's going to be a bigger fight once it cooks up [laughter] so you might as well have a smaller fires quickly so here's the thing\nIf you're afraid to discuss with your spouse\nA purchase\nOr a financial issues that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that's a relationship problem\nNow\nI got to tell you there's times I I mean I I have a ton of money I'm a multi millionaires times though I think I Want to buy something and I'm also down talk Sharon hey I Want to buy this toy\nI Want to buy another gun she's like you know I mean not again you have too many guns already\nPeople already but thank you were crazy if they know what I mean and you and I collect guns by the way so\nYeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're gonna find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another ... you don't need another inner tube to pull behind the bar actually collect those I got too much too many like toys right [noise]\nUh for the grandkids and for the kids to play on\nAnd so you know I I get ready to buy a toy and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked about this she gets ready to buy purses too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys this too expensive\nBut like she says one of those purses is equal to\nOne of those guns [laughter]\nUh well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know\nAnd it's funny how as adults that have the money even\nIt'd be maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know isn't it funny how as adults that have the money even where there is not a stress on the finances have it a little\nBit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not there's the one of the seven habits just talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always hard\nTo talk about it keep it clean and if\nYour spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship and they are intimidated by you\nTo the spouse is an arrogant rebellious\nImmature prints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with\nTheir lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child and the grownup body and goes and buys whatever they want to buy but know that it's wrong so they hide it from you\nMost often we find hidden that though is the what the guy was on the last call\nOne of the spouses\nHas been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling them well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is multiplied and it shame based hiding its guilty\nCondemnation based hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job of handling the money\nIn which case if that's your spouse you you are partially responsible just like that guy said\nHe was he owned it because he should have been more involved you shouldn't have dumped is on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband\n\nYou shouldn't dump it all on either one of you both of you should be involved not want to be again can carry that ministry of weight once all the decisions are made but every body ought to know where every dollar is going\nPretty simple stuff\nSo you probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who had almost been on Oprah more than anybody\nOprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we could get off I'd been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a sixty minutes I had been on\nLarry King remembering Larry King was on the air I'm Sally Jessie Raphael you remember her with a red glasses you know all that I'd been on all these different shows\nYou know everything out there ... except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call ... or so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah and the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWhy would I Do that because Oprah was wrong [laughter] that's what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh I had told the producers I said what's partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not loving his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars ... unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy had and he he doesn't know what's going on under his own roof these free can clueless when his relationship\nAnd so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and if you say that it's partially fault and he owes earn apology I don't think I agree with that as well you would be wrong he does or an apology because he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand auto the bat and he don't even know what the clips going on under his own roof\nAnd she's like well he delegated it to her I said oh this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you delegated in business you would always inspect what you expect you would never just walk away and hope it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that\nThis is marriage is not a joint venture God not say and now you are a joint venture you said and now you are one and these two are not one they're not on the same page and so\nYou know the poor lady sitting there crying because she's so ashamed and overwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's finding out he got eighty granting debt that he didn't know he had and oh man they looked like a Jerry ... Springer episode or something and\nUm you know and I'm a I'm Stan I'm making him apologized to her for not being a good husband\nBecause of your wife can run up your husband can run up a hundred thousand dollars in debt and you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life or their or psychopathic\nLiar one of the two but most of the time that you just did you just dumping on them and then and then you cry because they didn't do it right after you dumped it on them and walked away and close your eyes\nAnd what we'll do ... well you know you thought but you didn't even care enough to get involved and know what was going on and so\nOprah's all upset with Dave because Oprah was wrong [laughter] didn't work out well the rest of the show what we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb then\nWe see couples who have a good marriage have been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years\nSit down and start doing a basic budget together we're every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name before the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month of begins a unique budget it takes about ten minutes\nOnce you've been doing it a while but it takes about three months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going\nWe see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increase their level of communication\nTenfold\nIncrease their level of cooperation\nTenfold\nIncrease their empathy for each other for the stress or the other one's been carrying that they didn't even realize\nTenfold [noise] they began to agree on their goals and their productivity with their money goes through the roof ... you'll feel like you've got to raise when you've learned through this together on paper own permission before the Monroe begins give every dollar a name and that's why we named the world's best budgeting software for every dollar\nThat's amazing so what in the world what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is\n[noise] um I Would probably say just getting on the same page um you know we've been married now for about two and a half years and I think\nJust getting on on kind of just getting out of bed and being on the same page in terms of our money\nI think that was really huge um you know just getting on the same page and also not being afraid of hard work\nUm you know I think one of the things that you say constantly and I really like you say that\nYou know when you decide to get smart with your money is kind of like God looks down and says hey I can trust that one and you know I think that's something that kind of happened was with us because you know a lot of different opportunities started coming our way in terms of just income and and just a lot of increases came our way as well\nAnd so God just begin opening those doors and we were able to pay off with a much quicker radio a lot quicker than we thought because we didn't even mention in the beginning it was definitely very overwhelming I mean just looking at all the student loans you thought how we're going to pay this off\nHow we're going to get home do all these different things started family but um you know definitely dollars on our side and and of course you know he was able to open up those doors for us to get on the same page and be able to\nPay off this in a pretty good to\nKnow how how do you explain to other people will cause I Know I Know what the answer is but how do you explain to other people the level of intensity\nTo require cars you guys I mean it was not panic but you were focused to the point that you sacrifice so deeply that normal people looking at you all had to think you lost your mind I mean you guys were on your game on\nYeah where do you get that fire from was it desperation\n[laughter] yeah I think it was um mostly that living with a student loan was unacceptable for us then and we just had made the decision and our hearts that\nUm we weren't going to do that and so I had and we had just individuals that kind of had the perspective that I'm living with a student loan was um you know and it was the normal you know it was just a mediocrity and like that was just a part of life\nAnd certainly made is going to be a room mate for life\nRight why why do people you know are some responses that we got where like you know you don't need to do that or you know like you can fit into your life that we had just\nMade that decision like you know art student loan which just astronomical that we couldn't live with it\nAnd so and we were really we were ready and willing to do and tell them to do those zero budget you know this year I spent budget everything out and every dollar hadn't assignment and every extra dollar went to my student loans though we were making payments like and they plan to making payments to have though is a month\nRight we have to have a big shovel and so we put everything we had towards the end we had like zero last for like just everyday living like eating out\nGoing shopping um socializing entertainment like that did not meet our budget line item and not for our budget and so and you know the sacrifices overwhelming and they can see like I was really a marathon ... decreed that it was extremely painful to\nWell in two and two years like and that lifestyle you know but and I would have to say like during those times like\nPrayer was everything like I really had to really have to pray through and just the frustration of that type of lifestyle and really be lifted in the spirit um\nPet really be focused and to maintain that lifestyle and him\nAnd he had countless hours worked countless hours like twelve fourteen sixteen hour days for weeks and months at a time um but he was just very focused and just stay prayer and staying in prayer time really I'm kind of meet the marathon that we were I'm experiencing\nAnd was in the hands of it was it worth it yeah I don't know you're completely free [laughter] yeah good\nYeah I Know what else should get out of this it's like when you climb a wall of this that tall you kind of come away going we can free can do anything\n[laughter] yeah I'm going\nTo crush the strengthens me but I mean we can do anything other than the first twenty four months of your marriage of your married life ... you know you didn't sit on the on the couch and watch Oprah reruns of wine suck your thumb you went out killed drug it home and paid off four hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars a day or so impressive [laughter]\nWhich is pretty cool we got a copy of Chris ... book for your returns bard we want that to be the next chapter in your story\nAnd it definitely will be outrageously generous and of course millionaires along the way so you're right on track to do all of that I'm so proud of you guys I Know your family's in I don't know your ...\nProud of you know you make sure you tell Robert story didn't want to hear this yet\nAnd I don't know what he wants to hear this I'm telling you you'll love it our guys way to go All right it's true to Virginia Dallas texas for a hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars but it all up and doing the boar months making a hundred three hundred counties\nAround let's say you're a screen\nMaking a hundred three hundred counties around let's Sarah debt four\nThree two one for me the glory where [noise]\n[noise] don't you tell me 'cause I don't know too many of those to those people are rock stars\nUsed wish you were them man that's amazing well on you guys well done either some of every generation that decided to be losers not those two and not the ones I get from age and you know that's an interesting thing you know what they did they just decided [noise]\nThey decided this was overwhelming it's scary and we're going to do something about it [noise] so what are you willing did you decide you're going to do something about it as you say baby [noise] this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each has dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed paying for the mortgage\nUtilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just goes and her insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and\nSee how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and

I guess her husband's family as a way I understood it but anyway the the lady that do the wife issue was wrong to she forgave andme was reconciled to the husband as he supposedly just putting his life\nBack together I don't mind me I'd be happy but his life back together I don't know the guy you don't know the guy well once you knew that you can always do it well you know people that I haven't done it can always do it you know\nAny one of you listening is capable of adulterous affairs\n\nEveryone's capable of that and if you think you're not capable of it you're just about to have one I mean really that's just ridiculous so at what point do you forgive someone when they've done something wrong at a distance\nLike that\nI can forgive him and you know I Hope he's turned it around and I'm not going to sit around and reading my hands and be mad at him and worry about him\nI Hope we turned it around I Hope he doesn't hurt her again on his wife I'm I can I can do that now at what point am I going to trust this guy again that is what reconciliation is at what point am I going to trust that his conversion his turnaround is real\nShe we run into this all the time with her coaching because one spouse lies to the other one about money what we call financial infidelity\nHusband your wife lied to you and ran up a bunch of credit cards and you didn't even know it it's hard to crush them again after that\n\nMap you're going to stay married you're pretty well instantaneously gonna have to sit down and go okay I forgive you but I'm not necessarily going to be reconciled to you financially\nI'm ... I'm going to watch over your shoulder on everything that's going on or we have a couple of\nCome in and the guy is ... is a you know he he's a been found to be a gambling addict\nWhich happens like every week\n\nFootball betting is destroying families finance us on the leave a ball so\nHe comes and he's discovered she's discovered he's a abetting addict an online betting addict the gambling addict and now he's gotten treatment he's in gamblers anonymous any seeing his pastor and he's seeing a counselor and he's doing everything he supposed to do does that mean she just turns over the checkbook to him and let him go run havoc again no\nNo it's a matter of fact we recommend that when someone's recovering from an addiction like that that that may not have control of and not have any access to money\nFor a while until trust us rebuild overtime but ten years later ... should be rebuilt ten months later it shouldn't be better than it is now two years later or should we better than that it should per aggressively rebuild trust\nAnd so if ten years later you you're still or you know you have not bet on a football game again you've not lost any money gambling again are you trustworthy at that point yeah as much as anybody else shows and so we're not going to treat you like you have no ability to handle money the rest of your\nLife but for the short term yeah or taken all access to money away from you too you prove that you can have a little bit\nAbsolutely but then gradually trust his rebuilt and overtime it's rebuilt if you cannot when someone has\nOn something like we're talking about here has has ... has not when when someone has demonstrated over an extended period of time that they're not entering into\nThe negative behavior and you can't forgive them and you can't begin to trust them in that area then it starts to be on you and two years clean if the guy's clean\nFrom his double life adult for survivors or whatever he was doing porn addiction whatever it was sound like it was all of that\nTwo years is a long time you should be some level of trust rebuilt assuming it's all real now if there's indicators is not real if they're still looks like\nLong time you should be some level of trust rebuilt assuming it's already allowance there's indicators is not real but they're still looks like he's sneaking around if he's still got behaviors that make everybody question whether there's a real then that's different but I'm assuming this guy straight and if he's straight for two years then\nYou know it starts to be your problem if you can't begin to trust at that point especially given that his wife already\nShe might just be in a neighbor she might be\nShe might be a total ban and that could be what's going on how could be\nThat he's cleaned up is alive and you're just suffered you can't forgive say that's a different sorts of difference in forgiveness and reconciliation they generally happen at different times and generally for HIV should come faster than reconciliation\nOr if I had a dog and it provides may forgive the dog is\nBiggest thing you learned that you tell people this is how we got out of that we did this this and this\nAnd I love to use them hope\nThat I like to use the across state for hope\nUm I think first being honest with yourself I'm saying you screwed up\nYou did this you got to get out of it and I'm
