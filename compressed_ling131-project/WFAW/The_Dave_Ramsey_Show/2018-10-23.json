Ramsey and you'll see the best possible deal out there that's the magic word Ramsey that blondes dot com Wendy is in Alabama I'm forty six years old and married but we do not have any children should we get long term care at fifty cents we don't have any kids to help us or wait until sixty wait until sixty\nThe probability of staying in a nursing home prior to age sixty is less than one percent so much less than one percent it approaches zero\nOnce you're sixty it goes up every single minute [laughter] it's very weird so I highly recommend long term care insurance for nursing home insurance for in home care insurance want you're sixty because Seventy five percent of the ladies will outlive your husband's so the typical scenario is\nThat papa goes in the nursing home\nFifty Seventy five thousand bucks a year cracks a scramble for three hundred thousand dollar nest egg dies leaves mama broke\nThat's a normal scenario at a decent retirement going end of the scenario [noise]\nLittle bit of a nest egg there but it's all gone and nursing homes are not evil they're just have to be paid to operate the people that work there actually want to feed their kids so they need money called payroll\nSo they're not evil and they're not ripping people off at home mom wanted to go to nursing home it's like saying I Want my money go to a restaurant even though I eat there\nWell that's dumb donate their then okay so but if you're going to need in home care or care in a nursing home you need to pay for it and long term care insurance was absolutely a vital part of financial planning but not until you're sixty whether you have kids or not\nJade de is with us in Sacramento, California how ... how are you\nDavid I'm good how are you better than I deserve votes up in your world\nThanks for taking my call and I'm calling with a question about mortgages my my wife and I pray and we've got maybe three a done\nWorking on three B. and we just went through it\nAbout mortgages my um my wife and I are debt free and we've got baby step three a done\nWorking on three B. and we just went through a happy you are we coordinated thank you and yeah and my ... ... we in there and said ten percent but I hear you on your show the twenty percent even prefer a hundred percent but if we can't get there then been one of those too so I'm just wondering what what makes the difference between ten and twenty percent\nOkay good really really good question well like you said obviously a hundred percent down as our favorite mortgage\nOkay not one All right ah but at the end when somebody's buying a second home I pretty much slap my fist on the table and so I don't buy a house unless you can put down twenty percent on your second because you've got the equity coming out of the first one\nRight in a normal scenario on a first home it's okay to whatever you can put down and get into the house okay here's the reason twenty percent is advantageous\nIf you put twenty percent down and you have what's called an eighty percent loan that are eighty percent loan to value ratio that allows you with a standard Fannie Mae conventional loan or for that matter with an F. ha loan to have no P. M. I. P. M. I. plans for private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on un lose money on the foreclosure\nNotice for show it has zero benefit to you under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying\nOkay ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you were in a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage you got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone\nIf you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference\nVersus ten percent and so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down and you get ... on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the PM I when you pay the lone down to eighty percent of value\nBy buying an appraisal that the mortgage from an appraiser that the mortgage company approves of\nAnd then they will drop the PM I later after you get it pay down\nThe fact that we're in fact in California where home prices are no fairly high compared to this country make any difference\nYou know it doesn't make any difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just because you're in California they don't like okay I'll point out doesn't count\nYou know we don't do that so you still gotta use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're at the higher the ... market you're in the more difficult this discussion because when you get all the way down to ... percent\nI'm not requiring twenty percent but you get\nYou get J. D. how it's much to your advantage to not have that stay that way I Am I\nYeah I mean because you are talking about three or four hundred thousand dollar loan I mean we're talking about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you\nRight [laughter] so that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not but it's so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent didn't keep jumping on that mortgage keep working your baby steps four five six simultaneous get that mortgage pay down and get that loan reset\nWith an appraiser plant that's approved and then get that PMS drop so you're not known BMI for Twenty years\nBecause it just sucks it's just a horrible you know it's just but it's part of the race and it's a it's a logical reason that they require it\nBut it's just super expensive\nAnd it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can because then you get to the business are really paying on your mortgage and not just wasted money but yeah I I you know we don't beat up on a first time homebuyer doing baby step three B. for not putting down twenty percent\nUh the goal always is to become a hundred percent that free as fast as we can and not waste any money we don't have to waste that's what we that's the goal we all have well\nThose of us that are in tune with being smart anyway\nNick is with us in Chattanooga

calling as much as we can mhm\nAnd with five of them we realize that could be a significant extent [noise] mhm and all five children currently have five twenty nine plans and that had been undone by cash gifts and things they receive from their grandparents over the years good\nUm so here's the way there are significantly further and math and my girls are my girls are quite a bit younger um but we just kind of want maybe around and 'bout estimate on what we should plan for each child or how to help each child through college because I feel like\nIt could be such an enormous amount of money with five of them but we also want to help them out as much as they can so\nThat there's a couple of ways you can calculated um as far as your target amounts and if you know your target amounts you're

wanting to know is how do we kind of go along and do the envelope system with budgeting has money and putting money away and try and figure out what new at all is that\nWell I think you did you do a budget and that's for every dollar has a name before the month begins right yeah it sounds like it's a fairly\nYou did you do a budget and that is for every dollar has a name before the month begins right yeah it sounds like it's a fairly primitive easy budget\nYeah there's not much that they're ... or email like Thirteen hundred dollars only ...\nYou know and let's get the ... often build up an emergency fund and go that route I'm that'll make sense but but um\nYou know we're teaching these basic things that you and I both know about apparently you been doing this stuff that we talk about for a while and the hour we're going we're going to be on a budget we're going to avoid that we're going to build up an emergency savings and begin long term investing\nOkay we're going to be generous with some of the money and a show the whole thing that you get when you got someone that's living in a fairly primitive situation like this meeting no bank account\nYou know he's a young young guy getting started is that ah it's real easy for all that money to just disappear\nYeah and the egg thing you've got to get him doing is being intentional with every dollar\nOkay I'm a I'm a I'm a little she said yes we start out with\nUm I well I get a bank account going like you're talking about on a debit card for that and then you know I I think you just lay it out and say okay you know where do you want to be in five years in what other steps that are going to get you there and so you know how much are you going to spend on entertainment\nOr ... how much are you going to spend on what's it take to keep the car running gas rush\nAnd your insurance and your car payment and then just you take this income and give every dollar a name ride down the page I mean this is a one page budget you can do in about eight minutes you know yeah there's not there's not a lot to this deal is not like it's complicated\nOkay yeah we got some apple or set up for like um ... should find in the car like a car like emergency fine as far as you go with your car stuff yeah I mean these things we do have famous quantum by ten percent of marine home we put in your savings Warren\nOkay well no I I Would I Would work the baby steps I mean not so Couzin dollars Assad is ... and then after that I got his car paid off and then after that I have a fully funded emergency fond of three to six months of expenses in his case he be rich if he had no debt inside a brand new spot five grand and savings wasn't it\nYeah it'd be really well off so\n[noise] okay well then again I'm not then I Would start is investing long term start talking about a Roth IRA and those kinds of things that he would start talking about maybe some additional savings so he can have his own blush\nOkay thank you very much\nHey thank you for calling in Russia you're joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Vicky is with us in Wilmington North Carolina\nHi Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I have a question about an inherited him [laughter] and my husband and I are small business owners and we have\nA significant amount of debt with the business end our personnel which is a lot to the business for ... years during the recession and five several years ago that we have a twenty nine thousand dollar and heritage that we [noise] um [noise] my husband had hope that we can\nHe's for the kids' college I have one daughter that than her freshman year of college now and then that the one that will be starting next fall and then two other teenagers and a baby face and\nSo this business and making money\nStruggling that it makes many now that we still have a good bit of debt and how much time to make profit\nUm profit [noise] uh [noise]\nGosh probably\nWell I have to say probably it doesn't make enough to support that time in the past few years but [noise] um\nAnd how long are you going to live in this mythology\n[laughter] um I don't know we every time he has said I can eat again find a job there it's like ... or ... and have doors stays open and um\nHave business doors not open\nIt's not making enough to support your family\n\nAnd so we need to sit down on this business and give it a deadline\nThat in the next six months it's going to start supporting our family after all these years and making enough to start getting rid of some of his death or we're going to close it\nAnd get a job because I don't think you're making any money\nUm am I wrong [noise] well\nI mean we pay our cell tend to do this and I was bringing home about a hundred thousand a year\nBringing out you're you're taking a hundred thousand dollars out of the business yeah well that'd be called profit okay you can't live on a hundred thousand dollars\nWell we can do that we had a lot of\nHow much data God\nBut the guy about fifty two K. and leap personally have about um Ninety six K\nWere you in the business doesn't have any debt you son personally for it okay so they're all is damaged ... it's a hundred dollars in debt and you have a hundred a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt and you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that all you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit to\nNow that's all we know that's what I mean\nWe're all income when you do your taxes is a ...\nIt has banned me like an account okay Jeff some things they're saying that we're taking distribution profit and\nThat doesn't change it right but that's how much we're ... we're paying ourselves from the business okay year so you need to find out what the profit she don't know but I mean\nYou get back you give me three different answers you so you need to find out if it if you make if your business is making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you guys can't live on her does when I was here you got other problems right\nTo ... and and you can pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars is not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go to clean up his dad gummed ... what might\nOkay but I don't ... the only way that makes sense is if you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the business is making a profit and if it is making a profit what the property is and it's all coming home to pay off these debts\nMhm or if you want to pay off the fifty two thousand at the business and call that business that I don't care but we need to be reducing debt\nBy quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars you you ought to be will do that but you guys aren't living on a plan to businesses not on a plan and your personal lives on a plan I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I Know and we just got ... in the mail today and wonder that started [laughter] [laughter]\nThat's a good start and and I'm going to send your company the contrary leadership on the business side so uh because here's the thing you need to be going no one's gonna quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great\nBusiness you know I'm not going to quit that but what we are saying then is is that we did fine tune and give a I think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it\nAnd so we need to fine tune our systems at the business the pier profit and loss statements though the budgets at the business and so we know exactly\nWhere every dollar at the business is going and exactly where it's coming from and then exactly what's coming home and what is taxable income and then ...\nAnd exactly\nIt's coming from and then exactly what's coming home and what is taxable income and then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand dollars worth of that between these two different sets of that and work your way through it you can do both\nAnd use the twin on thousand towards that go if you don't do that and you throw the twenty nine thousand that the goal and then you never pay off the debt\nIt was kind of wasted wasn't it so I'm not asking you to blindly\nThrow it at the ... the ... and throwing a system that your business in the system\nIn detail budget at your home and all of that applied directly on this problem solved the problem goes away and the twenty nine thousand as part of the solution to that but the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money\nAt home and at work pulled on I'm going to give me a copy of the book entree leadership [noise] this is the day Ramsey show\nA dang a payout or pay off dead or go golfing and Florida Keys or something I'm like oh [laughter] our choice I guess is that\nI I Am but the good news is you're out of debt now is like no one else later you can ... there's no real people the key to getting out of that as you probably thirty thousand and Thirteen much\nFor me at that budget sticking to the ... that we never and stuck to it through the ... that always change we knew we had extra cash to redo than spontaneous spending as a planning that for each month happened and loves the every dollar Applebee's it all the time cool and so yeah I just sticking to that budget and planning ahead and just delaying sunnier\nAnd things that you'd wind just waiting on then yeah\nThen for for me I Would say it's just you know everybody's different in the way that they approach or this debt free journey but Lindsay over here she's an excel guru in geek in loves to see a split out\nI'm a put a thermometer up there and let me hold her in the whole thing and get me to the top oh man I go more gold driven in that but we do about it I'm going to far but on the refrigerator right where we are on the refrigerator so that everybody can see that we're in that it's kinda like you know when you're an alcoholic you go to Alcoholics Anonymous\nNow this was it it was like hey we're the ... were in debt I Am not I was our way of being honest and I ended up front and letting people see kind of be a part of our journey if they enter a home\nSo to people look at you look curiously or like you were crazy or did you get more cheerleaders\nNo it was a little bit of both I mean our family is very supportive but for me the crazy part was that it was weird I I kind of took it took my blinders often realize that a lot of people are OK with with being in debt and taking on that and I'm like\nWhy you know like when we got to the store and get it in the beginning but people kept saying oh no just just go by that you know you know you can paid off soon no\nYou know we're that's how I Wonder also front page and you know obviously with with our little guy here in in our next one coming up or a little girl was like you know it's now or never in the best times now when they're cheaper um and then you know once again as far as something expensive\nSo they're going to be done to directly right or well done you got ... very well done that's fun and it's a little guy came with you how old\nIs he he's two years old and his name is she didn't Carter Carol how to ensure this eastern due to free screamed you approached\nHim lose my eyes but he may be a little shy but we'll see he's got he's got his back who actually in his mouth right now ... been driving around and not a good thing\nFor ... or for worse right fun they can do it

count it down a debt free screamer\nRight three two one\n\n[noise] open phones up AAA eight to five ... five two to five you drop it and we'll talk about your life\nAnd your money Dale is with us in Kansas City Hi Dale how are you\nOn like a particular colder sure what's up\n[noise] well I'm Wondering if I Need more life insurance so\nFine thank you for taking my call they sure what's up [noise] [noise] well I'm Wondering if I Need more life insurance that I have okay how much do you have a have a two hundred and fifty thousand okay what's your household income\nSorry what's your household income a hundred and eighty what do you make a hundred and fifty okay\nAnd you have two hundred and fifty in life insurance and how much in your nest egg do you have in wealth um and invest much\nOr\nMore debt free other than home and land mhm and that's worth about one point eight mhm and then I have\nAbout four hundred thousand and four ones and Ross\nOkay good and uh what do you owe on the land and home\nA five hundred and twenty okay All right well\nThe income produced off of six hundred and fifty thousand dollars let's just use it that's the two fifty and the four\nHundred you got those two numbers mhm if those two were invested and just rent round numbers just to make this easier but it was ten percent that'd be sixty five thousand dollars a year she doesn't get to keep the land in the house in that scenario does she\nNo\nShe can't for service or half a million dollar debt with a sixty five thousand our income and raise kids right\nSir okay so you're under insured if your goal was for her to stay in that property upon your death now if she liquidated input seven hundred thousand\nThe equity of that buys a two hundred thousand dollar house has five hundred in her hand plus has two fifty plus has four hundred now she's got over a million dollar she's got paid for two hundred thousand dollar house and she can live on a hundred thousand dollars a year then are coming off of a million one\nDoes that make sense [noise] so if that's your plan you're okay but if you wanted to stay on that property and continue to live there you don't have enough insurance do you see how I'm doing that\nYes or a new okay so what's the goal which one\n\nWould you want her to stay on the lambs I Want her to stay on the little pushy wants to stay on the land but I Would rather she was close with us from family okay\nAnd then if you if you if you want the ability to do that we need um [noise] you know you need about a million five and insurance\nShould use five hundred about to pay off the property she'd have a million dollars from change that way to live off the income from so somewhere a million million five and life insurance so you're seven fifty light
