I'm about yeah about Fifteen thousand dollars a month and I'm just blowing through that crazy sex addiction\nUm I'm standing just came out of money to ten thousand dollars a month on\nProstitutes and strip clubs and um ... all the above\nAnd I don't know what to do after everything that goes sex addicts anonymous and but I I I I Want to know what you would do in the situation I have done well spent that money on buying a house and I'm here being being it now and I'm doing well with that\nAnd that's ...\nThat's been a long project finished but I don't know what to do is how it should handle it what ... anything else I even tried [laughter]\nHow old are you going to ... and um\nThe inheritance came from who passed away\nSo my dad passed away about two years ago um [noise] uh he kind of missing plane and I might be coming into a lot more money 'cause it fell to a child a wrongful death situation is um it's it's a long story\nAbout your mom\nMy mom she's out of the picture that

people in your situation more than any other addiction\nWe see we still she cocaine we still see 'em and we don't treat for that but we ended up helping them with their finances we still see alcohol and uh but gambling and sex are both adjust eggs the the\nPornography is a is a is gone crazy because of the Internet access and um uh it's affecting every part of our lives in good ways and bad ways with the access in this case is causing\nExcess and gets people in real trouble with gambling and porn sex addictions um\nSo you're you know you named off a couple of the right things and that's getting an essay getting in a um a an anonymous group I'm getting in a with a therapist as a second I Would do um\nThe third thing I Would do is um [noise] it it sounds to me like just a guy talking to a young guy and guy talking to a young guy that all of your family structure has gone it's just you didn't have it with your mom and then your dad died and so you you're just left without any authority\nStructure as a twenty year old young guy there's nobody in your life kind of standing over your shoulder this stump you when you grew up your life\nThat I Do have some family on my dad's side I'm actually a good way but\nThey know what's going on now so I Know\nThey were asked them problems going on like over a year ago a like a fact and that just a and I I never and whenever I tried it go than they kind of they were like cheesy oh you're just going to pick on there and I never had a track again okay with them so I just kind of put off the lesion\nYeah OK okay but that's fine so that there are no help is what you're saying yeah OK\nOr no help but they they they're they're good but I just I don't know how\nWell I Know that all behaviors obviously have a psychology involved um as a person of faith as a Christian I also believe behaviors or spiritual and show to treat something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half\nTreatment to treated only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be half treatment but um there there's something that you're obviously searching for\nAnd there's something that you're missing 'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I think it's like and just beyond lonely I don't know if it's that um but um [noise] I I I don't know honestly\nI think that's probably right that doesn't sound wrong how can I\nCan resonate with that I can imagine you being there in that situation and it's amazing you can be in one of the largest cities in the world and be lonely\nYou know but you can be it's very very real um this other last component I Would add to it um\nAnd you're asking me so you always get my opinion when you're asking me and that I'm an expert on my opinion [laughter] so ah what I Would tell you do is find a great church and will help you do that and and sit down and get past store oh counseling to go with your other counseling\nGet with some young guys in that church and become friends with some people who have some character\nHave some integrity and that are walking a straight line not perfect there isn't any perfect people over there are at that church ... churches got people and um so you can find that out pretty quick but you will find a book\nOr synagogue how no you're Jewish okay cool that's more effect then let's get one of the rabbi [noise] let's get the spiritual element of this going because there's a there's an aspect of that\nGoes with this and if that's your heritage and that's your your your faith than wonderful on by caused the Talmud has a lot to say about the issues that you're dealing with um a lot\nAnd um so yeah I that's the only thing I Know how to tell you though because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realizes just ruining your life\nAnd um you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is and you're finding this from the twelve steps is that one of the thing is you realize you're powerless and you know God has to step in and I've got to put your structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out uh do do some\nCareful psych self analysis and say well loneliness is the issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm fixing it inappropriately and so how do I fix it was more wisdom and that will be hanging out with good people\nUm that are lifting you up I'm obviously not hanging out with paid friends which doesn't work for anybody whatever version of paid to friends you have and yours is one of the more gross so um but that's you know that's one thing I Know how to\nTell you I I I Would make sure I'd really lean into getting a group of people around me that I can trust and if there's\nGroup of people that um are are working on a social project that is worthy and you got to get with a bunch of young men doing that and you had some good guys around you\nUm then that's very important I've got a group of guys I get with once a month I was with him last night as a matter of fact and I'm fifty eight um that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their twenties or the other day and we all encouraged them and they all agreed that they need a group of guys you ain't got\nA what my friends the the man's Bill Cosby band of brothers in your life\nA little off with you in these situations so I'm I'm man I'm just a guy I don't know how to help you and um I'll pray for him to tell you that and hold on I'll have a lot of things were going to send your coffee Mansfield ... book [noise] uh he's got a lot to say about this kind of stuff\nAnd then the man's man's builds manly men or whatever it's called and I'm just and you need some guys around you do that's what I'm thinking and and you need some spiritual had it as a component to this this is the day Ramsey show\nMoment and are they all said okay I'm with you I've had it to let's fix this so it was on a

properties or um you know how the just sort of cynical that and I'm not getting into too much debt\nOkay do you have um what is one of these rentals worse\n[laughter] well I'm One of the challenges that we face is that the rental properties are actually out of town and I'm I'm a military guy and\nWe're currently living in Dayton, Ohio when a rental properties or in Georgia in Virginia so I'm the
