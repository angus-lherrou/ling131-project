I'm a little hungry sure and so we went up to the break room and what did I Do Michael\nFrom the pizza but a few I thought you were a guy I thought holy cow Kim is going to eat pizza [laughter] and I was going to be higher and she was to hurt innocence you open the box when she was just showing somebody where the pizza\nOff [laughter] so I went to my office when I got an apple blame ah I Know [laughter] and it's really funny because I had to go get my annual checkup this past week and so I was with my mail\nDock and I'm like oh look at my ... pm and this this and this right and you're showing them the app on your phone yeah your doctor yes and I'm like look like sometimes you know it's forty for a good resting heart rate [laughter] what did you say it's a she always ours and she

you know what I couldn't even do it it's if it's a curse is what I'm telling you so anyway so the apple watch for\nThat I have right now that was the one where it'll tell people if you fall slip or slide myself a presentation\nYes and that it will get you know as an excel or Roman earning gyroscope they'll try to\nAnd so that you can hit a button which I think is fabulous you know then you can hit a button and be and then but it will also do an e CGI which is kind of like an e K tree okay\nBut you know that's where you're going to put and be able to put your finger on the dial and so you'll be able to get a in east CGI have your own you know because it doesn't work yet it hasn't been ruled out\nAnd so that's kinda lame I think of apple that I'm white my teeth and not get worse but they

maybe a spouse speak English but maybe the wife doesn't sure and we had a very very good communication because you can speak\nA ... taxed and gold and you can also get the scans all at the photo on ...\nWhich is great because then you can take a picture of something and wonder like you know what is that vehicle really do or what does that dying and say you know have you did you find that to be accurate\nI can be quite accurate the only that's ... yeah it was split proper names are of a ... a bit beyond that um you know it was absolutely true that they\nCan now if somebody were to tell you Susan ten years ago that you'd be able to go to Finland and have this technology right at your fingertips [noise]\nWould you believe them now I Would have been given back slid\nI Know isn't it crazy it's just now coming soon is that we're going to actually have translation a ear pots and so that this way if you have your ... and\nSomebody speaking Spanish is that it's going to automatically translate in your ear and English so you're going to hear it in your language of choice\nSay if you have your ... and somebody's speaking Spanish is that it's going to automatically translate in your ear into English so you're going to hear it in your language of choice which is just amazing so you know if you haven't already and thank you so much for your call today Susan letting everybody know you know that it really does work I mentioned I've used it recently and France and\nIt worked without a hitch and save me several times looking at the menu saying\nWhat is it that I can actually eat on this menu and I was able to with my phone be able to figure it all out to the once again thank you for your call\nLet's talk a little bit about the ... my favorite printer my printer of choice you can learn more right now at ... dot com slash ego take him at the model number is a forty seven fifty enough in the box to print up to eleven thousand color pages\nLearn more apps and dot com slash ego tank Kim epson exceed your vision\nRight haven't as far as TV is one of the great benefits of modern technology but when you're a teeny connects to the Internet it becomes vulnerable\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay\nBecause I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to this is what you appreciate this is what you're thankful for you know if they had a great time they're happy to do that\nAnd you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before you say you know can you up on line and\nJust kept coming up in there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now outweighing the negative reviews\nOkay okay so that's the ... the other hand you've had the gate and let me finish the\nOther thing you can do is with health grades as drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have heard that when you do this then health grades will remove it health grades also has a program called recognize\nDr status and that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay [noise] um there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam I get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business you'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service can do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to accentuate that positive okay\nIn tune to work with search engine optimization and to learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say oh for five thousand dollars we'll put you at the top of the Google Search results pet well right\nAll right well you know you can be at the top of the Google Search results right now and it's not going to cost you a lot of money because you can do a cost per click campaign so somebody types and whatever your medical profession is in your town within the ZIP codes\nHe maybe pay ten cents for every click but you're not going to be at the bottom of page you're not going to be on page too so you start thinking of different ways that you can market your business instead of putting that money and depending upon somebody else to quote unquote get rid of the bad stuff on line\nOkay because that makes sense for us to say um I I Do promote\nLike customers to try to help them to go on and put on a positive review forest\nThey're like a should I Try to at a pet or something\nLike that and that's and rank and then say they do it here now\nYeah you put a pan right there exactly ah that's really smart\nAnd number you know and you could have a former they fill out you know positive and then they check a box that says this this can\nKnow and this goes up to health grades or whatever it may be but the other thing too is you can have a basket their gift basket\nThis is this can you know this goes up to health grades\nOr whatever it may be but the other thing too is you can have a basket there a gift basket and every thirty days we pick a winner from that gift basket okay\nSo we pick a winner from somebody who did who left a positive review or somebody who left in ... review for us\nAnd so and that's that can be on that little cart or that can be on the printed receive that can be part of the email confirmation or the text that that they get confirming appointments and you know so you start to you know sit down and just\nMake a list of all the different touch points that you have with that particular customer\nAnd then think of different ways that you can give them an incentive\nYou know maybe they write a negative review that's okay if you learn something from it you know you move on you make itself better but ... and you start telling them what you want and that's the thing about people most people want to help you most people are really good nature\nBut they may not know that this is what you need and so if you tell them at least four times 'cause the average person as a here's something four times before they act\nAs that hopefully they get in there and do that now if for some reason this doesn't work and thirty days and want you to give me a call back and we'll go to the next level but I think you'll find that people\nWill give you that review as long as you ask for and thank you for your call or let's talk about one of our great sponsors
