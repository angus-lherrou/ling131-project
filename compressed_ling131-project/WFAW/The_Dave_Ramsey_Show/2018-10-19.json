I Would pay that off and I would hold twenty bucks for an emergency and put to rest as your down payment if I were in your shoes I Would not buy a house with the still laying around I think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble and so on\nAnd so my vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't know I honestly I don't know why she would answer to listen to makes now let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never\nBorrow money again\nOkay yes I have a track to talk to her about that I'm actually a new is and I'm trying to get her on board mhm she's not really to come veins about also having trouble getting her on board with the plan as well\nYou know I can imagine so um I I highly recommend you don't do anything until you can come into agreement\nI mean you don't do anything\nUntil you can come into agreement\nOkay because you're going to make a mistake when you what Sharon and I when we have an argument like this we uh we have to we have a rule we have to do nothing until we can come into agreement\nOn large purchases large gifts large decisions we decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement\nAnd uh so I I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial peace university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to her mother trying to help me out just because she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well\nAh well I don't want to ask what I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial base university to the nine lessons and if I give you the one year membership\nYes sir you think so why she fresh rubber\nI think that me and my me and her mind would sit down with her and explain to her um\nGo to the house it's free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you\nOK because if you go by yourself or the cause of divorce is you're going to get more and more and more and more\nExcited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and you it's going to drive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two glasses with you I think she'll go on and go to the others I'm pretty ... but ah but\nDon't go by yourself to cause problems hold on I'll have Kelly pick up I'll give you the financial ... membership for a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else\nUm but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is All right Dave is with us in Stockton, California Hi Dave how are you\nOh good afternoon Dave how you doing today\nAbout her than I deserve what's up\nWell that that's good faith um both my wife and I are at Pew coordinators how we treat get free\nAnd we need

probably see the money again okay um\nWhy would you do that you're ...\nYou know what that's a good question that's a good question I maybe it's because I haven't ... for about a year and I lost touch with every I live that aspect of it but um we volunteer to pay for the true they take a class which they did\nBut in the end they didn't just from the ... all kinds of goals and Henri building ... and ...\n... well after six months we decided it's been the one kind of make pay us back anything we kind of let them you know we weren't alone and me more money\nBecause he had made no effort to to reimburse anything of it and and there was no communication to indicate me on her famous back well you know as life goes several months later they're only ... down and um and it could not be repaired and my son had no way to get to work\nAnd this is where it gets sticky let 'em knowing that my wife had to take care of her parents trustworthy dispersion funds to all the fisheries including him we both agreed to front about Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding that he would\nImmediately pay us back when the checks or in some of the logical is it they were ... they were already keep your empire or parents trash\n'em as it today we have not distributed that many but it's getting it's getting a little stick here here is going to be distributed next couple of weeks we wouldn't do what you do in the meantime and leave and they took out I'm a five or a eight thousand dollar loans to pay off for months of over ...\nThe other way they'd be um evicted and I got her life if there's not one of the work to help out [laughter]\nSo my English ... mirrors and because they have not demonstrated responsibility and came back yard alone I have strongly suggested ... and I I think that's about as far as that goes this is my way I'd\nThat my wife write the check to them having come over and sided oh gosh and we would write them a check and balance to come up with the bottom of much of it we didn't we didn't find them and it seems simple and we know if we approach it that way that would be successful\nAnd what eliminated the temptations and using the ... and this

behind the strike first\nBut I think there's a bigger problem under the Bible says out of the abundance of this\nBut I think there's a bigger problem Linda\nThe Bible says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks\nWhat's going on inside of you causes you to choose the words that\nYou you ... you need to stop talking like you were talking\nI allowed myself to fall into the credit card game no you didn't you walk straight up signed up for the card there was no falling you're\nNot a victim you walk straight up and signed up for stupid and you did it on purpose own it I've done a lot dumber than you've done ghetto but I'll walk straight up and signed up for stupid and as long as I\nBlame the government or I blamed amino banker I blame the IRS or I blame the economy I was not getting any better and I did I sat around and wind like it was a former like I was a form of prayer\nBut you got to own it you didn't fall\nInto credit card that you ever say I was forced to buy a car well bull crap you are not\nNo one's ever forced you to do anything they didn't have a gun at the car dealerships by car I'm going to shoot you there was no collusion there was no extortion you weren't forced to buy a car you want to freaking car and you rationalize the crowd out of it\nStop lying to yourself it's one of the steps you have to take to get your lives straightened out\nSo you didn't allow yourself to fall you walk straight up and signed up for stupid\nSay it like it is and it'll help you in the healing process I Know because I had to go through the same thing to me knows what does your New Jersey I mean how are you\nHey Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nOr hurt us all thanks for taking my call 'em my question is I'm I'm a ... actually the first one um I I make about forty to forty five ... a year\nOr I bought a family of four and I ... for the postal service they have and get a loan debt of like um about Fifteen thousand dollars [noise]\nAnd um [noise] I have two friends one of them and I'm asking me to go for a business or like a friend um subway business so I was thinking about taking a loan for that and my other friend if I'm\nAll for me like to go buy a house with him to the share like a two family house so I take one apartment he takes the other and it's going to be of course with a mortgage loan to so I wanted to know what should I Do\n[laughter] mhm mhm\nWell we tell folks don't have to borrow money around here if you listen to the show very much the shortest path to wells and peace in your finances is to avoid that and on top of that I Would tell you to avoid partnerships as the only ship that won't show\nShow 'em what that means is that if you still want to remain friends with both these guys I Would suggest to say no because at the end of the stories are nightmare\nGoing in partners with somebody in debt to go into the restaurant business would you do know squat about is a good way to end up bankrupt and lose your friendship forever going in partners for somebody to buy a house\nAnd then he doesn't pay is half or campaign is now for you don't pay your for camp by your house is a precursor to the ending of our friendship and a foreclosure\nShown no I wouldn't do either one of those\nAnd that's my reasoning I think you I have a lot better life have you avoid both of those paths and you can you can develop a career path that does not involve you're going into debt to start a business it's a matter of fact most businesses start without that\nThey just start small we started this one without dead on card table my living room we didn't have a big fancy studio we went down in the local radio station drove over there and they let us use their stuff because we work for free there\nWow you figure out a way to get going and you what we call bootstrap it and it works but you don't have to go get an SBA loan and go deeply in debt to buy a subway franchise in order to be in business that some mythology Thomas is one of those in Philadelphia Hi Thomas how're you\nDave thank you very much for taking my call sure what's up I'm I just\nGraduated with a degree in actuarial science back in may wow and I'm working at McDonald's making nine dollars an hour\nWhy I I've been applying I'm applying and I just I Can't find a job and I don't know what to do [noise] mhm [noise]\nWell I I Would assume that the primary job before that would be an insurance company is correct\nYeah I I've [noise] through me and my last year of school I got very turned off the actuarial science so I've been applying to finance jobs and I can't get anything because every one kid everyone on China have experience and\nI don't have the experience and I I graduated early so I did I did summer classes and\nThey can't get internships hospitals mhm so what kind what kind of Lance real job or you tried into\nFinancial analyst financial I'm like I've I've been\nEven doing accounting like accounts payable and ... you know entry\nLevel stuff mhm oh you do is get your foot in the door I'm OK well\nHere's here's one thing I Will tell you and Ken Coleman will tell you this is will go to the Ken Coleman show dog Tom and download his free PDF on how to put together a resume but resumes in applications\nWithout relationship are useless\nUm I'll give you an example uh we have eight hundred people here just under a hundred people work on our team we hired a hundred and fifty to two hundred last year we had Fifteen thousand the applications for those honored hires you get lost in that\n... and it is there's not that I don't wanna answer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people it's just a logistically not reasonable\nAnd show what ends up happening is you get lost in the stack of that stuff unless you know someone that works there and you don't have to be best friends with them you just 'cause I got to tell you we don't ever hire somebody because somebody calls me and says Hiram ever but we would give them an interview\nAnd pull their pulled their resume out of the stack\nYou got to get out of the pile you know and so some of these places you're trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that's married\nA kid plays soccer where the guy that works over there or something like that where you can find someone that will put in a little bit of a word for you to at least get the door open and that'll get you\nSomething like that where you can find someone that are put in a little bit of a word for you to at least get the door open and that'll get you in the door again you're you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact there are very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your hired an almost never happens that'll decent job\nAnyway are hiring this bodies you can get on with something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview and learn about trees and and that would be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a higher but we will at least talk to them\nAnd you know what might be a very short conversation no you don't qualify and setting or looking for but at least we'll talk to them and get their resume out of the pie oh\nIf somebody knows I'm Sorry go download that and let's see if we can tell them to show he'll help you with all this stuff is very very difficult out there but I think you can land some\n[noise]\nYeah well you know you wonder I Know I mean you might foreign fishing doesn't you know your payments\n[laughter] look into this ... story very well done thank you very well not well you did exactly what I tried to get doctors to do most dogs come out and go\nFinally worked all this time I've gone to school my whole life mhm I deserve\nA new house in a new car I deserve a trip mhm and they spend money like water you've seen them do it oh yeah definitely and I it's crazy understood all you do would you use kept living like a broke college student\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years out because that was really the easiest time to do it\nAnd so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I thought yeah 'cause\nNow I I mean you make three hundred four hundred and five hundred wherever you make it you're going to be unbelievably weapon so you said your how thirty thirty one thirty want\nOh we'll just fabulous income congratulations I guess I'm so proud of you who was your biggest cheerleader I Know you had to have good tractors that was easy yeah but who was the biggest cheerleader or I Would\nSay my parents or my mom had followed you for years and also people in my church family as well because they I talk a lot of them are encouraging me to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nYeah yeah so I mean you went from being completely crushed by student loan debt to completely on them it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't\nReally have an other planets I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later I mean the final payment\nYeah you probably know almost two hundred thousand a year for two years mhm Minnesota race you are on which is pretty incredible\nBut you're making four Fifteen minus taxes which takes a big chunk of it so you weren't living you weren't you weren't charging on anything now are you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging and just completely lean to show as you're going lawyer you're hitting this thing\nWhen you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah Fifteen to twenty month only given month\nAt what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this is actually going to work how far in war you before the before kind of the switch kind of flip for you\nWell I paid off all the smallest loans first I had a total of twenty different student loans and so I was able to attack the smallest ones first and then once I saw how easy it was to do that\nAnd then I started to have some more hope that I Would be able to pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I had just looked at it and I was like there was no way like those I'm not going to be able to do this\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking them off the little baby ones when you first started yeah\nAnd that yeah but I had to give you a lot of emotional boost deaf and it was that snowball really kicked in for you than they did what he was supposed to do that let you know that this was going to work mhm wow wow wow wow wow wow All right so what is the big takeaway when someone says\nOh I I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't get out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this\nI think the most important thing is just to stop burning from it stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never get out of debt and I once I face it and once I took personal responsibility for it and realized that um\nSo I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never get out of debt and I once I face it and once I took personal responsibility for it and realized that I'm the one who signed the papers ... you know I Need to get myself out uh then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money\nAnd they are their income as much less sure didn't know what mine is bad learn most people's\n[laughter]\nYeah I definitely learned how to live on a budget that for my parents and also um they had been in quite a bit of a credit card that in the past they always told me you know don't be stupid with credit card and I'm In ... smart purchases and so I think I learned a lot of those principles and then\nYou know there was a there was a sense a character that came from them that they cause you to be able to do this is what I was thinking\nYeah very good very good well I'm proud of you know they are well done very well done what a great great story well we've got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired that's the next
