council\nOpportunities present themselves and every\nPerson that was\nIn your community\nOr your opportunity to be here force reserve\n\n\n\nJerry's with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Sherrie ... show they they have a great how much I'm about thirty thousand dollars maybe a little bit more depending on how fast is love it yeah\nOnly work hard to figure out what we have one last one left over ... ... down on our house mhm\nI'm probably going to cut off that we've got our emergency finally started finding retirement and we have time girls that are nine years old now and then their college fund or if we could pay off\nOn the other congressmen on the house at the ... on\nHow much is that the ... percent I'm about thirty thousand years at all with a dog okay and what your interest rate on your home oh for sure it about market there and you are a hundred percent sure that thirty thousand dollars will cause the the amount of be dropped\nPopulated out it'll be thirty one bound than we have we have the money to do it\nFor the thirty thousand dollars will cause the amount of be dropped\nPopulated about thirty one involving hot will have the money to have a ...\nYeah and you can argue confirming that with the mortgage company prior to doing it obviously you're not going to send them the money\nRight now we want to make sure that the ... going away okay and PMS costing you've watched\n... hours and hide her and her mom crown on or a hundred and Ninety nine dollars and crop that\nHousehold income\nOr around and play with a hundred thousand\nOkay here here's what you here's where you are in our baby steps and you probably already know this but let's review show our other listeners are caught up you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement orange you correct yes\nBaby steps for five is kids college the Sixers payoff files fairly so really the question is where we can put this on five or we'll put this on six there's\nNot I mean ... there's not a dumb or wrong answer here either one is fine whatever makes you feel good whatever's good idea I'm I'm probably going to take twenty thousand of this and put ten each in five twenty nine pounds for these girls\nCome you're getting your college sneaking up on you fast\nAnimal throw the other ten at the house um and then I'm gonna system and then I'm going to set up a monthly amount to add to the ten beginning of the first of the year so that they ... are kind of on auto pilot and so you're going to put you know ten thousand and plus a hundred bucks a month each or something like that not in my\nRoom and I do want a ... year old male\nAnd then you know then we can just spread it around but however you want to do it but ... I Want to put a substantial amount orange college and then you make enough\nTo be able to just beat on this mortgage pretty rapidly but six hundred dollar a year or return on a thirty one thousand dollar investment is not that great\nBut\nYeah so I'm going to start the kids' college and then I'm going to just start paying off the house the natural result and working your baby steps Sixers you're going to get down below the pay him when I get that dropped but then you're just gonna keep beating on the house to after that and it's going to go away completely so\nGood question it's an interesting analysis to discuss it with you and talk talk it through well it's the first day of the month can you believe October's here\nMan a man on their own into a store this weekend is full of

connects to your bank account and the two of you both have access to both of you put it on your phone and put it on your desktop whatever and\nNo matter where you are in the world she can look at the budget and you can look at the budget as long as you get Internet access\nAnd they'll show and and then you ... you can obviously disgusted by phone or email or whatever else you want to do [noise] um but you've got to just lay out a game plan that encompasses your expenses there in San Antonio which should be very minimal because I'm guessing you're on base housing right\nNear on base food right yes you\nDo you shouldn't have any expenses if your families back home trying to get out of debt you know your ship and all the money home right yeah\nAnd so are most of it I mean but you you just basically don't get a small miscellaneous allowance and then the rest of us going home for the baby for the kids and for the get out of that plan or whatever you're working back there but they um the ...\nThe you know every dollar plus allows you to follow exactly any expenditures that she makes and vice versa because you're dealing off one bank account and we pushed that through that way so\nNow we're left one of the oh I'm Sorry if they're not going to go into\nIt it's one of the issues that I'm having with is a you know it's just kind of explaining how small details of why I feel like you know\nShe gets that feels secure and\nStopping heroin Batman starve while one K. or or are collect taxes or anything like that and ah\nWell that's not an issue on how to budget apart that's an issue of wearing the agreement on what we're going to do right these are different issues so I mean the\nBudgeting apart things much easier to solve them that won the two of you deciding you're going to get

ago I think between eighty them about eight and I'm sure you're still come up from ... to one twenty five during that time of year Jerry impressions are very cool so then okay you've made the decision were on the same page then what happened to\nMake a budget and it kind of\nIt was I felt constricted up first and then I kept listening to your show and it's like an almost like gave me permission to spend money and I felt safe and spend money it wasn't like oh this is going to cost me a night on the couch and so like okay we're on the same page and I felt the acting more and when I found is happy
