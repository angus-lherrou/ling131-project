and the reason I'm calling because I have to talk about bankruptcy so my wife and I combined we have about a hundred and thirty four thousand dollar than that I'm\nA hundred thousand new student loan and the balance will be a credit card debt we recently met with a financial adviser and they suggested that we filed for bankruptcy because it would take a long time to pay off the bat\nThey suggested that saying that it would be better for us to start fresh and I just wanted a second opinion of\nWhat is your household income sure\nOh combined it's about eighty five\nOkay you have any car debt\n... mhm I'm no we don't our cars are paid off okay what are your car's worth\nUm\nI Would say about twenty thousand combined okay All right\nWell here's the fact that the quote unquote financial advisor to know um apparently or he wouldn't have given you such stupid but advise student loans are not bankrupt double\n\nYeah we did talk about that during the conversation they never go away but he was thinking in terms of the amount of credit card that we have\nFound them are really really have a lot of men and women there's more on the suggested your bankrupt with thirty four thousand dollar for the credit card debt with a household income of eighty five thousand\nThat's absurd dude that's what I was thinking\nThat's absurd because the ... the the hundred thousand dollars for a student loan doesn't change anything because it's going to be there regardless modeling reputable so we're dealing with you're going to file bankrupt jumped thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five no you should pay it off in one year\nAnd a year yeah one year live on fifty\nPay it off in one year take six extra jobs shell so much stuff you can't breathe you know eating out no vacations and you're a hundred percent debt free in one year\nWhat are your car's worth\nNo eating out no vacations and you're a hundred percent debt free in one year what are your car's worth\nYeah of course the corner OK each\nUm her a newer ... older so proud of ours are working are hers is worth what about Thirteen thousand mine of about ...\nMhm okay\nWell um you can do what you want to do I if I woke up in your shoes I have to tell you I've worked with families that were in dire straits over the years that were forced into bankruptcy you're not one of those if\nYou choose to file bankruptcy because you're too did you I'm lazy to address the situation\nLet's say even say you did it over two years it's only Seventeen five a year and your debt free other than your student loan which I'm not talking about the student loans will be gone in one year I'm Talking about the credit card debt to be going in one year so how fast\nIn normal people that called uh Dave Ramsey show that work our plan pay off a hundred and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five about four years probably\nAbout four years yeah\nThat's the normal routine for people around here that would be student loans and everything and uh you know I I Would not move down in car initially\nOut of your wife's car into a into a six thousand dollar or five thousand dollar car initially I might end up doing that as we go along we'll see how it goes what do you do for a living sir\nI'm operations manager\nI'm okay and what does she do for a living to the past there okay All right cool um does she ever do any outside speaking for money\nI'm no windows wedding for about a gun or does she do speaking Miami fishy speak on Sunday mornings\nYeah see that's very very different under okay All right\nI mean I Wonder if if you know she might feel do some ... occasionally for somebody that was ill or on sabbatical or something in that congregation pay or a little bit or maybe she works in an evangelist to outrage and they pay you are a little bit for speaking skills\nOr maybe dot dot dot you do something I don't know I mean if you add ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation\nOf income and you guys tightened down your budget and nothing I mean nothing where you have no life because we're going to clean this mess up you know you can clean up the whole thing in four years maybe three but four for sure uh any\nClear up those student loans really really really fast as part of that equation I'm Sorry though that credit card debt as a part of that equation really really fast but you got to cut them up you've got to quit using them and you've got to stop living the way you've been living there was just not working agreed\nOn his way does that make sense yeah something like that yeah\nThe Bible says that no discipline seems pleasant at the time but it yields harvest of righteousness you guys make good money so I Know you're not stupid people you're not dumb move\nYour not dump you just been doing some dumb things which makes you just like most of it was added a lot of dumb things in my life dude I'm with money in particular has high end up teaching is 'cause I got a PHD in the UN be but um you know how to I don't know who it was it gave you this advice but you need to stay away from them because they gave you really\nReally bad advice that's my opinion I think you could not only can work through this I think you should work through this I think it'll be a testimony to God's power and you're all his life that you turn this around\nAnd that you attack at an attack at an attack at and that you can start having a sense of self control the sense of discipline and it'll change your marriage on communication levels in lower the stress when you're working the plan together\nAnd you can do anything how old are you guys\nUh two twenty a town I just turned thirty two\nExcellent show when you're thirty six and she's thirty two year debt free as I feel\n\nSo you're saying there's no life no vacation with no eating out\nFor a short period of time for a short period of time you live like no one else\nSo that later you can live and give like no one else thinking about well how ... how much money you would have and how well the you could become and how generous you could be if you didn't have any payments right now\nOh my gosh\nI think about the piece that wouldn't be in your house the stress that would be gone so it's worth it to pay a price to win but there's a price to be paid to do as brushing beside you got your own home and you don't get out of\nA whole lot jumping out usually you climb out scratching and clawing\nPool and dirt under your fingernails you know what I'm saying you can do this man I'll help you I'll help you don't want you to go through our

it and continue to make a payment on it it's not completed well we're at a point in me paint and flooring\nCompleted well we're at a point I mean I paint and flooring and you're living in it no no um well we were living in a mobile home and\nBut then we got offered to live in the house basically for free and he paid ... here and take care of it\nI got that far okay so that's ... so you've never lived in this other house known okay it's gonna be a little tough to sell it and the conditions than yeah like I Can't get financing on it right and so you're going to take a whipping\nA what will it take money wise to finish it\nUm [noise]\nWell I've never had a professional answer on that but probably ate at\nA thousand ten thousand dollar yeah and what is your household income um well my hand then he worked forty hours a week what her household income\n[laughter]\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year\nOkay so your husband's the only one working well we haven't been here um that doesn't make it out and running but it doesn't make money\nGiven comments about twenty five thousand and then that makes about Fifteen thousand nearly okay and then getting the care taking condition or there'll be making about forty eight hundred cash but we get housing for free\nYeah I got that part until you get into if he decides he doesn't want you to care take anymore and then you don't have housing for free anymore\nThat time so I mean you walk into more and fire you pretty much I changed my mind and then you you have a housing issue again right nice\nSo um you have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring as it is\nUm [noise] well we had to pay you know and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand\nThat smart completed so probably a hundred and eighty hundred and twenty five\nNo no not if it's not completed it won't know um because ... it's a\nFurther discount and the cost it takes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer cannot\nBothers house\nOkay because they don't have any money and they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on this house and so that\nLimits your in but they didn't limit your selling pool to investors and they're going to discount that I'm a lot deeper than that if you get a hundred out of there should be flying I'm thinking so um [noise] how much should we borrowed against it so far\nAbout how the south we owe thirty thousand but they're from property attached to a\nA hundred thousand\nYou owe a hundred thousand against the house and the property yeah\nWhich would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if you sold the property is well\nYes okay All right\nYeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars in an additional loan\nAnd get this house finished and let's get it so as soon as possible\nAnd then just continued tanning mine in Cali yeah\nYeah we all have you know you should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm not a time but you're going to get a little money out of it so you know it it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that right yeah\nYou've got way too many hours in this house and and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here right you'll get a little bit but it's not it is it's not worked out very good so you know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm gonna tell you as you guys need to look at your incomes\nBecause your household income as you I'm very very low\nAnd ah so I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime but um yeah I Would get that house finished up I'm saving scratching and clawing painting and [noise]\nYou know if you borrow three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's let's try and get it sold as fast as possible now is the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land without selling the house in order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first\nSell a pig showing acre also corner use that money to finish the house then get the house so that way there's no more debt involved\nIs with us in Lexington high Olivia how are you\n[noise] cobalt hire you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] and I had a question and her head can African amount of debt and and I'm wanting to pay that off the air that right [laughter] and then I saw in recovery for an addiction and an idea that it's going to the show\nAnd I ... ... budget and\nPet therapy at the end it's likely not going to get paid and how kind of the quake that I'm not really sure way to pay in the budget [noise] or how big of a priority like\nHow long you been clean and have any kind of\nGood for you well known what is it\n[noise] um actually show or whatever\nYou know can write well no I'm not going to therapy on hold right now there's just something you need you need some accounts for a walk with you as you finish this life transformation and that that is essential to you having a life would you agree with that statement yeah [laughter] now\nWhat I Would do is is number one it's not a permanent situation\nUm the therapies not permanent it's not going to be there the rest of your life\nFifty years from now you're not going to still be going to the therapist okay I Hope I'm and then uh otherwise they're just not very good [laughter] but ah and so at some point you'll you'll pull back from that\nAnd the second thing will happen is is that as you continue to address your income and you're out go you're going to find ways to make more income and as you have more emotional healing\nYou're going to feel more energized to make more income\nAnd so if this month you don't pay any extra on the debt but you pay your therapy good\nIf next month the same thing happens okay but by this time next year we ought to be making more money\nLet's do something let's kick our life in gear and let's start to clean up the mess to but for today Seventy five whole day's you've been clean\n[noise] that's a great start by but it's not like you told me he'd been clean for two years mhm by the time you calling for two years we ought to be have different having a different conversation about the money would that make sense to you [laughter] so let's get Hugh healed and then let's see who your money\nAnd as you and it's not going to be suddenly like a switch flip Hugo OK I'm OK Now getting the money no it's not like all or not\nAnd as you go and it's not going to be suddenly switch flips undergo OK I'm OK not getting the money no smog all or nothing it's coming gradual it'll be incremental\nYou'll feel better you you know when you're Ninety Days or your four months you ought to feel different than you feel right now and you ought to be able to do more and make more in just save more and more and\nYou know you you all have more focus on the money 'cause you'll be more healed and have to spend less severe emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting through this is that right\n[laughter] okay well I Want you to finish turning the corner you've turned the corner once you're finished turned the corner and let's let's gone out and then as you make incremental progress\nMove more and more than money from your new income and your increased income to\nShop for today we want to take care of a movie you need to be taken care of\nWhich part of the Ramsey solutions network on serious XM Radio it's also a pod cast too so look it up the Ken Coleman show\nAnd you learn a lot more about that kind of stuff open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Brian is with us in Pittsburgh Hi Brian how are you\nI'm doing great thanks so much for being there today because she had it\nOn or how can I help sir [noise] uh well\nUh two years ago my family was very your lobby and we did a debt free screen and a and then I feel like we've really been left to you know the ... opened up for our income is doubled and why a lot of really positive spiritual or you know directions that have opened up to us\nUm and those are you know that those things but we really thought it was sort of a recovery is opening up because we are starting to do things right and really what I see now is that he was preparing to throw it was what was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months [noise]\nAnd uh our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh well right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church and or just getting to the part oil ah we're working on oils and so because we have this special needs a issue we we get involved or attorney and getting our wheels together good and through that conversation we ah you\nKnow I'm a we've been discussing a special needs ...\nWill that have to play in planning for our baby future yeah your animal\n... sure uh originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs ... kind of functions the way that the other boys have a college fund in baby steps five\nUm the uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special condition special rules because of course ah you know his\nHis teachers are boring it's too early to know what is your fully what we've been blessed but he's he's healthy developing well you know there's this guy to limit for him just like anyone mhm um and we don't have to uh\nUh you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations but uh but now as far as I'm getting into it and we haven't find anything quite yet but it's coming down to the wire why things on my comfortable with is that you know if I start investing any money or finding Charles I I lose control of that to the track that we've named and\nWhile while I trust the truck the and I believe it go with I Wish that makes me uncomfortable no you don't you don't need a special\nNeeds trust unless both of you die right the special needs trust does not need to be funded prior to your dad okay so that\nThat was on it sounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay\nAnd it's not I wouldn't even have it formed accept upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want to he was alive as long as one of us alive to manage your assets one of the things you're going to do is care\nFor this child who out of those assets now ... ... when the trust is needed is if both of you die it gives the trustee me the\nThe the the direction on how to handle the assets and disperse them to take care of this child's needs\nAnd um and what that needs to be is a a big hairy term life insurance policy that ... that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs trust or a portion of the policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of the policy and the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust\nIn the event that both of you die kind of a thing in the primary beneficiary is your wife okay but then past that the secondary beneficiary is\nThey have to both of you die kind of a thing in the primary beneficiary is your wife okay but then past that the secondary beneficiary is\nSome portion would go while you've got minor children into a family trust to take care of the minor children your oldest two until they get them through college the other portion would go into the special needs trust to perpetually care for this other child throughout life\nNot just through college and so it's a larger amount needed to do that and then what happens is let's say we fast forward Twenty years\nAnd this child is Twenty years old and you've got a million and a half dollars and mutual funds okay then your other children are grown and gone or close Twenty years from now right\nThat's a dream the dream that\nLaw yeah we're kicking them out so they're going [laughter]\nThat's the legacy baby [laughter] but it's out of that than what we've got is we've got you know some portion of my million and a half dollars in my example is gonna be parked in the special needs trust in the event both you and your wife or to pass the\nRest of it would go to your ... more traditional Irish directly to her but you know we put a million dollars in a in in the the youngest child ... special needs trust at Twenty years old because he's going to need care and that's a thousand dollars a year it will produce that'll take care of him and maybe one of his brothers is the trustee\nBy ban you know would you what you had like we're doing right now would you form the trust of the legal entity known now and we've been unfunded or would not let it would have put make a caught in the well why not why would I Would just\nMake it a clause in the will to be formed upon both of your deaths okay because you don't need it now you don't need to be filing tax returns for the next twenty five years on this thing\nYou don't need a screw that all the time you don't need to go to all the legal expense to form the trust so let me give you another example okay special needs ... as I as a special conditional\nVersion of just taking care of minor children right then the differences that might be perpetual okay but you know my children grew up\nAnd moved out on her own their own so my need for a trust to cover my minor children in\nA in a live in both of our best expire\nForms a trust for my minor children at that time he had never need for that expired\nAnd I would have done it for nothing in this case as ... you're going to need to trust that\nI wouldn't be doing it until you die mess when\nYou're on the mom's house and the ... that's what I Would do whatever you want and that's that's how we do\nI get asked all the time about what people need to do to improve their families money situation to the most overlooked things are term life insurance and disability insurance both plans to make sure that you have income to pay bills\nAnd take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen for term life you need to carry ten to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families stay away from cash value our return a premium plans there just a rip off\nDisability insurance is just as critical how are you going to pay your bills you if you're unable to work disability is the leading cause of bankruptcies foreclosures\nThat's why I send you to Zander insurance they've been helping my listeners find the right plans at the lowest cost for almost Twenty years called eight hundred three five six Seventeen
