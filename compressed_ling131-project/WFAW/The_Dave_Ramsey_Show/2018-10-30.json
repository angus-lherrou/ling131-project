get\nAt twenty thousand every four years in a large line\nTwenty over four years and it's a four year old program I've taken a hair dye and what does it cost ... nearly okay of which you have five\nHere so we need eight yes our plus you need to eat yeah there's that detail right where are you living with friends family what\nI'm living where frankly I bought a house out in the country because it's cheaper\nYou and some friends were roommates okay and so you have rent\nAnd electricity or share and you have food and you need to get out and you need eight thousand dollars a year\n[laughter] okay so when we add all of that up what does your rent and other stuff cost you a month\nIt cost me about nine out looking out my dad and I work\nMinimum wage and things like clean and they don't have anything like that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nMhm okay All right so let's let's kind of had that up then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that and an eight eight thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other are probably some books some stuff too but we're pretty close there so twenty thousand dollars a year is what you need to earn\nTheir and minimum wage doesn't do that [laughter] sounds like you need a new job\n[noise] and I have an opportunity to start a whole failing family name brand claiming and and now I don't have the money to pay up right now\nNo don't need to get into that you have a job you need a job you need to so you can make more you can make 'em Fifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and ...\nYou can make\nGood money cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour ten dollars an hour cleaning houses I'm walking dogs or other stuff so I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage\nAnd by the way you make enough to work your way through with the numbers that you and I are discussing here I'm In um you are gonna be working all the time though\nAnd if you but if you can get a situation like that the semi self employed where you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever um and you\nUh\nYou can control your time and you can make more money you can control when you work and how much you work now you are going to struggle because you're going to work and study and go to class\nAnd that's all you're going to do what you can make it if you do that the other thing I Would\nDo is I Would apply for a bunch of scholarships the third thing I Would do is investigating some of the hospital companies that are out there\nParticularly in your immediate area talk to the nursing school and see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school how much of the nursing they would pick up for you\nOkay kinda been indentured servants type program if you've ever heard of those\nAnd I married a hospital that actually planning on working at an ... they won't forget all life like it that way but in fact body\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now and let them just pay for it and now\nOkay rather than have to pay you back for student loans because I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with the maps were you in are doing here\nSo I Want you to apply for a hundred more scholarships you'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps the situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you couldn't control all the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with this hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but\nYou you sound like you are to me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old and it sounds to me like you're a rock star\nThinking and so I don't think you need to play beer pong his real\nHot [laughter]\nI I think you don't mind working and and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out with this with you know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars a student loan that you don't need to it\nBut you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this and the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable Andrew tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career\nIn terms of employment you will be able to get employed instantaneously I'm mean nursing is just there's always a shortage\nSo you're going to do very very well but I Would go talk to that they'll talk to the hospital administrator at the local hospital just set up an appointment with them and just walk in there like you own the place\nIs a kind of like you can do that and uh\nJust tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work their house at work and how can you help me get through school because I don't want a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a statistic and you know get get him impressed with you and and let him help you be a hero in your story and a him or her that hospital administrator\nWho by the white needs nurses so they're going to be very intentioned\nAre very very inclined towards helping someone in your position especially someone who walks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on\nAnd um you know get\nGet some people on your side helping you accomplish this um this task lives in front of you but you're on your way you're doing really good congratulations very proud to talk to you call me back if you need help as you're fighting through this Greg is with us from Milwaukee Hi Greg how are you\n[noise] Dave thank you for taking my call how are you today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I just have a question for you I'm On a way out our I've talked polio and get your opinion on a couple of things here [noise] um my wife and I don't have any at all with the exception all\nOf our house [noise] um we do a lease our cars\nAnd [noise] um [noise] we do that um I have a customer and that and a good client of mine that I reciprocate or the money that they spend with me back with them so it's kind of a win win situation [noise] um for both of us here [noise] the\nMain question that I have is we have um [noise] some investments 'em over a hundred thousand dollars with\nUm she will off IRAs and some mutual funds and that type of thing uh she has four one K. I. of four one K. or she is a bench and I'm ... and right now we are paying above and beyond our mortgage I'm bought our house by a ball\nActually it's a pension I'm SOL and right now we are paying above and beyond our mortgage I'm On our house by about ten to twenty percent and and putting that toward the house with the amount of investments that we have diversified\nCompared to what we're putting into our houses is that the right formula\nWe tell folks to put Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement once you're dead free except the house and have your emergency fund and above Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement and your debt free except your emergency fund then I Will put everything above\nThat towards the house until the house is paid off\nSo I took your income sounds point one five [noise]\nMake sure the total of all the Roth IRAs four one\nK. constitution you're doing is equal to that enough right or the math is greater than that fact some of the contributions download them best to throw the balance of our service not up to that has to get it up to that that's where the balance of the house and um\nYou know you can do that and again getting your income up get you into that go faster so um I I'm going to be working on the income side of the equation and I'm probably going to go and enjoy that paid for condo it's a it's kind of like saying uh I'm back\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back\nYeah the oh you is back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house that I'm a package for 'cause my incomes going to go up and goes back\nAnd uh yeah I'm I'm not going camping anymore fifty five\nIt was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that but you you you know you got past that stage now your back is that okay yeah cool thanks for dropping by things open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia made clear how are you\nI'm good how are you know good how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you we're calling your data for a little less in the air now and I feel like we are on I had all retirement but we're behind on college savings search you can show how old are your kids you\nAre they are twelve and ten\nOkay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement on a limb of are now you know your head congratulations ... so what's your household income\nIs an only child that way but yeah we\nWe are I mean when you have one without million dollars you're a millionaire yeah okay yeah you're right [laughter] yeah so ... what is your household into\nA little over two hundred\nOkay so why can you say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before college\nWell we're paying for private school right now as well what are you paying for ... how much\nCash how much twenty thousand a year per kid or total total okay you make two fifty when looking at you like it you don't have like two hundred me one eighty okay\nAnd if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's that cash flow can be turned towards casual in college too if they choose a college it's reasonably expensive\nYeah OK okay that's a good point and yes nine\nSo I I you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement you don't need it\nYou're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the moral\nBut I don't think your house to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids to school today we're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college we want to set aside\nAnd put Fifteen Percent of ... side so we're talking about thirty thousand dollars that's fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say something college U shape ten\nGrand a year per kid another twenty grand you can do that\nA front for from now until I go to school they'll have plenty of money\nI mean you just Jack up to five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control and saw that five twenty nine get or the one that's more of us are pros and they'll help you do that click smart ... de Ramsey dot com for a list of them in your area\nThe people we recommend all shut down when you help people that five twenty nine together and pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement then you're not working our plan at this stage\n\nIf you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you are not working our plan at this stage\n\nBecause you put Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby steps seven to increase return rugby on Fifteen Percent and Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand thirty ground\nSo that that's how I'm doing this map here I think you can do it I think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it\nAnd instead of having an actual game plan we lay out and go this is important this is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing so that we can do this\nAnd that's ten grand a year per kid for college to kids such point granted that's where I mean you've got is where you are so good questions ... thanks for joining U.S Open phones a
