a\nGood good question how old are you\nA fifty four fifty for near single\nOkay and how many years do you think before you buy a house [noise] um I don't think he's sixteen\nOkay oh cool well as long as you got more than five years I Would use a simple growth stock mutual fund\nOr a series of them for something like that I probably would just shoes and S P index fund because it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out I as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I started to a person is in the five hundred and fund an index fund\nAnd use that to grow for the next five ten years or so until you buy a house as long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nAnd that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar things got in that sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment\nAnd um even if I don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and uh 'cause I can afford for it to go

S C I was kind of how you think through it from a critical thinking skills standpoint so how long were you thinking of well I just started in June and I'm hoping to have it done in two years okay\nAnd so the thirty years' old your your game own on retirement taking on a Fifteen year mortgage about forty five the mortgage is paid for if not sooner and uh you will have saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs going to make you a millionaire multimillionaire usually I'm doing this show you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than they Ramsey says never go more than three years that's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other or because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go yeah that's all it is high thanks for stopping by thanks dance\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five to to find Julian is in New York City how Julian how are you\nKnow I missed around the can you hear me okay I can how can I help\nThank you very much for taking my call so I'm In a a bit of a unique position I'm I'm twenty four next year I'm going to medical school and uh I was I'm very very lucky and very appreciative uh I'm not going to have any debt to after graduating medical school and residency residency included I if I decide to specialize\nUm and uh\nDid you get a ... or what\nUm uh yeah I'm not entirely certain this to what I Want to do yet I Know they're not asking how you did that oh oh um\nYeah so so if they get from my father and my grandparents um\nWow I'm very very very appreciative yeah good now yeah you should be that's amazing wonderful so\nUm yeah so when when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially control this funny 'cause it's under my name I'm but I'm Sorry I Apologize I'm Joe I'm\nA yeah I was I was given controls this money and uh I've been given a very good financial advice from my father who's helping me manage it but\nUm because it's under my name and he he's essentially asking the rain stopped me or I Would like a second opinion as to what to do with this money I can give it a little bit of a\nMoney for a living expenses um and I said that about five thousand dollars from some small side jobs in hospitals but I Want to know how to capitalize on this and a half set myself up as best as I can for after medical school\nWell the thing I Would be most concerned about is that the money is a viable and enough to get you through medical school\nUm it it definitely is um about one third of it is invested very securely and two thirds of it I haven't ... um and this two thirds we were discussing putting into at AT T bill on a few months when duo basis until I needed to take them out that day my tuition and then I Would just re into the rest\nUm well probably would not do that and the only reason is is that the bills basically or bonds and a bond interest rates were yields uh go to the bond values\nGo down as interest rates go up and we are in an increasing in the interest rate environment so if you put a hundred thousand dollars in T. bills I could turn into Ninety pretty quick\nAs interest rates increase so that's not a very safe investment in the environment that we're in right now um but if you wanted to have some portion of the money invested I probably would go to something like gross income type funds but I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and that doesn't have to really earn anything\nIf you want to keep it all very very safe because that would be okay with me because the most important thing is for you to be able to graduate with zero debt\nAnd it'd be ... around with his money in some way and it loses value and you're not able to do that then the whole you know is like a ... we were concentrating on the wrong thing\nAnd Julian is the right thing to concentrate on Julian ... debt free graduation is the most important part of this math equation not what this money is paying\nA it'd be nice to be a little bit sophisticated about it but if you get caught up in some kind of a sophisticated process and then you end up losing money trying to\nTrying to just get a little bit more on this lump sum uh you you defeated you're on purpose you shot yourself in the foot so to speak so um that's the process you're looking at I'm going to keep it pretty safe uh if you want to go towards something that's fine but I wouldn't use bonds\nFor anything right now a burst possible play Kimberly is in Pensacola Hi Kimberley how are you\nSaying you know what I'm doing great thank you so much for taking my call sure also\nI I just wanted to thank you for all you do this thing temporary Walmart ... it's been seven years and it's not they're not have paid off very bad I'm following their plans to go for that\nI'm On the day is I'm not for an hour at all concerned about our parents are at higher than you could give it some advice on how they got them um my parents live in North Carolina and they are within a flooded area of heart pound area\nAnd um every time they're ... I'm thinking they experienced confining it on their on their property in their home as well as my dad is now\nAnd we were just wondering what you can and as far as the fella um they have like that they do have um different savings and my mom has a ticket for one\nMhm Mm too often does this property blood\nBut wow and nine nine and ... pointed and yeah but it got like forty ... and the house and I think about ... feet and his shop\nAnd then two years ago um it got in my dad shop I think about three feet or so and it all my life is about six inches from getting in the house again\nAnd again there's only been to Maine terrified but I'm there and they think the more it it's very emotional for them in town or farm ...\nThroughout this past down we actually packed that or I didn't care whether they bought a house with added states I think that all their belongings and let them put them away you know because they were afraid that in\nWhatever amounts to his living there has become more painful than not living there\nBut those are the fear of rising water even even the fear is not founded we once\nPainful than not living there but those are the fear of rising water even even the fear\nIs not founded we once in Twenty years is not that bad but bottom line is is is developed a phobia for them and they're not on living there they're not as fun living there why wouldn't they move [noise]\nRight [noise]\nI don't care I mean the actual threat a flood statistically with what you've given me I wouldn't be that concerned about but here they're absolutely panicking Everytime the weather ... says it's raining and then his town because it's not fun to live there anymore\nBecause you know it's more of an emotional decision but that's an okay decision doesn't wrong with that is not one of the liver and more moving\n[noise]\n\nYou know these guys are tech to me they're they're calling me Kate how do I do this how do I invest what is Dave say about this you know it's just real cool to see the\nShow and players want to be good on a field but they also want to make the right decisions off the field as well [noise]\nI was telling a leadership team this week when I was talking to a group of passengers were with yesterday that ... you can't attribute\nA life skills to someone just because they're successful in one area or in starting to get a twenty six year old music star yeah um well they're good at music but what happens is we see them being very successful there\nEven me I'm fifty eight I Know better I've worked for the NFL players for Twenty years off and on\nAnd um I Know this is a a a world class one half of one percent athlete\nUm but they are twenty two guests there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed they are the size of a key up yeah [laughter] but I don't mean that their life skills have developed [laughter] at the same level and you know so\n... it's it's kinda weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still is football skills are are the best on the planet yeah I'm In his physical acumen his physical\nA cue the things you can do this body in mid error or it's just shook us like it's amazing what those guys can do\nAnd but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching like on TV\nYou think of that guy as you know a forty year old who she is a mature developed\nA ... as you know strong marriage has all the other things and these guys are college kid turned out they were in college last week yeah you know there's twenty minutes ago and I'm\nEven a player that's been in the league three years yeah they're still young and they're still I'm twenty five years old ... and so it it's uh it's interesting in the same thing happens with music people when they get a success level earlier a thing where you're spotlight yeah and you get a success level\nAnd your skill this world class in that thing does not mean you have everything else together yeah yeah and that's true with the you know teenagers in general is one of the things we do this under one or two boxing\nIs they can start to develop some of those skills you know running a business yeah\nYeah they and that's absolutely right you know you say this all the time when an American nosy nosy for than it is but the NFL stands for not for a long and these football players young football players know that like hey I Need to develop something now because in probably in three years I Would not be initially mhm um and the most\nMoney these kids were make will be within their first three to five years of the league if they make it past and\nAnd so I I told them like ... you have to get focus but when we look at these twenty two year oh this is why I'm so passionate about that Fifteen you wrote about that

interesting thing is they're not um\nYou know that they're not like rushed into place right you know they're they're pretty they're pretty uh uh elastic\nIn their spirits and that they can receive\nYeah this stuff sometimes more than some of us are a little older and we get a little stiffer yes on our spirit and we don't receive us quite as well they're like okay let's go let's do that right right and they're not like old docked in and go now to argue with you about ... ... ... it's a it's easier to get through most of the time we don't have a big argument like they have to have a credit card you have to start a loan you don't\nHave to have a car payment they don't hear all that from the fourteen year old when you're able to sit and talk to them they're just ready to go what is

entrepreneur and I'm like man that's that's a bunch of bologna ... wrote that stupid [laughter]\nAnd so I get excited because I'm seeing this younger generation they are making stupid mistakes because no one never taught them once they learn\nThey tend to not make that same mistake in an area of the finances but they have to be taught at first\nSo that's what I Love about what we're doing is we're giving them life skills to ... skills through the teen entrepreneur to a buck kit we're helping them understand how to deal with their finances and how to make the right decisions earlier on with our
