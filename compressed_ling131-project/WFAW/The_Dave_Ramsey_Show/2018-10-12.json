them straight to the point I'm I've been living in my car on and off for about two months a whole month for two weeks since my car had broken down\nUm and I'm just wondering\nMoney has become one of my biggest dresses and I'm just curious what advice do you have some ... in that situation again like five families are financially stable to support me we've always struggle with money [laughter] I'm currently working to grab shot and jobs how one of them just caught by ships on the other one\nI don't make tips has a survey\nAbout I'm just wondering I'm twenty three year old I'm\nAt this point in life I don't really want to ever be in the situation because my physical health spiritual health mental health is all\nGoing down and it's and I lost my home to self conscious running for coming by

two at fifty six o five the doubts about two hundred Ninety five higher John Perkins brown seal\nMm [noise] Mm\n[noise] [noise] ...\nThanks for being with us America this was the Dave Ramsey show so glad your hair and you know it's interesting [noise] um and informative to all of us to stop and think about something\nHope causes you to be able to move the needle\nCauses you to be able to move forward when you think the light at the end of the ... at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train your paralyzed your stop your overwhelm your frozen you get paralysis or the analysis\nThat's hopelessness when you think its allies and the tunnel is the way out of your trap and\nThen you run to the light but if the train is coming at you and run to that obviously right\nAnd and what's the difference in those two events in both ... both a tunnel both the situation one is you believe that if you run to the you're going to get out of you believe you run a lot you're going to get\nKilled right I mean so that's hoping hopelessness and all of a ... me included face that or have faced that at times in our lives and it's amazing\nTo me the power of our brain and our spirit that God gives us\nTo do things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that there possible\nThat's called hope\nAnd so when I show you look you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you got thirty thousand dollars in debt you feel stock but gosh if we did that at a thousand dollars a month or you're going to be out of debt and my gosh and I thought I was always a month out of a hundred thousand is nothing a swap thousand dollars a year you're going to be out of debt and little over two years\nAnd you suddenly go oh I see it ... it's the same situation you were in but now you can see it\nSee what I'm Talking about and once you can see it that's called hope I can see my way out one of the things is steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective perspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\nThat's happened to me it's happened to you\nRemember one time one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was very upset like the world is coming to you\nSchool certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was very upset\nLike the world is coming to an end and her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort her [laughter]\nNow why are we standing in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nWhole blush well\nWe've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been places she is a man and have experiences as she doesn't have right so in other words we'd been to our ... year class reunion we know she'll be glad he didn't call [laughter] that's what we're giggling about standing and All right so we have\nPerspective and so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\nThen you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer and it it's going to grow some things in your future\nYou know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you ... there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different than when you look out ten seconds\nAnd the amount of just talking to an end folks that have dealt with an homeless situation so it's one of the problem was the desperation just to eat and not be cold\nCauses you to have ten second increments just thought instead of ten year increments just thought gee I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see he couldn't see that you don't care that he wasn't getting it it's like go\nGo go deliver pizzas go bowl leaves go walk dogs go shovel something somewhere you know go do something do you know work all the time because she knew that money come from work is where it comes from and I can't get enough hours will then work someplace else\nWork more work all the time but but because I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does mean out when we were going broke two babies in life the houses in foreclosure were that\nClose to homeless ourselves so how we get out of it or or bought off and well you know you can't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way I don't want bankrupt but I didn't lose the house\nAnd if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that well you know and and it's not that I'm Better it's not that I'm smarter\nThing is just perspective\nIs like I didn't grow up rich but had a friend that grew up rich and\nBecause she grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out considered always worked out and I had the perspective that ain't gonna work out [laughter]\nIt's going to be awful ... and ... because he thought everything was going to work out you know how it worked out a lot because I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes it didn't work out\nYou say you set yourself in these traction these rockets with this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it it's when you can't see the other\nSide of it that you don't want to work through it because you don't believe it's going to work out so called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same they only different issue is your perspective\nAnd so I'm challenging somebody right now that I think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this\nMarriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\nYou're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film script you're going to turn the page and something else is going to happen better or worse tomorrow is not going to stay the same you are not stuck\nSo look the other side of it look out there five years look out there three years look out their ten months in say\nOne of I got to do\nGot to be true that is not true right now for me to never be here again that's the question he was asking but he was having trouble emotionally buying it\nAnd I don't think I helped him I was kind of bothered me that's why I Want to talk about a minute I'm not sure he heard me\nBut if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away with where everything I haven't been through I have no identity no I ... and you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long\nBecause they don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this that I'll be out\nAnd I work my way right out of it I don't I don't know how long will take but I Would get there I pushed my way through it and um and I haven't always been that way\nThere's been times that I was so scared to show beat up and so hopeless that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see\nWhat I'm Talking about here is is is vision site that gives you hope\nWhen you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it\nThen then there's no you know the the it's hard to take action\nIt it's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you got to do a series of steps you got to take to become unstuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm stuck\nI think that guy's gonna be okay I really do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be I think it's going to work out\nGreat book to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that started um dominos pizza Monaghan came out of the army made some bad mistakes and ended up living in a homeless shelter\n\nAnd then he ends up owning dominos pizza at the end the story [noise]\nSo it's going to be All right [noise]\nYeah it can be [noise]\nYou can choose for it to be All right\nIt's not magic and it's not positive thinking and it's not easy [noise]\nHave them involved and they

company I'm traveling a hundred and ten miles a day roundtrip commuting okay I'm I'm averaging about four hundred dollars a month and gas and I'm having a little bit of trouble [laughter]\nKinda stomach moving to this new city because of the fact that it [noise]\n... higher up there [noise] my rent right now is only seven hundred dollars a month up there for all\nNew city because of the fact that it's\nThe rent a lot higher up there [noise] my rent right now is only seven hundred dollars a month up there for all and that's on a two bedroom apartment a one bedroom apartment up there started to ride around fouls in dollars\n[laughter] so my question is what should I Do about that [laughter] where are you driving or [noise]\nUm I'm drawn to carry North Carolina [noise]\nI think you went shopping in one end of town and there's the town [laughter] Kerry Kerry is not that dramatic ... thirty percent more expensive than Burlington\nI'm wrong something's wrong with your analysis here\nWell everything that I've done research was I Can't find anything less than non fifty thousand dollars a month for a one bedroom apartment [noise] and I've been digging for almost thirty days now okay a ton to offset the cost of gas and be closer to my job\nYou know get him that I don't I'm not I'm just not doing what you're doing but I'm a I'm a I don't have the emotional ability to commute like that some people do but I Can't do it my commute seven minutes or so I Can't relate um the um\n[noise] I I just I really think that I mean a ...\nI have never seen anything that indicates that scary North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive than the rest of North Carolina I mean you know maybe you need to move\nTwenty miles from there instead of a hundred and ten miles from there to get something cheaper but I'm the numbers you're giving me just don't work I I just a truce way I think you haven't\nLooked in the right places I think you're looking in certain neighborhoods or certain types of apartment complexes or whatever I'm going to continue to shop and learn an opponent I mean I'm ... you may need to dial it out pan back a little bit and\nDial out just a little bit mileage was from where you are looking to get you may be in the most expensive in the town I mean I can imagine that there is an area of carry this that expensive but\nOverall the psych carry North Carolina just thirty percent more expensive rents than Burlington no that's just I just don't believe that\nUm I can be wrong but I I don't I've never seen that indicates that the you know one end of North Carolina is that much more expensive than the other end now you want to compare Manhattan to Abilene, Texas we can talk about this but that's a different issue and that's not what you're proposing so I think you're\nUm you look in a different into town of Kerry or you move a little bit further out of carry but not a hundred and ten miles out of scary\nAnd let's see where we are at that point um but I don't think you can\nUm what your your numbers just don't work I thanks for the call Sharon is with us in West Palm Beach Florida Hi Sharon welcome to the Ramsey show\nAnd I'm On

how how much do you make\n'em I make about Seventy one um I work in IT right now\nAnd for you okay so you're just coming out getting things going and you know making Seventy one is a single person you're gonna attack this debt very very aggressively and very quickly okay so you're working on getting out of debt your boyfriend is already out of his dad and um is your ah parents or his parents going to help with the wedding cost or do you have any idea\nUm I think it did the as I Know the\nThe thing about it and we talked about me into the cow briefly overview about finances I Know he has a standstill amount paved at himself\nAnd then he planned the writing and they gave you forget how he pays for the wedding then and you keep getting out of that\nOkay that'd be paid for the wedding um should I before we do it said I pay down from either that or\nI'm shocked no you you have a lot of debt you enough to work on yourself\nOkay um I mean is listening that that's one of the package that comes named Jennifer has a master's degree\nOkay um I mean ... that's what the the package that comes named Jennifer has a master's degree and a hundred and forty eight thousand dollars in debt and all of the other things that are wonderful about Jennifer the package that comes with him is he\nIs out of debt and he has some money\nWe don't know exactly what yet and like you guys need to really get into this and talk about it but when you combine these two things then you're going to you know you're going to finish off the dead are going to spend a limited amount on the wedding show that you can use the rest of his money to clear your dad when we are married after we get home from the hunting [noise]\nI understand you've got some shame about your past we all\nWe can do it over when you do that oh my God [noise] ah no I don't let that hold you back at a plenty of good stuff I had a [noise] this is that Iran to show [noise]\nI'm probably it was another year or two before I really started the program 'cause\nBeing in med school and not having any income living off loans it's kinda hard to figure out how you're going to pay out that while you're taking out ... and then Alan and I met and we were engaged and\nWe want to start or mirrors off rights or we want to sort of get on the same page for ... or ... or what have you with a sort of what our future was\n... so out Allen actually had a when we met he had already paid off all his school loans and had a lot of the savings and I'm like hey you want to get married I've got a hundred and fifty thousand is that you\nKnow I think I really don't see doing that girl\nAnd our church um at that time was offering it for you and so I like to go to the class because I'm terrified and I don't know what to do and\nI'm so we did that in that was in two thousand twelve where she did that while we were engaged and so we got married in August twenty twelve and so\nTo this day you know before we got married we had our budget ready to go on the spreadsheet ... from the nerd too and uh [laughter] to this day we can tell you every penny we've spent since the day while I'm Mary and so that's been that's been an interesting journey but definitely a blessing\nTo be one month later ... things done yet so what do you tell people were key to getting out of ... ah\nGosh a source of communication or whether we're married are engaged for years by herself to me so much talk to you about it um and then it's setting the budget and being disciplined on it there's no problem in changing the budget but it's just it's actually spending ever since and figure out where it goes and being ... just going to do it\nOh yeah we've gotten very good at 'em cash flowing things there's been a lot of ... of course over six years a lot of unexpected expenses\nAnd we always say that if it weren't for the budget than we wouldn't know where to get money from ... um we've actually cash loads three cars in the span of time um and then about two years ago we um\nWe we were having some trouble I'm getting pregnant which you never think that that's going to happen and um\nYou know for fertility stuff isn't really yeah it's not like getting cancer it's not like a medical emergency or anything but it's definitely a very stressful um and so we we were very glad to be able to have the\nFunds and know where to pull money from and we actually ended up doing two rounds of IDF which was a very expensive [laughter] um and so we're happy to finally be pregnant and\n\nWe're not we're not going to call her Dave how are you good [laughter]\nWe just you know going through the stress of that and I see I've seen plenty of friends go through that or want to adopt and not be able to because they don't have the money or they have to fundraise for years and years and so we were just left to not not have to put that on hold because of money so that was definitely a blessing that but\nYeah but the on MasterCard yeah that would be bad\nBut but he was for you guys yeah\nWeld on we're very proud of you who ... who is your biggest cheerleader probably are that many of us were weird and crazy ... rolling their eyes on\nI was honestly I'm recording it
