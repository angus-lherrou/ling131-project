Badgers and\nPatrick I thought going into the year given what Johnson Taylor did last year Russia for nearly two thousand yards I thought well maybe he can [noise]\nNot really approach that number again and and and this could be a good thing for for the office and his other paced it's right there in the last years\nThat's remarkable consistency is one thing that\nThat is really impressive and he he last year of obviously you read for Nineteen hundred and Seventy Seventy ... two hundred Ninety nine dry so far this year has got nine hundred and fifty yards at a hundred and forty three camps so he's just behind his yards per rush that he had last year which was seven forty seven six ridiculous summer and this year he's ... he's the closest but again\nBut maybe the most impressive trend is consistency like I mentioned he talked to a hundred yards and eighty percent of his career outings sixteen out of the twenty games he's playing\nFor some perspective on this is Ron Dane did it in thirty three of his forty seven Seventy percent only Seventy percent had Henry David ... sixty percent of his games Moneyball fifty three percent of his games Melvin Gordon the great love and Gordon only ran for a hundred yards in forty nine percent of his game shame white James White thirty four percent\nSo here is John Taylor do get an eighty five\nEighty percent of his games\nFor some comparisons beyond Wisconsin [noise]\nThe FBI single season record holder is very centers of Oklahoma State\nHe ran for a hundred yards you Seventeen of Nineteen eighty nine percent [noise]\nUh and then I should write up Adrian Peterson Oklahoma he did in Seventy one percent of his game such as kind of gives you a barometer of where he is the big picture Taylor needs fifty yards to reach one thousand yards back to back season for two seasons of his career\nIf he does become an ... player and Wisconsin history to do that ninth player that back to back the algae are seasons that's crazy [noise]\nSince the last Twenty years had seven players do it for comparison\nIllinois has not had any one rush for al ... back to back seasons the last Twenty years in school history they've only had two guys doing a great ... in Nineteen sixty four sixty five minute Robert ... three straight John Taylor is [noise] consistency is impressive\nTo these things even veteran a lot of ways and it was

but\nWe'll check in with you before kickoff because we've had little snow schools go through it is a blustery day just to see what it's gonna be like Donald field hashing could be a struggle\nDo a lot we asked them to you know we need to get some more pressure on the court and I both ... both and number of Taos both\nThe tide fast and trust them shows and what great examples not even just for our

see\nThe ... ... we talked about him here he's given you what he can do and you a little bit more slowly but surely starting to come around to a a healthier line backers are really good one

of\nPlays a you know in coverage in past rush he's just a heady good football player and so it's been good to get him healthier and then I I look forward to when he's kind of just free to go in and turned it lives you know\nBe another interesting test for this defense this week is Illinois can run it and nobody runs that you know per game better with them and they have an inability to get a lot of big hits on the ground too don't they\nThey really do and I think you know like it a lot of the spread officers they will ... from ... quarterback is cable but he is running back in and they did was she was so therefore you better on or what's going on on the perimeter which gives you good numbers and so that's\nYou know the challenge for ... you know our defenses everyone has to play their assignment do their part of it and we're going to be stretched\nThin at times you know you can't really load up to stop one thing or the other and so when the ball does declare you got to fly to but they are a teen and wants to run the ball and they are capable of some ... years may come and we got to keep Russia's not that that happened what is our response going to be\nI'm not even going to try to sell smart when it comes to ... the ... the numbers are not particularly pretty but do you watch some of their games in their line backers of his hands and they'll show as they can show up others can as well they they they're young that should be pointed out but there is some talent there's\nNo doubt there is in in a lot of these players we played against last year and then we came out of that game like those are some good players and and uh you watch the film and you still believe that I think you're right a blind backers they play fast and you know I think they do enough different things and\nAnd you know give you some changes but they are going to play a lot of men coverage and it frees you up because she had\nA you know down low on in last year you know they're free said you'd made a number of tackles and like I said a lot of those players we play his last year and and you know I Know our players do and and we certainly saw unprepared for this week you know they weren't given
