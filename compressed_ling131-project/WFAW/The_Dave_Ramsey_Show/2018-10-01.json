we currently have fifty thousand in the bank and about forty five thousand and retirement\nUm and we're taking Fifteen Percent of the white income and putting it into retirement but after we do all that um what kind of have about like zero not quite there but very little for that on when\nI was wondering how much should we be allocating to join our time here until I get a B or to her [noise] um

going and obviously she's making some money or what is her income\nShe's making about fifty five okay\nAnd obviously that's carrying the water for you guys right now and so I mean you can take two approaches to it you can say do what you're doing right now and live like\nYou know Fifteen Percent going into retirement and that is heating up money that would be used for fun um or um you can just say you know\nWe're in a transition time while I'm In law school and so were you know we're really not walking the baby steps right now we're just going to be on hold and her incomes going to be used to make sure I get through law school and make sure you know that we enjoy this time here in Florida and then when I come out\nThen we'll be what both incomes will be game on when you can take it either way or you could take you anywhere in between if you want um\nYou know obviously the more you live like no one else the more light or you live and give like no one else obviously a by right and and so those are ... there's the choices you do um the the point I think the good I did the good part of this discussion is you're actually thinking about it and whatever you do at least you're going to it on purpose\nAnd sixty John Perkins brown field mark it up to date\n\nOf the women to make money doing what they love [noise]\nAnd this has been\nThe big week and it continues to hate the um tonight central time this is an ... month week you know a role in all my closes at ... pm tonight central time for the business boutique academy Begley\nChristie huge it's been so fun day it's amazing to see these stories coming in and women are\nYou know they're joining the academy they're posting and they closed academy group than I'm doing it scared I'm going for it a couple of women have already been exploring the training videos and saying things like I've already got my money's worth and I've been in a two day so it's just incredible it's been a lot of buying a lot of energy and ah and yeah so we're excited so tonight eight PM\nCauses so we got a few hours as their last chance to get in\nBefore we causing them on a ship my focus and work on coaching them and walking with them and training them step by step so billions on week academy what is that we're talking about so this will include Sarah my online training group settle for women and both are women and business that I Want to start a bit and I keep getting asked the question was is for filling the blank business I'm a freelancer I haven't had the shop I'm a\nProfessional organizer or an architect or I have a dental practice or whatever\nYou're all in business and that's what we do we help you build your business so someone and they want to start their business and we had a foundation of course in the academy that shows them how to start\nAnd then all the other training videos we have over a hundred training video I teach them how to grow their business on a variety of topics and then every single week rolling out a new training lesson and I'm In their cooking them step by step\nAnswering the question telling her hand showing them what to do next and it's been really really fun to see the success stories of women that have been in the academy for the last year and a half since we started when I was saying things like you know I've grown at three times as much as ... the year before one woman said I make twenty thousand dollars more this year than he ever for the academy\nSo just seeing the growth one woman her has been quite some time to go work for her and so these women are surprising even themselves but that's what happens when you get the help any nothing helps I haven't been able to coach when you have a trainer by your side so it's been fine too I didn't want to\nLearn something especially learn something new right you got to have a coach and you need a community yeah many people around you to encourage you and show you what to do and a cheer you on any cheerleaders because I got to tell you when you try to do something different\nA there's always some cow standing also wrote it just chewing\nLooking at you like like you to like you've lost your mind yeah\nI mean when you start a business there's always somebody who\nSecretly wishes they could do and I are you down the time and so you need cheerleaders remind people this you know standing up and jumping up and down and go and you got this you can do this you say yes it's scary yes we don't know what to do all the time\nWe do it any way I've done it for Thirty years and uh you got to push yourself out of the comfort zone and bust up and do that and ... knowledge and community or the two things that cause you'll be able to do the\nThe life change the transformation that you've got to do\nRight and it's interesting because you also you have those outside people like you were talking about that may not get it and they may not believe\nWe'll do the the life changed the transformation that you've got to do\nThat's right and it's interesting because you also you have those outside people like you were talking about that may not get it and they may not believe in your dream but you also have the fear in your own head that can be really loud and that was that's louder them that herpes on Assad well that's right I had a woman a write in just this week Emily that joined the academy and she said\nI have always dreaded business I don't have a business mind I don't have a business background the mere thought of running a business seem overwhelming but I had this dream that I wanted to do something and she said just two days now and the academy I've been watching these training lessons and you have me laughing and nodding along I never thought I Would actually look forward\nTo learning business you take all the intimidation out of it and make it fun and what a great compliment except the heart David to take the intimidation factor out of business to show women you can do this you absolutely can do that you just need when anyone needs you just need help and that's why we're here that's all we had the academy\nYou know the interesting thing is is that sometimes when people are standing on the sidelines looking at the idea of opening a business or even if they're running their own business\nOr you know and they're in the beginning stages or are they are stuck at a place where they they just need extra boost they need some knowledge they didn't have to go to a different level in any of those situations the interesting thing is is that people\nTend to think that ... those people have some kind of special DNA Jane right or like you have to be like this ... or ... or the entrepreneur Jean right or you have to dress a certain way or ... or whatever and the interesting thing is successful businesses are run by\nEvery type of person on the planet there every version of wild animal\nRuns [laughter] I mean it's amazing well I I use that example with selling because I think people have that myth about selling like I'm not sales person I don't want to be pushy and so on like a sales person as a certain type of DNA it's an extrovert it's a social butterfly someone that's a talker\nI use my example my husband all the time he's an introvert he's quiet he's steady\nBut he got me to marry him because the sale right are are seven and a half months and he was confident as can be\nA and so it's just you know selling or running a business is like anything in life it's a skill that you can learn like cooking or riding a bike and\nAnd that's why we built the academy with all of the training lessons that you need to learn the foundations to build your business to grow the next level and then we have that cut to my coaching and say oh you've got a weird situation money help you walk through that situation and really the best products and services you can put out there is a response to the market and what they tell you they want and for two years people said\nI Need a coach and mentor I Need help\nAnd this is our solution saying we're gonna help you were gonna walk with you and we've already seen the success stories of women absolutely\nExceeding their own expectations making far more than I imagine they could and so it's proven now it was an idea two years ago but it's proven down at working and I and I'm really excited for this new class of members running in hundreds of joined us read Oh absolutely that's right and we're close in age tonight we've got to kickoff party at eight\nSo I don't want people to mythic slanted closes its close till next

hundred eighty nine dollars for the year\nThat's around a little over forty dollars a month is still for a year's worth of coaching and training in your business you get your all I back some ladies are sending it back in a couple of days so it's absolutely worth the money to invest in yourself and your dream for a full year of training but you got to say tonight to get him\nKnow that we mentioned to the community is a is a big part of this and so what I've found is is that um I might not know the answer and I'm pretty good business to someone squash writer on the air but if I put them in one of those communities there's probably somebody in there that noticed the answer\nThat's right and they're connect because women are so relational\nThey're already connecting just this week seeing the connection is being made ... who's in Florida I'm In Orlando let's get coffee hey here's an interior design I'm an interior design hey let's get together and talk about best practices Haiti how do you a source you know your for your vendors for your product\nThey're already connecting that allows her to be a compound affects the ripple effect that goes way beyond me some of the catalysts that guides the conversation and then it goes far beyond me or those conversations in those connections are happening twenty four hours a day and our favorite group so it's really fun to see the impact that made because we've created this community like you said\nYou know communities aspect of it and then you've got a bunch of videos for content\nYeah so we have a video training library that
