I'm not doing that\nI'm not leaving my pregnant wife and four kids halfway around the dad gum world and go live with your dad not a chance I'm One of them are up and move and do as you can you can have your family help you a little bit of animal costs much to get move maybe the employer would give the new employer would give you an advance to get your mood into your new apartment\nUm there's a possibility with the yeah you need a load of your family and get out of there\nBut you know not being with your pregnant wife while\nShe's carrying what your fifth child you're in Boston and she's in Montana dude that is not okay [laughter]\nI mean you're not in the military you're not you're not required to be separated like that you're just making bad choices\nNow you need you need a scribe together a few dollars and go deliver some pizzas or something and uh for a month and and pile up you know thousand Fifteen hundred bucks and get you a U Haul and get your button gear and enroll loan over to a Boston and take that job\nOr moving with your dad for a month with the whole dead gum crew over there if you can something like that I mean you need to find a different way but this idea you're going to lay bringing your whole family\nAnd while your wife is ... no no no that's not going to work out for you that's gonna end poorly I'm going to assure you\nThanks for calling in men is one of those bands in Colorado Springs I ban how are you\nYeah ... better than I deserve what's up\nThere I Am self employed I'm a real estate agent and um\nYou've got the thousand dollars for your baby steps wide\nAnd our [noise] but they were were kind of a crossroads on how to how to do I do about going on with the next babysat I'm of the opinion which isn't in your plan but you know because I'm self employed and money is\nAlways there I Need to have oh you know two two months or so a income to fall back on in ... to be able to make a budget\nThat does your wife work budget [noise] she does not she's a stay at home mother and are you sure you're not make any money in the real estate business\nI mean I'm making a hundred thousand five hundred and ten thousand a year\nSomewhere in there they are not having you know zero months\nNot any zero monsters during the winter in Colorado there's um a month or slower than others where you know making the making the budget bill would be tight tighter in ...\nI'm not I don't I don't I never expand the baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly volatile and I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nYou really need to stop and think about what you just said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have zero money I'll go along with that part but I don't think that's what's really happening you might get eight thousand dollars a month average\nSo I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so anyway set some aside but we're not going to call it an emergency fund and we're not going to add to the thousand dollar account we call it an Illinois valley account\nThe hill and valleys the volatility of your income the hill is when they come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to start a couple of ground over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts one is for emergencies and one is for you if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month\nBut dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow to analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run\nOut of money I mean you can go make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me he made forty thousand dollars in real estate business I can imagine you have in some zero much but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back in track your revenues in charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nIn giving in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are then okay since some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is and uh but no we're not changing the emergency plan\nWe might have a hill and valley account if you truly have a volatile income Mark's with us in Seattle Highmark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nYeah thank Dave hey it's a great honor to talk with you I Know you I had a great impact them changed my life five years ago um do you think you are currently uh I I got a career question I'm In baby steps back so the only thing right now I'm paying off my arm Devin and I got a net worth of a half million dollars uh [noise]\nWhat happened was was five years ago I left a small company with a great guy company culture when I hear you talk about your company that the company I was working for had a very similar culture [laughter] I was making an average salary for what I did I went to a competitor I\nMuch um are you making um I was making a eighty thousand dollars a year and what do you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year on your questions what\nI make my question is is I really miss that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really\nReally interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work\nAnd um you know I should have to work every day I get great reviews um I'd\nProbably go back but I Want some equity are I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worse than the marketplace\nAnd so we endorsed credit unions are not because of their nonprofit status but because they have reasonably priced goods and ... are reasonably priced banking services for you to use and you'll be treated not like a member\nYou'll be treated ... by you know people that actually care you'll\nAlso have that similar experience at a local community by a regional bank and that's who I Do business with personally\nI don't personally have an account right now a credit union I'm not opposed to I just don't my stuff our our business accounts and our a personal accounts are all have local\nOr read our regional and I'm a community banks in our area we do business with several banks\nAnd so and it's very simple it's just because I Need to pick up the phone and talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller knows that kind of thing but but in you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talked to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me\nThey treat you like crap and they over charge you for most of the services and this day and time their online offerings of their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated\nOr not that good they're not good at anything\nBut I I just don't get it so that that's why we endorse credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank and I'm just a\nA huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did\nEverything I endorse on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation and that kind of a thing I don't have anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that I I'm\nNot I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell you to get but you know ... you know in most of these cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Ted how are you\nDoing better than I deserve how're you doing\nJust the same how can I help\nBy ... thank you and your staff you're doing it it's a blessing you um how it'll be needing a lifetime saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years I don't get hit by a bus\nAnd I want to know if I uh probably should continue funding and ha with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks here first I just put a that extra money into a raw FireEye her four one K.\nWas it just a couple of hundred bucks a year a company I don't know whether she can put you come out they're matching a couple hundred bucks a year and more how\nCan I show the the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you've got to have in ten years what does it\nNeed to liver ooh I got hungry I see so yeah fortunately or something you can't live without\nYeah I've heard that yeah [laughter] oh [laughter] okay um yeah it's it's a it's a slow a slow progression then\nYeah it is they they estimate that you know Seventeen years out so okay I get to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to retire early you know if I\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're going to want is a ... you you got to have the cash in your age essay or somewhere else in an investment to cover what's going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking to health insurance is going to cover a large portion of that is correct\nYeah that if I don't retire um and I'll be on um either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or I'd I wouldn't retire because this is a guessing this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it\nProbably half now\nAnd so I'm thinking we're gonna time retirement around this a little bit um or and or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the cobra but the cover only last what two years or something\nUm I don't know you can keep that indefinitely so I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of those I don't want a\nTime that poorly um but then how much have you got coming out of pocket or over ten years you could put five thousand dollars a year and to that age essay or whatever your big the duck double is what you are to duck double\n[noise] um [noise] ... yeah you or whatever that adoptable is on the age of say a year oh now\nThe age I say is that health insurance or I Know of fun [laughter]\nUm no the ... or health savings account that is attached to a health and a chess a health insurance policy that has a high ... policy\nOh no no the ... or health savings account that is attached to a health and ... say health insurance policy that has a ...\n... it depends a policy I pick a teeter ... nine nine thousand\nDollars is what I'm Talking about you can put up to that amount per year into that savings account\nThat would be six thousand yeah yeah I Wish I only met yes and I don't touch it until I you know pretty dire\nYes here's why so when you're when you need the money out of pocket to cover the whatever comes out of pocket on on the liver surgery a and you keep your health insurance in place then you've got this big\nJuicy health savings account sitting there in and I do use mutual funds in it and let it grow over the next ten years be as big as a ... there's no downside of that whatever you don't need for the liver transplant or liver trans whatever the processors they're whatever you don't need you can\nPull out and just pay taxes on no penalty\nAt sixty five and so um you're going to want to build that up and he's just not going to ... it becomes a what you don't use you can use for retirement\nAverage sixty five so I Would love that up knowing that you've got this coming down the road\n\n\nFor years and one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do a live um in in our city\nWith a radio show and book

do get is health insurance\nUntil they're Eighteen and it's provided through our state Medicaid system and every year my husband and I kind of go back and forth on whether or not to keep it or to put them on his plan through his employer and we're getting close to that um [noise]\nTime of year to make that decision\nOkay um what would his employer plans cover that Medicaid is not covering\nWell they're both and healthy thankfully I guess are um you know the thing we always come back to as unknowns of any kind of health issues that they may have er\nUm any services because even though the Medicaid coverage is crummy you know in a lot of ways that a lot of doctors don't take it and it's a basically welfare insurance [laughter] um it has covered their needs up to this point because those kids are healthy and they've had you know minimal minimal ... afraid\nIf they had some kind of a major event that he'll Medicaid would not do a good job of covering and that his insurance might\nActually it's more the opposite I'm not worried about the major stuff because like we've had to go to the ER for you know my you know a scrape and a bump and they pick up the tab for everything it's more the ongoing care there is um you know it's very hard to find providers who take it there's a bit of a steak than we feel\nImagine being denied and apartment because of housing discrimination soon wrong but who has the power to stop it is\nThem on and on your side if you've been discriminated against because of race color religion or national origin disability or from illegal status fine would complain because\nYou've done go slush fair housing public service message from the national fair housing alliance\nMm Mm Mm [noise]\nLike if you want to go somewhere but we're so glad you're with us today Ramsey show Jackie's with us in Columbia South Carolina Jackie how are you\nDo find the best thing for taking my call sure what's up [noise] but\nI Want to know if I co signed a loan for my son is six years ago it on and on\nAnd on that a part of my business to have you got like you're supposed to mhm\n[noise] well when you sign alone and I don't pay you get to pay it that's why they wanted a co signer yeah so how much do you owe on the student loan\nAll they do what's your household income or about Seventy thousand Seventy okay and what is your son make\nA huge ... got a job about twenty dollars for our thinking about the five hours a week\nHe's working twenty hours a week yeah OK what you're doing with the rest of his time\nHe's working twenty hours a week [noise] okay what's she doing with the rest of his time\nReally he he he doesn't want to have a job that you know what John because he's trying to get it because their job forever because\nWhat I Would add conflict with his job he's only working twenty hours a week\nRight for the call 'em for a job\nTwenty hours a week or the whole week\nTwenty hours a week ... ... ... ... is it TV they have a good thing they have a football game and they go ahead\nAnd why would you be on call for football there is no emergency football\n[laughter] trying to get into the TV for years\nI got that pilot he's working twenty hours a week and his mother is calling me 'cause she can't pay his dad gum twenty thousand dollar bill I'd like for him to work another forty hours a week on top of the twenties playing football\nOr so she so he can pay is freaking bills so you're not calling me how would that sound that would sound awesome\nI I Try to tell him that I did get down to ... and I think\nAnd I guess when I have to pay like out in the guardian basically I mean everything you don't work much\nYeah there's a great place to go when you're broke to work so uh\nWhat I Would tell him to do is get into financial ... city and get his young budding gear and start by and I do I I mean I find me I'm going to be all up on this kid because he's twenty eight years old and he's a slacker\nAnd his momma is calling me you single after his mom's a single lady I hear when your safety what\nKind of fifty fifty years old and you're having to pay this kid's bills yeah I'm mad at him right now I don't want you to be two and a good loving mama's kind of way I'm not trying to disown him I just want to knock knock on his little head okay\nWell you know and then you you better plan on paying it if that no mob doesn't get moving okay right so that snowball and knock\nIt out and then you know shock it up to that and but dude I'm telling you a word will have some discussions is he married\nHis girlfriend okay I'll bet she works forty hours yeah\nYeah there you go [noise] alright open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Katherine is with us from Portland Maine Hi Katherine how are you\n[noise] I have thank you I hear it out my budget activity every dollar budget among baby step to great I protect my expenses for them on a\nProject on I'm going to be paying for debt and then sometimes something happens like last month when my car broke down and I had to had a tone and repaired and it costs almost five hundred dollars [laughter]\nI Know some had in mind off on that we know that one out of ... do you have your baby steps one with a thousand dollars right I Do now that would be an emergency that you would use that for\nOkay but that's what I was confused about because the way I handled at what I simply added a new line item to might not check for that item and then we get the amount that I pay toward get for that month so I get it wrong that would\nBe okay you cash flow did\nYou just ... but if you can cash flow in that month that's fine I didn't have to come out of the emergency funds so you are paying more than five hundred dollars extra on that each month yeah\nGood and so you reduced it by five hundred for one month 'cause you got kicked in the kneecap what this thing but usually you're not going to have that month in a month out now there's some things if a if there's a recurring unexpected event it no longer is unexpected\nFor anti and you know you don't have anything budgeted for car repairs well that would not work because most cars are going to need some repairing over a period of six months you know they're going to have\nAnything that you did for car repairs\nYeah I probably would put something in there for that because the ... year budget needs to reflect the real world and the real world is you're going to spend something on the car and the given six month period of time it might be tires that might be maintenance you might be oil change it might be a five hundred dollar toe you know\nBut you're going to spend something on a car in unless you're driving really nice brand new cars you're going to spend something on the car during that time so your budget should reflect reality in that regard\nSo probably going to add a little bit of a done it to be a lot fifty or a hundred bucks or something and let that build up\nAs a sinking fun they call and then the every dollar software or in them on below but I don't care where you build it up but somewhere you build it up and you ah have the money in cash than for your car repair as it comes up and that's an example of something that is recovering so it's no longer unexpected\nEmergencies should be unexpected things\nThings that are often enough that we can expect them aren't emergencies anymore but you did good yeah you did fine just to cash flow through that emergency you slow down your debt snowball for that month and then you pick backed up next month hopefully won't have another one of those and you can really\nBuild it up and go from there so good question and you're doing good keep after Tom is with us in San Francisco Hi Tom welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDo appreciate we're doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now\n[laughter] I mean can you [laughter] I'm honored isolated to gather a long time you and I [laughter]\n[noise] so of course you can use so my wife and I we have about three hundred and ... and student did another hundred and Fifteen automobile and you don't mind the credit that type of thing so it's about four Fifteen till we do\nAnd we make a pretty good income she's about one twenty annual leave my middle one eighty three hundred come on I mean my question for you is I was a move back to school you can get my masters the Koreans only twenty five ... to feel like they wouldn't be a very real our ally on it\nBut over the last three days are starting to think may be maybe I shouldn't [laughter] just want to get your take on the\n... masters in what\n[noise] oh it would be in ... ... right\nAnd it would increase your income by more than twenty five K\n[laughter] it would probably be hard to say I'm there would be when he came and raise because of the category of jump into\nMhm okay you admit you know you can get back into would make it\nBack in touch over a year then from\nThat point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget as you make so stinking much money\nNow you live in in a very expensive area granted it's crazy expensive but I didn't want to live in\nOr in the budget as you makes us thinking much money now you live in a very\nExpensive area granted it's crazy but I don't want to live in a really rough ... yeah but you guys are really you're really spend\nThat money ...\nAnd so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four hundred and two years if we do it in two hundred a year that may be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year and get out of debt plan\nBut you know vacations you don't need to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you dare talk to me by buying anything else you've bought enough crap for a while you need to and you need to live like people that make a hundred people that make three hundred and get this that million dollars\nAnd in the process of doing that can you will you twenty grand or ... in the budget for\nBut it depends on what I mean when you say a tea but you could change your mind about I'm ... I'm not going to do I T I Want to go into business well then you might want to do a four year degree with a degree you know the specialization in marketing or finance or something like that\nAnd in that case the answer would be different on how to pay for it here's the thing you one of the number one carefully select what it is you want to study\nAnd that it makes your eyes light up when you talk about it you kind of smile down inside when you talk about doing this\nThing whenever the thing is okay you know once you've selected that then you decide how to study it if it's a four year degree if it's a two year vote tech degree\nOr am I going to go to a community college for two years and then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a regular school I mean for your school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing\nCommunity college is a lot less expensive and you can get your basics out of the way for the first two years for a four year degree if you want to show the second thing once you determine what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is\nCollege cost is the number one cause of student loan debt and what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a huge pickup truck\nBoth our transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of you know the mall and answer if you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley\nYou can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to a super expensive college so you go to an end state school\nThere in Florida you go to the University of Florida Gainesville or you go to University of central Florida right there in Orlando a wonderful thing you want to but wonderful both of them in state tuition not that expensive and uh that's thing one year college selection\nAs at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need a mat\nWith rare exceptions and you're not going out of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make scholarship hunting your full time job after school job that kind of a thing\nAnd you start applying for and filling out the scholarship forms and riding the essays and he probably ask for a thousand scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just wants school free ...\nThat'd be pretty cool not a bad part time job the third thing is planning on working a lot while you are in school don't borrow money so that you don't have to work work and get good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking\nCutting grass jobs people don't want to do what they pay a lot to do I'm not talking about minimum wage crap and if you're gonna live on campus go ahead and be an R. A. B. a residential advisor or written that's what they call it what is an R.
