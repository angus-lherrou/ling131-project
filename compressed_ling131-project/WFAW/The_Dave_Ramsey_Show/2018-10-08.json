reason is counting on the house I've got a lien against the house right now\nThan some of the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is\nYou know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry I mean they'll let alone anybody this were either not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing\nYou know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nAnd ... and so the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but\nUh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it was like no they would've offered a dog that credit card so I mean dead people get credit card offers show is you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offers you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you can be that low on the deal so that that's what you

after four one K. or by some other things than\nThan usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different parts to that equation and you know if you know when

take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college and a five twenty nine or an e essay and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plans here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in\nPrice\nAnd so if I prepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of an increase in price 'cause that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an increased rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last\nSeventy years as average about seven point two percent\nInflation right\nSo that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent\nAverage annual return\nOver that same period of time minded and so on you make more\nBy putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is\nA ... and it's a blanket statement but ... and\nIt would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans in the process I mean they're just horrible administrators now some\nStates are well run my state happens to be well run so in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration\nWith a with the stability of the ... still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say I would roll your eighty six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned called a vacation because you're broke and you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card\nDebt so you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas hey Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent or want to thank you for for a a ...\nI was going to be for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a\nHad we not gone through a few wow so ...\nTo my question because this was a wonderful thing it's fixing to happen or we were at my family my parents have received an inheritance of mineral rights in West Texas mhm a large portion\nAnd a half minutes struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oils but not not a tie mhm uh\nSpeculators are wanting to sell a by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell ... and cash out or hopefully you know are being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom ... and we want to ... you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly\nMhm [noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole and there's only a boom if\nAfter it's not a dry hole there is an actual um oil prices that sustain a drilling a and then that's one of the reasons west Texas is struggling run our oil prices are so far down\nThat there's no boom okay I mean when gas for five dollars a gallon or the boom by you know what I mean but er and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does own turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue\nAll of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all to get just about everything I Know just in a [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell although at all or none\nNo it's not an all or none ah what do you it's it's essentially a they're looking at the\nThree million for all\nThe and or or you know obviously one point five for half okay so you're just added on how one yeah\nAnd my biggest concern is a risk yeah I mean we are not oil people\nYeah I think ... million is is what I mean I'm ... so you're only talking about selling our house\nWe're deciding on how much yourself\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table this debris million dollars on it when I go by oil rights with it my answer would quickly be no mainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that\nI that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay but that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars piled in the middle kitchen table when I go go by our rights in West Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I say you know that you wouldn't die and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know what we're fighting the stock market might crash yeah well\nIt might but I got to tell you start getting less rock markets Lazarus\nThem drilling holes\nYeah we're hundred percent sure that you don't have I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be all person to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like\nYours off\n... uh no this is I'm I'm helping my mother and father and make it to say\nOh I see so it's just so they ... they can make the decision for the whole thing or not yes All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least sell Seventy five\nPercent of it\nI probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they're just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and a ... you know so that that you know if it struck out after us\nScared to death ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh I I'm Glad I was so that that you know struck out right after I sold it I regret it the rest of my life\nYou know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let spots from real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that I'm definitely not\nSome advisors to the families entire portfolio three million dollar networks\nWe caught up in the oil rights [noise]\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked me\nAs a financial pros I Do that I Would say though\nI Would say the majority or all of that money also ties\nGood news to have a blessing like that\nThis is the Ramsey show [noise]\nLet's just let's stop a second because it sounds like you're paying bills and then trying to\nEat I Want you to eat and then try to pay bills what that means is\nIs that we need to start start doing a written budget for every dollar but for the month begins you look at your paycheck and what they're going to be you look at your child support what it's going to be\nFor this month before the month begins and you assign every dollar and so we would start with Todd off the top you said you're a ... that's cool I'm that's the first thing we do like ten percent off okay that tie this done now are we going to next well we're going to eat\nThe second thing you do\nYou eat so you do your grocery budget you shut that money aside and then what's the next thing you know you pay your life and your water okay what's the next thing you do you do your you pay your rent guess what after ties food rent and lights and water there's some money left but it's not a bunch\nOkay well you probably got Fifteen hundred bucks left if I did my calculations correct there give or take right\nI don't know what you want to know the only man that much left those are food um\nBut you know you probably got twelve hundred maybe not let's just call it a thousand you know after you just your run those actual numbers right down the page child support plus my checks minus ...\nMinus ah my my a food ... budget what am I set up for food and um minus ... minus my lights and water now I'm living and I've eaten and the kids have eaten before we do anything else out now we've got paid a car payment or they're going to report that\nThing and we got to put gas in the car now how much is left\nOnly then that we spend money on something else\nBut you can't go buy something for your son's sporting event and then not be able to pay your light bill right that's not an option how long you been a single mom\n[noise] um [noise] they're pulling in Thirteen now for about three months or\nSo a
