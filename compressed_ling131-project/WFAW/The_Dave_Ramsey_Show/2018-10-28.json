David have mercy on me [noise]\nJesus stopped and said call him [noise] so they call the blind man sure on your feet he's calling you throw his caucus side he jumped to the speed and came to Jesus [noise]\nWhat do you want me to do for you gee just asked him and the blind man said rabbi I Want to see\nGo say Jesus your faith has he'll do immediately he received his site and follow Jesus along the road and now\nOur choir will sing I'll fly away\n[noise]\n\nGoing on in la la la la\n\nLa\nLa la\nLa\nLa la\nLa la over a\nA R o\nDo we know all of\n\nA\nA\n\nShy about a mile\nAway\nOh a client\nAlways [noise]\nTo do that without a doubt on then blow us that John ... from\nA way and da da da\nDa da da\nDa da da\nDa da da da da da da\nDa da da da da da da da da da da da da da\nDa da da\nDa da\n\nI'll never forget either the time that we were getting ready to come here oh about Fifteen Years ago we were getting ready to come here and we decided\nWe were going to make a pilgrimage we were living in San Diego and we thought let's just go back and visit all the old spots on her way to Wisconsin so we drove north\nAnd we drove to San Francisco so eight and could see San Francisco he could see the school where my wife attended and we wanted to see San Francisco's because it's such a wonderful place it's a great city so we were taken him to the streets of San Diego or through a San Francisco and we warned him\nNow you're going to see more homeless people here it's okay not that homelessness is okay but just so he knows you're going to encounter them well we didn't think of is that he would be assaulted on that trip that day we were walking through the town and this homeless guy\nJumps out at him with a knife that's pretty scary right and said I'm going to kill you five years old that's his introduction to a bigger [laughter]\nI'm trick or treat right he was terrified of that he was terrified of that so we had to have long talks this guy was obviously mentally ill and that's why he was there but that's life on the street\nAnd were introduced to a bar to mask the Senate ... means to honor who's living his life on the streets of Jericho\nJericho is an important city in the life of the Jews you know why you may remember the stories of Joshua the stone cutter who was a follower of Moses who then inherited a the leadership position when Moses died and\nHe was the one that the defeated the Cain and nights of Jericho the walls came a tumbling down\nJoshua thought that battle you know the walls came tumbling down here inside help but anyway the walls came tumbling down and that opened up the door to eventually have their place the promised land become a reality that we're now able to move into this\nLand they were able to establish Bethlehem where David would be born and they would would later than established in Jerusalem as the main capital and the headquarters where he would build or help to build or encourage\nHis sons had built a temple for God that's become the center of their life and that's in this place if the story is taking place today with Jesus\nSo bart amass Tuesday means to honor who lives his life as a beggar is on the street now anybody that knows anything about begging if you had to do a make money as a beggar I'm sure you'd rather do it in a place where there was a lot of traffic\nRight you need foot traffic to be a good beggar\nRight opportunity there you don't want to be in some dark alley way are begging for money cause who comes through there you want to be where there's a lot of people so in some ways to mess might've just wanted to know there's a lot of people coming around he's blind but he can hear the commotion he knew something was happening so we ask somebody now\nWe don't know why he bought or when he became blocked\nWe know that he probably wasn't born blind though because later in the scripture we discover and when ... was asked by Jesus what he wants them to do and he says I Want to see again which indicates at one point he could see\nSo we don't know what happened when his eyesight disappear when did he lose it was he a kid young adults\nWas it because of a battle or was it in society's mind that he or his father to mass had sin against God and this was God's punishment\nAnd so we need to reject bar to mask the sun to mess because his family did something so wrong that God chose to punish them by taking his eyesight away and now he's reduced to begging on the street children stay away from him there's evil in him\nAnd that evil if you get too close could get in to us that evil could penetrate us just by being near him that's what they thought in the first century\nSo far to mass is on the street and he's ... he's got a cloak around him he's probably dirty 'cause he's living on the street probably has no home of his own\nThey tell them that Jesus of now with Syria and immediately and as Mike pointed out this is that journey and the gospel of mark when they're getting ready to go to Jerusalem\nWhere Jesus is going to have a parade palm branches flying and all of that this is the preparation for that [noise] his disciples haven't declared this as loudly as part of me is about to but Barno may have said son of\nSon of David have mercy on me now what is that what does that mean have mercy on me it means forgive my sense\nNow\nWhat is that what does that mean have mercy\nOn me it means forgive my sense is a survey that he has done something to a front got that\nThat's why he's blind\nHave mercy on the pity me have compassion have empathy on me for I Am blind\nAnd of course the people in the community are mad that this guy that they're trying to ignore and reject the give arms to they may give some food to they have to keep them alive because the scriptures tell them to do that but they don't have to like them\nRemember when Jesus tells the story of the good Samaritan and they see this guy lying on the side of the road and he was beaten and bloodied and good Jewish authorities walk right by um\nWithout stopping and it's the merits and that stops and shows compassion\nFor his situation but they couldn't be bothered\nThe scriptures are clear that you have to be bothered you have to have compassion that's what God wants for us and they knew that they have compassion for him but they just wanted to keep their distance\nBut he was talking and it was just like when the disciples were trying to stop the children from coming to Jesus and Jesus folded the disciples and say don't stop them for such belongs to the name of God\nLet the children come and then this way they're trying to stop\nA beggar a blind man who is suffering and in pain who has been rejected by his community and has no family or people around him presumably\nAnd so Jesus tells his disciples to go and get them go get them he says and they immediately go over to this guy and they say cheer up things are about to look really good for you\nThey know what's coming cheer\nCheer up all fella right that what you would say to a blind beggar it'd be something on the street cheer up buddy so cheer up\nWhat what does he do it says he throws off his clothes and jumps up now just a little worried about first century fashion\nNot wearing anything on there was caught [laughter] All right you see that in San Francisco maybe you don't want to but that happens to\nThat is what happens if he's throwing up his clothes he jumps up nothing covering him just like a child born before God standing there before Christ and then ... says what is it you want me to do for you know that because Jesus just is ignorance\nAnd doesn't see what's wrong with this guy Jesus knows it's got to come from him what does he want from me\nAnd he says I Want to see again now why would you want to see again so he could see all the faces that hate him\nSo he could see all the people who have mocked him over the years so we could see what he looked like now and how he was living now what career could he possibly go into now did he have a profession that he wasn't able to do because he was blind and Jesus tells him to throw off the cloak\nNow the story is such a powerful story and that seems really obvious right\nPart masses blind Jesus restored society but where you get it right who's really blinds here right is it part of my answers really blind or is that the community we get it it's pretty obvious isn't it in this story that the other people who were there telling him to shut up but they're the ones who are blind\nThat they can't see that Jesus is in fact the son of David that he is the messiah and all of\nTheir lives are about to change because why because of what that cloak that cost to the bar the masses wearing that day is where that is the cloak\nOf fear is shrouded in fear\nNo yesterday was an amazing day here at our church we got to host starlet Lewis and um the choose love lessons or it was really an honor to be able to host her or if you don't know her story if you don't remember having read about it and our broadcast or or or otherwise a scarlet um\n... what the mother of Jesse a six year old um who was a student at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut\nAnd one day I'm a shooter came into their school and killed twenty people that day including the students\nIn fact there was a moment there were Jesse was in his class and I'm the guy had to reload did shots of many he had to not reload is gone and rather than running for his own life Jesse yelled to his classmates Ron\nRon in and nine kids listen to Jesse and ran out of that classroom and lift\nBut Jesse didn't he was killed that day\nThank you for sharing this hour promise prayer and praised with us\nIf you desire to grow in your relationship with God

this morning we're inside and announces on NBC News the White House correspondent Christian ...\nErickson editor of the research is Amy Walter national editor for the cook Political Report and Josh Josh and host of warning on NPR\nWelcome to Sunday ends meet the press [noise]\nSunday Morning as our colleague journalist and O'Keefe wrote on Twitter late yesterday the worst anti Semitic attack in us history took place today just days after the largest attempted assassination of political leaders in us history but that thinking\nIt's a deeply unsettling assessment that has the disturbing advantage of being accurate this after a week of ethnic violence and political tear on friday a Florida Man ... was arrested and charged with sending as many as fourteen mail bombs to Democrats and other critics of President Trump\nAnd justice of the country tried to exhale as the male bombing danger seem to have passed we learned yesterday the horror in Pittsburgh where a lot\nOf people were shot and killed a ... a synagogue and the city's heavily Jewish world film they\nLast night there were numerous vigils around the city and the country including this one in Pittsburg near the synagogue\nAnd remember that [noise] that are hyper partisan atmosphere\nWorld we will inevitably debate was\nThe male bomber inspired and catalyzed by President Trump who kept his political opponents enemies of the people or was he just alone are filled with anger and political resentments what's the synagogue shooter\nA product of a toxic environment on the right that treats refugees and Americans who don't look in worship as they do with other or with is the type of hate filled mass murder we've seen too many times in this country before\nWe got both of these stories covered plus we're going to look at the amped up political rhetoric that serves as the backdrop to this year's midterm elections just nine days away\nBut let's begin with my colleague NBC News justice correspondent Pete Williams will hopefully have updates force of both of these stores peak mourning\nMourning Chuck will Bowers is now going to face Robert Bauer is the uh the ... the alleged shooter in in Pittsburgh is going to face Seventy two counts now these been charged both by the federal government and by the state\nOf place over correct well they they both filed charges so I think it's not clear who where he's going to go on trial for us but the federal government was very eager to step in and say this was a hate crime\nAnd just as the ah Pennsylvania authorities have said and there seems to be very little doubt that for three reasons basically one is his social media postings I'm months and months of a ... a vial anti Semitic comments secondly the fact that he singled out of the synagogue is speaks for itself and thirdly the police in Pittsburgh say\nAs he was being transported to the hospital as he was being treated for his wounds he said all Jews must must die because they are committing genocide against my people\nDenise who who does he referred to as is his people in the case\nWho knows I mean that's that's what he told the police as they were treating him on the way to the hospital\nThere was that other than his whereabouts over the last year there's not much known about Mr ... board that is that what what what profile are they able to drop so far\nNo you're right and if you contrast that to hear Caesar say oc are accused of the bombings of sending out the package bombs\nHe had had many run ins with police over the years he even made a bomb threat against Florida power light over one of his power bills at one point on the other hand power seems to have absolutely no contact with law enforcement they said he was never on their radar before he was a loner in neighbor\nSay he never got out much he seemed to of his life seems to have been led on line and I think one question is how did he ever visited that synagogue before did he know the lay out of it because you know ultimately it ends on the third floor that's worth a shootout with police as he's he's trying to hide from them\nAnd they're a is there any indication that he purchased any of his guns illegally or when they all purchased legally\nNo there's no indication that he bought anything illegally and I think one question about his weapons is this ... many of the witnesses said they thought there was automatic weapons fire well you have to assume that these are people who don't spend a lot of time listening to gunfire but the police say it sounded like automatic weapons fire so I think the question is\nDid he modify that semi automatic rifle it's possible to do it it's illegal but then he modified in a way that would shoot automatically or was it using a bump stock like was used in the Las Vegas shooting I moved to\nA Caesar say are as of friday he was not talking a is a is there any update on whether he is yet to cooperate with a with officials\nKnow and their ability to question him now ah is is reduced he's going to have his first court appearance on\nYeah to cooperate with a with officials\nKnow and their ability to question him now ah is is reduced he's going to have his first court appearance on Monday they they initially questioned him under an exception to the Miranda rule you know normally you have to buy some of their rights before you can\nQuestion them if you want to use that evidence in the trial against them but there is a public safety exception and that's what they used here basically saying are there any more bombs well he refused to say a whether he had anything to do with the ones that were already out there or be whether there were any other still waiting to be discovered it's been what thirty six hours now since they found it\nWas just going to say at this point I Can't say I noticed that the postal service won't say definitively yet at what point will they feel comfortable assuming that it's out of the system\nAnother week maybe a you know they had been finding these closer and closer to the mail system of the last ones were discovered inside the mail system so they're all carefully looking for them and I think you have to assume that there aren't any more because this is the longest gap that we've had since they were to anywhere discovered\nAnd all the ... late once discovered or west coast so it's sort of makes sense that that might be so the assumption has got to be that\nRight the last two to senator sent to senator Kamala Harris ends attempts dire\nAlright tends to a top tier ... Pete Williams a than an awfully tough and busy week for you for all of us thanks very much for the day yesterday and at a vigil last night members that community in Pittsburgh\nWere shocked and heartbroken\nWhen it is very ... that community whether you're Jewish or not I\nJust could not believe in light of the other things going on across the nation fishy fish right on my ... really right on my street to where I was heading\nSouth ignoring it because we have a nine to ... going on something like that so hard to ignore\nAnd joining me now is bill put it on the mayor of Pittsburgh Mr Mayor and\nWelcome back to meet the press\nPsyche truck let me just start with what you are asking this what new information this morning can you share with us about what more you've learned about the incident a and the killer\nWell there's um a press conference it's scheduled this morning where we will be releasing the names of the victims of the families were notified of yesterday evening and as you can imagine there's a\nLot of sorrow right now within the city [noise]\nYou know many synagogue have protection sadly constantly on because threats are constant or in the Jewish community sometimes are low level sometimes they're very serious [noise] um so sadly this isn't\nYou get a lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nHere are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now Judy power has re Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage rich nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also rank us highest in the nation for mortgage servicing ratio\nAnother way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nBasin right where he said in comparison to get a record spiritual prove only balance or thirty or just turned ... information conditions equal housing Leonard licensing office he said and wants to be thirty three additional conditions are losers may apply\nOfficial methods for Medicare open enrollment thin so now's the time to be open mind looking at everything prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans kind of insurance wise because climb straight\nSoak into your house I found lower ... extra benefits and save money open to something better Medicare DACA\nWill call one eight hundred Medicare today things on their own to be\nPaid for by the U.S department of health and Human Services [noise]\nRenowned medical correspondent and endurance race champion pop are not empty\nPeople ask me how you keep competing at the age is Seventy healthy living is important which so he's saying if you have paint you can't train someone through and I discovered salon past fly to keep bless\nThis unique topical pain reliever contains too safe and effective anesthetics nothing has worked better for salon ... plus cream or wrong [noise]\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former foreign Lincoln and mercury owners are less ... skin receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective take on an air bags and their vehicles to see it\nThese are less ... skin receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective to Kona airbags and their vehicles\nTo see if your vehicle is included and to file a claim to the auto airbags settlement dot com or cold one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six that's auto airbags settlement dot com or one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six [noise] here's\nThe cold hard truth about hard water in our home nearly Ninety percent of America is affected by a hard water contains harsh mineral that can dry out in in here hard water can raise our electricity bill signed up to forty eight percent ... second leader pathogenic bacteria stressed out yet\nStill be so these waters suffers can solve all your hard water is you get the full scoop at a little salt not on a\nWednesday night it looked cool what ... what about what goes to show\nThis is Gary Douglas ... joined me Wednesday night at seven and eight forty one brew house she bought it I'll be joined by head coach Kevin Willis and assistant coaches and players it's cool one eight six point five border quarterback political to show this Wednesday night at seven and eight forty one brew house we water\nOn ... and I'm On a dime boarding W.

able to fix it so it's always somebody else's fault and when that's the world we live in is never going to get better or walk or\nI I Know everybody everybody when when you go to the president says what about this what about what what about this and I would say there's only one president that's right there's a day and they\nThey don't the response within the White House and I spoke to a number of officials is look everyone bears responsibility\nAnd when you put that question to them squarely look he is the president he has the loudest microphones doesn't he they're the largest responsibility they say look he has changed some of his rhetoric he has struck unify no but we're number on friday check he was asked if he is going to tone down the rhetoric he said no he thinks he can actually turn it up now that was prior to\nYesterday's tragic shooting but I think Amy really hits the nail on the head which is that White House officials say this\nYes he feels like he needs to have a unifying notes at the same time we are ten days out from the mid terms and so he knows what he needs to say to fire up his base and a lot of that rhetoric is divisive that's the bottom line\nTurks and David French wrote this and said you know what they'll call this person crazy referring to seize or say Iraq\nHe's an anger angry obsessive and that there's a difference and that the language did matter and he writes that not all listening here's a sober minded are entirely rational and when they hear a public figure they admire thunder against its political punished for extreme language sometimes they they'll take extreme action in response to save it French putting some of the burden on the Britain\nYeah I I think so um I probably have ... putting the burden on the president is how much do you put on him and I think a lot of people want to put a lot of the burden on him where it really does belong on the American people as a whole I'm the president is the American comments section of the White House\nAnd he is the president who does this we're not going to change this president what can we knew the changes that people if we're not going to change the president\nI think aims right no one wants to change but the fact of the matter is this is larger than the president society is crumbling around us politics has amplified at the prisoners amplified it but there's something going on in society as a whole a that is translating into politics and the president's up the cause he's a symptom\nIs the president Joshua\nIs only one true the president bears part of the responsibility of significant part of the authority for the tone of the country\nBut I Will say I do have a fair amount of hope coming out of this and I know it seems very bleak but\nI find a lot of hope and younger people that montage he played in the first second in the program the girl with the future hair she was one of the organizers of gathering dog squirrel ... she got on Facebook\nAnd helps bring people together to just come talk I got a tweet from a guy who I think is in Wisconsin who says I combat the heat of the world by coaching high school debate\nThey learn to see both sides of an issue in how current events relate to real life there was a poll that came out from\nHi combat the heat of the world by coaching high school debate they learn to see both sides of an issue and how current events relate to real life there was a poll that came out from cue recently that found that the younger you are the better you are able on line to discern factual statements have opinions the rights of the older people\nGeneration has grown up the baby boomers blame them but I'm not going to be maybe ... frankly I Know I think it's it's the generations and I'm just a generation removed\nWho have grown up with the advent of social media who haven't been able to navigate at our kids having watched our example another question is whether we will be the queen thing to them a nation that yet remains connected whether this is the beginning of another cultural civil war but\nI come out of this worried but also hopeful that there are people who are taking responsibility for this look what happened after Parkland look what's happening now after school ... there is a generation ready to leave but the question is what will they be leading ...\nThat ... that sounds like you didn't think he continued\nI said I Hope they'll continue on that path\nFair enough constantly on you heard congressman diverse area says that you have not you continue to back people that he says a trapping the traffic ended in hate speech what say\nWell Chuck first off that that simply not true but look with the concerns that that a woman hat and in Pittsburgh look another census active\nHate has strict in yet another community and a place of worship in the United states of America and the Congress has a responsibility to act to keep people safe\nAnd it's not too much to expect leaders to bring us together to unite our country or to find a way to reach out to us to our greater good and make sure that we rise above all of the accusations and the hate and the finger pointing\nChecked so I'm certainly hopeful that we'll see that out of the leader of the free world and that will see that out of each and every one of us individually as well as our colleagues\nI I and I would like to say I'm proud of the way then responded when ... was shot I mean we didn't blame Bernie Sanders when Steve ... was shot we all came together I think we can all come together now or it may take us about nine days for that to happen but I think we can all come together now\nWhile I Want to read something Dan ...\nStart today though Steve is an added layered because today well\nI Hope that I Hope that the finger pointing will stop and we can come together I Believe we need to come together and then I\nHave to tell you I actually think Dan ... is the perfect person to insert into this because he writes the following this is a time of the politics of the apocalypse\nAnd all or nothing new the difference between winning and losing an election and holding power or not holding it politicians say that it's time for the country to come together as you just said what on who's terms I think that is the issue comes in on\nWhat this coming together mean to the Democrats and then I'm going to ask the same question to Congress in ... I'll start with you constantly on\nWell look it's making sure that we're able to reach across the aisle and we can work in a bipartisan basis\nFor Democrats have been clear about is if we're fortunate to win back the house which I Believe we will that we work immediately on lowering prescription drug prices for the American people\nThat we work on a bipartisan infrastructure package to make investments across the country\nAnd that we work together to clean up Washington DC or to find ways to overturn Citizens United to address gerrymandering to improve or an increased transparency and disclosure across the government to restore faith in our political process those are all areas where we can work together and reach across the aisle and find some common ground\nCongress in ... what does it mean to you why do I think I Do think\nWe need to come together or not on anyone's terms but on America's terms we're Americans first I agree with and that infrastructure is something that we all need and we need to come together on lowering prescription drug costs I'm not sure why didn't talk about lowering healthcare costs we need to come together on lowering healthcare costs\nA and I think we can do that we need to listen to each other\nA no matter who takes the majority are and I think we're going to hold the majority but no matter who takes the majority it will be a ... a razor thin majority and hopefully that will mean people will come together Republicans and Democrats\nTo get things done but I Do worry about the you know making sure that we do it in a way that we're focused on getting things done not on just abolishing ice\nOr doing the things that are on the extreme\n... congressman cyber someone asked you about an ad that you're running um last week one of the
