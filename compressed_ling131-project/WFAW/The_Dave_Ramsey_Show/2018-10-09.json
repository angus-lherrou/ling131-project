is\nThey are debt free except their home life saved up their emergency fund a three to six months of expenses and three beam means and beyond that they're saving for the down payment on our house\nWe want to take her two young children to Disneyworld you're should\nWe're currently saving to build our on a new home on property we bought in cash already we can cash flow the trip by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not saving money where's the balance you you're guilty ...\nI mean you're stuck 'cause you're just going to be guilty you're guilty if you go to Disney and you're going to be guilty if you don't\nYou know what I Do I'll be happy about it either one murder will be guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way you're out of debt you have your emergency fund and you're saving up for expenditures\nOne of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash that some awesome go second one is you want to spend one month of that money and go to Disney about three thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel guilty\nEither way but I'll tell you what I Would do I'd go to Disney yellow kids your part is perfect age for that\nUm if he is something you obviously do want to do something they want to do\nJust not something I Want to do but you it's fine I mean retro cruise loves Disney she just took her little baby down there they had a wonderful time not sure how great it time her husband had but they had a great time and I'm now ... but but I mean if it's what you want to do you've saved up\nThe money you're not going into that you're not getting out of debt and going on vacation you're out of that you have your emergency fund this is the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals but I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then you're not enjoying your life\nYou live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps you're extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans till you're ... out of debt and have your emergency fund in place then you let your foot off the accelerator some\nTo where you can do by me steps for

you go on vacation and we don't go ten years and never upgrade the couch that as springs\nAnd the middle of all of that we don't go ten years and never go on vacation\nThat's when you go on vacation and we don't know ten years and never upgrade the couch that as springs sticking out of it that's when you'd upgrade the couch you just pay cash for the stuff and you realize that every time we consume something in slows down our long term wealth building but the purpose of long term what building has to be able to concern and to be able to give\nMoney piled up just for pollen ... having a pile of money sake is not worth anything it's only or something when it does something for your family or you're able to do something for others that's all it's good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDay about ... thank you for taking my call first time caller sure I'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training\nAnd I finally received like commercial helicopter state ticket um however I unfortunately I Need a ... by eighty hours or more training as I discovered a there is any industry is highly regulated by insurance\nAnd in order to become a sure why NATO out two hundred hours and I'm trying to figure out how to pay for eighty hours and be ready to work the upcoming she and I'm as a commercial up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a co pilot you know the hours\n[noise] no I ... a day or a job are there any out is the single pilot\nThat moment you just said the wrong thing you should do the job opportunity there's only one person and Florida are you know like ... what's wrong\nWell I I didn't call you know thing or two days I I work at a firefighter\nShow that's my primary um income choice there so it's kind of like a secondary thing that I kinda went off in there and that's a that's kind of why I'm I'm kind of limited as far as the jobs that I ... I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than ...\nI Know or believe it or not firefighter a definitely make more\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter\nPilot yes yes that's that's what I Want to do [noise] okay um\nAnd you show U.S forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work in a regular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited value\nYeah ...\nIt's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like I'm sort of hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just I feel I'm I'm too far and to to just I'm not suggesting\nYou quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it\nMakes sense to do anything except to slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do their hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job done me up\nAnd they don't charge not worth that much\nYeah\nIt doesn't pay that much either\nThat's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're paying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training in the first year\nNo mayor right\nNow show not mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for a place\nI mean you've got connections in the fire department other lifelike guys or something that you can get some hours and the co pilot street and get some option landings and get some of the council virtually\nForks and those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently\nFind a lot of them that were ... aircraft gotcha not even a turbine yet but um I mean I Am even reached out to people that own their own aircraft and and you know offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get does or Jerry ...\nAnd unfortunately a lot of those guys are very busy so I can get our air and our there but nothing really counts as\nTo who you're going to end up paying for these hours for dessert to eighty hours cost\n[noise] well considering some of the hour and a source of a you know on the cheap you can get 'em at two fifty a three hundred five hundred at all and on the aircraft and what kind of\nA deal you ... you know so\nBecause you know twenty thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much already my chair and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on\nJust take your time and cash flow it because you you now have as we continue to end the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level\nUm ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can do even more and so this is slightly above\nA hobby yeah yeah definitely ... passionate yeah why not you are out\nThere is nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah\nYeah and I I've got a I I collect handguns and shoot them a lot\nAnd uh and in shop burned through some MOH a but it's a panel make any money doing them I'm trying to make money doing it but it was just a hobby\nAnd so that costs money hobbies costs are on and this was not going to cost you money it's actually gonna make you a little once you get past this but up until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just going to put another twenty thousand bucks into this thirty dollar much of this before you get\nPaid and um that may take you two years to cash flow that instead of one you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season want to pay for it in return you promise to work there are three years or something like that you know\nAnd they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody looking for a pilot that you know that much intensity\nOr sometimes are unemployed here or will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on board if they're having trouble finding the help in that area to hell in destruction [noise] interesting [noise]\n\n\n\n\nGet off why are Hindu and\nLive a\nVery cool ... she's the latest avenger is yeah right right\nSo of course what about you what is your key to getting out of bed what do you tell people the budget and what else\nIs probably the like the being intentional with your money I think all my life I just knew how to make money and spend it and understand what the budget and just your plan I was like man this is crazy crazy how how much life can change\nAnd I go like it's it's just insane I married the first time we ever did or budget thinking we make a ton of money [laughter]\nI think this is I did not think we made this much and we can do this yeah it does\nGive you hope that enough to vote you sit down and you kind of have that moment feel like I got a raise I Know this for\nYears and now we're like we're on we just started step for last month so that was the first time we're going man this is this is just unreal we're\nGoing to be a millionaire yeah I'm actually what are you are you really are I mean it really does happen all the time and I was pretty amazing very cool so how did you tell a lot of people you're doing this or you're a quiet about it for this thing\nFor the first one was like I was so bad with money growing up for the first month or like a year maybe kind of kept it just with a ... and then after that my sister who's also here\nShe kind of started asking me questions to she knew I was with money going you know what are you doing it I'd give her all your books because we think the whole library mhm so but uh then so he told my mom dad

three years and you had no payments\nWhich was ... it took me a long time to figure this out\nI wasn't smart enough to figure it out as early as they do well do I wasn't either I'm fifty six\nOh no one in three or who may be mine so you might as well\nYou might as well be worry you might as well make the decision when are you going to make the decision you're most powerful wealth building tool is your income when you spend the\nAverage car payment which has five hundred and six dollars over eighty four months right now according to national editors association when you spend the average car payment\nInstead of spending it on a ... but car cash for your cars is what rich people do pay cash for your\nCars is with rich people do I put guys from our cars we will no darling you will be rich people\nYou start paying cash for your cars may mean your drought junk for a little while and then drove a little better drunk middle America you move up\nBut right now we're gonna pay cash and instead of putting five hundred dollars towards the prosperity Ford Motor credit here\nAnd put it towards your prosperity and if you put five hundred and six dollars power for hours you put a mutual fund in your Roth IRAs got a good track record from age thirty age seven to you'll have between five and six million dollars\nIn that account touch your car\nRedrawing the five million dollar car regime and if you don't know if I were in our car payment does what you're driving\nAnd when we look I'm Still in the dictionary well so your picture\nYeah that's right because you're financing

security\nUh and the other one is basically a full and can you do mhm\nNow for the past month the for what can you only get she got it from\nMy weight is mhm so I'm a big concern that if the party to budget mhm sure sure go ahead and the other side is continue paying the minimum on the phone can just be part of the budget or should I go ahead and just okay she'll security\nNot because it's part of the budget and I'm not because of interest rate but because Social Security a repayment on that can have heavy seas and um you're dealing with the government which has no so and so I I Would get them paid as fast as possible because I Would want them out of my life\nAnd show for that reason I'm going to you know that's gonna be the tie breaker twenty eight hundred versus twenty eight hundred on the debt snowball for me and I knocked them out right quick now when you get to the four oh one K. you know you cannot pay extra on a four O. one K. loan monthly you will have to just save up and pay off the lump sum at one time\nI see what you're saying\nThat they will not let you pay an extra hundred dollars on it a month or five hundred dollars a month you just have to pay the whole thing off or pay the payments and so what you do is you just build up a big chunk of savings as your last bit and then when it when your savings gets up to equal to the four oh one K. above your thousand dollar baby step one then you knocked out four one K. loan out as quick as you can\nImagine being denied and apartment because of housing discrimination still wrong but who has the power to stop this\nCome on and on your side if you've been discriminated against because of race color religion sex national origin disability more familial status finally complain but\nUsed to go slush fair housing public service message from the national fair housing alliance\n[noise]\nHuge fans of the people who believe in case something indoor I get home turn into millionaires the original book started everybody talking about this back in the early Nineteen nineties\nWhen I wrote my first book when financial piece came out it was a book called the millionaire next door but Dr Tom Stanley it changed the way everyone thought about millionaires I got to know\n... a little bit a while he was living and I've gotten to know his daughter since then and I'm big fans of each of theirs and we're big fans of course of anyone who's in this millionaire space doing anything\nAnd as you guys know Chris Hogan has a million or a book coming out in January but Sarah for law is with us a Tom Standage daughter and or is this the first time we've ever talked on the airwaves topped off the air and she has a new book coming out of being blown when some of her dad's original research so Hi Sarah how are ya\nI'm good how are you in ... well\nI'm honored the new book is called the next millionaire next door in Deering strategies for building wealth and it it's out this week right\n[laughter] right yeah\nNext door in during the strategies for building wealth and it it's out this week right\nThat's right yeah it's um it was a labor of love without my father but without and river like sides about it\nYou know if you didn't know her her dad passed in a car wreck or four years ago it was it no\nYeah it was a dollar Fifteen that's right yeah he said yeah I'm thinking I remembered that about there and um\nWe had to have him on several times over the years as we discuss this whole subject to millionaires and\nSo although some of the mythology litters around millionaires so you use some of the research from your dad's in Europe are professional researcher to like he was and uh and they put this together tell me about the ... part of it what does this or did you do and more of it was combined with what he had done\nYet I think that's the right to me and work together really on the in this whole survey for the buck on you know really started back in two thousand twelve thinking about the twentieth anniversary of the millionaire next door like that it came out in the nineties\nAnd and work together on kind of what the book should include and got to the point when we were just about to send out a survey I'm shu our sample of a fascinating Americans and he was killed by by a drunk driver\nOn and so really he wasn't able to see the data that came back and compare it to what was there and Nineteen Ninety six and Andy On 'em and that's kind of where I took up a second project and and kept going with it\nSure is an industrial psychologist and president of data points about a research and\nTechnology company that studies wealth accumulation and build tools to help and you guys have to check this outage\nUm data points dot com has all the stuff on her research as well which you can get the new book the next millionaire next door enduring strategies for building wealth at any major bookstores show the moved out of it you guys got\nAs you put this back together on the anniversary and then you've added to it since with your\nContinued research what were the ... was there anything that just shocked to win the findings where you should go out and see that one coming\nOut you know we were a lot at um some of them escaped though in that kind of behaviors that millionaires make related cue investing and I think what was tied in with\nYou know just like any of us that are trying to do the right thing um millionaires make mistakes along the way to end that will lead to a lot of us are going to have areas and the other than to take the role that they make really good and bad things about the rising\nThen I think what was the timing was that a lot haven't things in terms of the kinds of or rather the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that but some of those things are surprising that were sort of similar time\nYeah I was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the\nA key points that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this one of the things you have to do if you want to build wealth is you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become who you hang around with and I see on the back of your book and understanding how those around you influence your financial buddy here's what did you find on that\nYeah absolutely I think that again you see it's very clear from the work that we've done both with populations in and out\nEvery every day so it's like I like that they are um that that that social and defense that not caring about what others driving and buying and wearing is are really key factor in building well no it's related to them that were regardless of how old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know now with technology it really hard to ignore what other people are doing virtual media and so forth but it continues to be a factor are just not caring about what other people is and you know this is one of the wave itself well\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits of going broke what God did in my twenties where his violently was ... at that point I just reached all I wanted to do survive and thrive and and I reached a point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people don't and I think there was a big contributor to me\nPersonally to be able to to build wealth again after going bankrupt but I see it with other people is when you don't care what other people think about what your drive where you live what closure where whether you've been on vacation you're not trying to keep up with other people's Facebook version of themselves then you've got the ability to win\nAbsolutely and I think like he said I think that that on Facebook version I live in a lot different right and what's really going on in our lives too so that something is keep in mind but we definitely see that and the research\nTo gaining knowledge and composer to invest in grow will that is a great word come closer to grow world what do you mean by that\n[noise] but you know study that related to making it and when that comes fine mess but it really you know you could apply to any kind of major financial decision they are making matter to\nThe kind of comedy as hell before making this decision so I Know they example we get sometimes there's death and it rained not a great time to go out and look for in a car because you're not a skier and an emotional state where\nYou are so excited about the new income level that you have all of a sudden your decision making is a little off so he can stay home and come as\nA matter what the financial ... bar then you'd have a better chance of making the right one\nAnd I I all of a sudden here we've got a ... personalities as a career show on you know choosing a career and there's all this stuff about following your passion out there\nBut you guys have you found yet again in this new set of data the idea that ate a lifestyle related freedom does not equate to less income or less wealthy it actually ... to greater engagement greater will the new\n[noise] yeah you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding that looking at your passion or or your interests let's say for your career happy ground in some kind of reality and and I think that's something that\nYou know a lot of people don't want to hear but it is true and so um if he had an accent for the arts and that's really where you want your career to go out and you know you have to take that with the reality is that mean certain things are going to have to be set aside\nFor that kind of again it's a ... a lot of I don't want to hear but um we can have acted happy here in Seville though\nYou know there's a price to be paid to build wealth and it's worth the price and nobody else does it accidentally they'll do it with a plan\nI absolutely yeah that that's one of the things that we can't thing over and over again and again whatever time out millionaires or does that are on their way to becoming a millionaire but\nThat time than planning and and looking at your goals and monitoring what's going on in your whole life and not you know sort of keeping your head in the stands I'm betting that relates to building off every time the that the ... court thing I go to is well\nWe're talking with Dr Sarah Stanley silo of I'm I'm I'm from mispronouncing your last night I don't say it correctly\nSo la la la la la yeah I'd say\nHome we've got one on there and are still mess it up sir I'm so sorry law and a daughter of Dr Tom Stanley a comic work called the millionaire next door a lot of you've read it if\nSo messed up sir I'm so sorry ... and a daughter of Dr Tom Stanley a iconic work called the millionaire next door a lot of you have read it if you had insurance and you need to read Sarah's new book that she did combined with her dad's\nResearch project that they were working on together

them for years we'd love that she's got a book out come in the same year that we do and we want love helping her we want you to go by this book right now it's called the next millionaire\nNext door Sarah thank you for being with us today\nFrom the time I had I mean [laughter] this is the Dave Ramsey shot [noise]\nI'll probably do that and probably get around to sleep in the same room with the box it'll be just going to actually learn it you know by its losses\nAnd um it it didn't I didn't [laughter] so um I was still over drafting and actually it was I Believe it was April twenty Fifteen when she came up just to say over my apartment so she could fly out of Minneapolis to do or that free scream and I'm like she knows my situation\nAnd she ... she will see that on open box and she will give me a lot of crap because she knows and I can't have that are good sister rules are exactly so I'm like before she gets here I'm signing up for a class and that was the\nMotivating factor so I finally got it so it's her fault\nFor minimum\nWage to do her debt free scream you get shamed in the process causes you to be here to there your debt free\nSharing Zach I'll take it that work such good family stuff right there\nAnd I should say it ends up being a pretty good book into because I went out of them got out of debt and this last April and um the singles at my church decided to go on

other things that's about a thousand bucks and it's okay thanks\nAnd so I just do that and then I go on to the Montana trip come back and\nCame back and look and uh my Lehman was out so all of\nThe tires were were just shredded and there are other things wrong so in a five week period I had twenty three hundred dollars for the repairs plus a vacation and I was able to cash flow the whole
