I Would not want to pick up the premiums on a half a million dollar policy on there's a whole lot policy because\nIt's twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a port right of return that when you die they keep your money so our whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned by half a million dollars or whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got determined\nProduct\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance symbolizes proper on you and your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and say bad\nI'm I'm going to go ahead and suggest you dropped that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't want anything to paint by something you know and I think you have on well it's\nNot only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yep 'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm a question uh regarding up part of my retirement savings sure ... I called him ... from my company and that overall is a bad\nGuy eight percent of my total as ... and\n... or ...\nWell it's I mean a per se it's projected to be or at a project retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that that would be a binding eight percent of my total have had you know and\nAnd the question is whether they can carry a lump sum\nYes or okay\nNow here's why okay if you die are not way she died when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all going to die or get when you die a that\nMoney's gone 'cause it's a pinch again\nAnd you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there emerged in may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there is this Robert benefit\nThe money's gone it's gone and if you live are as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market so it ... if you had an account and the investment advisor said\nOK stable got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you can make five percent on your money and when you die\nThe money's gone before\nYou get that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family\nWell that'd be a better deal right\nYeah [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah there was a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity\nBut ... so it's still you know if you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you do the same concept ... show the piano bottom line is it's got a decent\nBut low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die\nMakes this a bad deal and so you\nAlways take pension lumps on almost always type engine lumps arms enroll them die of race and invest them and good roast our mutual fund so it sounds like your network cynics us from a million\nA year so close to too\nClose to ... and that's probably about four oh well they're total total now where the assets house ...\nCongratulations how old are you I'm sixty three way to go how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my um my family and my wife came in for\nA a millionaire or that ... before that happened\nA millionaire both for my wife's mother passed away yes\nUh when my mom my my parents were eligible young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern or because of the amount you inherited is ... maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nSince I was home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool is I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell that twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means they are a modest lifestyle which we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I've done a stupid thing which I think you can limit\nIs saying that that should do along the way that's good I like that they make tacos\nMcKay every every everybody listening right now yeah he is has done or will do stupid\nThings but then you can minimize those ... along the way and\nLive a modest lifestyle live below you mean um yeah Lloyd\nSo do you think there'll be done to not twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now and finished listening to me right now\nBut he is probably a probably even higher if they stay minimize stupid you know maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and the ... all the math on that works to your benefit a at a Wal alive\nAnd if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor sure you come out three hundred grand I had\nA thank

gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're probably\nTar and I'm not sure we're going to move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything

car and I think the two of you know I think you're going to be making enough money but then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth about making about a little over a hundred but instead it has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven dollars an hour from the ... a year for two years we can keep her car but if you're not willing to do that as I household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble
