the show the sixty\nUm [noise] if we if we continue on this course where how are you from literally sold everything so the rest of it's just going to be working really hard I think it's going to be

paying the mortgage and wanting to know what to do whether he should fool with us or not and whether you have a credible by or work it out or however\nNone of our summer what you told me so far sir\nYes oh okay so the the ramp renting out Ninety five thousand dollars on a house that's what it takes to pay the mortgage off correct\nCorrect\nOkay and the next thing you need to do is you need to talk to a real estate agent and find out what this house was actually\nBecause right now you don't know\nYeah I don't I don't know I don't know exactly who it is my wife my wife is a great grandma so I Know where I live on the lower than it was a it's a hundred and three of them but I don't know if that's even ... they're not\nAre not like it's not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes\nOkay if you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great a by that is being okay by it's not like you're getting right great deal there where you just went wow that's the best deal ever ride this is I'm not sure if I'm\nLike to even get kicked out 'cause someone gated or should I leave or should I should I go back ran over well where\nNo one on the long term whether you want to know\nWhy he we kind of didn't want to own because we got a daughter she's four and my wife scene that school and now so we get is trying to kind of settled down right now mhm\nHave you got every angle area it's like I say my wife great grandma's house that she can hear her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres\nMhm and um it's kind of in a country well part of Atlanta gotcha okay and how old are you to uh my\nWife she turned twenty yesterday and that and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days so we both twenty now\nMhm and you've got a a one child who said and how much do you have\nA we don't have any debt okay and what's your household income\nUh make uh every year but I'm trying to get in school but I had to kind of work with the center that was how much are the ones on on my house um I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month and your wife doesn't work [noise]\nOkay that's pretty ... that's ... on your budget\nIs is very tight on your budget\nYeah and we found out about you not too long ago one of my friends from turkey recommended me start listening to you but now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff going out to eat and we're already kinda\nYou know trying to start it\nIf the minimum age I listen to you but now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff going out to eat and we're already\nKinda you know trying to start it off a little better and\nYou do it good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the uh the relatives that are involved that would be the air's a this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren that would be the air\nSince there was no will someone would have to petition the court you'd have to get a lawyer and go to probate court and probate court would have to rule that the house could be sold and would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now yeah I Know\nWith all the new the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now\nIs anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages paid I doubt they are going to get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should I feel kind of want to actually start even going into real estate 'cause I Do construction that's what I Do know I kind of this house is kind of it's not me to kind of a matter of fact the last\nFew years she yeah a hidden and like other relatives staying there kinda beaten it up so I I mean I don't know if it's like maybe weren't more maybe you know what I'm saying they Lincoln flipping and get another house or am I Lived\nThere unless you become the owner of it\nYeah and and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to you'd had I see in a state might learn anything they did hurry up and now like my aunt's name or should I tell you what I Would\nDo if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from the south some day when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it\nYou're probably not gonna bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking\nAbout okay so uh what I Would do is pay the rent or pay that payment of rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't fret about becoming the owner today it's inexpensive rent in the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend\nOn it just say or to fix it up\nMoney you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be in it's going to be a really\nStrenuous process with the courts to become\nThe owner of this because we don't even know who the errors are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of the day and this is not that many on 'em\nOr that they actually even know about it like I said we we been here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried\nThat I'll stand your pain or you know I just keep paying it in because that's the only man that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYet but I'm I'm just worried like can't nobody command me out 'cause it's not in my name\nYeah they're going to get you out\nPeople that only can there are the heirs but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nAnd they're yeah they're far away they're like in another state and yeah but they're not they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah\nThey're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than a vote on it\nIf it was valuable now there'd be some sharks in them are are circling right but it's not got any ... because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it because some of that you're just gonna walk off and leave it\nYeah 'cause 'cause I've already done paying eight and ... before they need some something you know and I met my wife had because\nThat's my money whatever money you spend or make her happy is money is\nGone when you leave because there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing to probate court\nAnd get to be transferred to your name and you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent\nTo a place you kinda like living\nAnd uh you know six hundred bucks rent in line is not a bad gig on two and a half acres so I'm sitting there in front of you for now a\nSmell hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just going to move along\nQuite worried about being the owner\nAnd then if you really want to be the owner than getting ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the ... court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need\nTo sign on it and that's what you're facing so it's an interesting situation but um my guess is it's not worth any more than his vote on it my guess is ill as probably fairly close on this\nIf we thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks is a relative sought his worth two hundred thousand bucks a Ninety thousand was owed and they were going to get a hundred thousand their pocket want to show\nNo sharks would already been circling they would have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the courts Lou it when you die without away all you have to go in and the judge has to you know authorized the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs are just like it would in a wheel\nBut it's just a lot bigger mess\nAnd do you can't get clean title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it any other way than doing it properly and getting clean title could you won't be able to do it if you don't get clean title so that's how you do it if you decide to do it later but for today I was treated as cheap rent\nIt's a rental house how much money would you spend on a rental house that you're going to move often you don't home nothing [noise] not any that's what you would do hope that helps ma'am thanks for calling him this is the day Ramsey show\nYou're a survivor I don't know if you know this or not there is a
