Facebook is there a mileage limit you use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm know what I'm trying to determine is is the car worn out to the point is going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it\nIn other words a hundred thousand miles dodged neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nBlack one is used up and the other one is just getting started at that point you know what I'm saying\nThe ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point\nI don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay it's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well built I mean ... again a Honda Alexis a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on it I wouldn't do anything about that\nIt's got easily another hundred in it and maybe another three hundred and depending on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we kind of depends on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought I drove until I got about sixty or know got got about fifty something on it\nAnd um so it was a very low mile car when I got rid of it the other day\nAnd um\nSo you know you just you're looking at that your situation and to what\nIs the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more than ... miles where they have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know I Can't because I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is less than it was so cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nThinking I take them off Sherman what's up\nI'm standing on a high cocaine yeah I've got about three thousand dollars and the count out donating shut eye and then if I knew what China and\nYou're going to college\nYeah community college with a cause for entertainment and olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program or maybe ... survey that type of a charity and I keep them at the community college of either and you know our first\nYeah you know I Will be true if you get some search someone certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that\nOkay so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer or you want to be an hour or whatever mhm okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus\nUm you can invest it\nAh here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine finish college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you\nMight need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and has a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know maybe I'll talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account to stage\nA with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal\nFor you is your friend is for you to get your degree\nAnd your field of study whether it's a two year or the certifications and the ... tech field or\nOr whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream\nWithout any that and that\nThree thousand dollar spin on that is more important than than the mutual fund and so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise]\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones at AAA eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nI'm Gray Davis an honor to speak with you you too sir what's up in your world\nDon't my wife and I are currently on baby step forward and look at things with them for retirement and we're using the access our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our gross take home pay\nOur dilemma is when we say an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we're already contribute we don't have much left over how motivated coloration so\nWhen we think the ... percent ah we're able to save a lot for a mortgage to tolerate\nThe is it okay to do that or am recommend saving their twenty four\nPercent now the the mandatory amount that you're putting in are you ... are you vested in that is that a ... choosing an investment for that or as a pension\nGets attention there's no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you\nCorrect that the weight on sixty thousand or a okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent yeah okay\nSo the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect\nGuy I probably would split the difference because I don't like the pension\nWe're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly run state and now we're ... those guys\nAh yeah no thank you so\nUh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a phone line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we can or for then that means we need to put in ten percent right you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood as well not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horrid\nOh I get but it's there and we'll probably get some odd but I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere to be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and goes round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting them Fifteen Percent on top or something like that not only celebrate\nYour mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it was a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so I'm\nYou know go do it that that's what that's what I Would do a backing off a little bit\nAppreciate your joining us but it's just that I ... [noise]\nAnd their show up for financial peace and they're not game on because they're scared and they don't think they can do this the the whole hasn't kicked in yet the belief housing kicked in yet\nWhat do you tell them they need to do to be debt free one of the things you need to do if you want to pay off sixty nine thousand dollars in nine months we don't do that and you start your hand start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's kind of a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team in his own as to if you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nOne of the main things that someone needs to do to get out of that\nBudget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just flies through the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much\nFor less troop generally true have soil I also think that\nThey need to focus on why they're doing it and to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that my reason why it might not be the exact same reason as his wife but the end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward ... okay cool what was your why\nRight here I I I like um kids yeah and your family tree I just the legacy I listen to a lot of your staff and a lot of other um had cats on legacy and love for leaving behind and I think that um if we want to see change like we have to start teaching at\nMm mhm modeling it in teaching it yeah I can change your family tree that's a big reason people will do stuff to change the direction of their family that they would never do for themselves and and it it's a bigger and more noble why\nThan just a I Want to go on vacation someday you know what you if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else but in the process of doing that you do change the trajectory of your family tree\nSo very well done good you guys very cool very cool or do you have a lot of cheerleaders along the lawyer for some people that kind of went and I think you'd be more nuts\n[noise] you know we have a we had some than we had some of the flip side right I'm you're going to have something in return to play down but you know I think the one thing we had some good mentors that were local that were definitely coaching his on keeping us going not only through our you know scenario but also helping us lead a few so definitely\nMhm but not so when he came home that first time and said uh we just bought this car it's killing me I'm listen to this podcast I Want to do something different where you resist under judicial I Will finally you woke up\n[laughter] I Know I had a pet in my stomach when we bought the car law and so\nAnd like and traditionally I knew that was not the right choice and we kind of felt that pull that we needed to do it he played your ... cats on a date night physically remember that date night [laughter]\nThat is so on romantic [laughter]\nFor him I mean we we listen to that ...
