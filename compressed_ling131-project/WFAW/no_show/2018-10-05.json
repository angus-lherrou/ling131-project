I Want to get to a game that I Am playing and I'm not quite sure that this to me is my last of the week I've been talking about an ... for a while on the show and so I'm curious what your explanation of this line is Baltimore Ravens going on the road\nTo face a rookie bigger may feel no I Know everybody loves her main field and there's a lot of bigger hype and I think\nThat's one of the reasons to be honest one of the browns are only three point underdogs in this game at home\nIn Baltimore to me looks darn good and I don't understand why there are only three point favorites in this game is it only because of the Baker high visit because Cleveland's at home and argue with me that this is a pretty good bet this week at Baltimore minus three\nI think a lot of it has to do with the Cleveland Browns being at home we've seen her home underdogs win the super contest which is essentially the biggest contacts in Las Vegas for NFL betting\nGo through it go eight three and one so home underdogs have done quite well but they're both that said I Am right there with you Cleveland gave up so many points in that last oh when they just couldn't hold that leave\nYour father brown seeing that I Know that they were able to win that game against the jets but bigger may be able to really had to put on a second half perform in order to get\nThat when I get the jets that we've seen in the past couple of weeks be really really bad at one of my plays of the week in the ravens Ryan is three and taught him right there with you\nKnow I'm so happy to hear you say that because I Am I I look at that line and I was just confused I was like man I\nMight want to really consider a betting against Cleveland a lot this year just because of the hard knocks singing Baker Mayfield but because that that\nThat is an interesting tactile home dog said at one end or at home so I so I'll go to another one here the Elana falcons into Pittsburgh Steelers the first thing I said when I looked at that this game was a matchup Greg was I'm betting the over and then I look at the over and I see that it's a fifty eight\nIs at a safe bet to go fifty eight over fifty a Pittsburgh Steelers defense those terrible without a Ryan says here and the Atlanta Falcons defense banged up too good quarterbacks I I Know you're going to say it's projected to be a ton of points in the game but it's fifty eight too high to go on the overall anything\nI think that they're the eight is a little bit too high because that means that both teams are going to need to get over ... ... they are going to need to get over twenty eight points for the thing that had well if you're going to need something completely one sided like\nYou're going to need it came to score forty two and I just don't see that happening in the Steelers the offensive awful and Brian cheesier went out we saw them give up so many points to not wild card game to Jacksonville\nThe defense really what's holding against the ravens even though if I remember correctly they only gave up twenty eight points in that game but\nBy the Steelers the Pentagon's been bad we saw the falcons give up over thirty five points the Bengals the next ... watts as well\nBut what's that said something's gotta give here these are an F. L. D. fences and the other thing that had trepidation was going over a year for me is\nThe Atlanta Falcons operates under seeing star Kesha has been very hitter Matt Bai it's been a really good all last year there were a lot of struggles and week when we start throwing those as well I just can't go over fifty points is just too many\nOkay so I'll tell you Greg Greg Peterson is our guest of the cold with Steve heighten or along with a high five the super contest podcast you can follow grunt work on Twitter edgy unit underscore eighty one so I'll tell you what I did other than the Baltimore Ravens I please to bet sisters point right now the ravens minus\nThree and I'm hitting on the patriots IDs the patriots down to about minus three I tease the over on the south in Steelers game to about fifty and I he's just saying the Cincinnati Bengals dolphins game down to a pick them so all I Need is for the bangles to win\nSo the bangles minus six I actually think they're Cincinnati can win the game by a touchdown Miami I just don't buy is a good teams but am I a little bit too premature to really be on board\nThe Andy don't bandwagon night right now what do you think of that\nGame and that minus six why\nI think that if you're betting futures of angles to win their division is actually pretty good but I really like what I think from the Cincinnati Bengals age you agreed to Andy don't could actually has been very good the fear\nI mean AJ green is one of the best wide receivers than the NFL and that's the only so many people get any dog a little bit more black then he deserved I Know that the guys I've gotten the job done in the postseason but he's not a very good regular season quarterback so I don't understand why he gets so much black\nAnd the bangles defenses also looks\nPretty nice here I mean obviously life we can get talking for bad very very bad but with that said the bangles as a whole they look pretty strong and\nThat is the north just doesn't look very good I mean you felt the grounds there I don't see the ... going the division and then the Steeler we've seen them take a step back with their defense and the Baltimore Ravens I feel like it's probably more of a nine and Seventeen and I would you really think the bangles can go in there\nI think that the bangles to be able to knock off the dolphin how's that going the way the stick to that point what was that that I think the bangles or get an outright win\nLet's say and they asked the okay that's good so um I I may be the over under the Atlanta Falcons game and fifty you feel safe turned fifty with that\nBut I\nFeel much safer I probably wouldn't if he's there by itself but with that said at fifty I think that you're getting a much better number than try and go fifty eight that there's too many ...\nLet's say in the I guess the one game that is very hard to assess for me as the jaguars and that she's got the best ... in my opinion this is a game between the best off ants in the hottest quarterback\nAnd the best defense and I think Vegas is a little bit confused because they have it right now as basically a pick 'em they're given seats minus three but that basically ... you know the home team gets three points the over under Senate forty nine I think Vegas just overall just confused on this game and they don't really know is\nThat your read on it and if you were to make a play on either a team or the over under what would that play be\nActually pulled the trigger on the on the chief minus three I really like what I see from Showtime old I Am the team was down in a hostile environment in Denver at elevation and he brought them back\nHe had that amazing what's hand in past I mean he looks so calm and cool under pressure and its Broncos even that's pretty good and you still have bought and Miller you still have a good D. V. D. be a\nSecondary back there so I thought that\nI was really impressed by Patrick ... Holmes the guy had zero interceptions it here yeah making that decision I Need to essentially the second best started of any quarterback in NFL history along with Peyton Manning who had that amazing without their games so I just think it's really hard to go against Patrick were home the Jacksonville Jaguars\nRebuild a little bit of oil a couple of weeks ago when they lost the titans by that by the time to fix game that was just ugly I Know that they knocked off the jets last week that that they in a whole lot a lot\nAnd I felt like there win against the patriots was a little bit artificial just because we have seen the patriots have early season struggle because they were without Julian Edelman a well they're defensive driving around in the form\nAnd I'd just they'll have a tough time trusting by ... yeah I think that he's now a more bit here quarterback but I just can't tell them as being a really good quarterback\nBut I Do think that Patrick ... is one of the most special players Wi Fi in the NFL ... chief made it\nHonestly Greg I don't trust any of these quarterbacks ...

you let the play by play for the call out yeah come on man he's probably a former players\nDo whatever I think you look at it but it's just that bugs me Andy Dalton three hundred yards and three

what we're going to see it has not been a fluke are you ready to believe and Andy Dalton\nI'm ready to believe in Andy ... he's had been one of those seasons that the passing game is they're\nThey're running game there even without Joe mixing Giovanni Bernard step in in being that that that he was in a brought into the league as a kitchen receivers are catching the running back to ... run in between is more like outside runner so I I like what the bagels can make of ourselves as a side I'm ...\nI Love their front for I Love Carlos ... that he can get to the quarter\nBut that's the thing that got to consistently get to the quarterback and there are secondary got some problems but Cincinnati defense has holes in it will see that this is an offensive legally we we got a lot of teams this year Bobbie\nWho have got tremendous on fences and bad defenses and no it's not look the numbers were seeing this year it's not just because of the rules we have in place we have really smart ... minds in football who are getting quarterbacks to a federal level Cincinnati is a good example that\nBaltimore is a better example of that and also Bobby younger players were seeing a fence employers for the most part being drafted higher\nYou know you you I Would rather take as if I see a\nTight end and the defensive and on the board okay and I think they're both equal\nI think you take this might end in the second round Baltimore took to the point bottle are stacked up ... and the ... that's another reason why we're seeing so many point we're seeing a lot more pull young players Lamar off into\nPlayers being trapped in the first three rounds that address Joe mix and practicing Giovanni Bernard not for the bangles don't look the running situation going to be really interesting for

Tennessee\nPlayed such an incredibly ridiculously stupid soft his own they they complete the for Santa Fifteen patch and then you have a holding penalty on third down and then you have a pass interference on another third down and then what do you know tendency scores the game when he touched down for the eagles have written Ben's on their mind is is it just me or do you or it's Philly just [noise]\nI feel they have a rational competing I feel like they they\nBecause they won the super bowl I I just think we as the NFL public thinks that they are better than they actually are just

football so on the network every Tuesday night Christ on where you can find him as the em ups are good I Want to start with what I\nThink it's going to be the most interesting game of the weekend and that's the chief and the jaguars best off ... against the best deep at one of the reasons that I think\nPatrick mom's is as good as he is ... and obviously he's got tremendous skill Kareem hot in the backfield has been extremely effective anti we talked earlier this week about the importance of cream onto the teams the jaguars obviously our staff defensively how do you see cream Hans outlook fantasy why this weekend\n[noise] [noise] well I I think a lot of it depends on the help of Sammy Watkins Matt because we have not seen the cream hunt usage that we had before and what I mean by that is he's not getting as many Kerry and the fact that he's not really much of a factor in the path in game as well and it's\nYou know we see Patrick my home and just the way they able to just push the ball down field which has been really good\nBut the problem is he rushed Nineteen time for a hundred and Twenty one yards and John that's great three catches for fifty four yards he was the focal point of the ... but it will be re has a tendency to get away from things early so I think he's going to be a borderline running back one against that jaguars he's\nNot All right let's stick with the running game uh you know I obviously levy on Dell is out James Caan or has kind of been up and down if you're James Connor and you have the falcons deep and still look at who has two key injuries and Keanu Neal a Andy On Jones it can we expect change counter to have a big week\n[noise] I don't think you're looking at I'm having a a big week just to the fact\nThat he rushed nine times for Nineteen yard and was targeted seven times and and had three catches the problem with the Steelers and what's happening now is the fact that we're better off with burger gets to the scrimmage the ability to audible so naturally quarterback got an audible and it's something that he can throw the football so\nWhy are we going to be the bell cow and they take care of it\nHe's an RV too at best and that's just the Steelers are throwing the ball more\nHe didn't have any red zone trips do consider this that once they got into the red zone they didn't run the ball at all so they should but will they\nI don't I don't know he's still definitely a plug in ways that running back but he's got an R B to feeling\nChris ... is our guest runs the fantasy football show every Tuesday right here on this network SB Nation radio you can follow Christ is work on Twitter at ... am to us so I had a friend tax me today and I figured I Would pass this question along to you because I knew we were going to watch I talked fantasy football so\nHe said hey I'm In a two quarterback league and I of Cam Newton against the giants Jared ... against the sea hawks and big band against Atlanta I can only start to who should I go with I told him and all amended all day I'll call them up after you know tomorrow and tell them if you tell me differently\nBut I told him to do with Jared golf against the Seahawks because you are at this point in my opinion you just have to start Jared golf every week and big band against Atlanta because of the injuries but I like cam against the giants as well so can I guess the giants go up against the the ... big been against Atlanta you can start to who are you going with\nOh my God that's like ... that that's such a hard\nQuestion I told I told him you couldn't really go wrong but because you\nCan't go wrong but but if I have to go to I'm going to go to the same way I'm gonna go Jared ... and I'm going to go big band ... you can't say the guy that route for four hundred and sixty five yards and five touchdowns against what looked like I said look like\nA very good defense on paper in the Minnesota Vikings right and you mentioned the match up against the falcons the falcons right now\nMatt you look at these lineups and any time that he was playing the falcons you know that you're going to put in that passing games so I have absolutely no reservations and going but go off and and big bad you can't go wrong with any three of those especially with the other matchup against your giants but\nGo golfing big band of the way that I Need to\nTwo part question here the Cincinnati Bengals are going up against the Miami Dolphins I actually have money on this game\nThe bangles to we really really believe in Andy do the ones that I don't believe in Miami at all in terms of longevity throughout the rest of the season\nBut I Do kind of like their defense and I am hesitant to start to really trust the Andy Dalton so\nIs Andy Dalton becoming like any tone than Joe Flaco to me Chris have both elevated their game this year but I'm just not sure if I can trust them moving forward so I'll ask you Andy Dalton against the dolphins and Joe Flaco on the road against the Cleveland Browns can we trust both of them if not who do you trust more\nLike a dog and more than I trust Flaco I still think that Cleveland defense is very very good I think they're very they're very undervalued and fantasy community oh look at the numbers that any don't put up last week yeah it was against the falcons but he was twenty nine forty one\nAnd the first half or two for sixteen two hundred and eleven yard and two touchdowns but the roads that he's making that it's not necessarily the volume\nIt grows the girl that he made the ha green at the end of the game was absolutely fantastic uh and before that you can find Tyler board for a couple of work down convergence so he's putting the ball on the money Tyler I heard is is the last I think that's bigger than people realize but\nFor a couple of Fort down convergence so he's putting the ball on the money Tyler I heard is is the last I think that's bigger than people realize\nBut he finally got a reliable number two the first one they've had since ... the new up and Tyler Boyd I think ... gonna continue to swing this ball around he's you know what when quarterback one value this week against the dolphins but I Do like it better than Flaco this week\nChrist hubs is our guest he runs the fantasy football show on this network every single Tuesday night you can follow him on Twitter at C. M. tubs\nAll right so when it comes to send the Los Angeles chargers I'm outside of Keenan Allen if you actually like running a wide receivers three that you gotta still\nAre you trust them either Mike Williams or ...

Jackson wet because Jackson's on a by\nCan I trust either of the Williams to put up numbers against the raiders Louis in the raiders secondaries a mess right now\nBut Keenan Alan ... they do that now when you come to the chargers though their second and third leading receivers are the two running backs that they have so do I trust the either the Williams this week against the raiders Seward susceptible giving up their place\nRight now if you're looking for upside I think the the lower for is high real Williams because Mike Williams he's one of these guys ... for the first three games\nHe didn't have any lesson eighty yards in any one of those games now we only had three targets here why catching the win over the chargers but I mean this they got sick for two twenty he's a great red zone target\nAnd I'll tell you to tune in Allen they've got to Antonio Gates Matt but I'm going to Keenan Alan and the safety net Melvin Gordon rivers has been looking for Mike Williams or just based on the ballot\nOr I think we've got a really good match up he's an upside number or until you figure out how they're exactly going to use them for I Love Mike Williams I ain't going to be a huge Mike Williams supporter for the entire year\nAll right so let's say that I have a car similar ... uh and I have Aaron Rodgers a which one of those two words you would actually both of those I don't know actually I don't know anybody who would have Carson winter Enron so I'll just compare that\nCarson when so I think it's kind of under achiever than Aaron Rodgers has under a cheap which one of them are going to bloom and the second half of the season to saint which has a better chance if not both\nI think over the course of the second half Carson was was coming back up at a steel I thought he looked really good last week in their off against Tennessee uh I think when you when you're talking about the long term Aaron Rodgers that he is not going to get better and it could progressively getting worse\nAnd I'd like to I'd like to position players a skilled players a lot more pulled out the what you're getting often Jeffrey back and Zach urge and ... and Jay jockey and Nelson Aguilar and you're outside the box ...

Peterson of that goal was the pioneer along with high five super contest podcast you can follow a grudge work on Twitter edgy unit underscores eighty one\nRegret I Want to get to a game that I Am playing and I'm not quite sure did this to me is\nMy last of the week I've been talking about a ... for a while on the show\nUm and so I'm curious what your explanation of this line is a Baltimore Ravens going on the road to face a rookie Baker may feel no I Know everybody was bigger Mayfield and there's a lot of Baker hype and I think that's\nOne of the reasons to be honest why the browns are only three point under dogs in this game at home but Baltimore to me looks darn good and I don't understand why they're only three point favorites in this game is is it only because of the Baker high visit because Cleveland's at home and argue with me that this is a pretty good bet this week at Baltimore modest three\nI think a lot of it has to do with the Cleveland Browns being at home we've seen a whole underdog ... through ... which is essentially the biggest contacts in Las Vegas for NFL betting\nGo ... go eight three and one so home underdogs have done quite well but if you're ... or that that I Am right there with you we wouldn't gave up so many points in that last the or when they just couldn't hold that lead\nYou all for the wrong thing that I Know that they were when that game against the jets but bigger may be able to really had to put on a second hair perform in order to get that went\nAgainst the jets game that we do about a couple of weeks be really really bad at one of my plays of the week days or even find the dream team right there with you\nBut I'm so happy to hear you say that because I Am a I looked at that line and I was just confused I was like man I might want to really ... that are\nA betting against Cleveland a lot this year just because of the hard knocks thing a Baker may feel but because that that that is an interesting staff\nDo home dogs they don't want to or at home All right so I'll go to another one here the Atlanta Falcons into Pittsburgh Steelers the first thing I said when I looked at that this game was a matchup Greg was I'm betting the over and then I look at the over and I see that it's a fifty eight\nDays at a safe bet to go fifty eight over fifty eight Pittsburgh Steelers defense looks terrible without a Ryan shows ear and the Atlanta Falcons defense banged up too good quarterback I I Know you're going to say it's projected to be a ton of points in his game but at fifty eight too high to go on the overall and you say\nI think that there is a little bit too high because that means that both teams are going to need to get over there are going to need to get over twenty points for the thing that hit well if you're going to need something completely one sided like you're going to need a team to score forty two and I just don't see that happening\nAnd it would be better off open Brian Jersey or what are we saw them give up so many points to not wild card game to Jacksonville does he really was not holding against the ravens even though\nIf I remember correctly they only gave up twenty eight point lead game but in this deal is the president's been bad we saw him to give up over thirty five points the Bengals then that was as well\nBut what's that said something's gotta give here these are do and I told the fences and the other thing that trepidation with going over a year for me is\nThe Atlanta Falcons office under thirty Asian has been very hitter Mitt why don't you know it's been a really good oh why you're there were a lot of struggles and we want we thought ... well I just can't go over to the point is just too many\nOkay so off to Greg Greg Peterson is our guest of the gold with Steve heighten or along with a high five the super contest podcast you can follow grants work on Twitter edgy unit underscore eighty one so I'll tell you what I did other than the Baltimore Ravens a place to bet to this point right now the ravens minus three\nAnd I'm hit ... on the patriots IDs the patriots down to about minus three\nExactly to this point right now the ravens minus three\nAnd I'm hitting on the patriots I tease the patriots down to about minus three I tease the over on the south can Steelers game to about fifty and I he's just saying the Cincinnati Bengals dolphins game down to a pick them so all I Need is for the bangles to win so the bangles minus six I\nActually think that Cincinnati didn't win the game by a touchdown Miami I just don't buy is a good team but am I a little bit\nToo premature to really be on board the Andy don't bandwagon night right now what do you think of that game and that minus six line\nI think that if you're betting futures of angles to win their division is actually a pretty good but I really like what I think from the Cincinnati Bengals age you agreed to Andy ... connection has been very good this year I mean AJ green is one of the best wide receivers than the NFL\nAnd that's the only so many people get any dog a little bit more black then he deserved I Know that the guys I've gotten the job done in the postseason but he's not a very good regular season quarterback so I don't understand why he gets so much black\nAnd the bangles defenses also looks\nPretty nice here I mean obviously life we can get talking for bad very very bad but with that said the bangles as a whole\nThey look pretty strong and that is the north just doesn't look very good I mean you felt the brown there I don't see the ... going the division\nAnd then the Steelers we've seen them take a step back with their defense and the Baltimore Ravens I feel like it's probably more of a nine and seven game and I would you really think the Bengals can go in there I think that the bangles to be able to knock off the dolphins are not willing to stick to that point what was that that I think the Bengals to get an outright win\nLet's say and they asked the okay that's good so I'm I'm a maybe the over under the Atlanta Falcons game at fifty you feel safe and fifty what's that what the deal I feel\nMuch safer I probably wouldn't if he's there by itself well\nWith that said at fifty I think that you're getting a much better number than trying to do that too many ...\nLet's say in the I guess the one game that is very hard to assess for me as the jaguars and that she's got the best ... in my opinion this is the game between the best off ants in the hottest quarterback\nAnd the best defense and I think they get a little bit confused because they have it right now as basically a pick 'em they're given chief minus three but that basically ... you know the home team gets three points the over under Senate forty nine I think Vegas just overall just confused on this game and they don't really know\nIs that your read on it and if you were to make a play on either a team or the over under what would that play be\nI pulled the trigger on the on the chief minus three I really like what I see from Showtime old I Am the team was down in a hostile environment in Denver at elevation and he brought them back he had that amazing about tainted path and he looks so calm and cool under pressure\nAnd its Broncos event that's pretty good I thought bond Miller you still have a good D. V. D. V. a secondary back there so I thought that I was really impressed by Patrick more homes the guy had zero interceptions this year yeah making the decisions I Need to\nEssentially the second best started of any quarterback in NFL history along with Peyton Manning who had that amazing without their games so I just think it's really hard to go against Patrick brought home the Jacksonville Jaguars\nRebuild a little bit of oil a couple of weeks ago when they lost the titans by that time to time to fix game that was just ugly I Know that they knocked off the jets last week that I'd say in a whole lot a lot\nAnd I felt like there were against the patriots was a little bit artificial just because we have seen the patriots have early season ... they were without Julian Edelman a well their defenses riding around in the form\nAnd I just still have a tough time trusting ... yeah I think that he's now a more big here quarterback but I just can't sell them as being a really good quarterback but I Do think that Patrick my home is one of the most special players we see in the NFL ... chief made it\nVery honestly Greg I don't trust any of these quarterbacks and the AFC South Angela Blake mortals Andy ... uh an end to jump to Sean watching I mean who knows what you're going to get on a weekly basis Greg Peterson is our guest that school was the minor along with a high five the super contest pockets\nYou can find all of his work on Twitter edgy unit underscore eighty one\nSo there's a lot of minus three lines this week I'll give you a couple others for under achieving teams in my opinion Minnesota Vikings are playing the Philadelphia Eagles in Philly and the Dallas Cowboys on the road to take on the Houston Texans so of those two games what is your most confident in either a team or an over under in those two games\nThese are two games are really laid off but I Do think the cowboys have your chance to be able to cover that three point spread\nIn the Houston Texans just have not looked like the same team that they were when they had the shot what an ... year this is a game that got really really lucky to win against being\nThere and it was cold last week because ... obviously one port on for some for around like the forty five yard line\nOh that's that is a one hundred and twenty five percent bonus only with the promo code when one twenty five Bobby I

I spent a lot of time after the Detroit game talking about how mapped Patricia really figured this thing out oh double ... you can't just double ... now you can't do that\nBecause you got Julian Edelman running underneath being west Walker and I'm not going to sit here and make the awful stretching the bells because Bobby will come through the glass like he tried to win I compared to ... to marshal books I'm not going to say that John score and it can be the Randy Moss of this team\nBut don't you kind of try and see if that would work for the New England patriots Josh garden\n\nOn play action past is\nSet up the run that this ...

follow Greg's work on Twitter edgy units hundreds or eighty one regret I Want to get to a game that I Am playing and I'm not quite sure that this to me is my last of the week I've been talking about an hour for a while on the show and so I'm curious what your explanation of this line at a Baltimore Ravens going on the road\nTo face a rookie bigger may feel no I Know everybody loves Baker Mayfield and there's a lot of Baker hype and I think that's one of the reasons to be honest why the browns are only three point under dogs in this game at home but Baltimore to me looks darn good and I don't understand why there are only three\nPoint favorites in this game is it only because of the Baker high visit because Cleveland at home and argue with me that this is a pretty good bet this week at Baltimore modest three\nI think a lot of it has to do with the Cleveland Browns being at home we've seen a whole underdog in the ... which are actually the biggest contact in Las Vegas for NFL betting go through it go eight three and one underdog quite well the fear that that I Am right there with you\nWe gave up so many points in that last to or when they just couldn't hold that lead\nYou also have a problem being that I Know that they were when that game against the jets but bigger may be able to really had to put on it that can have perform a dirty get that when I get the jets game that we've seen in the past couple of weeks be really really bad\nAt one of my plays of the week in memory of invited\nThree into I'm right there with you but I'm so happy to hear you say that because I Am a I looked at that line and I was just confused I was like man I might want to really\n... that are a betting against Cleveland a lot this year just because of the hard knocks thing at Baker may feel but because that that that is an interesting staff\nDo home dog said at one at a at home sorry so I'll go to another one here the Atlanta Falcons into Pittsburgh Steelers the first thing I said when I looked at this game was a matchup Greg was I'm betting the over\nAnd then I look at the over and I see that at that fifty eight\n... data they set to go fifty eight over fifty a Pittsburgh Steelers defense looks terrible without a riot gear\nFifty eight is at a safe bet to go fifty eight over fifty a Pittsburgh Steelers defense looks terrible without a Ryan shows ear and the Atlanta Falcons events banged up too good quarterbacks I I Know you're going to say it's projected to be a ton of points in his game but it's fifty eight to ... to go on the overall and you say\nI think that the eight is a little bit too high because that means that both teams are going to need to get over ... ... are going to need to get over twenty eight points for the thing the head well if you're going to need something completely ... sided like you're going to need a team to score forty two and I just don't see that happening\nIn the Steelers events has an awful and Brian cheesier went out we saw them give up so many points to not wild card game to Jacksonville the defense really what's holding against the ravens even though if I remember correctly they only gave up twenty eight points like game but\nBy the Steelers defensive run back on the falcons give up over thirty five points to the Bengals the next ... watts as well\nBut what's that said something's gotta give here these are unethical defenses and the other thing that had trepidation what's going over a year for me is\nThe Atlanta Falcons opposites under the search engine has been very hitter Matt ... been a really good all last year there were a lot of struggles and weak one we saw those as well I just can't go over fifty points is just too many\nOkay so often Greg Greg Peterson is our guest of the gold with Steve heighten or along with a high five the super contest podcast you can follow grants mark on winter edgy unit underscore eighty one\nSo I'll tell you what I did other than the Baltimore Ravens I played too that's at this point right now the ravens minus three\nAnd I'm hitting on the patriots IDs the patriots down to about minus three I tease the over on the falcons Steelers game to about fifty and I tease this saying the Cincinnati Bengals dolphins game down to a pick them so all I Need is for the bangles to win so the bangles minus six I\nActually think that Cincinnati can win this game by a touchdown Miami I just don't buy is a good team but am I a little bit\nToo premature to really be on board the Andy don't bandwagon night right now what do you think of that game and that minus six line\nI think that if you're betting futures the bangles to win their division is actually a pretty good but I really like when I came from the Cincinnati Bengals aged ... to ... to Andy don't connection has been very good this year\nI mean AJ green as long as the best wide receivers than the NFL and that's the only so many people get any adult low but more black then he deserved I Know that the guys I've gotten the job done in the postseason but he's not a very good regular season quarterback so I don't understand why he gets so much black\nAnd the Bengals beat censors also looks\nPretty nice here I mean obviously life we can get to talking for bad very very bad but\nWith that said the bangles as a whole they look pretty strong and that if the north just doesn't look very good I mean you felt the grounds there I don't see the ... the division\nAnd then the Steelers we've seen them take a step back with their defense and the Baltimore Ravens I feel like it's probably more of a nine and seven game and I would you really think the bangles can go in there\nI think that the bangles to be able to knock off the dolphins are not willing to weigh the stick to that point what was that that I think the bangles or get an outright win\nLet's say in the eye and say okay that's good so I I'm a I'm a maybe the over under the Atlanta Falcons game and fifty you feel safe turned fifty what's that\nWhat the deal I feel\nMuch safer I probably wouldn't if he's there by itself but with that said at fifty I think that you're getting a much better number than try and go fifty eight that there's too many for\nLet's say in the AFC one game that is very hard to assess for me as the jaguars in the ... you got the best ... in my opinion this is a game between the best off and on the hottest quarterbacks\nAnd the best defense and I think they get just a little bit confused because they have it right now and basically effect on their given C minus three but that basically you know the home team gets three points the over under Senate forty nine I think Vegas this overall just confused on this game and they don't really know is\nThat your read on it and if you were to make a play on either a team or the over under what would that play be\nActually pulled the trigger on the on the chief of three I really like what I've seen from Showtime all\nI mean the team was down in a hostile environment in Denver at elevation and he brought them back he had that amazing about trying to pass I mean he was so calm and cool under pressure and it's a Broncos events that's pretty good I thought button Miller you still have a good D. V. D. V. a\nSecondary back there so I thought that I was really impressed by Patrick more homes the guy had zero interceptions as the earth yeah making good decisions I Need to\nEssentially the second best started of any quarterback in NFL history along with Peyton Manning who had that amazing without their games so I just think it's really hard to go against Patrick my home the Jacksonville Jaguars\nRebuild a little bit of oil a couple of weeks ago and they watch the titans by that by the time to fix game that was just ugly I Know that they knocked off the judge by weight that's I'd say in a whole lot a lot\nAnd I felt like there win against the patriots was a little bit artificial just because we have seen the patriots have early season struggle because they were without Julian Edelman as well they're defensive driving around in the form\nAnd I just still have a tough time trusting Blake ... yeah I think that he's now a more ... here quarterback but I just can't sell them as being a really good quarterback\nBut I Do think that Patrick ... is one of the most special players we see in the NFL took three ... three\nHonestly Greg I don't trust any of these quarterbacks and the AFC South Angela Blake Bordeaux Sandy ... a an end to joined us on watching I mean who knows what you're going to get on a weekly basis Greg Peterson is our guest that school was C minor along with a high five the super contest pocket\nYou can find all of his work on Twitter edgy unit underscore eighty one so there's a lot of minus three lines this week I'll give you a couple others\nFor under achieving teams in my opinion Minnesota Vikings are playing the Philadelphia Eagles in Philly and the Dallas Cowboys on the road to take on the Houston Texans so all of those two games what is your most confident pick in either a team or an over under in those two games\nThese are two games are really laid off but I Do think the cowboy hat with your kids be able to cover that three points right in the Houston Texans just something that looked like the same team that they were when they had to shout and bought a ... year\nThis is a game that got really really lucky to get in there and it was cold last week because\nThe goals obviously one port on for some for around like the forty five yard by that made absolutely no sense at all and the Houston, Texas where they can ban from there but we've seen the shot Watson in those white game situations come up short couple of weeks ago against the against the Tennessee Titans\nOnly what the problem of code when one twenty five body I I hate thank you notes it's just something I don't do I don't like birthday cards and I don't like thank you notes like never gave me a thank you never expected thank you know for me and I'm not going to give you a birthday card and I don't want a birthday card a return\nBut I Would personally white to hand write a thank you note to the people who discovered the next pad that I where I have a stiff neck once again I have\nIt last week and I have a ... today because I jumped off my couch with over ... joy after Aaron\nJudge hit a home run in the first inning and and my fitness came back and I don't know the name of the company but I I Want to give him a thank you card and I want to give them just a kid the owner of that whoever discovered that ... like the guy who discovered that the dot com I Want to get him a ... sometimes you just want to get this is in fact you know my neck is feeling so\nMuch better and I wanted to tell you all tonight it's over the next [noise] [noise]\nI'm ... do you have any value for napkins\nAnd online at nine forty WMA dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n...

is what we're going to see it has not been a fluke are you ready to believe and Andy Dalton\nI'm ready to believe in Andy ... he's had been one of those seasons that passing game is they're\nThey're running game is there even without Joe mixing Giovanni Bernard stepping in being that died and he was in those are brought into the league as a kitchen receivers are catching a running back out to backfill run in between is that the more like outside runner so I I like what the bagels can make of the office aside Chad ... says\nI Love their front for I Love Carlos ... that he can get to the quarter\nBut that's the thing they got to consistently get to the quarterback of their secondaries got some problems but Cincinnati defense has holes in it will see that this is an offensive legally we we got a lot of teams this year Bobbie\nWho have got tremendous fences and band defenses and no it's not looking at the numbers were seen this year it's not just because of the rules we have in place we have really smart ... minds in football who are getting quarterbacks to a federal level Cincinnati is a good example that\nBaltimore is a better example of that and also Bobby younger players were seen ... players for the most part being drafted higher\nYou know you you I Would rather take I if I see a\nTight and on the defensive and on the board okay and I think they're both equal\nI think you take the tight end and the second round Baltimore took to the point Baltimore's stacked up ... and the ... that's another reason why we're seeing so many points we're seeing a lot more pull young players Lamar off into players being trapped in the first three rounds\nThat address Joe mix and practicing Giovanni Bernard not for the bank also split the running situation going to be really interesting for Miami this week because all reports indicated that it was gonna be Bernard starting this weekend nacho myth and now I'm not really sure but I\nSee Cincinnati winning this game because just you know Miami offensively I I he rides at al ...\nMinnesota Vikings on the road to take on to Philadelphia Eagles Carson went back and Carson went just loving the fact that he's playing football

ridiculously stupid soft his own they they complete the force than a Fifteen pad and then you have a holding penalty on third down and then you have a pass interference on another third out and then what do you know tendency scores the game when he touched down for the eagles have written bench on their mind is is it just me or ... or is Philly just [noise]\nI feel they have a rational confident I feel like they they because they won the super bowl\nI I just think we as the NFL public thinks that they are better than they actually are just because they won the super\nBowl I and I and that's

one so\nI don't know what's going to given this game if you heard our schools analysis in the previous show there's going to be some weathering this game so who does that and who who who has the advantage in a weather game you would think traditionally the Jacksonville Jaguars um but they don't have Leonard and foreign that you would think it would slow down the chiefs passing attack\nI don't know I ... I I don't know I I have no idea who has the advantage with why they're probably what about you\nWhat think Kareem hut will have the money you know second year\nRun in bed ... said he's the best in the business a dummy I'm ... I'm pretty sure he by saying that because that's just a player but I I make ... will have that advantage he could run in between the tackles and outside as well so I think he will be he'll be the best guy\nAnd I'll tell you what we are going to see a very good match up coming up All right when we come back we're going to talk of major league baseball are yes we have some good games tonight and for great games coming up later today overnight SB Nation radio\nIs street he just\nHiring Donald joins me holy cow I'm super rich cough\nThe rams posted on Twitter a ... percent in the interest it's pronounced just no it's not as parents to it's not it's not peanut butter okay it to get the creator of says concept said it was just I don't believe you don't care\nBecause some of the Google dot peanut butter it's not just that's what the creator says the crazy I I don't believe you and if he really did say that I don't believe him you're down in the creator guy who made one of the most glorious things on the interests will be able to just because he made something else I mean he knows how to speak English GIF has not shifted to him\nSlowly he might not know how to speak English could be but if it's a gift it's always check anyway they posted a stiff of him smiling ear to ear when he was in his country are not allowed to say that we're any more\nStraight heat with Patrick great weekday afternoon at five eastern on SB Nation radio\nThe nation radio\nAnd we the afternoons at five eastern on SB Nation radio\nThe nation radio for the next generation of ...\nFor more exclusive as we measure radio coverages got ourselves writers and as the nation radio dot com\nThey do for his followers on Twitter measure radio hall of fame voters judge Gosselin Enron for just break down everything going on in the NFL plus you should be the next great players should be given a golden jackets on the same that weren't here to talk of fame every Wednesday night from eight to ten eastern right here as the nature of radio\nFree nation we're listening\nSex so much loss sperm to yellow Jack and whatever it is a big media be still fly around the ice freezes like a statue right thinking maybe it won't seem here and we're seeing the and I'm thinking I Am a million times bigger\nThan this thing and the wars but it's going to do to me is just it's going to hit me like just ... and I I freeze\nAs if this thing she's loaded with toys and if it's things meal gosh nothing scares me more than one my wife says make tank washed snaps\nOver there to take care of and I'm like why are you crazy I was like you got to be somebody in this town I compare thousand dollars to come to my house to take care of that for me you want me to get on a ladder windows spray cans\nAnd knock out a hornet's nest what are you insane excuse my life insurance policy up to what is with\nUs be they usually am with Jodie the weekday mornings from six to nine eastern bunch as we nation radio [noise]\nThis is the nation radio\nEvery weekday from UT three Easter and came into the nation radio but my point is Todd from my may has given Vegas angle on all four it's from the NFL can the NBA I'm pushing the odds with naturalist follow him on Twitter at sports talk map\nThis is Carla from Toronto representing we're listening to ask remission\nRogue trader out of the nation rainy of enlist in all the time of the nation live dot com [noise]\nThis is where the night with mad hair up on SB Nation radio\nAnd on how the nation radio dot com\nBrightly O'Reilly auto parts studios here's Matt Harris\nOf every four batteries will fail this winter get yours tested for free during superstar battery month at a rally auto parts of you need to be replaced O'Reilly has the superstar battery for you around the auto parts better parts better prices every single day\nYou know it's funny we have nine screens on in front of a hobby and sometimes there's this other radio show on on one of these screens and and\nI just you know a glance at it over the course of the commercial break and and the topic that they are discussing is a is a a housewife\nListen to NATO rates may applied individual results may vary the website for detail\nI'm buying a huge flat screen TV so I can finally see without my glasses of wine really\nAnswering my glasses and contracts or ...

better person to talk of fantasy football what's been avoid Chris tub who runs the fantasy football so on the network every Tuesday night about Chris aren't where you can find him at the em ups are good I Want to start with what I think it's going to be there\nDoug ... who runs the fantasy football show on the network every Tuesday night Christ on where you can find him as the MTA by Chris I Want to start with what I\nThink is going to be the most interesting game of the weekend and that's the cheese and the jaguars best off ... against the best defense is one of the reasons that I think Patrick mom's is as good as he is ... and obviously he's got tremendous skill\nKareem hot in the backfield has been extremely effective anti we talked earlier this week about the importance of cream onto the teams the jaguars obviously our staff defensively how do you see Kareem Hans outlook fantasy why's this weekend\n[noise] [noise] well I I think a lot of it depends on the help of Sammy Watkins Matt because we have not seen the cream hind usage that we had before and what I mean by that is he's not getting as many Kerry and the fact that he's not really much of a factor in the passing game as well and\nWe think Patrick my home and just the way that he's been able to just push the ball down field which has been really good\nBut the problem is the rush Nineteen time for a hundred and Twenty one yard than a touchdown that's great three cat just for the for yards he was the focal point of the often but it will be re has a tendency to get away from things early so I think he's going to be a borderline running back one against that jaguars do you\nFind All right let's stick with the running game of ah you know I obviously lazy on bell is out James Caan or has kind of been up and down if you're James Connor and you have the falcons decent so look at the last two key injuries and Keanu Neal a and beyond Jones it can we expect James Caan or to have a big week\nI don't think you're looking at him having a a big week just for the fact that he rushed nine times for Nineteen yard and was targeted seven times and and had three catches\nThe problem with the Steelers and what's happening now is the fact that when Ben Roethlisberger gets to one and a scrimmage the ability to audible so naturally quarterback got an audible into something that he can throw the football so why are we going to be the belt cow and they should take advantage of it\nHe's in our beat to death and that's just because the ... throwing the ball more\nHe didn't have any red zone trips don't consider this that once they got into the red zone they didn't run the ball at all so they should but will they I don't I don't know he's still definitely a plug in plays a running back but he's got an R B to feeling\nChris ... is our guest runs the fantasy football show every Tuesday right here on this network SB Nation radio you can follow of course this work on Twitter at the end times so I had a friend tax me today and I figured I Would pass this question along to you because I knew we were going to watch I talked fantasy football so\nHe said hey I'm an a to quarterback league and I have Cam Newton against the giants Jared ... against the sea hawks and big band against Atlanta I can only start to who should I go with I told him and all amended all day I'll call them up after you know tomorrow and tell him if you tell me differently\nBut I told him to go with Jared golf against the Seahawks because you are\nAt this point in my opinion you just have to start Jared golf every week and big band against Atlanta because of the injuries but I liked him against the giants as well so can against the giants against the ... big Ben against Atlanta you can start to who are you going with\n[noise] oh my God that's like ... that that's such a hard question\nYour entire life he told I told him you couldn't really go wrong but because then you plug\nGo wrong but but if I have to go to I'm going to go to the same way I'm gonna go Jared golf and I'm going to go big Ben you can't say the guy that through for four hundred and sixty five yards and five touchdowns against what looked like and I said look like\nA very good defense on paper in the Minnesota Vikings right and you mentioned the match up against the falcons about things right now\nMatt you look at these lineups and any time that he was playing the falcons you know that you're going to put in that passing game so I have absolutely no reservations and going but go off and and big that you can't go wrong with any three of those especially with the other matchup against your giants but\nGo golfing big down to the way that I have two\nTwo part question here the Cincinnati Bengals are going up against the Miami Dolphins I actually have money on this game\nThe bangles to we really really believe in Andy ... the ones that I don't believe in Miami at all in terms of longevity throughout the rest of the season but I Do kind of like their defense and I\nAm hesitant to start to really trust the Andy Dalton so\nIs any dog and becoming like Andy don't than Joe Flaco to me Chris have both elevated their game this year but I'm just not sure if I can trust them moving forward so I'll ask you Andy ... against the dolphins and ... Flaco on the road against the Cleveland Browns can we trust both of them if not who do you trust more\nTruck dog and more than I trust Flaco I still think that Cleveland defense is very very good I think they're very they're very undervalued and fantasy community ... look at the numbers that any don't put up last week yeah it was against the falcons but he was twenty nine forty one\nIn the first half or two for sixteen two hundred eleven yards\nAnd two touchdowns but the roads that he's making that it's not necessarily the volume it grows to throw that he made the aging green at the end of the game was absolutely fantastic uh and before that he thought Tyler board for a couple of Fort down convergence so\nHe's putting the ball on the money power I ... is is a lost I think that's bigger than people realize but he finally got a real live on number two the first one I've had since ... the new up in Tyler Boyd I think ... gonna continue to swing this ball around\nHe's he's a lot when quarterback one value this week against that often but I Do like him better than Flaco this week\nChrist hubs is our guest he runs the fantasy football so on this network every single Tuesday night you can follow him on Twitter at C. M. tubs All right so when it comes to set the Los Angeles chargers I'm outside of Keenan Allen if you have like a running a wide receivers three that you got to sell\nOur youth trustee there Mike Williams or ...

Jackson with because Jackson's on a by\nCan I trust of either of the Williams to put up numbers against the raiders listen the raiders secondaries a mess right now but Keenan Alan ... they do this now when he comes to the chargers do their second and third leading receivers are the two running backs that they have so do I trust that either of the Williams this week against the raiders Seward susceptible to giving up their place\nRight now if you're looking for outside I think the the lower for is tired real Williams because Mike Williams he's one of these guys for the first three games\nHe didn't have any lesson eighty yards in any one of those games now we only had three target the at one catching the win over the chargers but I mean this guy fix for two twenty he's a great red zone target\nAnd I'll tell you tune in Allen they've gotta Antonio Gates met but Keenan Alan and thinking and Gordon rivers has been looking for Mike Williams just based on the ballot\nOr I think he's got a really good match up he's an upside number or until you figure out how they're exactly going to use them but I Love Mike Williams I ain't going to be a huge\nGood match up he's an upside number or until you figure out how they're definitely going to use them but I Love Mike Williams I ain't going to be a huge Mike Williams supportive for the entire year\nAll right so let's say that I have a car similar ... uh and I have Aaron Rodgers\nWhich one of those two words you would get both of those I don't know actually I don't know anybody who would have Carson winter Enron so I'll just compare this ... and ... and so I think it's kind of under achieved and Aaron Rodgers has under seats which one of them are going to bloom and the second half of the season do you say which has a better chance if not both\nI think over the course of the second half because the wind was coming back off that ACL I thought he looked really good last week in their law against Tennessee uh I think when you when you're talking about the long term Aaron Rodgers\nThat he is not going to get better and it could progressively getting worse\nAnd I like to hear like the position players the skilled players a lot more into the all the way you're getting often Jeffrey back\nAnd Zach urge and by and Jay a jockey and Nelson Aguilar and you're outside of the ...
