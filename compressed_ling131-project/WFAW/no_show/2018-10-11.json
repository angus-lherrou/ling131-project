member of the Nineteen eighties all decade team the NFL's Seventy ... anniversary team was elected to the pro Football Hall of fame in Nineteen Ninety seven\nHere with us today to discuss what became an instant hot topic or group of twenty or so hall of fame is led by our Dickerson issued a letter of\nSome see as a demand for three hundred thousand dollar annual pension or as well as health insurance or they would boycott future hall of fame induction next year's ... anniversary\nMike was among the twenties so names on it less but I was ... says the voice of reason legal sometimes devoid of it so I wanted to give him a call and just see if we can sort of this issue of welcome back Mike\nThank you Ryan and those are always good to be talking with you really\nRead all those accolades boy they got tired just read them all the unbelievable as I had forgotten about some of them\nIs the first thing about this letter that struck so many was that these are the same as easy to be asking for this only for themselves even though the letter did at one point said they wanted it to be a sort of a template to eventually cover non hall of fame I Know that bought it a lot of people\nSaw how did you see it might get and how would you explain what your intentions you really are\nWell still I think I'm going to do was to highlight the hall of famers but realizing that you know our quest is really to help all retired players in particular the the guy that played before Nineteen Ninety three um we we don't all all the players don't have the same type of\nBenefit package going going forward and I don't think the public knows that\nUm we don't have health insurance I don't think people know that as well\nAnd they're pretty surprised to find out that all the hall of famers aren't millionaires but they know what I think people forget is now the salaries have really skyrocketed over the years and I live in a long time you know I think maybe when\nYou know there was a time when the average guy supposedly only live to be like ... you live in a lot longer and the guys who played when salaries were\nTwenty thousand dollars or I can remember when I play with a guy named by the hour that New England to the corner my rookie year 'cause on the other side and he told me a signing bonus wasn't new Pontiac GT oh\nSo you know I think those are the details in those days we're going to like thirty five hundred dollars even a Mercedes Benz was like five or six thousand dollars a beautiful home and in Beverly Hills was probably sixteen thousand dollars you know what I mean so I'm so everything has changed and all the tensions were all based on\nThe money that the guys were making so that they didn't make a lot of money you can imagine what their pensions where they didn't have a cost of living increase our inflationary a kick into it and so you know every year along and they live um you know the money goes down down down instead of going up\nAnd so so a lot of those kinds of issues that people aren't aware of\nAnd um I think a lot of players they don't like to talk about their financial issues that too much pride and it gets stuck and they get stuck in a place where it looks odd when they're when they're I'm Talking about these kinds of things\nBut um do you know the there's also guys who were played after the nineties were doing great um but they're you know as a hall of fame as a hall of famer I think\nMost people are unaware that until recently there haven't really been in the hall of fame programs and um and you know the thing that you get is\nTo say that you're hall of famer to have a a jacket a ring of Boston can a and you know if you don't need an agent you know doesn't make sense to have an agent but maybe it does and so I'm a lot of guys in my era we didn't have a you know so we're gonna make any extra money being hall famers\nThere was going to have to come from programs that either we started ourselves or the hall of fame started\nIn the league continues to to use those players to promote those players compared today's players to retired players you know last night I watched um Drew Brees become the all time you know passing later\nAnd um you know in the past up to ... one of the hall of fame and one of the future hall of famer for sure [noise] um but all of those guys when you compare them you know back to the guy that played in my era they are they had different kinds of careers you know monetarily\nAnd there's no nothing really that that can happen that the leak still uses their names to promote even these current players um uses their images that I'm In in a similar ways and it's not\nIt's not a bad thing is you know I'm not saying that the league has taken advantage of the guys I just think that the guys really it's kind of woken up and realize wow you know it'd be great they're still continue to use our images are brand\nWouldn't it be nice if we could come up with some programs as well that the guys can use the the ... the hall of fame can use to promote the game and it helped communities or help some of our retired players as well\nUm and pay these guys uh stipends and um and so so it's really I just don't think that uh the story is out there I don't think people really understand what's going on and looked like a a bunch of rich guys are actually asking for more money and that's not the case at all\nMy time was some question what does that letter was never intended to be released for that matter even sent in the NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and more Smith from the same mistake or how do you go public were you among those who later so they never agree to see this as a man's poison sending a letter\nWell no I'm not one of the guys that um\nThat any of that but I I was surprised that the letter became public\nUm we had several phone calls with a lot of guys that were mentioned in that letter um every weekend for for a couple of weeks and we talked about what was going to be in the letter but we didn't get a ... I didn't get a chance to see the letter before it went out\nAnd I was shocked that it was public you know I really thought this was going to be something that was going to be handled quietly hum and talked about what the commissioner and demar Smith at the players association and we'd be able to you know have a nice friendly conversation about it but that that didn't happen but I'm I'm actually in some ways I'm Glad that\nIt is it turned out the way it is because you know now I'm Talking to you guys about it and we're educating bans about it um and and hopefully you know people will understand what the challenges are\nFrom like you know the you know the NFL when it comes to money nothing stays quiet but those owners to yeah I Know you're a you know one of the problem is that the problem is even though I one thing that bothered me about it and and I talk to you about this right after it happened\nIs that some of the guys who signed it into your frankly a right to strike makers were members of the things that was called the quarterback club the broke the back of the union's effort in\nTo win their federal courts the trust law students during the eighty seven strike\nA when you when the league appeal\nAnd those dirty sales a revenue was supposed to go to fund that the unions appeal to fight the legal field and then the league being smart signed the ... the top twenty or so quarterbacks and a few other stars like the like Eric and I believe a large scale as well\nFeel and then the league being smart signed the ... the top twenty or so quarterbacks and a few other stars like the like Eric and I believe a large scale as well so in a way it just seems to be contradiction you mean on one hand some of these guys are now saying they sued\nThe needy pensions and so forth or or or should be getting some compensation a Thirty Years' ago when the fight was on they jumped the fence ... sort of making that you've been involved in several those strikes when you were a player\nBut we are getting back on immediately very fun to do oh and we'll have diamond in silk on at the very next few days Bruce what bastards cabbage out some rich ... dot com engineers Joe ...

Jim you shouldn't have done that\nYou you you probably right\nI Would have said I Hope then I don't know how wrong I mean I'm passionate about it I Love the game and I love the win and that's how I was out there no one was to be playing hard doing what I'm supposed to do on the basketball for\nNow I think it is a hypocritical of media to attach Jimmy Butler if anybody wants to go after Jimmy butler\nYou are being a hypocrite because all we ask as fans and all we ask from the media is for athletes to be honest and Jimmy Butler guy for pod cast with him\nFor the guys like Bill Simmons a guy respect in this business he is honest all the time he will tell you what is on his mind Willie ... draw headlines yes but he's honest with you All right so I Want to play this Jeff ... who's a team if Jimmy Butler Jimmy Butler\nJust said look if you had a problem teammates if you're a problem with what I just did let me know okay be honest with me that didn't happen here Jeff ... teammate talking about his reaction to what Jimmy ... today\nOh he was he was he was around um you know that's really all goes over there\nBecause your best to move on or what happens if you have other things have been hard not to let that be a distraction\nHomes now from our man I'm I've been around a living for months and years so I've been part of the things were a lot of things have been going on I'm part of the game\nAnd I don't think there's a distracting me but maybe it's distressing some other guys the\nMaybe the way man I Love Jim Jim use my guy but he's not even when we got a good thing\nI Love them you know him being around energy is a good person who's interviews amazing um for me\nI can do anyway so\nI did you hear that I Love Jimmy I Love his energy okay that's what a good team in my opinion should react to what happened with Jimmy Butler okay Jimmy Butler just like old OPEC um junior all he was trying to do was provided a spark\nTo a team that did not look good at all in the playoffs against the Houston Rockets Carl Anthony towns I found it interesting Bobby when all this Jimmy Butler stuff was going on in\nThe off season you know ... to ... literally right as he was being you know the hold I was going on I found it an odd coincidence that the Minnesota timber wolves gave Carlin\nIf any towns age I Can't take maximum contract\nCarl Anthony towns is not the key to any kind of win for the Minnesota timber wolves in terms of a championship if Jimmy Butler leaves this squad okay if the timber it will do actually grant his request and trade him\nThan this team is going to be a seven seed and an exit in the first round every single year\nHow can you give a maximum contract to not your best player when you have your best player and he's waiting there and and he doesn't have a maximum contract currently have any towns it's not the answer to this to this thing they need Jimmy Butler Jimmy bottlers\nAbsolutely right and all this was that happened today in practice I was talking to people right now who criticize what's going on with Jimmy bottlers say oh you can't do that you can't do that you're not being politically correct he's being honest and he's right he's trying to provide a spark plug to a team who right now is buried in a conference that is really darn talented\nAnd Jimmy bottlers really talented and I do think that this whole season\nAnd this this he talked about how this wasn't states it was stage because guess what he just went to Rachel Nichols and did it interview right after it happened\nBut it's not like Alex Rodriguez storming out of the courtroom after the whole steroid allegation and then what does he do he goes right that might Francesca on WFAN yeah that'll storming out of the courtroom thing yeah that was staged okay Alex Rodriguez wants to be heard Jimmy Butler wants to be hurt and he wants other teams all of this what's going on with Bob but he won't be a Minnesota\nTimber wolf after this year okay this is all an audition for the Los Angeles clippers for the Brooklyn Nets but in New York Knicks saying look\nI'm going to be your guy this is what I can bring I can bring leadership and again people question people questioned him why why does he didn't want to go to the Lakers okay he wants to be the guy\nHe's like Kyrie Irving and guess what yeah he can say that stuff the time that they can see that stuff the so late in the general manager why\n'cause we have seen time and time again that players\nHave the power this different than football players have the legitimate power in the NBA in terms of leverage lazy on bell can't get his contract okay Steelers can do when the division without a doubt the Steelers have leverage it's a different sport it is a player driven sport\nAnd I fully support with Jimmy Butler did today will be will see what the temples decided to do and ultimately if this Minnesota several theme is better I when we come back Thursday Night Football will talk about it eagles giants it's over the night [laughter]\nThis is three and he's so tiring Donald joins evil\nAt football will talk about it eagles giants just over the night\nThis street eats\nHerring Donald

L. C. S. began Saturday nights\nJustin Berliner will beyond amount for the Houston Astros Joe blank is our guest host on ESPN Radio Ninety seven five down in Houston and I really appreciate the time do\nWe are in Studio don't get to do many studio interviews here mostly on the phone Joel joins us on the not ... dot com hotline but in the ... the aside dot com studios are Joel ah what do you think of this matchup specifically in game number one just in Berlin I actually think this team is better than they were last year if you look at the shows this year compared to last year\nOn paper they're better and the the weaknesses that I saw it coming into these playoffs where the back end of the bullpen and how healthy as George Springer and Carlos Korea was struggling it seemed to me all of the questionable weaknesses were answered in that first series against the Indians\nAnd I'm surprised I look at the Vegas and wine and they were not that not like I think there were plus two ten to win the world series and the red Sox were plus two twenty\nDoes that surprise you that the Astros are bigger favorites to win the world series it\nDoes a little bit based on what we saw in the first round of the play offs and because of the fact that like you said a lot of the questions were answered I did a a an article for our website sports map dot com or after the first two games against the Indians and said look\nYou can say what you want about their quote unquote corps for because you had questions about Korea's back\nAnd you still do hit home runs but that was his first hit in the series so you have to question that are out to base neat he came up a little ... a\nLame on on a a base running getting out of the box won the game and then started to talk about lingering effects of the knee again so he's not a hundred percent healthy Springer answer all the quest yeah because he was huge and so it was bragging but the bottom line is the role players the names may change but the results remain the same when you look at going out last year and getting it Brian McCants\nHow big he was but that pitching staff but then you add them our teen Maldonado and it's only supposed to be there for defensive purposes and to cut down runners which was a weakness last year yeah and he's done that but then he gets a home run in game one which is that insurance run that you really need Marwan Gonzales who had a really down your after a huge career you're the year before\nI was going into game three hitting seven fifty he came up big in game three as well and he's not one of those guys that you mentioned so you talk about those two got Josh radical had an awful regular season Seventy two points below his average of a year ago but what does he do first two games three hits\nJuice runs scored a couple of runs batted and he's been big as well he had three or four hits in that series as well and you look at and you say you know what this team is deeper than people give them credit for\nAnd the other thing is everybody talks about their starters but their bullpen has been exactly what they needed to unwind yeah and that's where you look at the comparison between them and the red Sox say yeah the red Sox lineup is loaded and JD Martinez has been huge that should be the envy pay but the bottom line is their starting pitching after\nThe ... the name Chris Sale\nIs all a big question mark and ... in most cases like Milwaukee in Colorado in Oakland who can go to a bullpen by committee to try and cover those any Red Sox bullpen is much better now so the huge advantage in my mind is the fact that\nFrom a pitching perspective overall from starting pitching death to the overall deaf to the bullpen ... aside from the closing role for the red Sox you don't know what you're going to get from the Astros\nGet pretty good idea and I think that they are hot it the right time that's the only team hotter as Milwaukee because they want to Lebanon straight\nBut ... but this team has stepped up big into games as well so there's no reason to doubt\nThe astrophysicist let's go back in time three quarters of the way in the season on this show I kind of rank the different tiers of a baseball team across the American league the batting\nOrder the bullpen and the starting pitcher\nAnd so I said that the Astros starting pitching was an a plus you can't tell them anything more than a plus when you have to waste is at the top there are some questions what ... is at the top has injury mourns injury or something I read the the batting order as an egg a solid egg one through nine and the bullpen was probably at a bb minus ever question marks\nIran and the Indians in terms of every single for all three of those tears I couldn't give any one of those tears less than an egg honestly it at that to the bullpen Cody I believed Cody Allen would turn it around I really did and then the ... the ... thing I just believe in the playoffs they would come to okay\nSo this is my question were you surprised at the result a sweep against the\nQuestion about it I said when I looked at the matchups this was the best divisional match up of anyone across the board and the one team that had the best opportunity to beat Houston aside from getting to the world series and facing the Dodgers again which or the cubs and the cubs obviously took care of that themselves\nOr with the Cleveland Indians I thought Cleveland was loaded for bear I was with you I wasn't sold on their bullpen because of the injuries but overall the\nNames that were in the bullpen and the ... the results that they had in the past\nHard to argue with that when you ... and again I said that people after the fact that ... hour was the X factor is Trevor ... our go before the injury\nAnd it was a leg injury and and it was you know he got hit with a line or ... coming back but if he's healthy and he's your number two I still think that's a longer series I still think it was the the toughest series the ... the Astros would face and I still gave the the Indians the best chance to beat Houston\nI did not see this becoming a sweet I did not see the role player stepping up the way they did and I did not see the bullpen giving up what they did from Cleveland perspective\nBut I still think when you went out at the deadline and you've got a job Donaldson a former American League MBBS\nAnd you add it up to ... and all the pieces they already have Bradley I'm a big fan of it all the guys that they had I thought Cleveland as much as I thought last year to the after the along streets finished the regular season I thought they were the hot team\nI thought this was the year that they make amends for that and they could really do think that if they knocked off the actors in the first round they do everything that they were supposed to do I do not said becoming a sweet but because of it there's even more confidence and that club how severe ... oh yeah and that's\nWhy I think the other thing that you're not factoring in is the fact that the red Sox they were they lost the game at home they they weren't perfect by any stretch of the imagination the way they played against Yankees they locked out in the fact that the manager for the Yankees gave them some opportunities as well as they got hot or look at the right time with their line up\nBut I think the actors are going to come in extremely competent and that's that's very scary for a team that's coming back already off a World Series champion oh yeah to be as confident as they are they are coming in Syria Joe\nBlank is our guest host of the usual suspects on ESPN Ninety seven five down in Houston one to four daily\nOr is it fair to say that all of the pressure all of the pressure one hundred percent in game one is on the Boston Red Sox simply because they're at home I Know they're facing Justin Berliner but you look at that game to match up Garrett coal against David Price we saw what happened to David Price in that game in that first\nI Know they're facing Justin Berliner but you look at that game to match\nUp Garrett coal against David Price we saw what happened to David Price in that game in that first game against the Yankees obviously Yankees have is number I don't know of hand the Astros numbers against David Price but David Price in the playoffs has it been atrocious it these red socks do not win game on against Justin ...\nI think they're in a world of trouble do you agree the pressures all on them and can you explain exactly why to a national audience what is the difference between Garrett coal last year and when he was with the Astros why is he been so good\nWell I'll tell you this we'll start with the fact that all the pressure in my mind isn't on the Boston Red Sox it's on sale because Chris ... has to realize\nThe hopes of his entire team the ... and the success that they could possibly have is all all on his left arm because David Price is Owen ten lifetime as a starter in the postseason\nAnd it's going to be worse at Fenway because those fans aren't going to hold back in the ... or small ball park and it's a home game and what's your fans are going to be thoroughly against you simply because of the fact that they booed him off the mountain the other day he got a standing ovation at Yankee Stadium and they started hearing it so\nWhen one at twenty five votes ... dot com as every wager you could ever imagine if it's happening at the time we'll put a line on it then on the NFL NC double A. and major league baseball buddy I really was\nI was kind of shocked not shocked I guess but just surprised I guess I should say as to the world series odds are that were that were given out by Las\nVegas the Astros plus two ten plus two Fifteen for the red Sox was to win the world series Los Angeles Dodgers coming up plus three thirty but there are three plus three thirty three plus three Seventy five so in other words if you're if I'm speaking Spanish the right now actors or two to one okay so you put fifty dollars down you've got a hundred dollars back\nThat's pretty much what's going on and the red Sox are slightly\nAbove I Would think the Astros would be more favorite\nTo win the world series because they are the team it's all about baseball what have you done for me lately what the heck is David Price done for your

basketball\nSpecifically I think it's going on the ... you know it's basically like one of those don't ask don't tell like steroids was for a long time with major league baseball we think it's going on as fans like reporters and do everybody knows but there hasn't actually been like legal stuff happening well now we have like an FBI investigation and things are going to court\nHow six games and so I think in your head because I I actually I I'm just like a staff highly Fifteen and complete passes twenty five per phone you're given a little bit too much credit but that's fine twenty five imagine if it was Fifteen\nThrough six games that would be incredible he hasn't taken a single snap in the fourth quarter a his Heisman odds are two to three Dwayne Haskins ... to ... seven to one we will\nHave our first Heisman winner in college football history who will not play a complete game over the course\nOf [noise] it is not going to be I Am I'm\nJust I I rebel when I look at Alabama football and I think it I I haven't done this at all this season but I think we have to do it at one point just gushed over how good they are\nSixty five thirty one against Arkansas now I Know that you know Texas these teams if they're playing I Am so curious to see what they're going to look like in the college football playoff 'cause honestly\nI worked at the beginning of the season looked at this Alabama schedule and I said All right we're could they possibly lose I wasn't November third on the road against LSU well all of us who just lost to Florida okay Mississippi State\nThat they have to go to Alabama like the two of the three ranked teams that they play this year two of them are in Alabama there gets Mississippi State an\nAuburn who both of those teams worse than we originally project at least all burns words Mississippi states actually probably right on par with what I thought they kind of came back to earth\nA little bit Ellis use over a cheap but they did it look good last week in Florida they're not going to lose and you look across I personally want Ohio State to play Alabama I think those are the two best teams are I think we we look right now from what I've seen\nClemson I Will have to evaluate them as they go along with Trevor Lawrence\nAnd they certainly weren't that good quarterback but we haven't really seen him\nA gets really come to sixty three sixty three uh three against Wake Forest I don't really you know who the ... is way for us and then you have Clemson and then you have Georgia so we'll see him again the SEC title game but do you not get the feeling that this year in college football\nAnd the FCC title game Alabama to me is gonna be Georgia by three touchdowns maybe it'll be a fourteen Seventeen point game but you've watched both of those teams probably more than I have in\nRegular season football Georgia obviously beating Alabama last year do you think that will happen or excuse me ... that is the other way around Alabama do you think that somebody close game\nAnd might I mean you know Georgia has some office of powers well Jay from and those you're on running backs back they're they're gonna have to keep them off the field that too I mean that's the case that as his running or football or to keep to themselves and so I mean yes it's going to be a competitive gay what I Do\nFind interesting is that you know we ... we always say when it comes to the NFL\nThe patriots we gotta keep Tom Brady off the field that's how you beat New England right I think that's kind of the same strategy with Alabama how are we going to\nKeep to off the field and ironically ironically\nBrady came out with an interesting comment a couple of days ago\nHe said that he thinks the lead is becoming more like college which I tend to agree with he said I think it was different it's a different time football was different back then\nAnd some days pro football was a glorified college football in some ways the transition it's more similar than it used to be when I first started football now is removing some of the physical elements of the game it's more of a base game there's a quote by Brady it's more of a space game you see a lot of college boys more in the program that pro game now\nThat I remember when I started and I think the perfect example of that is the Los Angeles ramps well we're seeing from the Los Angeles rams really the rams the chiefs in the bears I think do the best\nWhat we're seeing from the rams the cheese and the very specifically the rams is how they utilize space and how innovative they are\nBecause it ... you know that is how the college game is being played right now for the most part you\nLook at Alabama and how they play football how they utilized basing on the field\nAlabama is the ultimate example of how of of this because they have so many guys who are just ... opened it down the field all the time and I'm trying to think to myself like is it Nick Saban being innovated is it to be in great is that a combination of all these things\nI feel like almost ... I like we look at too and how great he is but\nQuarterbacks are always a reflection of coaching and so I think Nick Saban is not getting enough credit honestly Bobby I think they say that it's not getting enough credit for what it was going on in Alabama right now because just like Tom Brady said\nThis new NFL that we're seeing which is all pass pass pass pass pass it's kind of what Alabama is doing right now like you look at the Los Angeles ramp they're off as kind of look similar to what Alabama's they're trying to do like I watch them and I'm like man it's that kind of ... the big chunk plays one of the reasons that happens is because you utilize\nBait specifically space\nWell and it's really just I think we're in a very fortunate time just to be general football fans right now in our balls or talked about this earlier in the week how look Drew Brees a lot of the guys on the active list in terms of a ... a lot of that's on the list of passing yards total passing yards and the leaks\nAbout this earlier in the week how look Drew Brees a lot of the guys on the active list in terms of a ... a lot of that's on the list of passing yards total passing yards and the leaked a lot of them are active right now\nAnd that's just where we are this game college football and pro football there is an old adage and it is a reason why I say old cars adult defense wins championships okay look at Alabama\nAlabama traditionally wins football games with these that that's what you think running to football deep sense that's not the case that is not the case\nThe college get looked at Texas Tech red ... homes I feel like that's bled over a little bit into Alabama I feel like that's bled over a little bit in the collapse in the Sean watching kind of started that turn a little bit at a split over a little bit into Ohio State\nEven Georgia they've got a court Georgia there was questioned my last year with the Trump could throw the football Jake from school quarterback\nJoined Haskins is than they did they don't feel past again that Ohio State has\nIts a brilliant time to watch our fence just football right now at Brady said it best friend he's like well and I honestly the patriots are going to start looking more and more like I'm not gonna compared to the rams but they're going to start looking more and more like\nA a real a fish in a big chunk gain off because they have just gotten out of that funding Michelle they have this big it's just fun to watch it it's football is just really fun to watch right now at Tom Brady is right college looks like the pros and prose looks like college and it did not used to be like that when we come back\nTop five most disappointing teams in the NFL we do our top five power ranking let's go disappointment some of the night I finished already\nIs three to eat just so\nHappy Yankees game wildcard game some any posted a video mad is of a person deliberately throwing a beer at a span right\nAfter the Yankees role in the world right now he has\nA very big on the wildcard oh it was a ... yeah maybe one of the wild they were acting like a one of the world series I don't want to say all Yankee fans hard scheme bags slowly Lenny Bruce beer for the ... and we do apparently work ...

nation\nReal Matt Harris was you know the NFL\nFootball games will see you on the New York giants Dave ... is part of the Philadelphia and why are you can follow day's work on Twitter at eagles insider I save offer some want to start with the eagles running back situation obviously Jay ... out for the year was the ACL Paris and what is the latest\nI heard rumors regarding Jordan Howard we were hearing wave your bell are all different kinds of different situations regarding replacing the running backs will that happened do you think we're going to see it straight in the next week and a half and the eagles are going to have a new running back or they may make a trade but I think I'd be\nSurprised if it's a running back I think they feel like Cory climate window small would\nJosh Adams Darren throw who were coming back from an injury\nThey think next week when the Carolina Panthers come to town you know we play the first game is going to have five weeks where he didn't play ah I I think they feel like they like that group barring any injury tomorrow night however\nThey have a very desperate need a wide receiver\nThey have not adequately replaced tore through and the production that he gave them last year like well if you're on I or Mac Owens injured housing play this year no fanatical are better suited as a slob receiver so they really haven't been able to do much outside the numbers\nBut other than to Sean Jeffrey so they really I think keep your eyes open there and then they need to safety losing Rodney McLeod was extremely difficult for the defense or they've been very vulnerable down the middle of the field\nAnd I don't know I just I hear all these rumors they they were me\nI don't think the eagles are going to give up multiple draft picks have to rearrange their salary cap have to cut somebody so they can get half of the not above your bill I just don't see it happening\nThe where there were rumors that based on what you were hearing before the URL Thomas injury you mentioned safety that the you know he had no\nNo no because running McLeod was there on the field he was fine with Rodney McLeod Malcolm Jenkins eagles were in great shape at the safety position you know it's interesting how we wrote them and\nHad set himself into a position where people look at him and they act just to pay me back but it's going to make this move after after the ... deadline as they did last year with the dry\nAnd he's a wheeler dealer but I think there's there comes a time when he got to say okay let's just pump the brakes here understand the beagles I think I've ... next year they've got three in the first year round\nOne is worth giving up in it now if they can acquire somebody who's a long term fit you you certainly invest heavily\nBut if you're just talking about happier rental I think that's really risky there's this last year there for the eagles were cruising they were on the in the midst of a ... game winning streak when they acquired guy and he was a valuable piece in the super bowl march you're still trying to find a talk with two or three\nDays but our with our guests are the Philadelphia Inquirer also has an eagles live podcast which you can find on his Twitter page or what you can go to Dave Twitter page the eagles and started talking Philadelphia Eagles okay what if I were to tell you one through ten ten being Carson went just perfectly healthy one being he's not where do you think Carson Lynn says right now\nI I think that needs fine I think there's still some rough I'd probably go and eight I mean I think the Ross is still there but it didn't play in the pre season hadn't played since December started three games\nIs very mobile and the pocket [noise] he's very aware of the pressure in and out of the pocket he's showed some greatest capabilities great athletic ability great strength he's still drives the ball down the field has told the la city on the football\nI think it's just a matter of gaining timing and look it's also a matter of you all kinds of line giving time to set up ... or ...\nSomething that they did and were forwarded and defeated last year the eagles were terrific against the bullets and they protected wins beautifully and you know the use of everything and I think they have not found that rhythm yet and so I think it's not really on Carson I think it's more of the pieces around him\nYeah so that was going to be my next question I think there's no question if you watched the first half your just watch the game last week against the Minnesota Vikings and with eagles office has been up to this point they are a step backwards\nFrom what they were last year so it sounds to me like you're standing up and the wind is definitely taking a step back would that be your primary reason as to why the office has\nBecome slightly one dimensional that would be my major credit them if I watch that all the right now just twenty nine year old from a giant Wendell small with one of those you know you look at these teams with great quarterbacks Kansas City with a patch of bombs Jared golf with Iran than running games and you have the bottom line is you have to Dallas and the NFL still do the lack\nOf ballot where do you think the most credit for why that's not happening goes or should they discuss\nOne thing about this you gotta think like days that's what I've been told by the great ... just a man to start start thinking like Vegas yeah you know I mean their their favorite usa favorite because they're at home you know and uh but then you\nQuestion yourself is ... ... I don't believe in this guy you at least seven\nPoint or higher is that what it is you know what is it in mind that seven to spread so I mean you know I should say that situation where you know Colorado is down can they get back up I mean you see as a running back in the back so that can make some damage but other than that if you could could change eighty days you could win\nAll say this though if you look at us the schedule this year you know we kind of really looked at that last against ... and we're like man us the stakes did they did I mean then that game Texas demolished them but after taxes beats Oklahoma\nOnly have to start looking a little bit better on USC and say All right well clearly that they're not in the top twenty five level but they they might not stink as might as as much as we all\nThink because they lost their losses this year or two Stanford and to us the Stanford they beat them you Seventeen to three Stanford taxes those are their losses those are two pretty good teams Texas obviously on the top ten\nThey'd be anyone else they they narrowly beat Washington state and they narrowly beat Arizona\nSo at home against Colorado I mean I think it'll be a really good game I Would almost say Colorado plus the seven here Nineteen even a country like he wants you went to USC\nColorado I mean I think it'll be a really good game I Would almost take Colorado plus the seven here not even a country like you want you want to go USC\nMinus the point in the right on yeah it's either plus the points or anything at All right so then I that's an interesting [noise] [noise]\nI'm boarding WMA not what you were born Africans and online at nine forty WMA dot com\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Richard can sue\nNow over in Georgia\nMichael is lost a lot of its own now a tropical storm blowing it sixty miles an hour\nPanama City Appalachian coal at Tallahassee are now starting to the conditions gradually get better so that rain is ending the Windsor decreasing the storm surges decreasing the places like Georgia they are just being the wind starting to pick up trying to get very strong tropical storm force winds are happening right now\nABC News meteorologist Melissa Griffin in Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum has been surveying damage a lot of\nPeople believe that we got civil as the day [noise] um it's hard to say if you've got a tree across our house and so I I Want to keep that in perspective but as we think about the potential consequences of the storm in this area [noise]\nUm I've seen it a much worse\nAcross Florida Alabama and Georgia over six hundred thousand homes and businesses don't have electric power so far two deaths attributed to Michael including a two year old girl\nInvestors had themselves quite today driving the doubt eight hundred thirty points lower on the NASDAQ two or three hundred sixteen points Los analyst blamed recent interest rate hiking by the Federal Reserve that Michigan is a strategist of John Hancock there\nAnd at the time to go ... prospects a clue slows and we have a tightening monetary policy said that is good way our stock prices\nPresident Trump says the fed has gone crazy his word with interest rate hikes Palestinian American grad student ... remains detained by Israel barred entry under a new law targeting boycott Israel activists Palestinian\nAmerican law are consummate taking a stand against the Israeli government which has\nBanned her entry into the country under any law targeting boycott activists she's not being held against her will ... airport she can leave to go back to the U.

rated great to tell a basketball show on ESPN rights of the night Nicholson not host that today why because she was interviewing Genovese Emmy butler so I I don't buy that at all that's what happened this charade practice Jimmy ... auditioning to play for another team next year\nThat's what's going on is trying to prove he's a leader now Kevin Love I Want to get to that\nYou know Kevin level as I gave him a lot of praise and I think him into Marta rose and deserve a watt for being open and honest about mental illness and how they have gone through mental illness ah and Kevin Love was open with us again\nAbout being LeBron James teammate in Cleveland and he was asked to this because you know what would you say was the question what would you say to a prospective superstar free agent who I'd interest in becoming team in ... teammates with LeBron James and I will read you loves quote\nHe said you have to follow it you have to learn a lot about that\nPlane went abroad you are not the top guy I just tried to continue to be myself and not fake it I said how I felt whether we disagree or agree to my voice was constantly hurt\nAnd do not ever take for granted\nThe fact that these guys can do this I point to Kevin Love and I'll point to one other athlete\nWho did it in my opinion a relatively good job of being the guy somewhere else and then going them playing with superstar ... playing with LeBron James and taking a back seat Kevin Love obviously did this was Cleveland\nAnd the same position Chris Bosh had to do this if you remember\nChris Bosh was a beat with the Toronto Raptors Chris Bosh was the man he was as big as the man in Toronto as Kevin Love was the man and Minnesota their stats might have been similar I don't know if the top of my head but their stats might have been similar\nThat is not easy okay as I don't know because I'm not an athlete but look\nI Would imagine when you're the top guy and athletes are sold macho macho we lift the weights were men we get all the women when you are that guy\nI Would imagine when you're the top guy and athletes are sold macho macho we lift the weights were men we get all the women when you are that guy and the guy I Would imagine\nJust as a man it's difficult to take a step back\nAnd say look I'm not going to be the guy anymore I even if winning as a priority and you're doing this you're going to that team because you do want to win and LeBron James gives you the best chance to win\nBut some guys are not wired that way some guys are predicated on being the man\nAnd I think Jimmy Butler is one of those guys are like again I like I said in the first hour Ira Jimmy Butler and LeBron James would be great teammates split typically on this Los Angeles Lakers team because they are so young and I think he would be a great second in command\nBut gives out Jimmy Butler is wired\nHe's wired like Kyrie Irving\nThey both are the same in the sense that they want to remove themselves from a situation where they do not see themselves as the guy\nAnd they want to be the guy Kyrie Irving said look ... he he's saying exactly he went through what LeBron James with Kevin Love went through OK both of them\nCould not be the guy and Kyrie Irving I think in this MBA were just talking about the trial on the previous segment and the trial go guess what the powerful or could be the guy that's not this MBA\nAnymore and Kevin Love\nUnderstands that which is why I think for years he was fine he was fine coming to Cleveland 'cause he's like well can this new age NBA I can play with the brawn James I'm a powerful I'm not a guard I'm not going to take over a team\nYou know so I I ... Kyrie Irving a Jimmy ... the exit Jimmy Butler why are the exact same way they want to be the ... and so do you criticized as I like that really think about this fear in your car right now and you're like All right if you don't want to these people who are talking about Kyrie Irving last year and you're like oh I don't understand\nI don't understand why Kyrie Irving did not want to play with the brawn James why would some guy not want to play\nWith the best the answer to that is because they wanted to be at their best and when I got out of this call by ...\nBy Kevin Love is you are not allowed to be at your best individually personally we all have like aspirations individually in our own lives Kyrie Irving wants to get to a certain level individually\nI don't necessarily look down on him for that for wanting to request to trade and leave Cleveland because he saw exactly what Kevin Love his thing here I Can't do that in Cleveland the brawn James is here so this\nTo me to wrap this up is a very interesting idea moving forward because the Lakers cannot win now with who they have\nWell people go to LeBron James in Los Angeles like they did in Miami and like they did in Cleveland\nAre superstars or co superstars right now willing to leave the situation they're in and take on that not one B roll\nLiterally take on the definitive number to roll to LeBron James that to me is a big question mark because we have had two guys Jimmy ... learned Kyrie Irving who have said\nTo me about what by the way the reason I say don't want to play with Brian James he listed three teams wanted to be tried to do that next clippers Lakers not on that list will abroad be able to get free agents to LA\nThat is going to be a fascinating story line moving forward in the NBA we're

back in the Knight SB Nation radio Matt Harris back with us jump\nInto the major league baseball playoff Houston Astros getting past the Cleveland Indians Boston Red Sox they take care of the New York Yankees in three out of the four games that they play till the A. L. C. S. began Saturday Night Justin Berliner will be on the mound for the Houston Astros Joe blank is our guest host on ESPN Radio Ninety seven five down in\nHouston I really appreciate the time Joel we are in Studio don't get to do many studio interviews here mostly on the phone Joel joined us on the not bet the aside dot com hotline but\nIn the ... dot com studios are Joel ah what do you think of this match up to specifically in game number one just in Berlin I actually think this team is better than they were last year if you look at the as soon as this year compared to last year\nOn paper they're better and the the weaknesses that I saw it coming into these playoffs where the back end of the bullpen and how healthy as George Springer and Carlos Korea was struggling it seemed to me all of the questionable weaknesses were answered and that first series against the Indians\nAnd I'm surprised I looked at the Vegas line and they were not that not like I think they were close to ten to win the world series and the red Sox were close to twenty\nDoes that surprise you that the Astros are bigger favorites to win the world series it\nDoes a little bit based on what we saw in the first round of the play offs and because of the fact that like you said a lot of the questions were answered I did an article for our website sports map dot com or after the first two games against the Indians and said look\nYou can say what you want about their quote unquote corps for\nBecause you had questions about Korea's back and you still do get a home run but that was his first hit in the series so you have to question that a ... he came up a little lame on on on a base running getting out of the box won the game and then started to talk about lingering effects of the knee again so he's not a hundred percent healthy sprayer answer\nAll the quest yeah because he was huge and so it was bragging but the bottom line is the role players the names may change but the results remain the same when you look at going out last year and getting a Brian McCann how big he was but that pitching staff\nBut then you add a martini Maldonado and it's only supposed to be there for defensive purposes and to cut down runners which was a weakness last year now and he's done that but then he gets a home run in game one which is that insurance run that you really need Marwan Gonzales who had a really down your after a huge career you're the year before\nI was going into game three hitting seven fifty he came up big in game three as well and he's not one of those guys that you mentioned so you talk about those two bad Josh Reddick who had an awful regular season Seventy two point below his average of a year ago but what does he do first two games three hits\nJuice runs scored a couple of runs batted and he's been big as well he had ... three or four hits in that series as well and you look and you say you know what this team was deeper than people give them credit for and the other thing is everybody talks about their starters but their bullpen has been exactly what they needed in well right yeah and that's\nWhere you look at the comparison between them and the red socks that yeah the red Sox lineup is loaded and JD Martinez has been a huge that should be the envy pay but the bottom line is their starting pitching after\nThe the the name Chris Sale is all a big question mark and\n... in most cases like Milwaukee in Colorado in Oakland who can go to a bullpen by committee to try and cover those ending Red Sox bullpen is much better now so the huge advantage in my mind is the fact that from a pitching perspective overall from starting pitching depth to the overall deaf to the bullpen\n... aside from the closing role for the red Sox you don't know what you're going to get from the Astros\nGet pretty good idea and I think that they are\nTo the overall deaf to the bullpen ... aside from the closing role for the red Sox you don't know what you're going to get from the Astros you got a pretty good idea and I think that they are hot it the right time that's the only team hotter as Milwaukee because they want to eleven straight but ... but this team has stepped up big in big games as well so there's no reason to doubt the astrophysicist\nLet's go back in time three quarters of the way in the season on this show I kind of rank the different tiers of a baseball team across the American league the batting order the bullpen and starting pitching\nAnd so I said that the Astros starting pitching was an a plus you can't give them anything more than a plus when you have two aces at the top there are some questions what kind of go buddy ... says that the ... century or something I rented the batting order as an egg a solid egg one through nine and the bullpen was probably at a bb mine is there a question mark\nIrate at the Indians in terms of every single for all three of those tears I couldn't give any one of those tears less than an egg honestly that to\nThe bullpen Cody I believed Cody Allen would turn it around I really did and then the Andrew Miller the Miller thing I just believe in the playoffs they would come to okay so this is my question were you surprised that the result a sweep against the as legal question about it I said\nWhen I looked at the matchups this was the best divisional matchup of anyone across the board and the one team that had the best opportunity to beat Houston\nAside from getting to the world series and facing the Dodgers again which or the cubs and the cubs obviously took care of that themselves or was the Cleveland Indians I thought Cleveland was loaded for bear I was with you I was sold on their bullpen because of the injuries but overall the names that were in the bullpen and the ... the results that they had in the past\nHard to argue with but when you ... and again I said the people after the fact that ... hour was the X factor if triggered Bowers Trevor by our go before the injury\nAnd it was a leg injury and and it was you know he got hit with a line or ... coming back but if he's healthy and he's your number two I still think that's a longer series\nI still think it was the the toughest series the ... the Astros would face and I still gave the the Indians the best chance to beat Houston I did not see this becoming a sweep I did not see the role player stepping up the way they did and I did not see the bullpen and giving up what they did from Cleveland's perspective\nBut I still think when you went out at the deadline and you've got to Josh Donaldson a former American League MBBS\nAnd you added up to ... and all the pieces they already have Brandt Leah I'm a big fan of and all the guys that they had\nI thought Cleveland as much as I thought last\nYear or two after the the longest streak finished the regular season I thought they were the hot team I\nThought this was the year that they make amends for that and they can really do some things that they knocked off the actors in the first round they do everything that they were supposed to do I did not say becoming a sweet but because of it there's even more confidence in that clubhouse if you're a National Guard out oh yeah and that's\nWhy I think the other thing that you're not factoring in\nIs the fact that the red Sox they were they lost the game at home they they weren't perfect by any stretch of the imagination and the way they played against Yankees they locked out in the fact that the manager for the Yankees gave them some opportunities as well as they got hot that look at the right time with their line up but I think the actors are going to come in extremely confident and that's that's very scary for\nA team that's coming back already off a World Series champion yeah to be as confident as they are they are coming in Syria\nDo blank is our guest host of the usual suspects on ESPN Ninety seven five down in Houston one to four daily or is it fair to say that all of the pressure all of the pressure of one hundred percent in game one is on the Boston Red Sox simply because they're at home\nI Know they're facing Justin Vernon lander but you look at that game to match up Garrett coal against David Price we saw what happened to David Price in that game in that first game against the Yankees obviously Yankees have his number I don't know of hand\nThe Astros numbers against David Price but David Price in the playoffs has it been atrocious it these red socks do not win game on against Justin Vernon lander\nI think they are in a world of trouble do you agree to pressure is all on them and can you explain exactly why to a national audience what is the difference between Garrett coal last year and when he's with the Astros why is even so good\nWell I'll tell you this we'll start with the fact that all the pressure in my mind isn't on the Boston Red Sox it's on Chris sales because Chris Sale has to realize the hopes of his entire team the ... and the success that they could possibly have is all all on his left arm because David Price is Owen ten lifetime as a starter in the postseason\nAnd it's going to be worse at Fenway because those fans are going to hold back in the fantasy or small ball park and it's a home game and what's your fans are going to be thoroughly against you simply because of the fact that they booed him off the mountain the other day he got a standing ovation at Yankee Stadium\nAnd they started to get paid [laughter] so [laughter]\nI don't think there's that much pressure on the red Sox team per se because they have confidence in their line up to and that offensive line up has proven that they can get the job done and you are the double digit numbers that they hung on the Yankees but the fact of the matter is is that there's a ton of pressure on on on Chris Sale because he knows behind him he's got nothing he's got nothing that can\nPossibly help him in terms of your your your question about the difference in Garrett call I got two words for it spreads from restaurant the pitching coach is the same reason why bird later found the fountain of youth and it's gotten even better and put up numbers better than he's had his entire career ... ... and our parallel to the numbers that he put up when he won the MVP inside young\nWe talk about how managing a so important in baseball I thought it was a brilliant decision and put them back there because it's confidence was down\nUm and he and he is getting good pitches to head at that at that aspect you know Joel is the guy who has been in the professional media he was the Houston Rockets play by play guy TV guy for a while he's been around athletes for a while and so\nI thought it was a smart point when he talked about the media aspect of Korea he ... you know he doesn't need to be constantly be asked all these questions\nBut also you know when he when he was talking about ego\nI was really interested in why aren't there more ... why aren't there more and there might be you know more come the he might be a pioneer in terms of this you know what he's doing with the rams but just the bread strong thing is interesting he is an older fella and he has totally

Jim you said and done that yeah you're probably right\nI Would have said I Hope then I don't know how wrong I mean I'm passionate about it I Love the game and I love the win and that's how I was out there no one was the main playing hard doing what I'm supposed to do on a basketball for now\nOf the win and that's how I was out there no one was being planned hard doing what I'm supposed to do on the basketball for\nNow I think it is hypocritical of media to attach Jimmy Butler if anybody wants to go after Jimmy butler\nYou are being a hypocrite because all we ask as fans and all we ask from the media is for athletes to be on this and Jimmy Butler look I've heard pod cast with him\nFor the guys like Bill Simmons a guy respect them as soon as he is honest all the time he will tell you what is on his mind Willie ... draw headlines yes please honest with you All right so I Want to play this Jeff Teague who's a team if Jimmy Butler Jimmy Butler\nJust said look if you had a problem teammates if you had a problem with what I just did let me know okay be honest with me that didn't happen here Jeff teach his teammate talking about his reaction to what Jimmy Butler did today\n[noise] uh he was he was she was around um you know that's who they are going to say about that\nBecause of your best to von no matter what happens if you have other things have been hard not to let that be a distraction\nComes now from our man I'm I've been around a liquid smoke two years so I've been part of the things were\nA lot of things have been going on\nAnd I don't think it's distracting me but maybe the stress and some other guys but\nEither way man I Love Jim ... but ... and we got a good thing\nIs going on I Love zooming man or him being around energy is a good person who's interviewed amazing um for me\nI did you hear that I Love Jimmy I Love is energy okay that's what a good team in my opinion should react to what happened what Jimmy Butler okay Jimmy Butler just like old OPEC um junior all he was trying to do was provided us spark\nTo a team that did not look good at all in the playoffs against the Houston Rockets Carl Anthony towns I found it interesting Bobby when all this Jimmy Butler stuff was going on in the off season you know it ... literally right as he was being you know the hold I was going on\nI found it an odd coincidence that the Minnesota temperate will gave Carl Anthony towns age I Can't take maximum contract\nCarl Anthony towns is not the key to any kind of a win for the Minnesota timber wolves in terms of a championship if Jimmy Butler leaves this squad okay if the timber wolves do actually grant his request and trade him\nThan this team is going to be seven seed and an exit in the first round every single year how can you give a maximum contract to not your best player when you have your best player and he's waiting there and and he doesn't have a maximum contract currently\nHave any times it's not the answer to this to this thing they need Jimmy Butler Jimmy\nBottlers absolutely right and all this was that happened today in practice I was talking to people right now who criticize what's going on with Jimmy bottlers say oh you can't do that you can't do that you're not being politically correct\nHe's being honest and he's right he's trying to provide a spark plug to a team but right now is buried at a conference that is really darn talented\nAnd Jimmy bottlers really talented and I do think that this whole season and this this he talked about how this wasn't states it was stage because guess what he just went to Rachel Nichols and did it interview right after it happened\nUntil like Alex Rodriguez storming out of the courtroom after the whole steroid allegation and then what does he do he goes right to my friend just on WFAN yeah that'll storming out of the courtroom thing yeah that was staged okay Alex Rodriguez wants to be heard Jimmy Butler wants to be hurt and he wants other teams all

L. C. S. began Saturday Night\nJustin Berliner will be on the mound for the Houston Astros Joe blank is our guest host on ESPN Radio Ninety seven five\nDown in Houston I really appreciate the time do we are in Studio don't get to do many studio interviews here mostly on the phone Joel joined us on the not bet the site dot com hotline but\nIn the ... studios are Joel ah what do you think of this matchup specifically in game number one just in Berlin I actually think this team is better than they were last year if you look at the shows this year compared to last year\nOn paper they're better and the the weaknesses that I saw it coming into these playoff where the back end of the bullpen and how healthy as George Springer and Carlos Korea was struggling it seemed to me all of the questionable weaknesses were answered and that first series against the Indians\nAnd I'm surprised I look at the Vegas wine and they were not that not like I think there were parts to tend to win the world series and the red Sox were pause to twenty\nDoes that surprise you that the Astros are bigger favorites to win the world series it\nDoes a little bit based on what we saw in the first round of the playoffs and because of the fact that like you said a lot of the questions were answered I did an article for our website sports map dot com or after the first two games against the Indians and said look\nYou can say what you want about their quote unquote corps for because you had questions about Korea's back and you still do ya hit home runs but that was his first in the series so you have to question that\nA ... he came up a little ... a lame on on a a base running getting out of the box won the game and then started to talk about lingering effects of the knee again so he's not a hundred percent healthy sprayer answer all the quest yeah because he was huge and so it was bragging but the bottom line is the role players the names may change but the results remain the same\nSpringer answer all the quest yeah because he was huge and so it was pregnant but the bottom line is the role players the names may change but the results remain the same when you look at going out last year and getting it Brian McCann how big he was but that pitching staff but then you add um our teen Maldonado and he's only supposed to be there for defensive purposes and to cut down runners which was a weakness last year yeah and he's done that\nBut then he has a home run and game on which is that insurance run that you really need Marwan Gonzales who had a really down your after a huge career you're the year before\nI was going in the game three hitting seven fifty he came up big in game three as well and he's not one of those guys that you mentioned so you talk about those two bad Josh Reddick who had an awful regular season Seventy two points below his average of a year ago but what does he do first two games three hits\nJuice runs scored a couple of runs batted and he's been big as well he had ... three or four hits in that series as well and you look at and you say you know what this team's deeper than people give them credit for\nAnd the other thing is everybody talks about their starters but their bullpen has been exactly what they needed anything well right now and that's where you look at the comparison between them and the red Sox I say yeah the red Sox lineup is loaded and JD Martinez has been a huge\nThat should be the envy pay but the bottom line is their starting pitching after\nThe the the name Chris Sale\nIs all a big question mark and\n... in most cases like Milwaukee in Colorado in Oakland who can go to a bullpen by committee to try and cover those any Red Sox bullpen is much better now so the huge advantage in my mind is the fact that from a pitching perspective overall from starting pitching death\nTo the overall deaf to the bullpen ... aside from the closing role for the red Sox you don't know what you're going to get from the Astros\nYou got a pretty good idea and I think that they are hot it the right time the only team hotter as Milwaukee because they want to eleven straight\nBut ... but this team has stepped up big in big games as well so there's no reason to doubt\nThe astrophysicist let's go back in time three quarters of the way in the season on this show I kind of rank the different tiers of a baseball team across the American league the batting order the bullpen and the starting pitcher\nAnd so I said that the Astros starting pitching was an a plus you can't give them anything more than a plus when you have to I was at the top there are some questions what kind of go but you have to waste is at the top and morally didn't dream mourns injury or something I ran into the batting order as an egg a solid egg one through nine and the bullpen was probably at a bb minus ever question marks\nIran and the Indians in terms of every single for all three of those tears I couldn't give any one of those tears less than an egg honestly that to\nThe bullpen Cody I believed Cody Allen would turn it around I really did and then the ... the Miller thing I just believe in the playoffs they would come to okay so this is my question were you surprised that the result a sweep against the legal question about it I said\nWhen I looked at the matchups this was the best divisional matchup of anyone across the board and the one team that had the best opportunity to beat Houston\nAside from getting to the world series and facing the Dodgers again which the war the cubs and the cubs obviously took care of that themselves\nOr was the Cleveland Indians I thought Cleveland was loaded for bear I was with you I was sold on their bullpen because of the injuries but overall the names that were in the bullpen and the ... the results that they had in the past\nHard to argue with but when you ... I think it I said the people after the fact that ... hour was the X factor if Trevor Bowers Trevor by our go before the injury\nAnd it was a leg injury and and it was you know he got hit with a line or ... coming back but if he's healthy and he's your number two I still think that's a longer series I still think it was the the toughest series the ... the Astros would face\nAnd I still have the the Indians the best chance to beat Houston I did not see this becoming a sweep I did not see the role player stepping up the way they did and I did not see the bullpen giving up what they did from Cleveland's perspective but I still think when you went out at the deadline and you've got to Josh Donaldson a former American League MBBS\nAnd you added up to ... and all the pieces they already have Brandt Leah I'm a big fan of it all the guys that they had I thought Cleveland as much as I thought last year to the bathroom in the long history to finish the regular season I thought they were the hot team\nI thought this was the year that they make amends for that and they could really do some things that they knocked off the actors in the first round\nThey do everything that they were supposed to do I did not say becoming a sweet but because of it there's even more confidence in the clubhouse if you're a National Guard out oh yeah and that's\nWhy I think the other thing that you're not factoring in is the fact that the red Sox they were they lost the game at home they they weren't perfect by any stretch of the imagination the way they played against the Yankees they locked out in the fact that the manager for the Yankees gave them some opportunities as well as they got hot or look at the right time with their line up\nBut I think the actors are going to come in extremely confident and that's that's very scary for\nA team that's coming back already up a World Series champion yeah to be as confidence they are they are coming in Syria do\nBlank is our guest host of the usual suspects on ESPN Ninety seven five down in Houston one to four daily\nOr is it fair to say that all of the pressure all of the pressure one hundred percent in game one is on the Boston Red Sox simply because they're at home I Know they're facing Justin Berliner\nBut you look at that game to match up Derek coal against David Price we saw what happened to David Price in that game and that first game against the Yankees obviously Yankees have is number I don't know of hand the Astros numbers against David Price but David Price in the playoffs has it been atrocious\nThese red socks do not win game on against Justin ...\nI think they are in a world of trouble do you agree the pressure is all on them and can you explain exactly why to a national audience what is the difference between Garrett coal last year and when he's with the Astros wise he'd been so good\nWell I'll tell you this we'll start with the fact that all the pressure in my mind isn't on the Boston Red Sox it's on Chris sales because Chris Sale has to realize the hopes of his entire team the ... and the success that they could possibly have is all all on his left arm because David Price\nIs Owen ten lifetime as a starter in the postseason and it's going to be worse at Fenway because those fans are going to hold back in the ... are small ball park and it's a home game and what's your fans are going to be thoroughly against you simply because of the fact that they booed him off the mound the other day he got a standing ovation at Yankee Stadium and they started to get a paid so [laughter]\nI don't think there's that much pressure on the red Sox team per se because they have confidence\nIn their line up to and that offensive line up has proven that they can get the job done and you saw the double digit numbers that they hung on the Yankees\nBut the fact of the matter is is that there's a ton of pressure on on on Chris Sale because he knows behind him he's got nothing he's got nothing that can possibly help them in terms of your your your question about the difference in your call I got to work for it spreads from restaurant the pitching coach is the same reason why ... later found the fountain of youth and it's gotten\nOkay do you put fifty dollars down you've got a hundred dollars back\nThat's pretty much what's going on and the red Sox are slightly\nAbove I Would think the Astros would be more favored\nTo win the world series because they are the team it's all about baseball what have you done for me lately what the heck is David Price done for you lately\nThat that that game one is going to be so crucial if the red Sox lose game one this'll be my high tech if the red Sox lose game on I think they lose the series I really do I think the the three through for those ... do you know what do you think they're going to do three and four\nIn ... he was the oh lord no go game for you think or will they go back to ... I think they might go more independence\nOn ended it resulted in on the series is maybe more and I'm I'm a ... a nice thought the bulls like Garrett\nCold versus David Price I ah\nI mean that is a complete mismatch and I didn't ... that I said pressure totally on the red Sox he's like no pressure totally on the ... sale I totally agree with that [noise] All right our one of the vote fits

Mississippi states actually probably right on par with what I thought they kind of came back to earth a little bit Ellis use over a cheap but they did it look good last week against Florida they're not going to lose any look across I I I personally want\nOhio State to play Alabama I think those are the two best teams are I think we we look right now from what I've seen Clemson I Will have to evaluate them as they go along with Trevor Lawrence\nAnd they travel on to a good quarterback but we haven't really seen him a gets really come to sixty two sixty three uh three against Wake Forest I don't really you know who is way for us\nAnd then you have Clemson and then you have Georgia so we'll see in the SEC title game but do you not get the feeling that this year in college football\nAnd the FCC title game Alabama to me is going to be Georgia by three touchdowns\nMaybe it'll be a fourteen Seventeen point game but you've watched both of those teams probably more than I have in regular season football Georgia obviously beating Alabama last year do you think that will happen or excuse me ... that is the other way around Alabama do you think that somebody close game\nAnd might I mean you know Georgia has some office of powers well Jay from and those are running backs back they're they're gonna have to keep them off the field that to ... that keeps it as his running a football or to keep to themselves so I mean yeah it's going to be a competitive ... what I Do\nFind interesting is that you know we ... we always say when it comes to the NFL the patriots we gotta keep Tom Brady off the field that's how you'd be New England right I think that's kind of the same strategy with Alabama how are you going to keep to off the field and ironically ironically\nBrainy came out with an interesting comment a couple of days ago he said that he thinks the lead is becoming more like college which I tend to agree with that I think it was different it's a different time football was\nDifferent back then in some days pro football was a glorified college football in some ways the transition it's more similar than it used to be when I first started\nFootball now is removing some of the physical element of the game it's more of a base game there's a quote by Brady it's more of a space game you see a lot of college place more in the program that pro game now\nThan I remember when I started and I think the perfect example of that is the Los Angeles ramps worst team from the Los Angeles ramps really the rams the chiefs in the bears I Do the best\nWorst thing from the rams the chiefs into very specifically the raft is how they utilized space and how\nInnovative they are because it ... you know that is how the college game is being played right now for the most part you look at Alabama\nAnd how they play football how they utilize spacing on the field in\nAlabama is the ultimate example of how of of this because they have so many guys who are just ... open down the field all the ... and I'm trying to think to myself like is it nicks save and be innovated as it to be in great is that a combination of all these things\nI feel like almost six I like we look at you and how great he is but\nQuarterbacks are always a reflection of coaching and so I think next saving is not getting enough credit honestly body I think they say that it's not getting enough credit for what it was going on in Alabama right now because just like Tom Brady said this new NFL that we're seeing which has all parents pass pass pass pass\nIt's kind of what Alabama is doing right now like you look at the Los Angeles ramps they're off and kind of look similar to what Alabama's to trying to do like I watch them and I'm like man it's that kind of ... the biggest chunk plays one of the reasons that happens is\nBecause you utilize based typically space\nSo well and it's really just I think we're in a very fortunate time just to be general football fans right now in our balls or talked about this earlier in the week how look Drew Brees a lot of the guys on the active list in terms of a there's a lot of there's a militia passed in God's total passing yards and the league a lot of them are active right now\nAnd that's just where we are this game college football and pro football there is an old adage and it is a reason why I say old because it's old defense wins championships okay look at Alabama Alabama traditionally wins football games with these that's that's what you take ruining the football defense\nThat's not the case that is not the case the college gate looked at Texas Tech red greater off ... homes I feel like that's bled over a little bit into Alabama I feel like that's bled over a little bit in the climate in the Sean Watson kind of started that turn a little bit at a split over a little bit into Ohio State\nEven Georgia they got a court Georgia there there was questioned my last year with Jane from could throw the football jak from school quarterback\nTwain Haskins is a fantastic they didn't feel passing in our state has\nIts a brilliant time to watch off sensitive football right now would Brady said it best friend he's like well and I honestly the patriots are going to start looking more and more like I'm not gonna compared to the rams but they're going to start looking more and more like\nA a real a fish in a big chunk to gain off as because they object score to now they're starting Michelle they have this big it's just fun to watch is football is just really fun to watch right now and Tom Brady is right college

nation real Matt Harris when you look down on these little legal you on the New York giants sorrow is part of the Philadelphia why are you can follow these weren't\nGoing to win or an eagles insider I have a first I Want to start with the eagles running back situation obviously ... out for the year with the ACL pair and what is the latest I heard rumors regarding Jordan Howard we were hearing leave your fellow all different kinds of different situations regarding replacing the running back\nWill that happened do you think we're going to see a trained in the next week and a half of the eagles are going to happen to run into a make a trade but I think I'd be surprised\nIf it's a running back I think they feel like Cory climate window small would Josh Adams\nDown the road will be coming back from an injury they think next week when the Carolina Panthers comes to town you know he's\nPlayed the first game he's going to have five weeks where he didn't play uh I I think they feel like they like that group barring any injuries tomorrow night however they have a very desperate need it wide receiver\nThey have not adequately replaced Torrey Smith and the production that he gave them last year when I go out and you're on I or Mac Hall and injured hasn't played\nThis year you know fanatical are better suited as a slob receiver so they really have been able to do much outside of the numbers but other than to al Sean Jeffrey so they really I think keep their eyes open there and then they need a safety losing Rodney McLeod was extremely\nDifficult for the defense so they've been very vulnerable down the middle of the field and I don't know I just I hear all these rumors they they remain\nI don't think the eagles\nGoing to give up multiple draft picks half to rearrange their salary cap have to cut somebody so they can get half the city's not levy on bell I just don't see it happening\nThe were there were rumors that based on what you're hearing before the URL Thomas injury you mentioned safety that'd be no no\nNo no because Romney McLeod was there on the field he was fine with Rodney macleod and Malcolm Jenkins eagles were in great shape at the safety position you know it's interesting how we wrote them and\nHad set himself into a position where people looked at him and they anticipate back that he's going to make this move at the draft at at the trade deadline as they did last year with the dry\nAnd he's a wheeler dealer but I think there is there comes a time when you got to say okay let's just pump the brakes here understand the eagles I think I've ... next year they've got three in the first year round\nOne is worth giving up in it now if they can acquire somebody who's a long term fit you you certainly invest heavily\nBut if you're just talking about happier rental I think that's really risky business last year was there for the eagles were cruising they were on the in the midst of nine game winning streak when they acquired a guy and he was a valuable piece in the super bowl march this year this legal team still try to find itself with two or three\nDays but our with our guests are the Philadelphia Inquirer also as an eagles live podcast which you can find on his Twitter page or would you can go to Dave Twitter page the eagles and started talking Philadelphia Eagles\nOkay what if I were to tell you one through contending Carson went just perfectly healthy one being he's not where do you think Carson lenses right now\nI think that needs fine I think there's still some Ross I'd probably go in eight I mean I think the rest is still there but it\nDidn't play in the pre season haven't played since December started three games is very mobile in the pocket [noise] he's very aware of the pressure in and out of the pocket he's shown some greatest capability great athletic ability great strength he's still drives the ball down the field\nHas excellent velocity on the football\nI think it's just a matter of gaining timing and look it's also a matter of you off into blind giving it's time to set up teams are tacking eagles are a lot of scrimmage\nSomething that they did and were forwarded and defeated last year the eagles were\nTerrific against the bullets and they protected wince beautifully and you know the use of everything and I think they have not found that rhythm yet and so I think it's not really on Carson I think it's more of the pieces around him\nYeah so that was going to be my next question I think it's no question if you watched the first half you just watch the game last week against the Minnesota Vikings and what the eagles often has been up to this point they are a step backwards\nFrom what they were last year so it sounds to me like you're saying the offensive line is definitely taking a step back would that be your primary reason as to why the often has\nBecome slightly one dimensional that would be my major criticism if I watch that all the right now just twenty nine yards from a giant windows ... do you look at these teams with great quarterback Kansas City ah with a bomb Jared off with Iran than running games and you have the bottom line is you have to balance in the NFL still\nIt was the lack of ballot where do you think the most credit for why that's not happening goes or I should say discredit\nI Would I Would tell you that it's the scoreboard and\nThe run past ratio the people look at at the end of the game\nI think over the years is very much very much misleading\nWhen you have a lead you run the football when you were down Seventeen the three of the eagles were last week in the first half against Minnesota you have to go away from it you can only run the ball so much you kill you've got to have ... plays in the NFL\nYou know I think the the reason the eagles have been so sporadic off instantly their averaging Twenty one points a game\nIn a league is setting record for most points scored after scoring last year\nIn the thirties with cars and went to the offensive line Jason Peters\nIs not the same player that he was prior to his injury lane junk and is not the same right tackle that he was last year when he stole ... everybody he's given a big sacks impacted back weeks\nAgainst Tennessee and against Minnesota I think it's only offensive line I Believe that's where the game of football won and lost any beagles are losing their at the moment to a degree I mean it's still good line but it's certainly not the dominant wine but played last season\nDave ... is our guest is how much the Philadelphia Eagles to the Philadelphia Inquirer also has an eagles life podcast but you can find on his Twitter page uh it which is an eagles insiders described the relationship between power carcinogens jak or is it seems ... they have a fantastic working relationship how close are they off the field and why do you think that connection is so strong\nYeah really great connection is and it's a great point they they certainly know each other inside and out on the field they know where to go where the opening is anticipate each other's moves very well\nAnd it's really allows you see what that relationship is done to ... his career has been putting up some decent numbers in the first couple of years of his career but the eagles were\nYou know going through the the quarterback relax with the woods hole and Mark Sanchez than Bradford and so\nPeople are going to look at ... and said well why is this guy not reaching his ability to the ceiling now that they've gotten Carson in there and um he's been so or on the same page with that you see the production is tremendous back as the most catches of any tied into the league last week had his first touchdown catch up\nOn the same page with that you see the production is tremendous back as the most catches the very end of the league last week\nHad his first touchdown catch out being late in the game so they're very close in the field they're both very much a man of faith off the field family man great friends and you know it's a very very strong relationship on and off the field I think that's a great reason why work\nSo well Steve I Do find it interesting I Want to go back to what we said at the beginning here\nUm that they might make the trade but not for a running back and I always like to compare this time in the NFL to major league baseball does say deadlines coming up you look at these teams are three into foreign one\nOkay how can they make the next step like the Astros don't get Berliner the cubs a couple of years still don't get ... and I think the trade overall is more valuable in major league baseball just because the individual player in baseball is more valuable than any individual player in football that's just my opinion\nBut is there anybody that you think the eagles have their eye on in terms of a wide receiver or safety\nI I really I I don't know it's it's it's really hard to tell I I don't study the world of other teams as much just don't have time you know the name that I heard bandied about out there are wide receiver democracy Parker\nTo separate the facts from the feelings and that's where an

joining us right now on the ... inside line covering the Philadelphia\nEagles and bleeding green Asian for SB Nation is Michael ... going on model\nThat go on looking forward to a this do or more probably die came with the eagles and giants tonight ...\nWell um if the giants lose this game there yet if got eagles lose this game ... maybe on life support\nFor the rest of the division sucks too so you know I I don't know if it's the end for the eagles because\nWho's to say that the Washington or the cowboys is going to win\n[noise] yeah I I I said the other day and it was half joking but I think there is some reality to it too that you know fix them than when this division so calm down and see how it shakes out at the end of the season if we can get healthy and everything will be a little bit better but\nIt is a uh ESPN project is as a twenty seven percent possible playoff chance swing\nFor the eagles fourteen percent in favor if they win Thirteen percent the other way if they don't there are still up there pretty high because of the vision\nBut yeah this team has been somewhat sloppy and start their getting pieces in and out and every time they get someone back like al Sean Jeffrey it seems like they lose another couple of pieces like say you're riding a cloud or you know other things of that nature and Mike Wallace another example\nSo it's been hard on the seemed to have any kind of consistency and that's reflected in the ... some of the dumb penalties that they're taking and just not being on the same page with each other\nYou know you're just part of the issue with the eagles the fact that man they came into this year so beat up and up you know they just they bring down dies every game\nAnd you know even when they're not down on them for the season day Corey Clements been beat up and he's been vital for them in past protection and you've seen them struggle and pass protection with you know some of the double mug looks from the age gap with your safety is coming in and things but\nYeah Mike Wallace goes down early in the season back Collins hasn't been active Timmy Jernigan hasn't been active\nA house on Jeopardy doesn't come back until later in the season change I is that with an ACL already talked about riding the cloud I mean it's just there's this Super Bowl hangover it feels like there was more of a physical one that a mental one and it's causing me to to rearrange some things and they end up losing really good talent\nSo obviously that effort to so like I said you just you know as an eagles fan you're hoping you just just one week without bad injury news as we start to get some of these guys back would be a very big for us\nNow do you expect small would to get the majority of the carries or do you expect more of an even split with him in ...\n... depends on the game a script I think when it's closed are going to see more small we're just because he's the healthy Europe it too\nIf we get down at the eagles get down that I Would expect to see the curriculum and slow it has struggled mightily impasse borough and isn't quite the receiver at Columbia and is so it all depends on games script in that regard if you're if you're looking at these running back for fantasy purposes I Would pray away from both of them to be honest because they could go either way\nNow Michael the you know one of the biggest is the giants of course there are offensive line when a problem for years and the lack of time to\nBe able to get for Eli Manning\nOr the eagles able to get the fission pressure in your opinion on Eli Manning to force them into all those quick short garbage throws as opposed to trying to drive the ball down the field so it all back in June\nSeen every single quarterback that has played the Philadelphia Eagles this year release the ball within two point four seconds or under that is really really fast it's Patrick got it out to point to one when we played Tampa Bay so teams are definitely scheming to not there to protect their quarterback\nAnd get those quick throws out so yeah I Do believe that you're going to see a lot of that he like\nDefinitely scheming to not there to protect their quarterback and get those quakes throws out so yeah I Do believe that you're going to see a lot of that ... holds onto the ball a little bit more which he has this year compared to other years which is weird you know you get older and they were little\nBob but I I Would expect them to see what to go with the short attack and then every now and then you know go with a play action where they can have seven band protection and then take their shots\nDon't feel that way I feel like you know that's going to be trouble by I ...\nI think we may have lost Michael is going to try to\nFix that oh my God you still there yeah hey we can hear you know that that helps\nUs we're sorry about that what you're saying one thing I'm worried about that the giants will try to do to mitigate that pass rush that do go play action when they want to take shots but we've Seventy and I don't take their shots dollar field you I've got to hit those though he's been terribly inaccurate down the field so far\nBigger concern for the eagles defense back them or Barkley\nI I think it's more on a more consistent basis it's definitely back on the beat the giants won game with Barclay has only thirty seven percent success rate it's eight or nine plays that kind of hurt their try and keep them behind the chains where\nYou get those in strings and Barkley is not effective you got to keep him from three or four plays those chunk plays that he will get on his own because he has to do it all on his own\nI trust is brought to keep them bottled up it's the open field tackling that I'm worried about I'm really really concerned about these cores again so they'll come in and being able to stay connected to him so that would be the more consistent concerned permit\nMichael just covers the eagles for bleeding green nation for SB Nation with us on the bed decided to come inside line my what a ... with the eagles receivers\nI guess how healthy is Jeffrey or what's going on with Aguilar because they I Know Jeffrey just came back I was middle and consistent or what's your take on their receiver so far this year\nOr a week for had a real rough guinea at three dropped it looked like more of the two thousand sixty I go to war but I think that was just an aberration he's looked perfectly fine other than that he was uncomfortable and training camp leaving it to the season ah he's been a key player for them so I'm I'm not worried about him he's\nShowing the mental toughness to rebound from from a bat game I'll start Jeffrey I I watched him two years ago when the eagles signed him and watched his Chicago Bears tape\nAnd the first that he had off the line that year compared to his year with the tort rotator cuff was different\nHe has come back and has shown more of that two thousand sixteen first off the line\nThat you got to think when you're getting off the line and you're trying to create speed and generate speed your puppy your arms I don't know I don't I've never had a tort rotator cuff but if you're trying to pump their arms and do that a ... it's it's only going to have a negative effect on you so he has looked better he looks healthy he's been able to get the contest the balls and had a big game against Tennessee where he looked fantastic so\nIt's it's getting outside help outside of jeopardy right now that's the problem for them so you're probably going to see them you realize a lot of talk personnel let it too tight and sets and try to get favorable matchups on the back of some states you know the giants\nAnd Michael they re did much to talk to contract or are they looking at levy on bell or they're looking at changing McCoy who look at it\nI I honestly don't think they're really looking at any of those big three running backs Amy we'd been tied to David Johnson there were rumors that lately on bill and that was shot shot down by if they did make a call for the call I I doubt that went very far I Would expect that to make some type of move\nAnd you never know what how heroes makes that decision is able to pull the trigger on one of those bills then you know I'll I'll be happy with it because those are three tell the players but I think you're more looking toward like a mid range bargaining Ben type guy that's part of a rotation that that that that team doesn't necessarily need to feature as\nPart of a trade rather than a big blockbuster trade but again it how we will do things and make everybody look stupid All right so what do you think is the al ...", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "11"}
