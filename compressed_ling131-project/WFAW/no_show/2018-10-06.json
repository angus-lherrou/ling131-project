little bit earlier on in the day and that's where we'll start tonight talking about the brewers who now lead that into the as two games on as it heads to Colorado\nAnd the Astros game on seven to two over the Indians today\nAnd I was in attendance I'm going to tell you more about it 'cause I got a couple of questions to Bobby beats about this I asked a few other people too because I wanted to make sure I wasn't being unfair and I'll tell you the store I last minute Bobby I decided\nJust to go to the game this\nMorning I woke up the check the various secondary ticket pricing and it was sheep and there were still about twenty five hundred tickets\nAvailable on just one of those secondary sites so playoff game\nI Know it's a friday during the day and and clearly that impact the law but I was done it ... it was my again because I was able to get a fairly decent seat upstairs but not all the way at the top by any means pretty darn good seat and I got in for less than sixty five\nBucks when it was all said and done\nPretty good for my own a royals I didn't get into a playoff game for them that cheap\nSo I don't know if it's because each year or two of the ashes in the postseason as well that it's you know after the last year getting in maybe some people last year were willing to pay whatever this year that demand maybe wasn't as high I don't know also if it's hey we want a World Series we expect to to get to another world series or an AOL cs and it's like hey let's\nSave the money [noise] I'll talk about the crowd to\nOut at the ballpark but also how impressive the Astros and

section was like there was a couple of big pitches for her later I'm like waiting for everybody started clapping really allowed a there was only or at least in our area like once or twice fate only let's go Astros\nChant like it just was I was waiting for the whole stadium to echo the let's go astro isn't there were a few moments where you that was warranted certainly pressure situation for ... right before he he he left the baseball game so yeah I was a little disappointed with the atmosphere maybe tomorrow or ask\nThose fans will step it up yeah it'd be better tomorrow everybody's off everybody's rest it may be working out in the five year off but um everybody's rested just the atmosphere will be there I don't know it wasn't the simulation of the Cleveland Indians is you know people just hung out of it it it\nTakes the second time like that hey I was yeah this will work back in the postseason year or is it a combination of the fans that maybe there were a lot of fans like that word that hadn't been to many baseball games as you know what they were shocked cheapest tickets were on the secondary market I don't know I'm just trying to come up with I guess excuse as to why the atmosphere wasn't\nAs good as I Know it can be and I'm sure as good as it was last year\nFor the Astros and of course you're not going to I'm not saying you need to be a World Series atmosphere okay I'm Tania it's still a playoff game I did on the crucial playoff game and he got Clyburn Berliner them out and the seats in the Philly in but yeah I just was disappointed with some of the energy out there maybe you were at the game today\nAnd maybe you've had your own experience at playoff both postseason games I'm curious if I'm judging them a little too hard you can interact\nWith the show as always on Twitter at SB Nation radio ... and you get up ... on Twitter at\nRobo Harris junior also on the phone eight hundred seven seven seven to nine zero seven eight hundred seven seven seven to nine zero seven the game that started kind of towards the end of the actual game was the brewers Iraqis\nGive a brewers team that continues to me they are you could argue the most dangerous team right now in the postseason doesn't mean they're going to win the world series or anything\nBut right now the brewers heading into this postseason where the hottest team and they are continuing that and they have a two game lead already up you're on the Rockies heading back to Colorado and yes if the Rockies can take on game there then things get different but members of the five games here he's not a seven game series barrage of one went away\nThe brewers look awfully good and what's happened with this Rockies office to you I I I don't want to\nYou know as an excuse of their fatigue with the long week and everything going on there but the brewers also played an extra games too I\nI'm just trying to figure out what's going on with the Rockies all sense of Lee and the brewers pitching is good bought and they're they're I wouldn't say they're known for their starting pitching us on how they got there wasn't wasn't because of their starting pitching and the Rockies I've really struggled to score today they lose for nothing the other night they didn't squirting until two of the top of the night\nYeah just what it is that top hitters that you know as Blackmon story or not they get hit it they can hit it did but I can hit a Coors Field but when they come away from course or they can't hit on the road and that's the problem if your top hitters are not hitting\nGreat on the road it's going to be tough for you to ... to come back into the game and usually the scores for zero to one what three two and walk off and it's just hard for those guys to get going if that was that they'll get going on the road is going to be a tough road for the Rockies\nSo Colorado as their backs against the wall and Milwaukee just one went away that series we'll pick back up a yes or pick back up on Monday right there ever will be Sunday I Believe it will pick back up bottle to all their travel date I'm all for sure they are to say it is Sunday for that yeah the AOL will be Monday the NFL is is the way they started a day earlier so that's how that schedule watched by the way quick update\nIn the A. L. D. S. out at Fenway Park Yankees still trailing the red Sox five to but it is the top of the seven and the Yankees have the bases loaded with nobody out where nobody out so\nYankees certainly are not out of their skin they almost scored a couple of runs the prior editing\nAnd the Yankees were unable to capitalize on it the red Sox the jam but certainly a whole different ballgame here with the bases loaded and nobody out so the red Sox jumped up to an early three to not three nothing lead and out of the game before nothing late and\nContinued from they're up to five and nothing but the Yankees got two in the sixth and threatening again and in fact they have more hips than I than the Boston Red Sox or something to keep an eye on Christmas Day it was fantastic to start this game\nFor Boston but endanger of potentially wasting that if the Yankees get a couple of runs here Chris sail goes five and a third five minutes to an runs in struck out eight so he was fantastic tonight will continue to update you what's going on the A.

about that in just a little bit but joining us now on the ... line is very gloomy contributing national baseball columnist for Forbes magazine you can follow him on Twitter at ... ski and\nBarry let's start with the two games going on right now and let's start with the Yankees\nAnd the red Sox and just watching this kind of unfold live as the red Sox have a five three leading a couple of missed opportunities to say the least the last two innings\nFor the Yankees was the bases loaded only able to to get three runs out of it in this Red Sox bullpen which news had all kinds of issues as kind of found a way to to sneak out of it or has it been really the Yankees just missing these opportunities are going to come back and regretted tonight\nI don't know Alex is there a question there\nWhile I was just going to I was gonna ask\nYou if you felt like there are very that this has been more the missed opportunity of the Yankees or the red Sox bullpen blowing it\nWell I mean the red Red Sox bullpen has been doing everything they possibly can to try and blow it and it's not just the pope and it was sale let up the first single men for the bullpen and when the Yankees have bases loaded too out that your way shooting and one and they had the bases loaded\nNobody out situation or to start the next inning and they only get three runs out of that then it's the Yankees fault for not that you invented the opportunities\nWhere did you make heading into the series though not as a couple of days ago when we learned of course it would have this matchup for the first time in the postseason between these two teams since two thousand and four in the makeup of it in terms of these these pictures and the advantage on each side would you looked at the series who did you feel like had the advantage heading in\nYou know I thought it was the ... series and you know I felt\nBetter about it to the Yankees than I did two weeks ago I felt the same way going into the wild card you know the Yankees have been you know hitting a lot better and I'm planning on all cylinders there I you know ... they're saying that healthy they was\nKicks maybe again tonight with a hamstring tweak but generally they're big Poppers and they're ... they're all out there which is a you know something they had had not gone through particularly in August September\nSo they uh you know they got Seventy nine run one nine out of eleven\nOr I didn't know what failed would look like if you look great early ah I wasn't happy about the ... decision and I thought to knock it should've started game tonight\nBut you know the baseball or growers in the Yankee you know for an officer who run everything they think they know everything and this is what they did and they put a guy out there who let up five runs before you even turned around so I mean\nThat that that's where it is that's the whole game and they've had to pick out of the five nothing All right from the beginning\nWhen it comes to Aaron Boone and certainly you had to get that when the other night in in that wild card game both for him\nHow fans will view him in New York maybe they way they already view him this series this series you're against the Boston Red Sox just how how important is that for him just on a personal level going forward in in and ultimately maybe what it means for him not that he's in jeopardy this year but just long term\nI just don't think it matters for him that all Oakland and I think the way the\nWay the baseball management is structured now and it certainly that way with the Yankees is that they don't want to pay big money for any of these uh well accomplished managers anymore who might have their own brain cells they want us to throw these guys and they want to have\nA a pay a little bit of money for them\nThey like they went from ... who was making for a million and want to fix\nSome boon is making one point one five million\nI mean even your guys there used to it and who I think it's terrific AJ inch it's not really far up the salaries scale when it comes to any of this stuff and he's in the afternoon for the middle management guy he was the guy who they started this with an Arizona you know one judge burns made him the manager there and they fire Bob ... years ago\nAnd and but he's got a a an accommodation I think we're losing out there that gives him some on the to work and freelance with in their ... and in New York they don't have that so\nI mean you look at it now you go you know that was a pretty good game that bone manage the other night at one of the first ones where I could really say that and then I think well it really didn't manage it is just being told to do what he does and that's what it is all over baseball just one\nTalking with Barry Bloom contributing national baseball calmness for Forbes magazine you're on SB Nation\nRadio I actually want to go to the brewers series for a little bit of years they have a two games to none lead there are against the Rockies ... Colorado you your thoughts just on the Rockies inability to really get much going off sense of lead to this point in time and here in the in the first two games of the other series\nThey had the two runs in the top of the night yesterday but that's all they've been able to do [noise]\nYeah I mean it it kind of an epidemic for them you know late in the in the bigger games yeah they ... they got shut down and flip by the Dodgers then they came in and uh and and and swept the or the diamond backs\nAnd really ... fairly close games\nAnd then they were lucky enough to go home ... the city of the finish up the faith and against you know the Phillies and and a a the nationals\nAnd you know they had one game lead in division going into the Saturday before the season and then they look for the nationals and wound up having to go to outweigh the play oh you know applying for the wild card\nAnd they really didn't hit there and they really didn't hit in the game they want against the cubs and they didn't win you know uh\nYou know a ... ... ... series started but I think what you're looking at is you're just looking at a lot of guys who never played that before you know they they're terrific athletes but\nMan chance they playing at the same thing and the Yankees and these guys playing it for one more fish out of the strikes on I'm going to from my first day they said [laughter]\nYou know it it it chip Shane they were playing ... motion you know I and the ball ball ... story errant NATO and king situation polls are passing or their their habits breaks down and they strike out at the same thing with the Yankees here tonight to\nNow or or the other side of that store with the Rockies leasing is on the brewers as dangerous as anyone right now just given how they played entering the postseason and and what they've been able to do here start\nYeah and then they're also very nicely run in a\nYou know I I have a lot of respect for great council I've known him for a long time and uh you know he's a really talented guy you know he was hired by a different organization for them who came in he has really worked with them and then the comedy each other\nThe guy you know he was hired by a different organization the new people who came in these really worked with them and then the ... each other uh he he makes the most is does the best you can using the ... guy and ah you know they're getting\nYou know good years out of there you know a guy like if he doesn't get much attention but she'd grown is having a pretty good year for him for staying healthy and being in the middle of the line them and being a presence there where they really haven't had him in that situation because of drugs just French in than injuries\nOver the last four or five years pretty regularly\nYou know and I think having him there you know makes a huge difference and increase the gather ... they've got a terrific bullpen and ... and they know how to use it so I think yeah I mean it's not going to surprise may have a Milwaukee you don't want so\nAnd the championship series and and and ... and ... the Dodgers\nBecause I think they're better run James and the Dodgers

comes out that there are gambling then you want to and it's very hard for a local ones that do that it's just like with any kind of addiction\nIt's hard for a loved one to cut off a family member or

the\nUh from start to finish they start free and an ... so that was a move along for a bigger ... grows casinos and actually it was ... years now and some of the rules [noise] um\nAnd so\nWe're out there already you know\nThe idea would be how this would work ... came to the casino obstacle came out with\nA schedule which they were sorted out with structure which during each and cure for a for a team they sign up to their injuries experience to turn over it's just like any other tournament\nIt follows his shooting for the call or send us in a\n... a out the worst\nSo the winners would they would get shepherd prizes for be part of the best team um can you also just overlaid with the regular tournaments structure with winners and ... and the money or is it something that's not totally

or in the team poker system through a flashlight design through you know so they could say the boar got an open we are also a partnering with team poker\nAnd a ... people can sign up for teams as long as we follow the seating protocol so that people on the same team or not seated together until the final table\nAnd then we're going to do a a Ninety ten split so actually it's more than just a trophy\nThe same team and not seated together until the final table\nAnd then we're going to do a a Ninety ten split so actually it's more than just a trophy ten percent of the prize pool will go to first second and third teams uh and they'll get ten percent divided up a ... you know whenever fifty\nThirty twenty or to the best teams and they can be a participant and I said so in addition to being now\nPart of life poker rooms you also have this available to poker SARS is that right\nOh no no no stars is not a coal mine mission of ... or if they're using a in Europe a casino where it was world\nA club called king poker [noise] no no I'm going to be confused ... world can you know there's like several of them at all you don't ever right now ... now but [noise] um and the idea would be\nThat any casino or a court room can search for it which is ... actually for the first hundred people in the first three tables is free [noise] so you know some poker and wants to try to a restaurant casino or a small coke or they can try to like it or not\nNow I'm just thinking about the legality is there a way to do this legally in a state that doesn't allow poker\nUm you know for sure I Would think or something like that but I think or they don't allow poker um you know I have a sweepstakes model on online I'm having a charity comes from it's kind of a prototype but I'm working on\nFor so long but um [noise] but me I'm really focusing right now I live I think\nIt's possible then that in states that allow pub poker or other kind of free\nThings where you you don't actually pay money upfront you're doing it in a bar or restaurant\nThe bar or restaurant might contract with you to make it a little more exciting and interesting by having the team concept\nYes it would cost some money after a while to the bar or the restaurant but it might be worth it because it might bring in people and their buddies who might say oh well it's kind of more fun to do it as part of a team that just going individually\nAbsolutely I just can't poker there's maybe a crossover eastward in fact that's not what I designed at the time this can't be good for you know it could be good for me or single sports is sort of a scoring system and so that uh\nI think he comes in these sports car so\nI see so in other words the team teeming doesn't have to just be done with poker it

a pleasure to have you on the show thank you for joining us\nYeah hey Nicorette to talk to you and\nThanks for joining us on real quick the first thing I Want to talk to you about is the clay Matthew situation I think we'd be remiss if we didn't mention it or the second refusing to pass a call I think really aggravated clay Matthews what do you do if you're Mike mccarthy in that situation how do you make a deal yet\n[laughter] I think the whole league is trying to figure it out right now and this was a fear of how this situation would go\nIf if it got to this point this quickly the the general sense from the NFL was that the players would adjust players would learn she tore planted in the pre season and that will launch the regular season hit the new helmets rule and of course the real thing in the past role\nI think the issue appears to be\nA potential lack of consistency from crude accrue because they are Cubans they're not robots they don't exactly coal everything the same way\nAnd then the second part is interpretation letter of the law compared to having a feel an instinct as an official on the field flow of action timing\nAll of those things and talking to genes territory who's now working with CBS as our NFL rules analyst and one of the outstanding officials in the NFL for many years during his career also\nA great basketball officials so his life was that it wasn't as if he was an accountant Monday through friday and then we'll just fly out the games this was his whole life was officiating sports\nI think his take is that you need to have a real gut instinct of\nHow the game is called the flow of action and circumstances surrounding I'm not saying that you change your calls completely based on is it the fourth quarter is the first quarter but it's about having a field and\nThe the clay Matthews called both of them to me I did not exhibit but a true feel for\nThe circumstances surrounding that particular game\nI don't know what's gonna happen Nick I really don't I I think players do adjust and clay Mathews you may have to change something about what he's doing his approach the game but anyone that watch the game for a long time I didn't feel as if those calls were just\nWell the new correct the difficult part about it is on the first one and he was ... he he was aware\nThat that could be a possibility that they were about about it\nAnd he tried to avoid it on the first one so it's not like he wasn't studying and he was you know his awareness was certainly there and I think that's the most watched the most frustrating part about the situation\nYeah no doubt and I think he's trying to play within the confines of the rules\nAnd he's been a great player for a long time I do think there is some frustration when you hit the later part of your\nCareer and his sack numbers are certainly not what they want you worry is being used in a different role lined you as well but he's not the dominant force he's not the dynamo that he once was now he's making play those are two excellent place that you need to put his defense in a position right to do their job\nAnd he's being penalized for it it's it's a legitimate issue right now I Do think the helmet we have seen\nPlayers adjust and curb or their their approach and that's that's a good thing by the way for\nThey took a native ... individual results may vary he went to every detail\nI'm buying a huge flat screen TV so I can finally see without my glasses of wine\nWhat I'm hearing my glasses of contacts are pain I'd love to finally get rid of these but who\nCan

G. All right we talked a little NFL time to talk some college football because that's what we love to talk about on the fan react out now I could lead with your with your poor Aggies\nYeah man a lead with the so we can get the hell out of the way\n[laughter] I'm just glad that a cause that's okay and then my I didn't think got Alabama would cover and for a second they weren't going to cover\nJust show you all know with like two and a half minutes left in the first half paying him had\nA way and then was down by eight points with two and a half minutes left right before halftime and they could have stopped him it was thirty sixteen on like the thirty five yard line of and then so Alabama was like you know well relatively close to the scoring but it was certain Fifteen\nWhat two and a half minutes left only down by eight aim could have stopped them and instead they gave up a touchdown immediately and then\nI think that was partly responsible for the extension of course the building\nBut hey at least we're now for no against the spread this year that is something to be said that is something that's that's something All right\nSo you guys were like did you turn off the game halfway through or did you stick it out or not I didn't I was just watching it together you know who was warning them ever came at the end I didn't watch the first or you\nKnow I didn't ... it wasn't really doesn't ever really get out of expected\nBut what's crazy is I don't know\nWe I don't know what they're saying and team is right I mean the only real conscious were against like two of the top three teams in the country yeah kind of sucks you have no idea like a play that are that early on in your schedule yeah you have no idea how good they are or how bad they are I mean ah I mean\nThat those would have been huge wins they would have been I mean they would have been monumental and even if they\nEven if they had come within I don't know seven points I think that would have been huge from what I Would probably would've gone up in ... oh you look over ... ... they're they're just ungodly good luck to they're going to they have to win at All right they don't rebuild they relocate all keep saying that they have that advantage over everybody now Clinton is a little bit in trouble\nWith his ... yeah so it it became it was like a quarterback controversy for like a for like a minute\nIs weird because Brian again stay in him play better in Bryant played the entire second half against him so Brian had definite control can stay in ... in that second game of the season and then they just said oh no Lawrence is going to start now watching Lawrence you can see decades of freak\nBut they're they're calling it have you heard this year they're calling it the ... the sunshine effect at clubs in three Cubans have now transferred because of warrants coming in [noise]\nWhat they're telling yeah two of them were during the off season so they probably were like you know the kid yeah we got to go somewhere else Brian was like well I'm the senior and then after the game he probably felt he actually said this by the way I don't like that one players do this\nHe said I did everything right and yet they're starting Lawrence I feel like I definitely got screwed over a ... that that's like a\nHe did say that not maybe not in those exact words but he was kinda like\nAnd it's a I feel like I definitely got screwed over um that that's like a\nHe did say that not maybe not in those exact words but he was kind of like really bought her about it and by the way find I get it I Want players to be able to move\nHe really does only have a certain shelf life he has to get the attention in the NFL Zach so that's fine which is why the rules okay even though I don't like it because then you lose step but closer to scrutiny Lawrence goes down I think they're starting like a walk on\nOh no no no I think correct me if I'm wrong\nIf Lawrence goes down we get to have ninth year senior\nWide receiver hunter in fro who I think has been there since the nineties he's not so there yet he's still there he caught a pass to the game he's still there what do you get medical records I think he's the backup punter and I think he's the four main hunter intro\nSo if if it goes down we might be in for a real treat if Lawrence and the butter go down your quarterback is going to be the quarterback wide receiver owner\nHere right [laughter] so giving these listen right here twenty three hours ago on a run for getting practiced Simon quarterback\nOh yeah but how do we know that I Know all I see it on\nA hunger honestly impressed yes\nHe's been there since I think two thousand and five maybe oh he's like Jason wide Oklahoma it was oh yeah yeah or I think he got like eight degrees yeah\nJason why this is how long Jason why was that Oklahoma he tours ACL three times and he's still\nPlayed for four years that's how long he was there and then we ate and how long was he was there or we just started college when he was like thirty yeah same thing with the what was that guy who won the critical thinking oh he was like forty two years old was the place from quarterback in college to Austin I just saw the other day they showed the uh\nThe show the Heisman um uh the the footage from when Chris when he won the Heisman and he gets up and like you are looking you know the other guys are shaking his hand and you go I mean she looks like the coaches congratulating one of the players that he's getting ready to go and say look that much older than them in when he was running the Heisman\n'cause he I mean he was only twenty six when he won the Heisman but still yeah twenty six at max usually you're dealing with a twenty two year old right like a a ... from the highest if you're talking about ... a senior that did their fifth year but twenty six years old getting the highs and he can't even lifted up because he was like on my shoulders man [laughter]\nI think I think when we got drafted he was the same age as Aaron Rodgers who had already been in the league for like five\nYou're at it was like twenty eight or twenty nine when he got drafted it was a dead is can we talk real quick you know how we get gundy from Oklahoma State like a lot of love yeah boy a lot of people are just changing their minds on I changed my tune on them\nAnd I'll take a lot who's the the broadcaster that he was what was he doing a lot in plain sight he accused him of something really bad in plain sight\nYeah he was ... yeah I forgot who it was but yeah a lot of people because of that a lot of people are turning on Gandhi who allowed him to the same thing you said was one of our guys or was it somebody else I don't know if it was one of our guys I think it was I think in plain sight I'm like a I think it was a national media member I don't think it was in the last\nLike pretty much Oh yes it was um it was a national he treated it out that's what it was\nSo it's got to be interesting to look man you got to be likeable if you're if you're going to be if you ... if you're a bad coach like if you have a bad record you better be likeable\nBut as the undefeated right now I don't know what is right here is probably on as well you ought to check okay read yeah\nAll right but so interesting a quarterback situation for Clemson will be interesting to see where Kevin Bryant Kelly Brian ends up going\nBut another a quarterback situation that we need to talk about is in Alabama are jailing hurts makes a decision to stay in Alabama despite being or probably being a backup quarterback\nFor that program for the remainder of the season he by playing this next game he ... his ability to red shirt and will not be able to transfer what do you think about his decision to stay in Alabama [noise] I'll\nLook Andrew ... pretty passionate opinion on this okay I'm going to do\nFirst I think he should leave but he's I don't know the exact time was a that he's actually been in there but he's getting a lot of ah reps as a backup I mean he's probably played in four games he's probably played seven four quarters\nYeah I mean definitely a starter on a lot of programs out there\nYeah but so I think he he's doing himself a disservice they're not going to get more playing time but it's his decision I mean if he wants to stay stay\nYeah I I don't I I as a college football fan loves that he's staying at the school because I like the loyalty to the school because I Know that if I were an aggy and like we had a bad as backup I'd be like please God stay rhyming right um but for him personally I definitely think you should have gone\nOkay and then last Oregon ... uh who cares right but I mean I Wish I were in one of those ... I'll tell you or and I think they got a bad be last week off Amazon or should have won that game dude that's the top four twenty five we did it\nWe did that all on one minute and fifty two seconds ... wow what are we do for the other forty second silent that's it let's talk about the Stanford game how bad they're going to wait but some of the homes is touchdowns for the season by the time we got
