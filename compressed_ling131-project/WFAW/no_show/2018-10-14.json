T. S. S. dot com for the Raymond reports meanwhile do we have a new leader in the world series of handicapped\nYes we do for it it's funny you should say that we had a for the first time in a but the first time in five weeks we finally had to people go for perfect a seminal\nAnd believe this contest works at the world series of handicapping were indoors seven season plans or I have to put it in the ... elections a week and we got a right those are selections from seven units one unit and um if any time during the week they go feminine all\nA day did they win fifty dollars so it's a twenty five dollar atrophy and uh people can still joining but unfortunately because we're in the week sixteen won't be able to uh to sleep for the world series and handicapping rang but again if they go a perfect seven and all during the week they'll win or fifty dollars\nRight and as soon as you indicated we're going into week six why more points this year in the national football league I think I saw last week as if the fifth week it was three point nine points per game more than in two thousand Seventy is just a new rules or what do you think it is\nWell it can be accomplished new rules or just um you know a lot of great often throughout their you you got officers like the LA Rams or you know send you a the Kansas City chiefs putting up a lot of points\nUm you know you look at the runners this week and I were talking earlier this week for games that I have a total of a fifty are more or sorry yeah so the Pittsburgh Cincinnati damage fifty three Tampa Bay it'd be seven\nUm you've got Kansas City a New England fifty nine so moved three games right there that you got a lot of total so that gives you an indication of what what type of a\nFire power that's out there the season in the NFL\nAll right you just mentioned Kansas City New England my home's did not have a great game last week New England has a couple of guys back Edelman included to seem to make a difference just to talk about Kansas City New England and it shouldn't be an exciting game on Sunday night\nWell this is going to be the ... the game of the week or for Sunday night and uh you know this is the one where you know if there was a tell all these to say get your popcorn ready because you know this is going to be a great game to watch 'em when you looked at the New England patriots they're starting to come together now\nI'm sure they add a little full started out of the gate they had a tough game there again um what do you call a good Jacksonville in a week to I Believe that went down in Jacksonville they had a tough one week one twenty seven twenty against the Texans\nAnd then they got destroyed I'm In Detroit plenty thick stand but you look at the last couple of gained thirty eight seven that home again to the dolphins\nThey won last week or thirty eight twenty four\nSo you know things are coming together now ... that are now\nUm you know the the weapons are they've got idleman back a Brady is Brady he's hitting sixty seven percent on the season uh and there was a revenge factor here uh last last year the week one Kansas City came in there and they one forty two twenty seven\nNew England or you know they're they're one of the toughest teams at home in the NFL and that will do some research\nAnd going back to the last two years and including the first five games of the season\nNew England has the best home record in the NFL at Nineteen and five and they've covered Seventeen Seminole or the spread so um if there's one team you don't want to face at home it's New England but that in the city on the other hand you know these these guys all they do is is just keep playing right now we talked about this last week\nYou know sometimes you just look at a team and all they do is win and eat it gets kind of look for reasons to go against them they just like to you know just they just have the the magic firepower going there on our fence\nBut you know uh it's not as if they're reading a lot of world leaders right that they played the chargers the Steelers were you know how to lead to a shootout or the play the forty niners than they weren't thirty twenty seven\nUm the or they want to pay one in the Denver twenty seven twenty three and then they will not home last week and the ants are the Jacksonville Jaguars so\nI'm looking at a New England to dominate this game here this weekend and do the beauty of the\nUh the Rand report has a New England linguist gained twenty two points out under sixteen points sick so we like the patriots and this one here\nFolks the line is I see it or the patriots terrain versus Kansas City and the Raymond report run Raymond likes a New England by six and a half and your thoughts and again you have to do to sign up for the Raymond report to matter where you might be listening you go to ATF stashed dot com me just ask dot com and again that's\nA very very hot or the report was last week go right to another game this week and this one's always interesting Pittsburgh Cincinnati and Marvin Lewis again has never won a playoff game I don't know it was a chief this year is he out or not because people say that every year anyways Pittsburgh Cincinnati uh [noise]\nI don't see much chance here what do you see\nYeah well again right we talked about the over under this game is that fifty three and you know that's Bruce firepower the only concern I have with Pittsburgh right now is okay big Bennett is lining up he's hitting these two Fifteen for a one thirty eight for two Fifteen on the seasons hitting a fifty four percent of his classes\nThe running game James Carter but the thing here that scares me a little bit most I always say in the running game you know Batman named Robin and right now\n[laughter] you look at the end to Connor\n... burger is your second leading Russia and the teams\nNow that's not good [laughter] you know what I'm saying so they're going to have to find a a another goal in Libya does come back after the um the by so that's going to give them a little boost\nBut you know the receiving corps they're the defense of so you know still running a lot of points I'm by no wonder the Pittsburgh Steelers when they're facing that asking north division teams are seven and two and one on the straight up and when they're facing the Cincinnati Bengals in Cincinnati there are six\n... team they're seven and two and one on the straight up and when they're facing the Cincinnati Bengals in Cincinnati there are six and one straight up so they got the Bengals number at home and uh you know the Pittsburgh Steelers they're good very good role team their ache wanting one in the last ten\nAnd look at the last two years or the Steelers have one of the best records on the road at fourteen five and the one and the only thing that's better than the dealers or the New England patriots which are in three so\nI'm you know and you look at the first game that they are and every game\nAnd they can put some points on the board and and you know if if you look at Cincinnati last week they got down Seventeen knocking and uh you know they they rallied a nice little come back but you you can't do that against the teams because you know sometimes you look in the fourth quarter and it's too late so I look for Pittsburgh\nHere to um when this game\nAround Raymond ... you mentioned loving does going to come back after the break compare him to James Garner because I've said Connors are good running back and get here's a guy who defeated cancer so you you know you just wish the best form but loving bell is just one step better at my incorrect or correct\nThink you need a little over a cat\nHe's mark ...\nA thank you Ron Raymond Raymond reports and discuss they're

L. history what a performance by Mr ... what are you waiting for you so with guys like far pain man named Tom Brady and erasures [noise]\nYou know that's just to be on that list or even be considered in the same breath I mean these are great great quarterbacks of all time Tom Brady I think you got to put him at the top that with\nThe super bowl rings kind of proof for that many I Would put you know to all of a two minute warning this is the guy I Want leading my team down the field [noise] you know vintage Craig Manning was always the best camera would win at three\nIn definitely thought about putting breeze Uri\nBut for me routers I think again he's still young [noise] you still have some more time to claim that the league and when when more championships so for me I think that put them on the head of breeze but all the time right now I think breed you can make a solid argument\nIs the third best on that was I think the breeze you know playing the quarterback position you know at the height that he did in just [noise]\nYou know being able to make those reads and really just consistently year after year put up just incredible number for the quarterback position [noise] I think for me consistently saying that well Drew Brees and I think that there'll be remembered for them for\nFive for me as far I just think that he should have probably one more than he did but\nShould have one more they sort of wanting more but um [noise] I agree with you had a part I agree the head of runners and you know what\nIs going to pay many I mean he's he's been in head to head in the super bowl but many are very very close to three whatever might be Brady number one for sure the folks are listening to force overnight America sports ... passes ... who landers that lander solves roughly about\nUm I don't total agreement with you and the outside of Christ sale game on a you know the headline or the\n... going up against just overland are that's going to be a great game one match up of the aces offer both these teams but you know after that yeah what is there and it it there's not a lot of faith or trust in in any of those starters to go\nYou know to go out there ... start um you know against a loaded line up at the Astros have right now going for them\nAnd think about how good George ... years and then to for this team I Know we're gonna talk a lot of you covered the pitching sign up but I mean it that rotations really deep but I mean\nGeorge bring has been almost as good as ready Jackson seemed like early here in in his career\nIn the postseason so yeah I think he's up to ten or eleven years um you know in his brief time you know the big leagues so I think he's appointed to watch TV stays hot for that the uh the he gives them a major boost\nAnd obviously there are loaded with star power so yeah I Can't go against your call me the Astros to me are just hands down\nThe better team I think from on both sides and I think they're gonna prove that and again picking at the right time is is key for them so I'm going to go all ...\nYeah I bought Boston is darned good man I mean they have some underrated pictures in their bullpen their lineup is just as good if not better than the Astros if their starting pitching that I really\nWould worry about as a Red Sox fan more so because of Houston Sprite starting pitching Boston starting pitching well above average but Houston starting pitching is as good as it gets in major league baseball and the red Sox have been using the same price again to also would mean he would come back\n... game six of this theory if anything gets there that she lost it in my opinion for the red Sox because the price ... pitch in the postseason you haven't done that I'm not sure he'll ever be able to do I I guess or you're just left speechless there are I guess you have athletes who they\nKnow to agree with you there very I Would want view I I'd definitely with you I think that he's been brutal yeah he's definitely a pitcher you don't want to see out there pitching in these big games because of his resume it it just yeah we'd go out to be desired so\nYeah if if I'm Red Sox fans I Do not want to see David Price starting in the series I mean why\nNot give it a water Rodriguez and opportunity why not go stale game one a ball game true for\nSeveral games weeks even bring back sale in ... given what a Rodriguez champion stale out both have I mean use that price out of the bullpen he just has not gone down in the postseason prior to his Red Sox career at in his Red Sox group of folks are listening to sports overnight America with his forthcoming dot com and Lenny ...\nOutlandish talks rama Cleese at mad dog half\nBack then we'll be right back with NFL\nWeeks six ...

Kevin's a big reason why used to be there next big winner just seems promos code as a way that test awake at ... percent\nOff a subscription at the fast army dot com Kevin ... welcome back to the show here on sports over night of America looking at the games as we boxing falcons appear to have the highest ... total I assume that the game you're looking at\n[noise] that's the one you want to get involved with on many slate and um this is the same Tampa Bay bucks defense\nThat allowed Mitch Trump escape to put up six touchdowns just two weeks ago so the question is have they improved did anything happen over the by week I'm thinking now\nAnd so yeah I Want everything to do with the Atlanta off and\nEven the bucks all fenced because Atlanta is similarly terrible and went to terrible defenses and quality office is meat fireworks happen that's the game to get involved with this week so you know load up on\nMatt Ryan Julio Jones ... new Calvin Ridley and on the flip side we like I'm ...\nEvans gone when Jackson even camera brave who could have the tide in position all to himself for capital yeah foe\nJay how it is in fact how that can be a a big\nStart there with cameras brave for sure I get everyone\nThe fs army dot com the fs army ... ... s away SLA at the fs army\nDot com so yeah falcons bucks kind of a no brainer therefore anyone that is I'm a regular BS bass player but for those who are new to it definitely take a look at that game the Kevin let's talk about some of the other position starting with quarterback\nDefinitely so you know for not talking about again Ryan in Winston who are going to be my uh my favorite place of the week as far as being you know most obvious ones um couple of guys that like you know Jared golf he's been putting up a massive numbers every single week\nI'm even with Tom girlie putting up his\nNumber like the rams office is in seemingly unstoppable right now actually liked him better on the road because they're opposing team actually has like some semblance\nOf a chance to keep the game close which continues dependency points piling up throughout the entire game so it doesn't like off the shore and Watson is another guy\nThat has just been so incredibly consistent\nThere's no reason not to keep it rolling with him he has a new weapon my man Kiki Cody and\nThat was really missing piece in the dolphins so you know you've got the two down the field threats with Watson and full or and now you have Tony I'm moving to change so a really really good combo going on for the Houston Texans and if you need a really sneaky one\nKind of like um Baker Mayfield at home against the not that good on the road chargers the fence you know may feel some exciting player he's super cheap\nAnd I don't think a lot of people are going to be messing with Baker make deals with all the more attractive option kind of just slightly more expensive so um my my sleep or play\nUh my ... my Mitch Trybulski play of avoid section is I'm bigger may feel yeah\nHopefully it works out just as well but for the one dead it's funny I actually have Mayfield\nRyan in Winston my line up right now haven't taken a look at golf but there's still more time to make a\nHuge amount of more lineups so over too wide receiver obviously you have the Ryan weapons to Winston weapons um\nAre we not entirely sure yet what the status of Brandon coats and Cooper tapas which obviously would make Ropper woods a hell of a play this week and you're going to try and Paris of almost golf with walked in I think it's obvious he named the guys with Mayfield on the other hand is a Jarvis Landry that David a joke do um\nI Believe one of ... out this week meeting the other one's boss being could play too\nYeah there we go I mean there's there's wide receiver physician is really a I'm going to call it wide open this week there was a couple of plant that I particularly like and you need a couple of them um I you know down with drivers Landry I'm ready to go back\nTo him in that natural ... against the chargers or one guy I really like a lot and he's been on a price especially and FanDuel and I'm going back to the well with him as Tyler boy and bear with me for a second so Joe hate in a in the corner for the Steelers he is one of the best corners in late and he's particularly good at\nCovering age and green\nSo\nNo tight end to speak of really from the bangles I really think they're going to have to feature Boyd um they're gonna have to go away from greed a little bit with some of those targets and I you know I'm ready to go back to the boy band wagon he hadn't done last week the whole\nBengals often just didn't look good last week um they they scored with their defense which didn't never helpful for all sense of fancy points so boy does my sort of salary saber guy of the week\nAnd another guy going back to and I know you know as part of the big game but I think a lot of people are going to be afraid to roster Julio Jones again\nSome of the week and another guy going back to when I Know you know it's part of the big game but I think a lot of people are going to be afraid to roster Julio Jones again because he's burned to so many times already this year\nBut uh I'm In tournaments I don't know about in in you know smaller cash games but in larger tournaments I'm gonna go back to the Julio bandwagon and see if he can put one together against the worst defense in the history of ah the NFL\nYeah his prices drop man on tracking these under eight thousand all on\nYou know for that price he doesn't really need to have a Julio forty point explosion you know for the Seventy nine hundred you know who knows the price in the in the um ... you know a thousand Fifteen hundred more than this in the past so at the at the price point that who is now he just needs to really get you know ten or twelve targets to make value\nYeah twenty five points from polio not out of the question even without a touchdown [laughter] you know he knows what he's you know he ... he can make that happen for sure how about running backs I when I was looking at looks like it was very top heavy and then I just could not seem to settle on anyone in the middle or it's a part of that's why you're here though\nI Do have some you know we can talk about the obvious ones I don't know that everybody needs to hear the ... is a great plus he is playing it like start your line of awful time girl a summer melt and Gordon oh he's a great play trying to get him in your line of right um but but moving at all is a little bit a couple of guys that like I\nReally don't mix in with I'm Joe Bernard out\nFor seeing it sounded the Steelers have a bad run the fence by any stretch its just targets and opportunities are mixing it's just going to be in there\nThe whole time you know there's no there's no backup\nThere's no other guy that's going to come into spell him he's basically going to be in the game no matter what's happening and that's what I Want in my in the running back position I'm TJ yelled in starting for foreign net no backup plan either the only negative with now or with yelled and being Dallas it's such a slow all sense\nThat it's really um\n... reduces the amount of opportunities for ... for the opposing team so um it's a little dangerous flip yelled in because you know the jaguars might get you know Seventy percent of the ... on all things that they normally get playing playing against the cowboys who are in very slow team\nAnd the I don't know if there's a sneaky but the salary savings special\nFor this week is going to be having Coleman um as of right now it looks like the vaunted Freeman might not\nPlay [noise] he's got some sort of a foot issue\nJust popped up yesterday so Freeman is out we're trying to get exposure to this Tampa Atlanta game wherever we can and Coleman is a fairly inexpensive way to get our greedy little fingers into the highest\nProjected game of the week uh you\nKnow what I didn't hear about Freeman but that's a that's an interesting call and certainly Kevin Coleman was great in free minutes absence earlier in the year so we don't always tend to talk about the pie that edition of the fence about tea but there's a lot but we do have time here today and\nNow I still think you need a little over a cat\nHe's mark man seen in a\nA thank you run or a Mediterranean reports into

I Would have won at three\nIndefinitely thought about couldn't breathe theory\nBut for me Rogers I think again he still you're young you still have some more time to find that in the league and when when more championships so for me I think I put them on the head of breeze but all the time right now at the breed you can make up a solid argument is the third best on that was\nAbout what do I think the breeze you know playing the quarterback position you know at the height\nThat he did and just being able to make those reads and really just consistently year every year put up just\nIncredible number for the [noise] the quarterback position [noise] I think for me consistently saying that well Drew Brees and I think that there'll be remembered for them for five for me as far as things that he should have probably one more than he did but\nShould have one more they sort of one more but [noise] um [noise] I agree with you had a far I have read the head of runners and they know what it

lot of faith and trust in in any of those starters to go\nYou know to go out there ... start um you know against all over the line up they at the Astros have right now going for them\nAnd think about how good George Springer as has been to for this team I Know we're we're gonna talk a lot of you covered the pitching side of it I mean it that rotations really deep but I mean\nGeorge fingers been almost as good as ready Jackson seemed like early here in in his career\nIn the postseason so yeah I think he's up to ten ten or eleven years um you know in his brief time you know in the big leagues so I think he's a player to watch she stays hot for that team and he he gives them a major boost\nAnd obviously there are loaded with star power so yeah I Can't go against your car I mean the Astros to me are just hands down\nThe better team I think from on both sides and I think they're gonna prove that\nAnd again picking at the right time is key for them so I'm going to go all ...\nYeah I bought Boston is darn good man I mean they have some underrated pictures in their bullpen their lineup is just as good if not better than the Astros if the starting pitching that I really\nWorry about as a Red Sox fan more so because of Houston's great starting pitching Boston starting pitching well above average but Houston starting pitching is as good as it gets in major league baseball and the red Sox have been using David pricing game to also wouldn't be she would come back\nThe game six of the series if anything gets there that's two losses in my opinion for the red Sox because they've been priced can't pitch in the postseason you haven't done it and I'm not sure he'll ever be able to do I I guess or your just\nI sit in my opinion for the red Sox because they've been priced can't pitch in the postseason you haven't done that I'm not sure he'll ever be able to do I I guess you're you're just left speechless they're wrong [laughter] I get your ... who they\nKnow to agree with you the story I Will view I'd definitely with you I think that he's been brutal yeah he's definitely a pitcher you don't want to see out there pitching in these big games because of his resume it it just yeah we'd go out to be desired so\nYeah if they find the red Sox fans I Do not want to see David Price starting in this area I mean why not give it a water Rodriguez opportunity why not go stale game\nOne of all the games to for several games weeks even bring back sale a game for onshore arrested even water Rodriguez champion who say a lot of the bowl had to use that price has both had he

Cooper tapas which obviously would make raw for woods a hell of a play this week it you're going to try and Paris of almost golf with walked in I think it's obvious you named the guys with Mayfield on the other hand\nIs it Jarvis Landry that David a joke to um I Believe one of ... out this week meeting the other one boxing you could play too\nYeah there we go I mean there's there's wide receiver physician is really a I'm going to call it wide open this week there was a couple of plants that I particularly like and you need a couple of them um I get on down which offers Landry\nI'm ready to go back to him in that natural ... against the chargers or one guy I really like a lot and he's been on a price especially on FanDuel and I'm going back to the well with him as Tyler boy\nAnd bear with me for a second so Joe hate in a corner for the Steelers he is one of the best corners an elite and he's particularly good at covering AJ green so with no tight end to speak of really for the Bengals\nI really think they're going to have to feature Boyd um they're gonna have to go away for a green a little bit with some of those targets and I you know I'm ready to go back\nTo the boy bandwagon he hadn't done last week the whole\nBengals often just didn't look good last week um they they scored with their defense which isn't never helpful for offensive fancy points so boy does my sort of salary saver guy of the week and\nAnother guy going back to and I know you know it's part of the big game but I think a lot of people are going to be afraid to roster Julio Jones again because he's burned you so many times already this year\nBut uh I'm In tournaments I don't know about in in you know smaller cash games but in larger tournaments I'm gonna go back to the Julio bandwagon and see if he can put one together against the worst defense in the history of ah\nThe NFL yeah his price a straw man on Dr King's he's under eight thousand all\n... you know for that price he doesn't really need to have a Julio forty point explosion you know for the Seventy nine hundred you know who has been price in the in the\nUm you know a thousand Fifteen hundred more than this in the past so and so at the price point that who is now he just needs to really get you know ten or twelve targets to make value\nYeah twenty five points on polio not out of the question even without a touchdown [laughter] you know he knows what he knew he ... he can make that happen for sure how about running backs when I was looking at looks like it was very top heavy and then I just could not seem to federal want anyone in the middle or at the bottom of that is why you're here though\nI Do have some ... you know we can talk about the obvious ones I don't know that everybody needs to hear the tundra really is a great play PS plan might start your line of off with Tom girl like summer a Melvin Gordon oh he's a great play trying to get him in your line of right\nUm but but moving at all is a little bit a couple of guys that like I I really don't mix in with I'm Joe Bernard out\nFor seeing it sounded the Steelers have a bad run the fence by any stretch its just targets and opportunities a mix and it's just going to be in there the whole time\nYou know there's no there's no backup there's no other guy that's going to come into spell him he basically going to be in the game no matter what's happening and that's what I Want in my in the running back position I'm TJ yelled in starting for for net\nNo backup plan either the only negative with now is a whiff yelled and being Dallas is such a slow on fence\nThat it's really um\n... reduces the amount of opportunities for fancy scoring of the opposing team so um it's a little dangerous with the elderly because you know the jaguars might get you know Seventy percent of the ... on all things that they normally get playing playing against the cowboys who are very slow team\nAnd the I don't know if there's a sneaky but the salaries saving special\nFor this week is going to be having Coleman um as of right now it looks like the author Freeman might not play\n[noise] he's got some sort of a foot issue just popped up yesterday so Freeman is out we're trying to get the exposure to this Tampa Atlanta gain wherever we can and Coleman is a fairly inexpensive way to get our\nGreedy little fingers into the highest projected game of

find out something after sort of the fact that occurred ride you Monday morning quarterback I shouldn't have eaten Fifteen hotdogs at the barbecue after you started vomiting all night last night Monday morning quarterbacking or for\nThe president really made a mistake on that deal after it blows up and costs five hundred thousand jobs that's Monday morning quarterbacking in case of the New York giants let's call friday morning quarterbacking\nBecause the New York giants have clearly made a mistake in the draft\nNot so much drafting supply Barclay what a fine player he is you get a hundred and thirty yards rushing with a fifty yard touchdown against eagles but that's not what they need that's not what they need because last night it was plainly although obvious that what they needed more than anything else was a quarterback because now they don't have one\nThey don't have one in Eli Manning anymore and there is no no chance that\nHe lied turns it around at the age of

pile up on your personal calendar\nAs every day you just continue to get older and older you don't get to go back in time and relive the glory days when you were in your twenties and thirties seven

you're never going to get better I can exercise all I Want it's always going to be a little lake in ...\nHe lie manning is not going to turn into a twenty five year old elite quarterback in this league anymore\nThe giants needed desperately to look in the future but they weren't hanging on because he gave them so much in terms of the super bowl victories against the patriots\nAnd the belief was in the right frame of mind let's put an office of lying around them so he doesn't get shelled every single game let's give him a running back so that they can take some pressure off the passing game\nBut the reality of it is is when you have young challenge in on this football team everybody is going to look at the quarterback and they're going to start wondering is he the guy that's going to take us this was a quarterback league we all know that\nOr ... probably would have ended up with the giants\nAnd what if Phillip Rivers went to a team and he just his career didn't work out as successful as it did in San Diego based on personnel bad coaching\nSavannah offensive line rivers would have ended up with the giants because the whole reason for he lived with the with the giants ... and he goes because they swap picks because he like came out that I'm not playing in San Diego\nRight so but what if some of rivers one to another team let's say he went to a team than in a bad off of line and he got sacked all the time and he got hurt you never quite recovered and he just had a he just had a rather ordinary career tentative does he have any kids or does he told his wife I Can't afford it anymore I don't have a career honey I'm done\nI'm not making millions of dollars like Drew Brees is I don't have a Drew Brees contract again have eight kids\nI mean there there's a whole bunch of aspects of this\nAnd if ... if they if he does go to the giants through they went through the rules\nYeah do they win two Super Bowls is right does he throws the kind of pass David diary catches on his head\nHarm sharing we got thrown that kind of that guy to fast what and what about the things\nThe things the same time we talked about this with priests breeze was so important to that franchise because he comes in after Katrina Katrina decimate Sioux City it does to me it's the population everybody's moved out everybody had to evacuate some come back some don't come back right the city\nIs is underwater in his businesses leaving the saints are trying to survive but they're playing in San Antonio and you know there is an open city in Los Angeles that just begging for an NFL team to the saints go man I'm Sorry New Orleans but there's just no way we can make this work it's just\nNot good enough breeze joined that team and gay they're hoping like let's let's build this field to get the let's get this moving they win a Super Bowl a couple of years later maybe they never win a Super Bowl maybe they become a a team that never find its footing again I don't know that might be too extreme because no no but\nI ended up on the ranch outside the front of the butterfly effect that's exactly right but I mean we're in New Orleans can may you know they ... they were struggling anyways maybe they just couldn't foot the bill for a an NFL franchise because there's nothing to really rally behind\nI mean think about your season ticket holders or not you know are now with houses that are underwater and not even in the city your businesses they give you a local sponsorship are suffering and they're like well you gotta move out or we got to go somewhere else or\nThere's no money to you know to\nTo provide the kind of local dollars that you're looking for sure the national television revenue comes ensure the all the other national dollars come in all the merchandise that you're sharing with everybody else is coming in so it's not like the other things would go broke\nBut they're not going to have an advantage in terms of the local revenue in the ticket revenue if you have a ... as a fan base it's out of town and are dealing with the fact that their houses ruined\nRates so Drew Brees comes a board to New Orleans and there's a feeling like hey we got we got the quarterback here like\nWe can build something at let's stay in which the support the scene of the best we possibly can and it paid off of the super bowl a few years later but that doesn't happen if Drew Brees as shoulder is fine because he's either a going to be in San Diego or or Miami is going to keep 'em and say yeah well you know\nIf if indeed the charges wanted to move on I doubt that\nHe he ... he stays in your stays with the dolphins says a lot of factors here about it's amazing how that works\nDoesn't it like you find one thing and you're like all of these storylines\nCould've could've been completely did go to that parallel universe I'm just I Want the answer now that's how I ride the butterfly effect I Want to answer I told you this before I Want the butterfly effect of the raiders winning the edge a playoff game against the patriots the game that's another one I Want that so bad because I really want to know what ... what Tom\nBrady becomes if he goes into the off season as a great feeling for drew Bledsoe that got us to the playoffs but we got too much money invested in the starter kind of equation like what does that become for New England\nYeah if ... if he had one of those who were well what are you still in the south like learning and brought them to see what\nYou think you'd like to think when I talk to my friends in New England covered the patriots at the time and they all say now they don't check would have made that move craft would have made that move a really really like Tom Brady but you know I mean a lot of times you're putting your paying a lot of money to a guy\nAnd he got hurt and ... you you achieve this kid comes in and he's playing really well he gets you to the playoffs but there's also that factor of okay next year are we really going to go with that now there's more film on um is really gonna be capable of\nThe adjustments leagues are gonna be making two of them can be overcome that we know drew Bledsoe can he he's he's a quarterback that led us to a Super Bowl one other time in our in his career we know he can can this kid do that is it too much of a of a gamble\nSo my argument to them as always been yeah but we're not really a hundred percent sure on that it's easy because he won the Superbowl it'd\nBe like wow we got to go with the guy that won the super bowl but we're we're seeing that kind of play it out right now I mean at that time we had the we have to think back remember Tom\nBrady wasn't Tom Brady no he wasn't in the next year they went nine and seven and didn't make the\nPlay off right and what we saw that was kind of saw similar situation playoffs this year where Nick fold won the team of Super Bowl won the eagles the super bowl I mean it was always a soon there's going to be cars and wants his job when he came back and it was yeah then you know\nBut you know we saw the flip side of it you'd be you know the drew Bledsoe\nEffect I guess yeah instead of thinking what Tom Brady who just won the super bowl\nYeah in ... in it so I always I Want to know that that parallel there's all sorts of there's all sorts of fun ones out there there's there's all sorts of crazy ones I I have a a one\nUm but ... didn't get hurt yeah well how much how much more of a legacy we're the the British show on tariffs have\nOh that's true how long how many super\nBowls what do they would would've Kurt Warner's stay woods where they have they been more of a need to keep him around\nJohn instead of releasing them I Know or you know that's a question we should throw out there what sports butterfly effect would you what parallel universe would you like to see if you could change one thing and sports I Would affected the rest of the rest of the sports world one\nThere's more ... the most prominent woman probably would have the red Sox never got rid of Babe Ruth\nYeah that that was the one I have one or the Yankees have twenty seven titles I have one what is\nAaron Boone didn't hurt his knee playing pick up basketball because the because Aaron Boone it in a home run it to beat the red Sox and then that off season he got into it he played played pickup basketball\nAnd he hurt his ... he hurt his knee and that prompted the Yankees go well screw this we need we need to get Alex Rodriguez and they got Alex Rodriguez the Yankees could offer Alex Rodriguez obviously the the the money they got they got rid of Boone and the red Sox were in pursuit as well and one of the main reasons Alex Rodriguez was you know\nWhen when the Yankees the Yankees were like you know we can play you in the in the red Sox were like well we can't give you a shortstop and the\n... he always thought Jeter could could would give him over given the position but that was never going to happen\nBut that was the Yankees the Yankees catalyst for getting it right and the picking up the money was the fact that Boone who they liked and was it was pretty pretty reliable had gotten in a major injury and so they went out and pursue them there's all sorts of ones out there\nBoone who they liked it was it was pretty pretty reliable\nHad gotten to a major injury and so they went out and pursue them there's all sorts of ones out there they're fun that are fun to do they don't do something seven seven to nine zero seven or if you like it is up on Twitter and joining the radio or at Ron Paul ... the sports butterfly moment the parallel universe you'd like to peek into if a certain thing did or did not happen\nIn the sports world we're talking about Drew Brees not hurting your shoulder could

okay but I'm but I'm curious anyways\nUm\nMagic Johnson had never contracted HIV oh that's a great one would Michael Jordan be as big as he was or he became because he kind of became the face like magic was arguably the greatest basketball player of that era\nAnd if you never contracted H. I. V. missed all that time because of that because of that is a Ninety\nNinety One Ninety two right around around the beginning of the dominance of the bowls right because the because magic Michael started by beating magic in the Lakers but\nNeither would it hasn't but there would have been a good rivalry magic obviously wasn't feeling well we've come to find out later you know later on afterwards said he wasn't\nA hundred percent during the\nYou know there was probably a lot on an outline that's that's a good one you know and then when you know to the point of greatest century athlete amuses Michael Jordan\nBecome the mogul that it became clear that he still does because of many you know he was in a high profile market he was the face of the bowls and then just play well\nBut he just kind of sit there and go okay well would've magical was able to have that same sort of rivalry that he did was bird were obviously magic is bigger than bird that's pretty good\nThat's pretty good I like that I liked that one because there are you start thinking about the west remember one of the things about the west there was almost like a power vacuum ... like because Michael be\nLike in the early part he beat the Lakers um he'd be Phoenix any Portland early I Do not in that order I think it was Lakers Portland Phoenix in the first three championships\nSo there was like a little bit of a pet that wasn't a dominant western team and that could have been the Lakers of magic and stayed there and that's that's a really good one All right speaking with George now about this what if\nThe major league baseball players don't go on strike in Ninety four and Jordan who did not want to cross the picket line stayed in ... in minor league baseball\nBats according to the documentary Jordan rides the bus I don't necessarily believe it but according to the documentary Jordan rides the bus Jordan was dedicated to baseball he really did want to play baseball he didn't want to go back in the I mean he really did want to make a career in baseball and he was playing better\nIn Birmingham late in the season and was committed to play in the Arizona fall league that winter but the baseball players went on strike and joined being a union guy from the NBA\nFeel comfortable with becoming a potential scab players ... so ... so that according to the documentary was his decision to go back and and play in the NBA just say I can't be in baseball anymore if the players are on strike I don't want to be a part of a system in the minors that\nThat could be used to because they talked about using scab players the beginning or minor league players in the beginning of the season he didn't want to be a part of that so that's why he went back to the NBA I don't buy it I think the reason Michael Jordan went back to the NBA because David Stern said okay your suspension for gambling is over you can come back\nYeah [laughter] my conspiracy theory no surgery I was a long time ago at that time\nI mean ... there was a there was a real problem but you didn't want the face of the franchise or the ... I mean ... I'm going to say franchise 'cause I mean I'm saying the NBA is a franchise has he association is there and the association you know the ... to be in that kind of trouble\nOh he was in that day and he was going to casinos during the playoff games and you know it was all sorts of he's hanging around with these mob gamblers and all I mean there was all sorts of stories about Jordan at the time that makes\nThat conspiracy theory believable that wasn't just apparently not ... but you know I live in a row of it probably is I've always said there were two conspiracy theories I Believe my only to my whole life that's it and that was Jordan and the and the suspension Andy Patrick Ewing in the next that was the only two\nLike everybody else would give me all sorts of ones like oh they're manipulating games I'm like nah it's hard to do ... it's hard to keep everybody quiet it's very hard to manipulate games and oh by that and I'll buy this and\nBut the the two that I Believe\n... involving David because they both involve David Stern and I think David Stern is crafty enough to pull this off\nWas I got to give them ... number one pick to get Patrick Ewing so I don't care how he did it I mean people have got their suspicions about how in the world he pulled that involve out for the Knicks to be the number one team frozen envelope\n... fold in the ... I don't care I don't even want to know I just know he did I just know they get to the the Knicks would get the number one pick in eighty five that'll still believe now that Jordan one I've gone back and forth with but the the there was there's probable evidence not evidence for probable circumstances\nTo sort of make the assumption that that's that that could have happened or David Stern said Michael Jordan down said hey listen man you got to disappear for a little bit this kind of calm down like ... you're the number one\nOr David Stern said Michael Jordan down said hey listen man you got to disappear for a little bit this kind of calm down like ... you're the number one dry have but if you get caught like Pete Rose I Can't I Can't save you like I gotta I gotta we gotta make this I've got to we've got to let this play out\nAnd let this die down because if if again if you're caught with these gamblers on golf courses in your opening a significant amount of money like I Can't in ... I cannot have this in a in a league you may be the biggest thing I've got you may be the biggest dry have\nBut I Can't see the association if if you're linked to mob gamblers because you remember when the rose thing member when people were always arguing about um [noise] yeah well Pete Rose never bet against the red so there's no crime and that the people don't understand\nThe problem when you when you it doesn't matter who you bet with us or against when you're in professional sports because there's always the potential that you're in over your head\nAnd why would you dive in your personal fortune to pay a gambling debt when a gambling ... can be eradicated if you just make some some changes in the way you play the game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNine\nIs true for the environment\nThe owner of I'm In Brooklyn New York actually\nIf you look at it from a perspective of a bizarre you know we look at their industry right now it's on the line\n\nFrom how\nLong\n\n\n\n\nYou can show me around personality\nThey are to a game show they focus on specific not generalities policies not personality and they demand the candidates back up their positions and promises with facts that stand the test some scrutiny that's our goal tonight and to that end we've sat specific rules for the candidates to which they have agreed\nThe order of candidates have been determined by calling time you don't play favorites but we do expect them to keep just time\nFor the majority of the hour that means Ninety second and third two panelists question now are candidates Cynthia ... countdown clock and so do I if they reach their Ninety second limit and continue I ask them to stop if they go on I Will do note and their microphone will cease to function than we move on\nCandidates have been known to avoid giving since it's against their do to change the subject if that happens we have agreed that the moderator will invoke the option to call them out on it and give them just thirty seconds to answer the question as at\nOur candidates have agreed not to use props and we won't either\nToward the ladder quarter of the hour we will act a few quick questions of each candidate for for which they each have thirty seconds to respond and uh let's say directly attack their opponents there was no re bottle\nWe close with too many statements from each candidate now let's get started by welcoming them with the titles they've asked us to use senator Tammy Baldwin and Liam Luke mere and now we'll start the questioning and we start with Ben Meyer of W. J. F. W. TV Enron land or if they\nThink you're going to vote there when you must read in a new office today at real Donald Trump says boldly Harold demolish or promises towards teenagers unquote\nYou wish to an op ed by President Trump that attack Medicare overall what you're going Baldwin care because senator bowl when the cold bus or the proposal\nIn that USA Today that the president said Medicare for all would quote invigorating Medicare unquote\nBut multiple nonpartisan fact checkers to bump that and other under President Clinton was in fact the Washington Post ... ... what is the bar that say quote almost every citizen contained ... a misleading statement more also\nFor example seniors will lose their benefits they'll get more must move where do you stand behind the president's office\nI stand behind the fact that the plan that senator Baldwin is supporting and I have called it Baldwin care which is a complete government takeover of health care [noise] she wants to turn the entire ship bang over to government will if you read the bill and I have it well\nTo try care program that our veterans you they will also dismantle the Affordable CARE Act and I agree with that we shouldn't dismantle that but it also gets rid of private insurance\nAnd I think it Tammy Baldwin is okay with that I'm not\nThis is a scary scenario to me as a nurse who has given quality care to patients throughout my entire career\nAnd Tammy Baldwin and wants to put everyone on a system where doctors will be reimbursed at much lower rate\nThat means far few doctors are going to participate many will retire fewer will want to answer into the field of medicine so we'll have fewer doctors\nMore patient sent me the quality of care is going to go down I worked too hard to get quality care to patients in my career and I'm not going to let that happen to our seniors or to anyone in the state of Wisconsin or in our country\nThat senator ... ...\nWell first of all I read that fat check and I I agree with the premise of your question that almost every size a line was I was not true\nUm but I Want to say that um [noise]\nLive both near talks a lot about her time as a nurse but I really want to focus on her voting record a as a sixteen year a politician\nNo wonder if she was worried about private insurance at every a vote a on health issues she seems to have sided more\nWith the private insurers then she has with patients whether that's her vote to deny insurance coverage for oral came out for her vote to deny deaf children cochlear implants are hearing aids for her vote to prevent insurance companies from expanding mental health coverage\nExcept for what has been discovered through research in other countries for what ever private a privately funded research has been done\nAnd that's the problem because we need to know if this has an effect of alternative to other drugs for glaucoma or for wasting syndrome or for 'em\nOr any number of other conditions how about an alternative treatment Japan that's less ah ah addictive than opioids that have killed so many people in this country [noise]\nUm but we also have other issues in the federal government\nIn states now where it is legal to use marijuana for medicinal purposes\nFederally employed doctors can't discuss that with their patients that's a problem a doctor should have free rein to talk about all options with our patients and so we have more I'm certainly more work to do in this area uh of relieving pain\nAnd ended up all your time is that when you're ... yeah well thank you very much I firmly believe that this is an issue that should be settled at the state level and I have very serious concerns about legalization of marijuana marijuana and people know that I've had that I look at\nMarijuana and the fact that it is a schedule one drug\nWhich we know means there are no medical indications for a few and therefore I Believe it is very concerning that senator ball when would be willing to open this up you know the drug the department of drug enforcement at education has said that marijuana is\nHighly addictive even more addictive than bike it ends and math and other drugs we have a Syria heroin and opioid addiction problems in our states and in our country and the problem that senator Baldwin avoid it at our home a VA and I got to tell you\nI don't want to put us in a situation where we are now contributing to that and making the problem worse the governor of Colorado democratic governor has warned has said the the where the careful before you go down this road\nAlso and the nurse I look at this from the perspective of the research I seen on the brain development of our young people I Am very concerned that if we start going down this road where we make this legal what is going to happen to our young people\nI'm not willing to take that risk much more time you're committed I Need to see what happens in states like Colorado\nAnd now we're going to go over to our social media desk was highly chocolate and she has a question for humans Will Smith\nThank you Joe sitting ladies a lot of people on social media wanted me to ask about climate change report released earlier this month by the United nations' scientific panel on climate change says the consequences of climate change are more immediate than previously thought\nThat includes worsening food shortages wildfires and a massive die offs of coral reefs by the year twenty forty minerals near you signs and no climate tax pledge\nWhich means he would promise to fight legislation that taxes industries producing carbon ... do you agree with the science behind climate change and it's a fad\nAnd in light of the un report does your stance no change\nAs there is usually the airport is loss\nFor God gave a fifth grader and it is our responsibility to nurture it and to care for it and that means making sure that we are taking care of our natural resources\nBut we also have to be careful that when we go down the road of trying to affect climate change and climate is changing I think everyone agrees that\nWhat we have to be careful of us when we go down this road that we balance whatever procedures and mechanisms that we're doing to try to affect\nThe changing climate that we're not\nDoing something without certainty that is going to make a difference\nA problem with so many of the green ideas they're not based in science and they're based on a whim and there's no certainty that it's actually going to make a difference we have to balance our need for protecting this beautiful or if that was given to us\nWith the need to make sure that we're not spending money in areas that aren't going to make a difference\nThese are proposal that\nPut a lot of old enough on countries that are the only ones that follow through on it like America\nAnd other countries are doing absolutely nothing and how fair it's at and it's not fair to our industry I Believe we can truly take care of that if we'd balance so she needs together I'm committed to it I Know we can do it\nBut we have to be careful that we just don't embrace crazy a stream ideas that have no certain benefits to make a difference on the entire time is up and now for a response senator both\nI reviewed the un climate report um it's done such a present very dire a concern including a global have temperature warms warming up about two point seven degrees Fahrenheit by a twenty forty I also see it all around me\nAh I've been twice up to\nA northern counties in twenty sixteen twenty Eighteen just to survey damage from a incredibly extreme rain events that have washed out roads and cost a local communities state and federal our resources in order to repair on an emergency basis\nSo I see what's happening my opponent and this is where you have such a clear choice in this election my opponent not only disputes climate science and I'm learning today that she also uh is disputing some of the science behind cleaner energy sources et cetera but she also would see a\nFitting to eliminate the environmental protection agency the ISI a which protects the water we drink and the air we breathe we all share that on this planet and we have got to continue to press for better stewardship an resiliency these days\nIn in addition um I\nI just have to say that\nThe effects are around us there and media and I have\nTo say your time it's okay we're going to find that out because she never knew that that he would just you'd like if you'd like to you that I've never heard of the the EPA like to do that ...\nYou may Jewish than say a slow move onto the next question\nJob the Supreme Court\nJustice\nThe next question I mean a new job in the print\nABC News poll released yesterday shows American disapprove of justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court\nAlso fifty three percent I'm responding supporter more investigation by Congress allegations of sexual misconduct allegations of perjury much use the Portland visual investigation by Congress John travolta's accomplish [noise]\nI I\nRemember the nomination of a Brett Kavanaugh and getting an opportunity to review his records\nAnd my immediate concerns or that ah the people Wisconsin have a fair impartial\nAn independent voice on the Supreme Court justice um because I realized how high the stakes are that hanging in the um the the you know dependent on on a who want to be the next justice we had um a potential for the court to\nA side with polluters over a a regulation to put 'em to keep our ... our water clean that we had the opportunities to potentially see the roll back in women's health and access to contraception\nAnd we had a candidate who wrote about saying that a president shouldn't get a scrutiny or investigation or subpoenas I'm no wonder the president nominated him but I have\nTo say I'm I decided ah that I couldn't cast a vote in favor of Brett Kavanaugh after my early review of his record I have seven times to the White House to meet with Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd the White House fail to make that opportunity available to me and dozens of my colleagues I might add\nBut as to the doctor a blessing for it I found her credible and compelling and I believe her and I want all young men and women to be able to stay there\nI'm going to have to invoke the moderators options to ask you to address is this a question that was asked\nAbout reopening an investigation into the allegations against him both of sexual misconduct and the allegation of perjury and you have thirty seconds to respond to that specifically\nFall specifically say that I don't believe that the White House allows a full and\nFair investigation I had a chance to review the FBI report on two occasions after it came out and it was clear that they limited access to witnesses they were just a few\nAnd didn't follow a chips or clues I think it's only fair that when somebody against all odds speaks out like Dr ... for that there should be a thorough review\nI remember as a young are holding a twenty four week old baby in my hand and I saw that tiny heart eating just feeding so quickly under that thin shafts while trying to cling on to life and senator Baldwin belief that that's a woman's right\nTo choose that is the right to kill it's wrong I Will always oppose that\nI could move man or a lifetime\nAnd I have to invoke the option again the question was about what would be done after roe v ways especially on behalf of women [noise]\nAbortion is wrong what can I say abortion is wrong there are other choices I don't understand why people look at it from this perspective fire met people\nTo give them up for adoption\nAnd they're so grateful that sold parents gave them life instead of a boarding them I don't know why we aren't talking about these other\nOptions that are available there's so many people that want to assign children your ...\nThirty seconds they appreciate will move on the next question goes to bed I'm very similar and thinking\nChunk [noise] we're going to turn our attention now to immigration if we can just moved here we are here in America's dairy land where Wisconsin dairy farmers rely heavily on immigrant workers many of them undocumented\nA study by Texas A M university says the loss of immigrant workers will negatively impact the state's signature industry\nThis movement and you have so little walls must be built before anything can be done about immigration\nThe state's signature industry\n... move married you have said that a wall must be built before anything can be done about immigration\nBelong could be years away what should farmers do in the meantime\nClimbed the daughter of Greek immigrants and I spent a childhood watching my aunts and uncles come to this country I help them study for their naturalization and citizenship test\nThey assimilated into this country they wanted to become Americans they was so important to them to become a mirror Americans and I feel very strongly I still feel very strongly that that border security that wall must be built and it's a first and foremost thing\nI stand with President Trump won calls for that and I've got to tell you as I travel around this great state people\nStrongly feel that way why are we letting people crossed this border participate in this American Experience\nI Believe that senator Baldwin on the other hand would prefer open borders complete open borders I don't believe it I Know it from Senator ball one's perspective her idea of all of a border with the drawing a line in the dirt with a wink and a nod she support\nAnd Thirteen gang members coming across our border she didn't even vote for ... law imagine the young beautiful woman in California she was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had seven ... seven felonies and he had been comeback\nFive times he'd been sent back to Mexico and that woman died at his hands and senator ball and voted against hates law this is wrong people want to see all the legal\nImmigration you are out of your question but I have to invoke the moderators options he took the question was typically above what you would do for Wisconsin farmers who were impacted by the law of immigrant labor you have thirty seconds to respond to that specific questions\nI strongly believe in forcing our borders and some legal immigration and I'm Sorry but it is so important it is not fair that people who have gone through a process a process\nThat is\nA process that for years people have gone through to participate in the privilege of becoming an American\nNow I think that there are a lot of things that we can do are farmers and many things that we have done here in Wisconsin to encourage people to go into the different thirties reacting but it don't important that we follow thirty seconds national model that we are\nThank you well\nWe do have a broken immigration system and we need solutions not just political issues I had the opportunity to work with a Republican and democratic colleagues in the United States Senate to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill\nIn twenty third unfortunately the house did not take it out don't win border security twenty thousand new border patrol agents it dealt with agricultural visa issues like the one I'll return to in a second that in fact affect dairy and the job with a pathway to citizenship for dreamers\nAs well as others and\nIt passed with sixty eight bipartisan vote we know we can do it but we as we politicize this issue over and over again that's unfortunate [noise]\nWe lost five hundred dairy farms last year in Wisconsin where on the pace to out number that significantly this year there's a lot of reasons but are uncertain and unstable workforce is one of them and\n... most dairy farms couldn't last a week without their workers one of the things we fix in that bill I referred to was the fact that most agricultural Lisa programs are for planting season and harvesting season but we know that dairy cows needs to be milked\nUh every day and every day of the year and so seasonal basis don't work because that's one of the things we should fix and that I fixed before but unfortunately my opponent won't even look at this 'til they build a wall\nAnd your time is up say do will move onto the next question would go to Ben\nI Want to stay on immigration let's talk specifically about the predator families\nOperational for the Washington Post reported yesterday Trump administrative students actively consider planned again separate parents for children about the border with families seeking asylum choice for women in the\nOther news actions or love children to be federal government shopping center bowling do support the glass [noise]\nI I don't and I believe that ah\nFrankly there's been a it's a myth administration's failure on this issue of time and time again like my opponent\nI mean this seems to be more attractive as a political issue that no one wants to get down and saw just like my opponent Trump won't talk about much else until he gets his wall [noise] well I truly believe that we need comprehensive immigration reform but on this issue when we were seeing\nBabies a snatched from their mothers and fathers\nIt was ... for all of us to watch but imagine how harrowing for the families involved\nYou know a few years ago during the Obama administration we had a different situation also involving children well yes I like how many children coming to our border with their parents and I asked a lot of questions than about how we handle a crisis of such as that\nHow we make sure we have a foster families or relatives that we can place with how we make sure that there's a humane conditions we don't put children and changes like this a president has done and we can't ever look at doing that again\nHis it changes on asylum are despicable we are a country that welcomes immigrants\nAnd we should always be that country and we can do much better than this\nSince ... well it's interesting to hear senator ball when talking about is how outraged she ... about children being separated and we should be it's wrong but where would that outrage senator Baldwin when the same thing was happening under the Obama administration [noise]\nI never heard from you never heard a word he never did anything but now because of this President Trump's you want to go on the attach there's nothing that President Trump will do that and you will support it's obvious that this is what this party is all about\nJust just delay distract do everything you can obstruct and your obstructing a process that will enforce our legal system you know I think it's very important that we have\nA wall that we build that wall that we do create a pathway for those who are here\nThat are about ... what you are doing though is you're willing to let people jumped the line and until we take care of our border security people will continue to take advantage of all of the things that we have in this country and you want of course\nAll of our border security people will continue to take advantage of all of the things that we have in this country and you want of course with your complete government takeover of health care\nTo then have these people will be a part of the health care system as well where are we going to find that\nThere is so much that you don't understand about this system and the fact that you are just so willing so willing to allow people to come across our border and you're out on the line of\nYou are on the ... the here we're going to move on to one last question for which you each have Ninety second\nAnd I believe that's the only two just arrived\nAt the end of the first debate see we're both three ideas to reduce gun violence in the nation\nIn the mirror you answered specially that you supported the second amendment as a means of self protection than better mental health care senator Baldwin used that above ran a crackdown on straw purchases and universal background checks [noise]\nWell it looks like they run out how to play wrote playoff game but in fact they're not going to have that yeah the rams are gonna be I Want to say there and the plane and warm California myself there but and the super bowl is in is in a dome so\nI mean yeah you're not going to have to worry about it I I don't think that's been issued now you write off it hasn't been great today but I don't think it's because of all whether as much as people want to that's the big question when he came out of the draft by what he just got sacked and that's a big sagging to make it along third down in housing white pushed not a field goal ranch\nAlso but here's the thing you don't need to have ... flinging around too much when you have a running back tonight like girlie they've handed me the football twenty six times he has over two hundred and three yards rushing and fantasy king Mad Men\nAnd it also doesn't hurt that they do have the number one rated office of wind according to pro football focus so makes it easier to run by the why wouldn't be able to block for you\nYou don't you don't need to pass the ball

because the difference is Alex Smith was in your you know fourteen or Fifteen in the league\nThe reason why this will be more impressive is because it's the homes basically of NATO or yeah of course
