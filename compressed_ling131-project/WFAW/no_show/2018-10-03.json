American Steven is our guest covers major league baseball for SB Nation you can follow Eric's work on Twitter at air Steven aren't Eric and want to start with this Yankees aids matchup out just your thoughts on the Yankees\nBaseball for SB Nation you can follow their work on Twitter at air Steven aren't Eric and want to start with the Yankees aids match up just your thoughts on the Yankees going with Louis ... you know I really thought that Jay half was going to get denied but Aaron Boone choosing Severino your thoughts on that\nYeah I was a little surprised to it it seemed like you know half was picturing well recently and you know several you know kind of struggling a little down the stretch but uh\nYou know I'm a I was honestly surprised as you are I think you know they're probably I mean Severino does have the best stuff over anyone on that staff and\nThey're probably betting on that a little more uh I Know you started last year long game and he was he was out of there ain't really became a bowl game even though they didn't plan it that way maybe they're just hoping for rain this year but I think I was I was surprised by that but it was well\nWhat kind of game do you think we're going to see like I I was talking with uh my producer earlier tonight and I was saying you know a good line in Vegas I think are a good bet in Vegas for a product that I think would be the over under on the total number of pitchers were going to see in the game then I think I Would set it at like eight and a half nine and\nA half knowing what opens doing on the other side is what would you say what would you put that number as if that were Vegas that it just it's just what are your thoughts on the amount of things were going to say\nI I wouldn't even I Would think it would be higher like that I Would say like eleven and a half or something like crazy because\nYou know the ... are going with the opener because uh you know they have a number of ... you know without ... a day and I'm a lot of their other pitchers hurt and the ones who are available or they're just in a rough spot you know or what they have a really difficult and and the people and so\nThey're going to start to utilize that so I I think they're good for like six or seven years on their own\nAnd then you put your the Yankees will be aggressive some do or die games so yeah I'm thinking at least twelve pictures are gonna see time and his game but it's going to be can be wild\nHair is even as our guest covers a major league baseball for SB Nation you can follow this work on Twitter that Eric Steven or just how surprised were you asked that all on the fact that the Oakland Athletics or participating in this year\nWill remain very surprised they were or what they were ah they were did last in payroll I'm not mistaken and uh you know didn't start out the season very well um you know like Sherman I was really good but they didn't really have a term behind him to have a pretty good friends but\nIt just wasn't working out they were under five hundred in June um and then they just kind of took off you know they have a lot of power\nAnd they have really good and some of them for a long time their pitching staff was propped up by Brad Anderson Edwin Jackson and a ... and they would just like how do you expect that you know but\nThey they've overcome so many injuries they had to really get bullpen bleak crime and they have like do you know sort of a relief season for the ages or and I mean they've just been really fun story and I mean they they wouldn't Ninety seven games I mean it's funny because there's three American League teams that won a hundred a budget or they're sitting there sort of a quiet team at Ninety seven when than a funny\nYeah if there is this such thing as a quiet and I do agree with you in definitely goes the athletic you know there there's some amazing MBP candidates in the American league this year with Jose by their marriage and and you have moved ... Martinez Matt Chapman is we're going to any one of the look at the history books of this year\nHe will not be remembered in terms of one of those three guys but just how good has he been and how important is the ...\nYeah you're very important if you look at like um\nYou know total package I'm off than in the ... I mean he's such a gift for him to put her to it's pretty ridiculous I Know when he came up a couple of years back he had some pretty ridiculous um defensive numbers and they were even like a short span and you're thinking maybe that's a flu you know it's really been great it's and it's funny because the\nBelief he went to the same high school as\nA loner NATO out here in Southern California or all high and they played together for a year I think and a man what a what a legacy for your high school to produce such awesome defensive basement and they're they're both really good and they're both in the playoffs so yeah I mean you know he's I mean Chapman\nYou'll get some down ballot support I'm sure but he's he is absolutely one of the more most valuable players like in the American league I was just a matter of you know if that many people recognize\nLet's go to the other American League matches that we know it was definitely happening that'll be the Houston Astros and the Cleveland Indians and the ... if I were to say we're located down here in Houston and I think the bullpen is still a little bit of a concern as its\nCarlos Korea and his health George Springer so it if I were to identify it never to ask you to identify the biggest concern for the Houston Astros going into this postseason what would it be\n[noise] I Would guess it it's probably both of them I mean the thing is their starters have been so good I mean just as a whole lot of course they allowed like a hundred fewer rooms in the next best team I mean\nJust old overall giving up runs is what they what they specialize in in Missouri and preventing rounds is what they specialize in doing a lot of that's from the starters a lot of it from that people tend to but um I think it's more starter Seventy so I I Would say maybe the whole thing and\nUm you know I guess if they had some you know they they deal with Korea getting hurt today was that a little bit and\nI Know they've had some guys out of their lineup so if anyone gets her that's certainly concern too but uh probably the bullpen is my biggest concern but I mean the Astros are loaded uh yeah I think they are I mean I Know the red Sox won a hundred and eight games but the answer is one hundred and three you can make an argument there\nI'm just as good if not better and they they want to last year so I'm I'm pretty high on on what their chances are started Dover\nAir Steven is our guest a major league baseball for SB Nation you can follow our work on Twitter air Steven so I made the argument I Believe it was maybe a month ago that I could identify a specific\nWeakness on pretty much every American League team\nExcept maybe the Indian maybe the idiots don't necessarily sell like aren't a plus plus in terms of any specific category but they're both pretty darn salad you bring in John Donaldson ... who's the line up and that started it she just had a ... a ton of death\nDo you think people are kind of sleeping on the Indians just because of the decision that they played in going into the playoffs\nYeah and like we were just talking about like the ... are sort of the quiet Ninety seven when the more the Indians only one Ninety One games and they only in quotes because they're still really good\nBut yeah they're they're they are a pretty loaded and just about every area they I think they are the first team ever what's for its years with two hundred strike out so they just all for those guys are really good um the money the bullpen was like a weakness in the first time from Andrew Miller was hurt a lot um Cody Allen was struggling\nUm they they went and trade it for a bread hand an Adam semper I'm from the ... and that sort of help stabilize things a little bit and uh\nIt was kind of like the national last year when they traded for um matching them and and do it all and I think branding ... they sort of stabilized the bullpen and the second half ended up winning a I think that was sort of the same thing with the Indians that short up like the main weakness they added\nIf you look at I Know what I Would say look you bet there's probably a favorite brand BP but like you know Jose Ramirez um and for instance to indoor kind of right there too\nAnd those two are as good of a duo is you're going to find I think in baseball and um there's just a really small teams intriguing thing is they just don't seem as getting hurt like the majority of the year\nBecause of a duo is you're going to find I think in baseball and um they're just a really small teams in the intriguing thing is they\nI Know John ... someone's getting hurt like the majority of the ear but um he's he's showing a little bit um ... last week or two cents he sort of come back and if he's anywhere near and he was you know a couple of years ago and if he's anywhere near a healthy man that that just adds to an even deeper lineup so yeah there are certainly um you know a team that can do some damage\nSo let me take the other side of this like I said we're located down here in Houston and I thought it was coming into the station and kind of making the case like I said when it comes to the Indian somebody brought up this debt to me which I'm sure you've read but I'll just read it again\nAgainst the American league central the Indians this year a forty nine at twenty seven and this is amazing to me they're run differential\nIs lost a hundred and sixty seven against the division and then you go against other divisions they're forty two in forty for what they want three different ... that that that was just thrown out to me whenever I tried to make an argument that the Indians could win the series what do you make of that statistic\nYeah I mean the AOL central certainly were terrible I mean uh you know I Would I thought the twins are going to be a little better they beat the playoffs last year maybe they\nAre you going to I mean we just did a whole hour baseball it's it's October third or I mean we were you know we could do you want to talk on the phone that's down ... we we do that college football I mean we're in the middle of the week you know we we can talk a little football huh oh I I kind of just want to keep talking baseball though\nLike now I'm On the dot the athletic obviously this is again where I'm just like All right I'm ready to go like seriously like if\nIt's bringing back like living in Houston ... it's bringing me back\nThis game tonight was bringing me back to that was the game six\nOr last year as throws that Thirteen twelve game against Fatah gave ... there were two big gains in the world series where it's like what's in my eyes just see I mean that's kind of what I feel oh man welcome into the U.S too good yes got to Colorado Rockies guys on a good job I'll be All

the cubs two to one Colorado and Thirteen innings moving on to play the Milwaukee Brewers in the major league baseball playoffs I got a text from my roommates Matt I messed up I talk politics\nAnd I'm going to explain this because he's been trying to get what this young lady you know and this young lady is very very strong on her opinions when it comes to a certain side of the Texas Senate race and my roommate doesn't care\nOne way or the other but that's not what you want to do when you are having a discussion with someone who does really really care one way or the other and I'm not going to talk politics on this show\nBut he just has to me I talk politics what do I do see [noise]\nWhat do I do ... she hates me she wants to kick me out\nAnd I'm just going to talk to him right now because I Know he's not listening to the show but I\nTold him Bobby I told him don't talk politics\nIf you can avoid and this is not just you know if you're trying to get with a girl this is you know if you are going to a\nFamily function and you just don't want to start an argument you just want things to go peacefully I feel like it's safe to stay in this country now in this political climate right now\nJust stay away from the topic don't talk politics and the other thing is probably she he doesn't even have an opinion on it and that was bugging her the fact that he doesn't have an opinion\nIf you know that your zip Bobby get on here with me if you know that you are seeing somebody or you you want to see somebody\nAnd she's got a very strong\nOpinion one way or the other one way to pick her off\nIt just it's just that you don't have an opinion [noise] so he's an idiot yeah pretty much because she just wants to argue that I'm now ... she's I Am at I've never met her okay but I imagine it she's that's on my way or the highway yeah and she just told him to take a hike yeah and now I'm doing a show he wants me to tell him what to do how to salvage\nI got momentum here like you can't just we can't just stop the game here but he had a one to count on contrasts right after he threw to pitch his body\nAnd I couldn't tremors ground bothered knowing or NATO at third base\nOr NATO tabs bias is coming from second or third biased is the correct smart thing hugs are now because he wants to prevent the double play there was only one out at that point a bias hugs or NATO or NATO can't get the double play the second who notes I mean I I didn't even check who knows if that that was even close to the bag\nI I definitely I Would think on that point you would have been able to get drivers running down the first space lab because he just sort of crap\nIn his lap black I I mean this thing had everything playing games in sports are awesome and I think they should have been more let me give you a perfect example college football should do is college football\nI thought I should have done this last year because we had a moment where Georgia beat Alabama Nancy title game and we all have this thought to ourselves oh is Alabama gonna make it\nAs Alabama going to make it Ohio states on the outside looking in is the committee going to allow Alabama with their one loss to get in even though they lost their conference championship game\nAnd there was controversy and I was thinking to myself the whole time why do we need this controversy why don't we just put the too darn teams on the field in a neutral site number four versus number five put them on the field\nAnd let them do get out battle it out figure it out of\nCollege football should do this and we might have a situation this year in college football we might have the exact same thing because guess what Notre Dame might go undefeated this year\nThey might I mean they have Virginia Tech on the road there number Twenty one of the country Notre Dame as Virginia Tech and and that's pretty much it I mean they shouldn't win if they are a real ... to be in the college football playoffs if you look at Notre Dame schedule man they got like Pittsburgh they got all these\nTeams that they should beat Notre Dame should run the table this year but if Clinton continues to succeed in a week ACC and Clemson wins the ACC\nTitle game they're going to be in if Ohio State continued to do what they do in the Big Ten and they run the table and they do what they're supposed to do they're going to be in\nAnd you have Ohio State and you have constant\nAlright to more spots one of them is going to be an FCC team\nAlright if things go to plan Alabama's going to play Georgia in the S. E. C. title game one of them will lose one of them will win that's the most obvious statement of the night because it's a game\nSo the winner will join Ohio State in clubs in but then you have the loser the one the last S. E. C. team and then you have undefeated Notre Dame\nWhich team would get in I asked Jerry palm who covers college football for CBS Sports I asked him would Notre Dame actually be left out in a situation like that\nBaby um yeah I it's hard for me to America and under Peter major arts major conflict the records thirty and not at a conference and football but\nYou know there that level of team it's hard for me to imagine a team of that caliber are getting you know putting up an undefeated record getting left out that I probably won't believe it until I fear of the situation you describe is probably the only choice record happen a\n... year old he wants to wanna be your playoff team probably the number one team in that case then or you know maybe that but the art of why I don't know ... undid lead an undefeated Notre Dame would be\nUm I I think it's something to swallow but the thing about Notre Dame though with their strength of schedule could be a problem\nAnd you know the Stanford Michigan is currently the only Jew right you get the whole thing is that correct but back in the polls this week or not but\nYou know their way without their starting quarterback now it you know you as the maybe they'll creeping middle ranking through you know unless you get so I have a lot of gay or sort of Stanford so you know the end of the year you know what thirty kids will be like that could have a very in that kind of stereo\nAnd it's sad that a scenario like that could not be decided by a playing game come on college football just do it I Want the Eighteen playoff but just gave me the play in game five versus for\nLook what happened tonight and major league baseball the drama that's what sports are about right that's why we all turn the TV on to watch sports entertainment\nThe drama give me a playing game college football or let me come back NFL power rankings three week for its over to\nThis is pushing the\nPanthers plus six they last like seven I mean those are the games

they had one time out there down by seven\nThey had no urgency\nNone they took their time their walk into the line of scrimmage I'm up there going guys if you need to feel fine and I would I ... if they're going to kick a field goal I was cool with that because that would have covered and I would have been on the radio today talking about the fact that the Carolina Panthers knew the voice spread

hear of the nation radio all the major media time\nFrom the O'Reilly auto parts studios here Matt Harris\nAsked the nation radio Matt Harris back with us jumped into the NFL's simply the Los Angeles chargers which ... ... for the athletic you work on winter exam for the bar exam well\nThe chargers get a victory over the San Francisco forty niners without shipping ... twenty nine twenty seven [laughter] uh this past\nWeekend first of all I just the reaction to the game this past weekend were you surprised that the game was so close to being as a Jimmy ... did not play\nYeah I think I was not stone but definitely really surprised I think\nA lot of uh chargers fans and\nThat was the chargers media I mean you know without you regret what you expect this team will come in and take care of business I get a really you know an injury shred in San Francisco team so the trouble than it's okay it it was you know\nLos Angeles couldn't get off the field on third down a there was a Twenty one plane dry for San Francisco I'm ... and it just it goes back to ... it really everything that's going back to be as simple jokes also struggling to get a pass rush and that's why we're so close but I still think it surprised plenty of people\nSo you talk about the absence of Joey boso which generally votes to end the game take us inside the defense from when he's there and when he's not just I mean we know was Chicago Chicago is just the greatest or the Oakland excuse me the Oakland Raiders of the greatest example of\nAll right well we don't have our best past Russia including Mac all of a sudden there at the bottom in terms of the league in terms of total sex\nAnd and the Chicago Bears get a guy will Mac and all of a sudden there at the very top in terms of sex so where does that mean when it comes to the chargers enjoy both a just a different than being in and him being out\nRight so obviously haven't been in this season so I Can't I Can't tell you what it looks like this here but they said well you have is about one thing you know ... who is you know pro ball past Russia um but what he's seeing now is these I mean if they're in past protection he's getting a couple of teams or at least\nYou know they'll help don't seem to tackle some help with like a guard um and it just made a really difficult for him either were shell has been Joey both\nA replacement and how it works out good rung stopper I'm really highly rated against the wrong but he really struggle to get the quarterback um to create a password to really what the chargers have done\nTo pass rush is bringing up are when James but ... years who is the absolute stone playing out of his mind I'm In the first four games here and they'll put him at strong safety put it in the box are lining up outside Rochelle\nAnd I kind of let your let them go and he's and he's in in week one he overran the quarter back I think all three or four occasions that he should be so much energy and he's so quick in the backfield\nSo that's really what their plan is without those but we're both obviously that last year to a whole bunch of different things were turned back to free safety um kinda\nNot bullets his lunch because then Joe he's giving you know give you a Russia but without him if if a severe severe difference\nYeah no doubt about it Sam ... is our gas the covers the Los Angeles chargers for the athletic you can follow stamp work on Twitter at Sam for T. R.\nDirt with Jason were you surprised that he felt the Los Angeles chargers and the trap because I'm going to tell you what he's a fantastic safety and one of the things that I think you look at what state\nIs that they can make up for different you know they can make up for the best possible lapses now that you have other you know within your deepest but when you surprised at what the charges were able to get there when James\n[noise] yeah I was very surprised that he felt the seventeenth overall I think really what the charges wanted because they struggled so badly against last year was a ... and ... and a Virginia Tech\nWas he was drafted this ... for them to buffalo uh but I mean obviously you can't complain when arguably I mean I don't get what part of my head of the top five heroin yeah I'm I feel that that ... the reason that he felt so far but I mean if you're towns Alaska you're sitting in the warmer ... you know you're Seventeen you go okay like\nThis guy who was incredible Florida State you know maybe he's in the center of the people in jail and ran the was there he's covered all [noise]\nAll right you know we got to take him and I mean really I think there when James shut a lot of people in four games but they made a mistake by passing on what\nIs just your overall perception so far on the season because the two losses that the chargers to have this year or two of the better teams in the entire league and the cheap\nAnd the Los Angeles rams and the two teams that they have been one of them as a rookie quarterback might be the worst of the class but the bills you know they haven't had the greatest you're so far obviously and then the forty niners without Jamaica ... if I were to ask you what we've learned about the chargers through four games what do you think that would be\nI think that's a really tough question because obviously you lose the truth we want and was there anything that would ... homes being you know not what he is now you use to panic a little bit and then in retrospect certainly that law doesn't look nearly as bad 'cause they're given it to everybody else yeah\nWhat we learn I think is that the chargers avoided the low start playing them the last several years including a no win for start last year that\nUm you know with that with that tie break um last year that they ended up not making\nThe playoffs but they avoided the stars so I guess what we've learned is that is that the often this year the office for the will to overcome special teams mistakes defensive inadequacy I'm even some head scratching your coaching sessions or a little bit\nIt really I guess is that the often with an author that clear with the emergence of the\nHum even some head scratching coaching sessions or a little bit it really I guess is that the often with the addition of Austin Mackler with the emergence of the healthy microwave office is capable of overcoming shortcomings in other areas that would be my main takeaway Sam\n... is our guest covers the Los Angeles charges for the athletic you could follow seems work on Twitter at Sam for TR I'm Glad you mentioned in Austin adequate because when I look at the statistics and I didn't realize this until I prepare for this interview\nCherries or the ratio of carries is leaning a little bit more towards the F word then I thought fifty four attempts Melvin Gordon in twenty eight for ... do you think that is more of a\nI guess more of a nod toward how well ... has been doing or is it just is overall mindset that look\nWe haven't started Melvin Gordon and we don't want to overwork him per se like for example it they'll just use another team as an example I'm so curious how the New Orleans saints split carries now that are in ... back and you know that you have a southern Kamara\nDo you said well why do you think that carries are split the way they are and Gordon is not getting more do you think it's just a little bit of both ... success and maybe they don't want to overwork Florida\nI think that that's a good a good idea they definitely don't want to overwork Gordon 'cause you see what happens turning back to the use of but I also think they like those two guys in different settings I was talking to Alfredo Robert\nI'm running backs so the other day and he was saying that they really like Gordon Gordon six foot one you know\nTo twenty I mean that that he is he's a low so\nYou can run in the middle of the shore yard is situations you can learn about the middle if you want to start out at Dr\nHe is really effective in the past and gave me ... seconds on the team and catches right now I ... I Believe they're stuck it last year\nSo we're at ... they really like using a color in space you know they'll they'll give pitches to um they'll run jet sweeps with them everybody knows how much you know coaches love sweets nowadays\nBut really when you see is okay a second in in a lab and our second in nine or something like that don't bring in Ecuador they'll put a lot to the side you can either use him as a weapon at the passing game or you can you know try to sneak him with a ... or a drawl or something like that\nAnd so I think that's sort of why you've seen the Kerry split the way they have\nYou mentioned that Gordon is second on the team and receptions ... started on that seems the reception is it fair a assessment for me to say look up the chargers are going to compete for a wild card this year and if they want to pretend they want to go deep in the playoffs one of these other two if not me hopefully maybe another wide receivers gonna have\nTo really emerged Mike Williams only what twelve catches ... Williams with tennis and peanut leads the team obviously was twenty four within two and three are the other two running backs so is that for the charges often to take the next step\nIs it fair to say that a second wide receivers going to have to emerge\n[noise] um\nI don't I don't think so I I Would push back a little bit they have\nReal Williams who the who they're comfortable using it drops

radio Matt\nHarris back with you let's jump into major league baseball the playoffs are in pool for America Steven as our get coverage major league baseball for SB Nation you can follow Eric work on Twitter at air Steven All right Eric I Want to start with the Yankees aids match up or just your thoughts on the Yankees going with Louis Severino I really thought that Jay half what's going to get the nod but\nAaron Boone choosing Louis separate all your thoughts on that\nYeah I was a little surprised to see my you know half was picturing well recently and you know several you know kind of struggle little down the stretch but you know I'm a I was a surprise you or I think you know they're probably I mean ... the head of the stuff over the when I met him there probably betting on that a little more\nI Know he started last year long again when he was he was a very early it came up ... ... even though they didn't plan it that way but it's open up or down this year but I think I was I was surprised by that but it was well\nWhat kind of game do you think we're going to see like I I was talking with er my producer earlier tonight and I was saying you know a good line in Vegas I think are good that in Vegas for a ... that I think would be the over under on the total number of pitchers were going to see in the game that I think I Would set it at like eight and a half\nNine and a half knowing what opens doing on the other side what would you if I were to say what would you put that in number as if that war of Vegas that it just\nIt's just what are your thoughts on the amount of Pittsburgh I say\nI wouldn't even I Would think it would be higher like that I Would say like eleven and a half or something like crazy because\nYou know they are going with the opener because uh\nYou know they have a number you know without showing my nine and a lot of the other which are hurt and the ones who are available or they're just interrupt you know but they have a really good and and the people and so they're going to ... to utilize that sorry I was there for like six or seven you're on their own\nBut many who will be aggressive can do or die game so yeah I'm thinking at least twelve pictures are gonna see time and it can be wild\nAir see that as our guest covers a major league baseball for SB Nation you can follow this work on Twitter that Eric Steven or just how surprised were you asked that all on the fact that the Oakland Athletics are participating in this ...\nOr ... I mean very surprised they were what they were they were did last in Iraq or not mistake and then you know didn't start out to see them very well um you know like German I was really good but they didn't really have a term mine and they have a pretty grim but\nIt just wasn't working out they were under five hundred in June um and then they just kind of took off you know they they have a lot of our man have really good and some of them for a long time their pitching staff was propped up by\nBrad Anderson Edwin Jackson and cover it you know and I was just like how do you expect you know they they've overcome so many injuries they have a really good open like crime and they have like do you know sort of a relief season ... is\nAnd I mean they've just been a really long story and I mean they they wouldn't Ninety seven games I mean there's plenty to there's a medically things on a hunger\nAre but they're sitting there sort of a quiet theme in Ninety seven ruling party\nYeah there if they if they are the such thing as a quiet and I just have to agree with you it definitely goes the athletic you know there there's some amazing MVP candidates in the American league this year\nWith Jose but ah I read their marriage and and you know the best and shady Martinez Matt Chapman is we're gonna when they look at the history books if this year he will not be remembered in terms of one of those three guys but just how good has he been in how important is either the eight six at\nThe very important if you look at like um you know total package I'm up in in the home\nDidn't how important is even a success\n... very important if you look at like um\nYou know total package 'em a fan's in the ... I mean he's such a gift to form their third it's pretty ridiculous I Know when he came up a couple of years back he had some pretty ridiculous um defensive numbers and they were him to like a short span and you're thinking maybe that's a flu you know\nBut he's really been great it's and it's funny because uh that believe he went to the same high school as a loner NATO out here in Southern California and all our all high\nAnd they played together for a year I think and a man what a what a legacy for your high school to produce like such an awesome defensive basement and they're\nThey're both really good and they're both in the playoffs so yeah I mean you know easy I mean Chapman you'll get some down ballot support I'm sure but he's he is absolutely one of the more most valuable players like in the American league I was just a matter of you know if that many people recognize it\nLet's go to the other American League matchup that we know is definitely happening that'll be the Houston Astros in the Cleveland Indians and the ... if I were to say I were located down here in Houston and I think the bullpen is still a little bit of a concern as its Carlos Korea and his health George Springer\nThough it if I were to identify it don't want to ask you to identify the biggest concern for the Houston Astros going into this postseason what would it be\n[noise] I Would guess it it's probably both plan I mean the thing is their starters have been so good I mean just as an oil unquote they allowed like a hundred fewer rooms in the next best team I mean\nJust old overall giving up runs is what they what they specialize in in terms of preventing round is what they specialize in doing a lot of that's from the starters a lot of it from the people into but um I think it's more starters heavy so I I Would say maybe the whole thing and um you know I guess\nIf they had some you know they they deal with Korea getting hurt today was that a little bit and\nI Know they've had some guys out of their lineup so if anyone gets hurt that's certainly concern too but ah probably the bolt and his wife biggest concern but I mean the actors are loaded uh yeah I think they're I mean I Know the red Sox won a hundred and eight games but that that was there was one hundred and three you can make an argument there\nI'm just as good if not better and they they want it last year so I'm I'm pretty high on on what their chances are stark Dover\nAir Steven is our guest a major league baseball for SB Nation you can follow our work on Twitter Eric Steven so\nI made the argument I Believe it was maybe a month ago that I could identify a specific weakness on pretty much every American League team except maybe the Indian mainly the Indians don't necessarily sell like aren't a plus plus in terms of any specific category but\nThey're both pretty darn salad you bring in Josh Donaldson that boost to line up and that starting pitcher you just had a ... a ton of death do you think people are kind of sleeping on the Indians just because of the division that they played in going into the playoffs\nYeah and like we were just talking about that like the eighties or sort of the quiet Ninety seven when the more the Indians only one Ninety One gains and they only in quotes because they're still really good\nBut yeah they're they're they are a pretty loaded and just about every area they I think the other the first team ever with for years with two hundred strike out so they just all for those guys are really good um the it's funny the bullpen was like a weakness in the first time from Andrew Miller was hurt a lot um Cody Allen was struggling\nUm they they went in trade it for a bread hand that Adam Silver or from the Padres of that sort of help stabilize things a little bit and uh it\nWas kind of like the national last year when they traded for um Madison and him do it all and I think branding cans or any space or to stabilize the bullpen and the second half ended up winning a I think that was sort of the same thing with the Indians that short of the main weakness they added\nIf you look at I Know what I Would say look you bet that's probably the favorite brand BP but like you know Jose Ramirez hum and\nClinton school indoor kind of right there too and those two are as good of a duo you're going to find that thing in baseball and um they're just a really small teams in the intriguing thing is they\nCan do is you know someone's gonna hurt like the majority of the ear but um he's he's showing a little bit um ... last week or two since he's sort of come back and if he's anywhere near and he was you know a couple of years ago and if he's anywhere near healthy man that that just adds to even deeper lineup so yeah there are certainly um you know a team that can be some damage\nTo let me take the other side of this like I said we're located down here in Houston and I thought it was coming into the station and kind of making the case like I said when it comes to the Indian or somebody brought up this to me which I'm sure you've read but I'll just read it again\nAgainst the American league central the Indians this year a forty nine and twenty seven and this is amazing to me they're run differential\nIs lost a hundred and sixty seven against the division and then you go against other to visit their forty two in forty for what they plus three different as well so that's that that was just thrown out to me whenever I tried to make an argument that the Indians when the series what do you make of that statistic\nYeah I mean the central certainly were terrible I mean uh you know I Would I thought the twins were going to be a little better they made the playoffs last year maybe they weren't going to be that good but they were just pretty bad and then the other three teams in the division are are bad and so I'm an Indian certainly be something that so\nThose you know that those games but that that team to play a big series but the Oakland Athletics in the playoffs I'm you want to get a production\nYeah I don't I don't see a Thirteen and a game I say in in in nine\nI have to go to Yankees huh you know we'd go the good nice bullpen\nUm ... yeah I mean Robison and then\n... I mean a lot of ... and ... Chapman if a guy he's with the Yankees are ... yeah I mean I liked the bulls play I like the six seven eight guys that gets written that Britain they left a sneaky guy sneaker by ... good ... good I'm just\nSo worried about starting pitching I've just said you know what I'm honestly worried about like I'm worried about the starting pitchers in the long run in terms of tonight's game I most worried about\nBone not fooling Severino fast enough and of course I'm worried about Severino deliver quality ... so we shall see butts robot over that I [noise]\n[noise]\nI'm forty WMA doll you warn Afghans and online at nine forty WMA W. dot com\n[noise]\nABC News\nI'm Richard camps who don't be surprised later today when your\nWireless device sounds an alarm lapping up to Eighteen pm eastern time less than twelve hours from now\nThis afternoon you'll get a message on your phone that reads presidential alert this is a test of the national wireless emergency alert system no action is needed it's part of FEMA's first nationwide testable wireless emergency alert system mental let people know about things like nuclear attacks or widespread terror attacks\nFEMA estimates it will reach about Seventy five percent of mobile devices ...

Twitter at air Steven aren't Eric I Want to start with this Yankees aids match up just your thoughts on the Yankees going with Louis Severino I really thought that Jay half was going to get to not but uh Aaron Boone choosing Luis ever into your thoughts on that [noise]\nYeah I was a little surprised to hear it seemed like you know how was that during well Rick ... in San Marino kind of struggled down the stretch but\nYou know I was a surprise if you were I think you know there are probably I mean to Reno does have the best stuff over anyone on that\nThey're probably betting on that a little more and then we started last year olds are game when he was he was really capable and even though they didn't plan it that way but it's open up or down this year but I think it was I was surprised whatever it was all\nWhat kind of game do you think we're going to see like I I I was talking with a producer earlier tonight and I was saying you know a good line in Vegas I think are a good bet in Vegas for a profit I think would be the over under on the total number of pitchers were going to see in the game that I think I Would set it at like eight and a half\nNine and a half knowing what opens doing on the other side what would you if I were to say what would you put that in number as if that were of Vegas bet and just\nIt's just what are your thoughts on the amount of pets were going to say\nI wouldn't even I Would think it would be higher like that I Would say like eleven and a half or something like crazy is\nYou know they are going on because you know the number ... year without some and I have a lot of their other pitchers hurt and the ones who are available or they're just going you know but they have a really good book and then the people and so\nThey're going to start to utilize that I go there for like six or seven you're on their own I mean you're the one who will be aggressive some guy games so yeah I'm thinking at least talk 'cause you're gonna see time and it can be while\nAir Steven as our guest covers a major league baseball for SB Nation you can follow his work on Twitter that Eric Steven or just how surprised were you is that all on the fact that the Oakland Athletics are participating\nBaseball for SB Nation you can follow this work on Twitter that Eric Steven or just how surprised were you asked that all on the fact that the Oakland Athletics or participating in this\nWhole you know I mean very surprised they were or what they were ah they were did last in payroll or not mistake and then you know didn't start out with the season very well um you know like Sherman I was really good but they didn't really have a term behind them to have a pretty good friends but\nIt just wasn't working out they were under five hundred in June um and then they just kind of took off you know they have a lot of our man have really good deep and some of them\nFor a long time their pitching staff was propped up by\nBrad Anderson Edwin Jackson and a ... and they would just like how do you expect that you know you can but they they've overcome so many injuries\nThey had a really good bullpen bleak crime and his have like do you know sort of a relief season ... is a and I mean they've just been really fun story and I mean they wouldn't Ninety seven games I mean it's funny because there's three American League teams that on a hundred a budget or they're sitting there sort of a quiet team at Ninety seven when it's kind of funny\nYeah if they're if they if there is this such thing as a quiet night is kind of agree with you I definitely goes the athletic you know there's some amazing MVP candidates in the American league this year\nWith Jose by I read the marriage and and you move the best and shady Martinez match happening is we're going to end when they look at the history books of this year he will not be remembered in terms of one of those three guys but just how good has he been in how important is the end of the success\nOf the very important if you look at like um\nYou know total package I'm off than in the ... I mean he's such a ... on the third it's pretty ridiculous I Know when he came up a couple of years back you had some pretty ridiculous um defensive numbers and they were in like a short span and you're thinking maybe that's a flu you know\nReally been great to and it's funny because of the day believe you went to the\nSame high school as a role in our NATO out here in Southern California where I stand [laughter] they played together for a year I think getting the man what a what a legacy for your high school to produce such awesome defensive basement and they're\nThey're both really good and they're both in the playoffs so yeah I mean you know he's I mean Chapman you'll get some down ballot support I'm sure but he's he is absolutely one of the more most valuable players like in the American league I was just a matter of you know if that many people recognize that\nSort of the other American League matches that we know is definitely happening that'll be the Houston Astros and the Cleveland Indians and the ... if I were to say I were located down here in Houston and I think the bullpen is still a little bit of a concern as its Carlos Korea and his health George Springer\nSo it if I were to identify that were to ask you to identify the biggest concern for the Houston Astros going into this postseason what would it be\n[noise] I Would guess it it's probably both plan I mean the thing is their starters have been so good I mean just as a whole like when when they look like a hundred fewer runs in the next best team I mean\nJust old overall giving up runs is what they what they specialize in in terms of preventing rounds is what they specialize in doing a lot of that's from the starters a lot of it from the deep open too but um I think it's more starters heavy so I I Would say maybe the whole thing and\nUm you know I guess if they had some you know they they deal with Korea getting hurt today was that a little bit and I know they've had some guys out of their lineup so if anyone get started that certainly concern too but ah probably the bullpen is my biggest concern but I mean the actors are loaded uh yeah I think they are I mean I Know the red Sox won a hundred and eight games but the\n... on a hundred and three you can make an argument there\nI'm just as good if not better and they they won it last year so I'm I'm pretty high on on what their chances are starting to over\n... even as our gas to cover his major league baseball for SB Nation you can follow our work on Twitter Eric Steven so\nI made the argument I Believe it was maybe a month ago that I could identify a specific weakness on pretty much every American League team except maybe the Indian maybe the Indians don't necessarily sell like aren't a plus plus in terms of any specific category but\nThey're both pretty darn salad you bring in Josh Donaldson that boost to line up\nAnd that started did she just had a ... a ton of death do you think people are kind of sleeping on the Indians just because of the decision that they played in going into these playoffs\nYeah and like we were just talking about like the ... are sort of the quiet Ninety seven when the more the Indians only one Ninety One game and they only in quotes because they're still really good yeah they're they're they are a pretty loaded and just about every area they\nI think they are they're the first team ever words for its years with two hundred strike out a survey to stall for those guys are really good um the it's funny the bullpen was like a weakness in the first time for Andrew Miller was hurt a lot um Cody Allen was struggling\nUm they they wouldn't trade it for a bread hand an Adam semper I'm from\nThe Padres of that sort of help stabilize things a little bit and it was kind of like the national last year when they traded for um Madsen and him do it all and I think branding ... sort of stabilized the bullpen and the second half ended up winning a I think that was sort of the same thing with the Indians that shorter click the main week since they had and\nIf you look at I Know what I Would say look you bet there's probably the favorite brand BP but like you know Jose Ramirez um and when it's just all indoor kind of right there too\nAnd those two are as good of a ... you're going to find I think in baseball and um there's just a really so it seemed intriguing thing is they\nJust know someone's getting hurt like the majority of the year but um he's he's shown a little bit um class a week or two cents to sort of come back and if he's anywhere near and he was you know a couple of years ago and it is anywhere near healthy\nMan that that just adds to even deeper lineup so yeah there are certainly um you know as a team that can be some damage\nThe only thing the other side of this like I said we're located down here in Houston and I thought it was coming to the station and kind of making the case like I said when it comes to the Indian or somebody brought up this statute to me which I'm sure you've read but I'll just read it again and\nAgain the American league central the Indians this year a forty nine and twenty seven and this is amazing to me they're run differential\nIs lost a hundred and sixty seven against the division and then you go against other divisions they're forty to forty for what they want three different that's that that that was just thrown out to me whenever I tried to make an argument that the Indians could win the series what do you make of that statistic [laughter]\nYeah I mean the central certainly was terrible I mean\nI I mean it's one thing to be a fan I imagine if you were a fan and you had to get at the side that could have a dog in the fight [noise]\nAre you going to I mean we just at all our baseball it it's October third oh I mean we were you know we could do you want to talk on a film after we we do that college football I mean we're in the middle of the week you know we we can talk a little football huh oh I ... I kind of just want to keep talking baseball\nLike melanoma duck the athletic obviously this is a game around it's like All right I'm ready to go like seriously like if\nIt's bringing back like living in Houston ... it's bringing me back like this game tonight was bringing me back to that was a game six\nBought last year as throws that Thirteen twelve game against those ads are ... there were two big gains in the world series where it's like what's in my eyes just see I mean that's kind of what I feel [noise]\nOh man welcome into that too good yes got to Colorado Rockies guys aren't as good

[noise] if you're just joining the show Rockies beat the cubs two to one [noise] Colorado and Thirteen innings moving on to play the Milwaukee Brewers in the major league baseball playoffs I got a

she wants to kick me out I and I'm just going to talk to him right now but like I Know he's not listening to the show but I\nTold him Bobby I told him don't talk politics\nIf you if you can avoid and this is not just you know if you're trying to get with a girl this is you know if you are going to a family\nFunction and you just don't want to start an argument you just want things to go peacefully I feel like it's safe to say in this country now in this political climate right now just stay away from the top it don't talk politics and the the thing is probably she he doesn't even have an opinion on it\nAnd that's what's bugging her the fact that he doesn't have an opinion\nIf you know that your body can't get on here with me if you know that you are seeing somebody or you'll you want to see somebody\nAnd she's got a very strong\nOpinion one way or the other one way to pick her off\nIt's a it's just that you don't have an opinion [noise] so he's an idiot yeah pretty much does she

was only one out at that point the bias hugs or NATO or NATO can't get the double play the second who notes I mean I I didn't even check who knows if that was even close to the bag\nI I definitely I Would think on that point you would have been able to get control of his running down to first base line because you just sort of crap in his lap black\nI I mean this thing had everything playing games in sports are awesome and I think they should happen more let me give you a perfect example college football should do is college football\nI thought should have done this last year because we had a moment where Georgia beat Alabama the SEC title game and we all had this thought to ourselves all is Alabama gonna make it\nAs Alabama going to make it Ohio states on the outside looking in is the committee going to allow Alabama with their one last to get in even though they lost their conference championship game\nAnd there was controversy and I was thinking to myself the whole time why do we need this controversy why don't we just put the too darn teams on the field in a neutral site number four versus number five put 'em on steel\nAnd let them do get out battle it out figure it out of\nCollege football should do this and we might have a situation this year in college football we might have the exact same thing because what Notre Dame might go undefeated this year\nThey might I mean they have Virginia Tech on the road there number twenty four in the country Notre Dame as Virginia Tech\nAnd and that's pretty much it I mean they should win if they are a real contender to being a college football playoff if you look at Notre Dame schedule man they got like Pittsburgh they got all these teams that they should beat Notre Dame should run the table this year but if Clinton\nContinues to succeed in a week ACC and Clemson wins the ACC\nTitle game they're going to be in if Ohio State continues to do what they do when the Big Ten and they run the table and they do what they're supposed to do they're going to be in and you have Ohio State and you have ...\nAll right to more spots one of them is going to be an FCC team\nRight if things go to plant Alabama is going to play Georgia in the ... the title game one of them will lose one of them will win that's the most obvious statement of the night because it's a game so the winner will join Ohio State and Clemson but then you have the loser the one the last\n... east the team\nAnd then you have undefeated Notre Dame which team would get in I asked Jerry Parr who covers college football for CBS Sports I\nAsked it wouldn't Notre Dame actually be left out in a situation like that\nBaby um yeah I it's hard for me to imagine an undefeated major arts major conference the records thirty noted accomplishment football but\nThere are there that level of team it's hard for me to imagine a team of that caliber are getting you know putting up an undefeated record getting left out that probably won't believe it until I fear the situation you describe is probably the only choice what happened or\nWere you know you're only lost or to wanna be your playoff team probably the number one team in that case\nThen or you know maybe that but I Know why I don't know ... thunder lead an undefeated Notre Dame would be um I I think it's something to follow the thing about Notre Dame though there during the schedule could be a problem\nAnd you know the Stanford Michigan currently the only Jew raking ... back in the polls this week or not but\nYou know their way without their starting quarterback now it you know us the maybe they'll creeping breaking through the Amish kids still have a lot of gay students pampered though you know the end of the year you know what thirty kids will be like that I have a bearing in that kind of stereo\nAnd it's sad that a scenario like that could not be decided by a playing games come on college football just do it\nI Want the Eighteen playoff but just gave me the playing game five versus for look what happened tonight and major league baseball the drama that is what sports are about right that's why we all turn the TV on to watch sports for entertainment\nThe drama give me a playing game college football I let me come back NFL power rankings three week for its over to\nThis is pushing the\nPanthers plus six they last like seven I mean those are the games that could give them and to the you know where but I mean that's a team of the Panthers I thought that was when I came out right and they had some opportunities to store and back and leave a leak drive I don't know why in the world Cam Newton was doing in the last two minutes and ...\nThey had one time out there down by seven\nThey had no urgency none they took their time there were walking to the line of scrimmage I'm after going guy even in the fields all fine\nAnd I would I if they're going to kick a field goal I was cool with that but just not what a covered and I would have been on the radio today talking about the fact that the Carolina Panthers knew the voice read because they were waiting for a field goal and there was no forty thinking if he'll go down by seven but it did it anyway that didn't happen but they had no urgency\nSoon is pushing the U.S Monday through friday for new to the eastern ... radio\nHas seen nation radio\nThen Henry boys or a a

chargers get a victory over the San Francisco forty niners without shipping ... twenty nine twenty seven [laughter] ah this past weekend first of all I just your reaction to this game this past\nWeekend were you surprised at the game was so close seeing as a Jimmy ... did not play\nYeah I think I was not stone but definitely really\nSurprised I think a like a lot of uh chargers fans and and definitely the chargers media I mean you know without jury ... do you expect this team will come in and take care of business again really you know an injury shredded San Francisco team so the trouble that it's okay and it was you know\nLos Angeles couldn't get off the field on third down a there was a Twenty one plane dry for San Francisco um and and it just it goes back to ... it really everything the few that have gone back to the as people joke though so struggling to get a pass rush and that's why it was so close but I still think it is surprise plenty of people\nSo you talk about the absence of Chile which only both in the game take us inside the deep sense from when he's there and when he's not just you know with Chicago Chicago is just the greatest or the Oakland excuse me the Oakland Raiders of the greatest example of\nAll right well we don't have our best pass Russia include Mac all of a sudden there at the bottom and in terms of the league in terms of total sex\nAnd and the Chicago Bears ... Mac and all of a sudden there's the very top in terms of sex so where does that mean when it comes to the chargers enjoy both just a different than being in and him being out\nRight so obviously hasn't been in this season so I Can't I Can't tell you what it looks like here but basically what you have is you have on one side you know ... who is you know pro ball past Russia um what what he's seeing now is the I mean if they're in past protection he's getting double teams or at least\nYou know they'll help don't seem to tackle some help with like a guard\nUm and it just made it really difficult for him Isaac Rochelle has been Joey both to\nA replacement and\nHow it works out good run stop or I'm really highly rated against the run but he really struggle to get the quarterback\nUm to create a password to really want the chargers have done to pass rush is bringing up there when James ... who was absolutely stunned clean out of his mind I'm In the first four games here and they'll put him in strong safety put the box are lining up outside Rochelle\nAnd I kind of let your let them go and he's in he's in week one he overran the quarter back I think three or four occasions that keeps you\nSee it so much energy and he's so quick into the backfield so that's really what their plan is without those but we've both obviously that laws you to do a whole bunch of different things were turned back to free safety on cutting\nNot bullets as much because then Joe he's giving you know getting your Russia he has put without him if if a severe severe different\nYeah no doubt about it Sam ... is our gas the covers the Los Angeles chargers for the athletic you could follow Sam's work on Twitter at ... for T. R.\nDirt with Jason were you surprised that he felt the Los Angeles chargers and the draft because I'm going to tell you what he's a fantastic Stacy and not one of the things that I think you look at with safety\nIs that they can make up for different you know they can make up for the ... possible lapses or that you have other you know within your defense but were you surprised at what the charges were able to get there with James\n[noise] yeah I was very surprised that he felt the seventeenth overall I think really what the charges wanted because they struggle so badly against over last year what was going to suffer from eight and a Virginia Tech\nWas he was drafted this fall for them to buffalo\nI'm but I mean obviously you can't complain when the arguably I mean how long can we talk to my head of the top five heroin yeah um I Can't identify the reason that he felt so far but I mean if you're talking to let's go and you're sitting in the war room and you know you're a Seventeen year old ... like this who\nWas incredible Florida State you know maybe even the center of the people in jail in Ramsey was there he's of animal [noise]\nAll right you know we got to take him and I mean really I think there would change that showed a lot of people in in four games that they made a mistake by passing on what\nIs just your overall perception so far on the season because the two losses that the chargers have this year or two of the better teams in the entire league and the cheese and the Los Angeles rams\nAnd the two teams that they have been one of them as they their rookie quarterback might be the worst of the class but the bills you know they haven't had the greatest you're so far obviously and then the forty niners without\nJimmy ... if I were to ask you what we've learned about the chargers root for games what do you think that would be\nI think that's a really tough question because obviously you lose that she's we want and was there in the same thing with ... homes being you know not what he is now used to panic a little bit and then in retrospect certainly that law does it look nearly as bad 'cause they're given it to everybody else yeah\nWhat we've learned I think is that the chargers avoided that started to play in the last several years including a no win for start last year that\nUm you know with that with that tie break um last year that they ended up not making the playoffs but they avoided the stars so I guess what we've learned is that is that the often this year the office for the will to overcome special teams mistakes defensive inadequacy I'm\nEven some head scratching your coaching sessions or a little bit\nIt really I guess is that the often with the addition of Austin that clear with the emergence of a healthy microwave office is capable of overcoming shortcomings in other areas that would be my main ...\nIs our guest covers the Los Angeles charges for the athletic you could follow Sam's work on Twitter at Sam's for T. R. I'm Glad you mentioned Austin ... because when I look at the statistics and I didn't realize this until I prepared for this interview\n'cause it carries the or the ratio of carries is leading a little bit more towards the actor then I thought fifty four attempts Melvin Gordon and twenty eight for ... do you think that is more of a\nI guess more of a nod toward how well ... has been doing or is it just is overall mindset that look we haven't started Melvin Gordon and we don't want to overwork him per se like for example it they'll just use another team as an example I'm so curious how the New Orleans saints split carries now that are increments back and you know that you have a son and\nKamara do you say how why do you think that carries are split the way they are and Gordon is not getting more do you think it's just a little bit of both ... success and maybe they don't want to overwork order\nI think that that's a good a good idea they definitely don't want to overwork Gordon 'cause you see what happens turning back to where you can use them but I also think they like those two guys in different settings I was talking to Alfredo Robert I'm running backs so the other day\nHe was saying that they really like Gordon Gordon six foot one you know to twenty I mean that that he is he's a low so you can run in the middle of a short yards situations you can learn about the middle if you want to start out of Dr he is really effective in the past and gave his second on the team and catches right now on I ... I Believe finished second last year\nSo likely to get at ... they really like using heckler in space you know they'll they'll give pitches to them they'll run jet stream them everywhere he noticed how much you know coaches love sweets nowadays\nBut really what you see is okay a second in in a lab and our second in mind or something like that don't bring in ...\nThis is really what you see is okay a second in in a lab and all of a second in mind or something like that don't bring in Ecuador they'll put about suicide you can either use him as a weapon of the passing game or you can you know try to sneak in with a raw and or draw or something like that\nUm until I think that's sort of why you've seen the carries the way that\nYou mentioned that Gordon is second on the team and receptions ... third on the seems the reception is it fair or assessment for me to say look if the chargers are going to compete for a wild card this year and if they want to they want to go deep in the playoffs one of these other to stop me hopefully maybe another wide receivers gonna have\nTo really emerged Mike Williams only what twelve catches ... Williams with ten\nAnd Keenan leads the team obviously was twenty two and three are the other two running backs so is that for the charges often to take the next step\nIs it fair me to say that second wide receivers going to have to emerge\n[laughter] oh I don't I don't think so I I Would push back a little bit they have\n\nBus face it this is a hectic time of year but here's the deal is not an excuse to lose track of your spending especially when we made it so incredibly easy for you with our free budgeting tool called every dollar\nWith every dollar you give every dollar a name at the beginning of the month and then you track the expenses against your budget throughout the month it's really that easy in fact you couldn't do it straight from your smartphone in between running your kids for music lessons to soccer practice\nAnd the best part is by using every dollar you know exactly how much money you can spend on school was closed and pumpkins ...\nCreate your first budget today in less than ten minutes\nJust to answer a few easy questions about your money goes income and expenses and every dollar will do the rash folks that I mentioned it's free you started to Jay Li every dollar EPA's available for your iPhone and Android in the app store Google Play store or budget on your own desktop at every dollar dot com it's free\nTime mourning WMA W worn out\nOnline at nine forty WMA dot com [noise]\n[noise]\nI'm Scott overgrown Republican and democratic lawmakers are criticizing President Trump after he marched Christine Blasey Ford's testimony at a rally last night\nI Am well do you think it was it was one of them I'll do it how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember\nBoard is accusing the president's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault more from ABC Stephanie Ramos\nSenate minority leader Chuck Schumer sets for years women have been afraid to come forward about being sexually assaulted out of fear of being ridiculed\nThe president of the United states the most powerful man there is a confirmed those fears for millions of women and the most despicable way possible Republican\nSenator Susan Collins of Maine also criticized President Trump's comments\nOr comments tore Chad Farley and hair on\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway says the president was just pointing out the actual inconsistencies when speaking about Brett Kavanaugh's accuser\nThe FBI could wrap up its investigation into Kavanaugh as early as today the president's attorney ...
