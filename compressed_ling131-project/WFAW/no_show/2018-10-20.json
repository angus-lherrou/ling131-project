I was talking to a reporter from the crush the other day\nAnd um basically anyone in my opinion on overall how they they have a tablet themselves and you know how they're doing and I told him basically asked me a year from now\nIt's too soon to tell we just came out of a a a great summer but we had a wet rainy summer we had a lot of things going on and\nIt it is too soon to tell you you need at least a year over year to start to look a an established see see what they've done she won't work see what the more it it's all going to be about that that marketing\nA philosophy and um you can't rush to judgment too quickly went on a loop property comes to\nTime to to Atlantic City or I should that be for as well that\nWhen a rebel was originally being built [noise] everything I've read and impress was you know the savior to Atlantic City a and it went on and on and on it and and that was never true that was nice tagline English catchphrase and and the hard rock shutters cater to Atlantic City either it's a great push\nBut it's a collective group experience it's going to take everybody to pull this off the casinos restaurants the she already a state\nUh we we can go on and on a look at what it laying next city has had in terms of the complexity\nOver the past few years well you know they had a\n... look on their lives are let me ask you something about that a marketing philosophy I Know the hard rock came out and they were stressing the entertainment aspects of the property like you alluded to do you think other properties will follow their lead in Atlantic City and say you know what we're just not all gambling we have this other stuff for you guys\nAbsolutely you know today it is about the integrated a environment of the resort and it may not be always that gambling dollar and it isn't any more if you look at Las Vegas uh last time I looked at was so Seventy percent lung gaming\nAnd balance Spain gaming products so it's very important people will go see a show they will go out to dinner they will go see in a van and uh they may not spend a dollar in casino but\nOf not only do you go easy on me get a leg Rudy back to the moment starts working in one

[noise]\n[noise]\n... with a year for those if you're just joining us I'm Talking with Robert Ambrose a former casino executive Weiner because she knew comes on\nAnd adjunct professor in casino manager that fairly Dickinson university I was wondering what would be needed for a place like Atlantic City to get involved I mean it is is it the betting aspect of it if they can bet on it will they readily accepted or\nAre there issues with space and you put him on the gaming floor ... wood is preventing a Atlantic City some really jumping into the sports\nI think it's been the environment the environmental climate there the past few years you know like it when I were discussing up until this past year I'm there hasn't been much excitement in Atlantic City you know to say the least\nBut I think now that as the the the blood it's flowing again I think you will see more activity in this arena is\nUm plans in the works a wish on property is I'm not at liberty to mention them but\nThey are looking at space\nAnd that has been a consideration obviously they want to make sure that they get a return on investment per square foot sure sure and it's definitely going to happen you you were looking at that sports betting angle\nWhich is definitely a profit center for the show and not only that but also the identification of it that a noble say such and such resort now has the arena host um major league gaming events\nWhich ah is worldwide when these events uh our our broadcast or their international and they occur\nEvery quarter a shame that it was just one in San Diego there was one in Las Vegas around the beginning of the summer may draw hundreds of thousands of people\nBoth in person and and and an on line so there is money to be made but it has to be made correctly and it has to be a model correctly or I mentioned universities I Know of to universities right now\nThat are involved in dedicating space to create a gaming lab\nAnd a curriculum shut and probably I Know one in particular is looking at it in terms of having\nTournaments on campus which obviously would raise the bar sure and and and and they would be able to market to prospective student's mature or it's just it's all changing it's very exciting [noise] uh I feel like I'm a little ahead of the curve in the sense that uh\nI I you know I'm not a well let's just say I'm older than fifty [noise] and ah I've been involved in this sport since the beginning\nAnd it's because I'm a mini tournaments that used to be run in my basement but that my son and his friends were to happen so I've become familiar with it and I always felt that that there was opportunity\nTo do this right here in several articles on it as well [noise] ah it's a very interesting model and it's got a lot of a lot of growing for sure\nBut one of the things that New Jersey has really jumped on was the online gambling about couple of years ago you in your opinion how much is online gambling help the casino business in New Jersey\n[noise] Oh absolutely it it has helped and you know it's funny when they when they discussed it\nA a ... it was um um um theory was that it was going to destroy the brick and mortar missed us and it has complimented it\nSo it it it it it wasn't just the opposite of of of what they felt was going to happen I mean you're over a year it has produced a great in income in again in Jersey goes ahead of the curve in that respect so a ... it's been a very very positive\nExperience um and now you're seeing other states that are getting on board ... has been very very slow in the process um they haven't been known to move to\nQuickly but I'm very\nWell and also in in defense of some of these properties the costs an arm and a leg to get these or licensing fees\nOh absolutely the reason is ridiculous and I mean we're looking at tax rates are well just for sports betting on come on ten million dollars an hour later yeah yes and the tax rate of thirty six percent crazy how can how\nCan a property expand a I mean how can you expand properly if if all of these things are going on it's just it just it tracks from grows and that's one thing about Atlantic City in terms of the gaming uh it's still single digit\nA and in terms of tax rate and that is wonderful and should have been\nA while actually was held during the darker days but uh it's it's just sad you know when you look at the model of ... of gaming and the few short years\nA water contributor it has been in New Jersey a year over year it's sixteen points about ... percent\n[noise] I mean that that is amazing and you know the the digital fans that goes around the state and all that that's the models are there and I can do is see and it is happening where you have partnerships between stages more states come on line\nThe models are they are and I can do is see and it is happening where you have partnerships between stages more states come on line or you'll see partnerships where they can share the experience similar to what you know sports betting is is obviously\nGoing to be doing more states become active with it\nBut it's a you know your higher higher tax rates in a I have a lot of respect for Pennsylvania I think they have a great a brick and mortar model\nPennsylvania is a huge state and they have positioned their casino operations strategically and I think that's wonderful rather than having them all in one area um that's a plus\nUm they have a way to go with things but I think on that side of the the ... ah I think it's ... it's very important that they've done that\nNow we have to see how quickly the gaming comes up and the sports betting I think it's going to drag a little bit\nWell I Want to ask you brought up the sharing of players between states I Know last summer the W. S. O. P. dot com and eating ... the the the players pull between Nevada and New Jersey but only those sites\nIs that good with the market because you know there's a lot of sites that can't be involved in that players pool I'm Wondering if I knew sharing players is a great thing but do you think that will ruin the market when you leave that many other sites out\n[noise] that's a good question and again I think we're at a point where it's still in its infancy and uh I think it has potential\nUh as as more a sites can or or willingly become involved it it's going to be very difficult if you start to sing markets out\nWhich was a bad situation pretty much is doing um it obviously worked for them but collectively I think everyone needs to participate so in a sense it it it it could work into the negatives in that respect [noise]\nYou know but one thing that was interesting to me is that the model that New Jersey is following I mean they have on line slots or my dad loves to play the online roulette or the other games\nBut Nevada in Delaware are limiting I gave me just smoke or is there a reason why they're not jumping into the online slots on line casino games and just sticking with poker\n[noise] well I think a lot of it is regulatory issue and [noise]\nUm pay may be waiting to see how this pans out I Know you have some changes going on in a Delaware soon with ownership and I'm I'm some other regulatory factors ah I think it's a wait and see I'm a [noise]\nI Know if I had a property in another state and and this is still relatively new I mean you know as folks that have been looking at this for a while but it seems like old news but when you look at the uh restrictions\nWell sounds good well if there's anything about the casino business you need to know you look up Robert Ambrose to because nobody else you've seen it all and done at all in the game like where he's a writer you absolutely pay tax opera coming on the rubber Ambrose so much\nIt's a pleasure during this next week we're more al ...

I wasn't going to use that word but yeah I've noticed\nIs jealous of Bradley Cooper I was gonna say I see yeah I'm going to grow my hair out all kinds of compliments I'm growing my are like that it looks exactly the same except for not in more like Will Ferrell when it when I got out\nWill a good look it's or it's ... ... it's it's a look but you're here on\nThe reactor our as holy man crash

that ...\nThat gives us the baseball talk I a lot just try to cheer you up before I think it's hilarious you know I just want a curio because I Know you're sad about the Astros man I Am I had a band interfere and did it doesn't really matter the grand scheme of things I think I'm a\nI think the fairest way to look at it in real time it was probably the wrong call but you know can overturn it based on what you saw on replay yeah so\nYeah I think you could it does look like the fans and closes the glove\nBefore he got there and that's the big disagreement that's the big you though that you don't think so but that doesn't matter right it was it or not if if the fan was over the line who think as long as they're behind the one they can do to the ... biggest\nWalk right so that's a big believer in a ... that's the big\n... well that's the big question the question is you know whether or not the player went over the line and the manager of the red Sox a court said um he saw the replay and he said he didn't so I mean\nI mean it's okay so it looked like Boston just had our number in the series they like the better team\nYeah one hundred percent there there are bats look like what the Astros looked last these yeah and so they just the better team and so I don't think the fan interference would have changed a series that much I Know a lot of people feel like it would have but every time you saw an ad about though you never know I don't know when they gave\nUs the way the way prices played you know and the final game he didn't look like he was nervous\nAt all yeah at

we'll switch over to college football in a very special guests who joined us last week joined us again\nJoel ISI go for the two he's on the O'Reilly hotline welcome to the programs or how you doing\nA neck we'll talk with college football what a great week ... number ... we ... can't wait a and we'll see exactly what transpires were some of these great games is weaker\nAll right before we get into any previews let's talk about that tendency upset what happened there\n[laughter] well I think terrorists and you know coming out of it by week I mean there was a big victory for trying to see in a new coach Jeremy I'm dark you know all very much\nI I Want to say inconsistent things are often they failed to run the football game that match up against him at the last the turnover battle and Tennessee we're able to score offer or a turtle resent again go smiles on in my opinion is all in the face Ole Miss this coming weekend on the road\nAnother game it's not going to be easy should offer dropped out and there's a possibility of mind paying that ... not even make it to the younger here for her\nI mean that buyout that buyout alone the forty two million is that right was forty two forty seven I ...\nI heard from you know some of the people over on that side that said I'll do the donors don't care they'll buy that out no problem I mean we do you think that that is you really think it's realistic that they could just buy out like that\nYeah I think it's possible I mean I have a good friend Terry bound that coach at a University of all of our back in his last year was Nineteen Ninety eight I had a game against Tennessee where it's no longer to head coach after that you know that ... show\nIt can happen I Know what you're there for the landscape in college what ... what was wrong on a carrier or were you know winning a national championship against or given ... to ... age you\nAnd your number two guy and what's your finger in Burma cruise through time ... ... polling with copper or more importantly throughout the nation\nIt's going to be very tough for the opportunity to really that costs ... is kind of the week number nine they show up to the polls right Alabama at the end of the year in Georgia I mean do you could lower doses to potential losses as well I mean after a terrible record\nOver to talk to her six losses ... he actually here's your your your ... or ... or ... or ... or not she\nYeah and don't let's not forget they they place that they play against my Aggies\nA well on that schedule that could be another last uh for them if they are aligned doesn't start showing up but um you know the only other one I Want to touch on the last week before we get into a the stuff that's coming up this week uh how how legitimate I mean holy hell LSU\nLaid a whooping on Georgia is that more or is that more of a case of LSU being that good\nHow legitimate I mean holy hell LSU laid a whooping on Georgia is that more or is that more of a case of the LSU being that good or Georgia or having a very off day\nI've been to tell her she will be in that good let's be honest I mean the one concern I had about LSU heading into that and match up was morally worn out from that loss on the road in Gainesville against Florida I mean they allow two hundred and Fifteen rushing to the gators in that match up fees that balance stop as in Georgia that was averaging\nTwo hundred and forty rushing towards ensuring that ball game\nThey held on wiser totally feel that the Andre ... in ... Georgia only had a hundred and Thirteen brushing your teeth in that all getting but they wanted a channel for battle for doing nothing as long as you could force turnovers\nYou're going to the Balkans and more important in order to pick up the road when especially within the FCC you need to run the football and more importantly when the turnover battle and that's something that the Georgia Bulldogs but now you on the road in Baton Rouge and the average quarter facing Florida in a couple of weeks so we'll see how it plays out for the overall\nWe're speaking with ... see him as being Asian radio and SB Nation radio dot com or\nYou're listening to the fan react here looking ahead eh let's just start with what you feel is a game you'd like to you know potentially gamble on in terms of a week eight in college football realm\nWell I'm not going to back down guys I mean I go through that they're going to try to break down the power five conferences are like feeling my analysis is is is that what I'm going with the big game between ... and Michigan State I mean Michigan state's dominated the match up\nThey run for the last five over the Wolverine spike Fifteen points per game but I think it was just a different Michigan seeing that granted there on the road but it comes down to the ... century defense alliance for the whole grains\nAnd certainly it's natural Michigan was averaging charging Seventeen rushing per day more and more importantly chores you can go on your parents are yours will treat Patterson their infants who when you look at the front shepherd they're only give it up a hundred and eighty rushing yours to opposing fences around a hundred and twenty nine\nPassing yours on my house to opposing quarterbacks they do have twenty total Saxon holding opposing quarterbacks to ... percent on ... down ...\nWhen you look at their office that converted forty eight percent of the time\nWhen I look at Michigan State I'm Still seeing one dimensional off and there are averaging a hundred and twenty three rushing towards ... answering for right or whatever to Seventy one to the oil and work eat less bacon or an ... year or two hundred yards I don't think that when you're smoking against Michigan and\nI don't want ... convincingly\nTo coach or more Saturday afternoon in East Lansing\nSo [laughter] well that's surprising to me I tell you there's three games that I'm going to be watching uh in addition to that one Alabama Tennessee game I think it's still going to be a destruction but I just want to see what's in it she does coming off of that game and and then what's going to go on with Clinton in in the states\nBut the one I think that I'm most excited about because of the strengths the Mississippi State seems to have on the defensive side of the ball the Mississippi said LSU game\nSeems to be pretty attractive in terms of like I mean it it might be kind of an ugly or game but then you know borough is not like a prolific passer here right I guess he's had a decent season six touchdown sooner sections but like how do you see this game playing out that considering that this will be said seasons is no joke\nYeah I agree ... and the one thing well let's let's let's costs the state I mean at the end of last year Mississippi State nominated LSU on the interior offering to events allies and that dog and they weren't that Patrick thirty five percent of the last year in store will I Know LSU possibly was looking at how the work why\nDon't you know excuse that this could make or break out what she sees him in terms of making a college football playoff\nWhy author Nicholas job and I look at that operates aligned by Mississippi State they're kind of put a lot of pressure our allies you all for it later endorsed backers are more frequently quarterbacks we're gonna have to disagree\nEnron support I can open up by action for that out that's the one thing that job or had do better than I already and I know he had a ... game was where he looked like he was out coached but he he puts a quote unquote race\nThousands of acres one on one opportunities to staff and that's what they're going to work to do a cast of LSU\nTiger ... still given up around two hundred and twenty three partially are short posing quarterbacks\nThere in the Mississippi some jumps up early I think that for sure do the whole dogs can create habit for journal borrow again this is not going to be an easy game I think I Would issue ... but I wouldn't be shocked that Mississippi State school from start to finish you only give it up around a hundred and twenty Russia large\nTwo opposing op answers entering this ball game\nIt is very slow like very slow but it is a fantastic to me like\nIt's up there and like the eight to nine ... because it it's that good I wouldn't give it a tin only because it's not a movie would watch again\nYeah and the thing about slow movies is that when you use that word slow the new people tend to like a slow because their attempts to ever win rivers slow but it it culminated with maybe the most\nLike the climax of that movie is one of the most like intense ones when river ... movie great climatic right and that's my but my point is just because it's low it doesn't make it a bad mood vary so I give it a eight and a half ... something and you need to see it fantastic there's so many recommendations that I have not checked out\nOf them probably you're just not a movie guy no I don't I don't really watch too much I got I got Netflix and that's about it I mean I got a ...

the proper license now Georgia has made the effort Joan correct in that then the last year they have simple ply done away with some wise\nThey won't get the proper license now Georgia has made

for deer there's not a specified distance this time they tried to mirror the law for home which is fifty yards from a prompt in line but there were some deal with the law was written and it was left out\nWhat you'll probably see in the next year so is it will change to that also made the fifty yards but that the more there is no specified distance own deer and fifty yards don't whoa\nOkay that answer your question mark\nYeah because I was actually giving air written warning for well in Chicago several different resource officers say education issue between resource officers guessing falls into the hog hunting issue\nYeah it is a ... deals with that because it is very specific in the hall gunning those fifty yards\nWell they are but my question okay thanks for calling mark thank you all

I have a nice day you\nBet thank you good luck this season\nYou know something else that helps out in those circumstances is just communication just talk with diverse you're not always just it may not always gets you somewhere but sometimes you know if people realize that their impact and somebody else it sometimes they can they can work out then you you can form a relationship with your neighbors\nWe always encourage people to form cooperatives and\nUh you know ... you know people that want to protect younger bugs and quality deer manage we we really encourage the formation of multiple property cooperative so you know building up that communication can bridge a lot of those gaps and and uh won't work Everytime ah but you know sometimes it helps just to go out to\nMaybe they don't or maybe they don't know that you're there or what say let's say he's up next Jeff is calling from social circle good morning Geoff\nGood morning on how are you a lovely recalled in your own\n... that's a yeah let me introduce a this fellow a Jeff and I have been fishing and hunting buddies not recently but when we what Jeff Thirteen Years old\nYeah back in the late fifties sixties\nYeah yeah uh he we went to a different high school played sports against each other but we always spent the summer fishing and uh and doing a lot of deer hunting any it just walking in the woods right\nThat's right and I never forget time since we're talking about the early this morning okay about a good friend of mine\nNamed Leo ...
