fired by Jerry Jones the next week it says a lot of people say he's about to be given an extension now it's Dallas versus Washington Jason Garrett going to get an extension or is it going to be fired well\nYou know I mean yeah Jason ... then again ... start winning his role games because you don't want to be on the season that uh you know on the road but you know just what the doctor ordered for the Dallas Cowboys this weekend and that's a showdown with the Nazis division fall a Dallas Cowboys the last seven games when they face the division falling into the the division\nThey on the road there five and two straight up and five and two answers bread and they're they're entering a family ... this week I'll find this weekend with the Washington Redskins there are six and one in the last seven visits to the uh Washington so\nUm you know I did this ah this was developed order for the Washington the Dallas Cowboys [laughter] um you know I'd rather than looking\nThis week you know every week we're getting more and more data into the system and I'm Talking to a buddy of mine and we were talking about average all kinds of average played per game\nRight you know and in order to win the ballgame yeah it sure helps to have the great they all down to the fence on the field and we're going into a game this weekend where he got to the you know two very good defenses\nUm you know yards per per game I'd Dallas's rang for during the hours per dams against at three Fifteen point do Washington's rank three yeah is that three three twenty states point to a game\nSo you got two very good defenses you got a couple of Jekyll and Hyde off into this weekend going at it um and when you look at the strength for Washington you know you got Alex Smith is a veteran quarterback got Adrian Peterson the veteran a running back\nAnd then you've got you know the um the duo of or you got the data Prescott\nRegalia um but if you're Washington You're saying okay if that was going to beat me this week we're going to force the adapt to throw the ball and if you're in Washington and yeah so the way I think this week it's going to be a defensive struggle a dialysis dream three Washington dream to\nThe uh the Rand report has is very very tight it has Washington winning point to point six nine to twenty two points for eight\nSo if you did on you know basically almost like a drop like they don't play the point spread or you want to play Dallas this weekend and we're going to give the edge to the Dallas Cowboys because of their defense and they can run the ball very well\n[noise] alright Dallas and the points as far as the ... report is concerned about Minnesota the jets a Minnesota certainly is to find wide receiver ... knew a lot of people don't know a whole lot about and

come in and and and you know there's not a lot of flashing names on the jets um you know I look at their average yards per game on off in\nMinnesota's rank TANF right now in the league at three Ninety One point to the jets are ranked twenty states that three forty point five um yards per game on defense you a Minnesota rank sixteenth the New York jets rank twenty second I'm now the average I think the average place\nDefense you a Minnesota ranks sixteenth\nThe New York jets are ranked twenty second I'm now the average out to the average place per game this is where it gets a little interesting\nMinnesota's rank sticks on the um plays per game they're running fifty nine point eight plays ... and the jets are running sixty eight point five average plays pregame are they in the last three games the maverick seven eight point seven and a place for gang compare to fifty five for a Minnesota\nNow Minnesota hasn't done well against the jets there um the last three visits in a I keep calling the all metal and but the last three times in New Jersey when they play the jets they're all in three straight up\nOn three against the spread and ... minutes on a base thing in a way team there on the road and they're facing the AFC East division opponent the oil and seven straight up so um you know the ATF forecast is leaning on the underdog and just want to hear\nWe liked the

closer they are very hard to come by we know there's a closer carousel on\nYou know Fifteen teams are so it seems like every year their teams can never settle on that closer he's one of those guys that is a mainstay you'll see the red Sox are definitely going to want to bring him back to anchor and their bullpen but there are a number of contending teams could be looking for a closer this off season for one that stands out\nMost to me outside the red socks of course it's just former team the Atlanta Braves perhaps your Chicago Cubs and possibly even the Cleveland Indians who are gonna see Cody Allen and Andrew Bell or walk free agents late dog ... hand to hand is could be easily use the seventh or eighth that\nYeah that's that's a great point you brought up with the Indians I mean they are definitely going to be I'm looking for a closer you know taking the choir whites are closer I'm like a camera that that's going to be the top you know need for them I think in the offseason to address so I mean that depending on what happens with hand like you said he's\nHe's got a the experience in a clothing or holding out games plenty of that experience but you know if you can get a big fish you know why not go out there and get you know one of the best if not the best\nCloser in baseball right now so uh you know outside of maybe guys like Chapman To just throw heat and gas but this guy gets the job done and he's still you know in his prime so yeah I think the Indians would make a ton of sense and the Braves also\nAnd they wouldn't you know sometimes non contenders you go out there and spend money on it closer I don't think it makes a lot of sense because what's the point of having that late inning shut down man if you're not going to have a lot of leach Iraq tried a content save your money for something else I think it will\nBe a contender I think he'll want to go to a contender especially after you know this year's postseason them you know the success the red Sox\n... so I see chemical going there but everyone you're listening to sports overnight America ... dog ... will have NFL\nWeek seven to match up the betting lives coming your way right after

playing the waiting game anymore really or ... no more looking at the practice report in wandering about Sunday we have a concrete answer now do we want us to middle line up knowing that there is a good chance he might end up leaving the game and giving us a zero he ... playing to the groin injury but he decided to undergo surgery\nSo this means he's not going to be a fan of the factory to drop a ball and read rapidly mostly their championship games in week sixteen so few have him and somehow are lucky enough to get him back for that game I still don't see any way you can put him in your

sports overnight America for back here on force over night America ... percent landers talks for Allah taste and bad dog half\nAnd we're talking this week seven\n... and we'll start with a\nReally exciting game by opinion the way the patriots\nVisiting the Chicago Bears patriots favored by three in this game and I know the past aren't at home and that's why they're so so good at Fox borough um and ... it's a good one but based on what I saw that bears last week or the dolphins and what I've seen from the past over the past few weeks\nI don't think this game is really going to be all that close I think the Patriot to kind of hit their stride the all fat is healthy training course looks great he has a\nPlethora of weapons a wide receiver and the biggest thing to me that they have a very impressive do our running back right now with Sony Michel change white I think the NFL needs to be on alert for these guys this past dean had an embarrassment of riches on fast and as good as the parents have been um I\nI think the pages are going to take this game he's de la\n[noise] yeah I wouldn't be so quick to say that they're going to take this game easily Lu I think that you know with the bears there might be a little bit of a hangover effect from you know the overtime game there with the dolphins and kind of\nYou know coming up short against a team that they should have be by All right um you know but look he moving forward and and that's what they're going to do I think in this match up you know you've got a bears team that's just like the patriots they play great at home\nAre they not been beat at home yet\nUm whereas the patriots yeah there are two officers have been on the road to align seem that they should have that definitely beat aligns team that you know not as good as the bears in my opinion\nOn both sides of the football and then on the jaguars you know obviously losing matchup week two on the road to really good defense so I think when I looked at this matchup I see\nYou know a lot of the same characteristics in his defense um with the bears was ... it just being able to put pressure on Tom Brady I'm kind of in the same vein as what the jaguars were able to accomplish back and wait too so I think it's going to be closer than people expect\nUm I Do think that the teachers are probably going to win this game um but I wouldn't be surprised if it's a lot closer than what is it three points right now um\nYeah I mean it's going to be I think it's a touchdown or less um but I wouldn't probably wouldn't bet against the three points so that's you know I I have faith but don't have that much faith but\nYeah I mean to me a patriot you're going to win the football game and they'll win by three or more by that and I understand you're a bears fan I mean it's hard for you to lie to you know go against our team and that was going against my team I'm In the Dallas Cowboys quite a bit earlier in the year\nBut this week I Am going to go with by Dallas Cowboys they're visiting the Washington Redskins Redskins favorite by one and a half and both teams coming off very impressive win against good opponent the cowboys beat\nUp ... ... there's a huge rivalry between these two teams of course but the winner of this game will either be in full possession of first place or at least in that tied for first place in the NFC\nEast heading into week eight the way the cowboys play week six leads me to believe that they can and should be able to win this ain't versus skins as he looks like he's on a roll again that\nMessage of data rates may apply

this one's going to be pretty intense I my favorite game of the week is absolutely\nThe um\nKansas City Cincinnati game but unfortunately that was the last two Sunday night and doesn't show up on our\nMain flame contest but I mean that's one of the most exciting to watch a Kansas too explosive all fences I just love watching ... every single game no matter where it is [noise]\nBut um unfortunately that's not on the main slate of games on the Sunday one to you know one to eight PM sort of slight so we can't target flares from that one and it's really interesting this week\nThat there aren't any extreme of what I Would say obvious ... games to target\nOn the main flight and so I'm going to give you a little bit of a of an unusual team to target that might surprise you a little bit but as he cited about the most this week is the Cleveland Browns\nTaken on the Tampa Bay bucks\nA cat and that's all that's not all that surprising man I mean it sounds crazy when you think Cleveland but the books have been just torch through the air I mean they already fired their defensive coordinator\nOh Mike Smith why would you hire that guy but but um\nDo you remember the mixture risky ... six touched down from her and so this is where Baker Mayfield who hasn't been super consistent all season\nHas a has a real chance to you know test out whatever ceiling he might have in his young uh and it's all career so I'm really excited about the Cleveland often a banker Mayfield\nOf course Jarvis Landry a as a connection and David and Joe ... who's been getting ten targets for game so that that trio excites me and the other quarterback and again these are names you rarely hear him talk about on this show or for a\nFor a Sunday slice of the other guy I'm interested in Joe Flaco\nTaken on the saints now the saints our team when the number one run defense in league meaning if you're going to attack them you have to attack them through the air I'm Joe Flaco in a contract season you know he does his best in the contract you're willing to oblige\nThrown like crazy raw or even something running a lot so I really liked Joe Flaco and it's tough to narrowed down which passed\nCatcher ... time into but you know Crabtree brown and seeds sees has a little bit of a of a revenge kind of narrative going against thanks so that those are the two passing all senses that I'm looking at for the Sunday slight\nMakes sense to me and if I'm not mistaken that game is in Baltimore and uh the saints are a bad road team but there's certainly a much better home team so I you know just all festive lead defensively all around so I don't mind that ... not to mention that he's in the contract here but he has a nice looking over our shoulder at large accent\nYeah psycho plays better when he's got a little pressure on him the last time I had a contract believe they went to the super bowl and then he got paid so\nYou know boy did we ever yeah I mean one I I I for one was quite surprised\nBy him getting paid but let's not talk but Joe ... contract let's let's parts of the fs here and of course everyone the fs army dot com the U.S army dot com ... away from a ... that's s away at the U.S army dot com so we talked about some Baker Mayfield we talked about some joke Locke though and the other quarterbacks you like this week\n[noise] um the the only the guy I'm looking at really a couple of others a periphery low more expensive not not as excited about about paying off this week but Jared ... cousins both look or to be in good situations gossip just you know it's the forty niners and\nIf he wants to throw he won't be able to incur cousins taking on a jets a secondary that's not that good um the goal with the Congress play would be\nThe hope that the Jeff could keep the game close because I Believe that the Vikings are going to blow out my beloved New York jets but if they can keep it close\nUm cousins will continue to throw the wind is going to see when it's going to go crazy and things will have a great game both of these pass catchers can do really well and it doesn't look like I'm the Vikings are bringing much of a running game into town which I like for the passing game fantasy point scoring purposes\nWell let me ask you this from a strategy that point and yeah it's going to be pricey but if you're going to use cause it so what do you ever considered using both feeling and things and the ... going to be too pricey to get that though\nIt can be done but you do need a certain value plays in other spots to make it work and this isn't really that kind of a week\nUm you'll know when I get to the running back position there really aren't any clear value place and and it's making this week I'm more difficult overall we I like it gives us an edge\nBut in general some more difficult we could've put line us together and certainly putting to just on my receivers and inexpensive quarterback together is really gonna limit what you can do with the rest of your lineup\n[noise] I can\nCertainly putting too soft on receivers and inexpensive quarterback together is really gonna limit what you can do with the rest of your lineup\n[noise] I can get behind that's all probably make two cousins live ... with the with the one with the eggs or any other wide receivers outside of Landry steel and thanks you like it\nYeah I mean I have a feeling it's the talk over all play and wide receiver he's the only guy that I'm willing to pay out for um if I'm looking on ... very inexpensive a little too expensive for me on draft Kings' but you know\nThis is what it is um it's basically fans will drop to surprise this week drafting racist price and draft Kings' is much more um predictive so when drafting raising the price that players in a better spot and went sandals less productive so I actually use ... price movement to\nShe had to show me target plays on FanDuel if that makes any sort of sense so\nI'd like to actually brilliant that's really that's the kind of stuff that we that we want to hear from me that our listeners could really benefit for also that's awesome\nYeah it's it's actionable drafting a salary I remember the ... is actionable information they they do really good job with moving those are based on the matchups couple of other players on looking at um cooks in woods I liked the pass catchers without cup uh for\nThe rams woods actually moves into the slot that's the best offer him so he gets a boost for me particularly would close and was both getting a little bit of a boost a moving down the list if to my health is healthy and he's Pakistan right now you know\nThere are thrown like crazy in Indianapolis and health an at home has always been pretty good so I I don't think a lot of people are going to be on him um I already mentioned the Baltimore pass catchers all good I'm Willie sneak with The Revenge factor and I'm going to give you a super sleep or if I could find them\nBecause I Can't remember his name for a second\nBut I'm there oh Cleveland number three wide receiver replacing Higgins Damien rapidly rally yeah never heard of this guy come as a target is Lesley ... eighty two yards\nA Antonio Callaway just not that good he's just not that good so you know very inefficient so indirectly form in price on tracking is only play can pick up on four or five reception kitchen fifty yards ten points um you know that's one of those ways you can afford some exciting running backs up\nWell let's get to those running backs it obviously we know of the ... of course but uh you know after ... really so let me ask you this and I haven't checked is laid out if a woman game on that early slate with the chargers ... okay gone now you know about or or need it you\nKnow this is one of the toughest weeks for running but normally I Try to load up with three running backs every single week because that's the most consistent position but if you get a look at the slight it's brutal\nUm girlie obvious want him in every line up and then we moved down the list you know Kamara not in love with that um you know still in touch with her a Z galley it's in good spot but it's very tough to afford him and girly together [noise]\nUm you have your patriots running backs who I Love both of them but you don't take it on the number two ranked Chicago run defense now my favorite um\nSeventy

then one would wear white leotard one would wear a black leotard they\nWould wrestle each other just to the rest of them in the finals and of course end up in the bedroom with them\n[laughter] I was

overnight\n\nWell you're back with the attack black view [noise] farmers one eight hundred and eighty seven I play one eight hundred eight seven eight seven five\nTo nine bit of a sticker on Thursday night which was to be expected cardinals were really bad\nTeam Broncos forty five cardinals ten case Cain um fourteen uh Twenty one hundred and sixty one yard touchdown and a pick\nA random football for a hundred and thirty one yards rows and had three interceptions for Arizona which was really the story of the game or one of those stories Larry Fitzgerald breaking another record\nWhich is fine um [noise] again bad football teams both of them I don't know the Denver is going to be able to salvage the seeds and that's where I'm going to focus all but just because of the fact that uh [noise] there's\n... ... case keyed them showed last year within a system\nThat he could be a particularly good quarterback pat Sherman who was making the calls and and Zimmer was getting it done\n[noise] um\nBut within a system and it spoke volumes and I wondered and again I'm far from an expert I opine about it but I'm far from an expert\n\nI looked at what case keyed them did and I respected it and I thought wow he had one heck of a year maybe this was a guy that broke out but then a major red flag went up for me when they jettison sand Bradford\nThey jettison teddy Bridgewater and they absolutely had no interest in bringing case Keenan back and I thought to myself well somebody saying something there\nThey went with Kirk Cousins John Elway ... case keen him and us far it is not being good now I don't know if it's Vance Joseph not coaching\nJohn Elway went with Kay scheme them and us far it has not been good now I don't know if it's Vance Joseph not coaching to the strength of his quarterback I don't know that this is a scenario where case getting them is finding is real level\nDon't know I don't know\nBut they were good enough particularly defensively there was a little trick play as well to pick six is forty five ten over Arizona Arizona fans you're gonna have to live with it it's just your Rosen's team\nAnd you just have to live with the fact that every once in a while he's going to have one of these on a bad team\nI saw I'm trying to make attack along the pick six now one of them it got tip that the line of scrimmage it wasn't his doing that just happens but the other one was and he's going to make some bad throws it just is part of the deal\nAnd Arizona is probably going to get a top three pick 'cause I don't see them when they get held a lot of football games for the remainder of the season and they'll be fine and your quarterback will be fine\nYeah I'm looking at the second one it was it was just a bad throw all the way around what needs to happen is when he throws an interception please don't try to make the tackle\nYeah actually looked like the receiver random wrong route but there's still a road forty five ten Denver\n\nAnd not a great start to the week in the world of professional football titans in the chargers as I said titans are getting exposed to more and more each week in that their quarterback is not very good\nAnd as they quarterback goes so goes the deep chargers look in a way forward or over there at home they're gonna do that against Tennessee\nAnd they'll take care of their business [noise] um oh and for those who you want to chime\nIn on any of these football opinions plays one eight hundred eighty seven eight play one eight hundred age seven eight seven five to not that's going to be a tough decision down there in Tennessee 'cause they went for the extra year but I yeah he's just not very good parents or the patriots in Chicago\nAnd this is where you say low okay what are we going to do here patriots hitting stride their foreign to shine designed Josh board and he's given up a deep threat\nGround college and with twenty six receptions for four hundred and five yards Sony Michel has Ninety One carries for four hundred yards the important thing here balance balance a balance there they're really getting it done thus far\n\nThey're they're really showing up Thirteen touchdown six interceptions for Brady not great\nBut he's still passing pretty well forty one and counting it's gonna happen eventually but he's still playing at a pretty elite level not the best in a game anymore but still pretty elite level bills and the colds did show you how bad the bills quarterback situation is\nIs Josh Allen thank goodness didn't need Tommy John surgery after his elbow injury but Derek Anderson got signed off the street and he was immediately named the starter\n\nNascent Federman shouldn't be in the league and won't be next year but he signed this year and ... okay whatever one touchdown pass for interceptions three touchdown passes in nine or deception said his career\nSean McDermott throwing up on the bus said it's the right move for our team sure it is the right move would've been keeping AJ McCarron and letting Josh Allen learn but you weren't bright enough to do that\n\nLike I said the Buffalo Bills and and\nThey're not obviously going to tell their quarterback map to perform well but the fact that they have to win with Josh Allen is astounding to me their defense was part of it a big part of it\nThey're going to finish with well I don't know three wins maybe four wins over the course of the season and probably get a top five drive I don't know probably they're going to get a top five draft pick\nBad football team defense is okay\nTo actually leading the conference in points that guy is their division and points it yet but Seventy six points for they can't score and nascent Peter man can't play but I mean it was incredibly stupid\nOn the part of that management team\nBut dormant the coach and company to get it done now\nOne good thing at least for buffalo was the fact that there are playing Indianapolis was one in five in Indianapolis a win the game and maybe I don't know they don't have any film on Derek added should with this team so they have no idea what's going to happen I Would imagine handoff left hand off right quite a bit but he is a big arm\nAnd he can throw the football\nAnd the bills can get up after the quarterback and Andrew Luck can get sacked and does often\n\nAnd I've been I mean he's been throwing the ball more than any other quarter back in the national football league so we'll see\nSee why health is going to play\nIs less than a hundred percent with the hamstring eat but as as he said and I respected port is it my hundred percent is better than a lot of people say he's going to fight through it and try to help his quarterback\n\n... it's going to be a not pretty game let's put it that way [laughter] ah yeah well\nYou know you look at it and you say ... ... certain games there just aren't very good and that's going to be one of them\nUm lines and the dolphins kind of falls into the same category tannahill

seventies foreign guy humans to represent your victories on your on your ring\nAnd of course team members got them and personnel people you know everybody in the organization that these rings um every ring ceremony they're just getting more and more crazy\nI remember what was the um the patriots had the super bowl ring when they beat the Atlanta Falcons and there was two hundred\nAnd eighty seven diamonds in it because that's what they trailed by in the game leading to the comeback when it gets the falcons like the ultimate trolling of Arthur Blank was to put the exact amount of diamonds into the er into me\nHow much you were trailing by in that football game and the super bowl the are well done and they do if they do look really really good so congratulations ... fantastic for now\nTo tie game in the in the second half look five and on and on a ... a rose last at New England you could do worse and they haven't\nSo their number two no ... exactly what you're saying I mean we were talking\nBut not not only just the robots but I mean they they rallied they they had to fight back becoming a come back and get it\nAnd they were almost successful the almost beat the patriots at home which is unheard of\nAnd there's only been a one quarter back under the age of twenty five that's ever want to July stadium yep exactly and you know ... or ... quarterback Colin Kaepernick but bad ... almost became the second quarter back to ever win ... stadium under under the insurance but\nThere's there's nothing wrong with the ... they [noise] they ... their mind blowing right now and it's it's gonna be fun to just continue watching them rams your number\nOne that the only team that are having the that having lost the game and six noses and keeping the Seventy two dolphins that she can check right now they are the number one rushing team in the NFL they score a ton of points you don't give up a ton of points they throw the ball particularly well yes they had some injuries yeah the Broncos made it a little interesting at the end\nBut the rams are six you know he's not every game is going to be a thirty five to ten blowout it's you know you're going to have your you can have your adversity um they played in the cold weather but nevertheless still was able to get tied girlie rolling for over two hundred yards against the Broncos defense against that seem to stop anybody but nevertheless the rams undefeated number one in my power ranking\nNumber one as mine as well I mean come on they they took us so Cal team and threw 'em in the snow [noise]\nThat's right and they said whether it be damned will just figure out something else that will figure out how to play snowball\nAnd they did they just they just throw them back to a girl who ran all over the last guy to Broncos deepens couldn't do anything against colonel\nBut living in it but it just shows you that this team the same as far as to when they're just going to I mean they're going to march to see a NFC side of the super bowl with ease there's there isn't a NFC team I think right now that can stop on\nThere that they might they might put a they might put a little bit of fear in the ... the Seventy two dolphins team there they could they could\nThey got the ... coming up I'm looking at their schedule now look at the same coming up uh let's see chiefs that is going to be quaking them or Nineteen in Mexico and the Mexico that's right well I talked about that\nUh they got the bears coming up as well and the eagles the eagles start pig you know figuring themselves out a little bit students there are two games against Arizona they beat Arizona already one giving his Arizona they got the niners twice\nThey still have the sea hawks that can be a little bit of a danger but yeah\nYou know still get some tough games six another six now let's get all the fun and these are the worst teams in the NFL number twenty eight on my list\nI put the Buffalo Bills have the game in Houston should have won the game and Houston but forever God Knows I have no idea why they still looking Nathan Federman you go he's gonna get is one thing you know when these kids will be is still in this league I Swear\nIt's they're holding on to something this is like a producer in the movies that just believes his girlfriend is going to be that big superstar actress and he just puts her in ... bad film after bad films up their bad films and she can't do it they beat him and cannot play in the slave everybody knows it put the bills that's why you stink and that's why you're twenty eight\nI put the cardinals that twenty eight just because I\nI felt that they did okay against the Viking senator and and you know even though they are one in five and you know one of the worst records Italy I thought it was like you know I'm starting to see maybe a little bit of a trend of words on them no no there's no chance they're really going to make any noise is the season but\nI felt you know what I'm going to reward you for valiant effort and so I put them in twenty eight\nNumber thirty some sorry twenty nine on my list is the Indianapolis Colts being only Andrew Luck and and that's it that's it [noise]\nI mean if you you got to really love fantasy football to pretty much know who else is contributing on this team\nI mean ... but that's that's about it they don't have anything else they don't they they they've Andrew Luck throwing the ball as much as you possibly can ah they can't run the ball at all they are a passing team because they trail alive they give up a ton of points they went on the road and against the jets and [noise]\nYou know it was it was one of those high scoring not necessarily a shoot out he was forty two thirty four but the culture bad there they can't figure out ways to win games and it's all Andrew Luck and this is why I didn't put them there earlier this season but I'm starting to put them now one inside the terrible\nTwenty nine I put the bill for all the same reasons you do those cuts I mean if they've Nathan Peter men is there hope God help us God help but also you know\nThey were able to I don't know if this is a slam against the taxes I mean they look somewhat competitive from time to time and that game so I don't know if that's a big against the Texans who are you know tied for first place names to south [noise]\nWe're just saying what I'm saying nobody wants that division now but I have the uh the bills are twenty nine\nTo a number of thirty on my list the New York giants they are also one in five they've got an Eli Manning problems they have a quarterback problem\nI said this uh this after the Thursday night game I think\nFive ... new probably was trying to hit the giants management you got a problem here when he benched Eli and broke his\nConsecutive starts streak good for him because he seemed to be the only one with a clear head and what do you like manning is doing the giants as an organization believing them too much\nOf the ... which is there's a lot of other problems my father who is a giants fan texted me on friday and said there's a lot more problems with this team than Eli so I'll take his word for it they're thirty\nFor my thirtieth I had the Colts offer the same rate as you did which it pains me to put them there because I Love\nI Love captain Andrew Luck tweets now I Do too and I and I actually think they are getting funnier as they keep losing yeah and one theory smothered actually celebrate a victory eventual irrational and see what he has a say you know about about the uh the football airmen or whatever who whatever team they play next\nBuffalo coming up in one of his tweet said and and he goes there there are fierce warriors and they're all named William [laughter]\nGod to seem as bad as it is pretty much it is Andrew Luck and he and he had certainly going to be him the entire season so [noise] but I but that's what they call ... asked for they wanted a franchise quarterback who can move the ball they have that they just haven't put anything around them\nJordan Wilkins as they're leading Russia either look him up to find out who he is a rookie from old\nMiss he's leading a user leading Russia\nI and I and I live here are saying I didn't remember that you played for the thirty one for me is Arizona I ... I was just going to do that like you did I was going to give him a little bit more credit because they thought their game against Vikings was better than ah than I expected against them but there's still one in five and he's still on other issues I like Josh\nAnd it 'cause I thought they were given gets Vikings was better than uh than I expected I'm against them but they're still one in five and he's still with other issues I like Josh rows and I I I I think he's going to be okay\nBut this team is so far down in every category passing rushing defense giving up points scoring points um they got a Thursday night game against the Broncos they might actually win that game at home but Arizona's my thirty first steam\nMy thirty first same as the giants I'm near so here's here's the one good thing about the giants season this year that they're they're they're receiving a lot of grief project you say one Berkeley yeah the number to pick should have taken a franchise quarterback well guess what\nThey had the running back to the future they will get a top three picked this coming season that then this coming ... they will find their franchise quarter back then\nThere did it they did it the right way America\nStop blaming unprotected say well when they should have taken a friendship scored like they're going to find that quarterback I don't know who\nI haven't seen any one or the or in college football is really could be you know designated as the next round says quarterback\nBut obviously that's got to be their first move coming back into the next dressed suck it up this season and you'll get another tops I picked easily back could easily have our exactly protecting they're going to be in the same spot again and either two or three I don't know if they're going to be one because I feel there's another team out there is going to be clear favored to get the number one draft pick\nAnd the final team the number thirty two team I think we both have this will you hold\nOakland Raiders come in it's one thing to embarrass yourself in Oakland in a city or leaving it's another thing to represent America\nAnd going overseas and playing a dog football game like you did against Seattle and bearing in caring embarrassing to the rest of the world shame on you John grew in I don't blame the players I blame you and you embarrass America\nBy going to London and Lincoln egg\n... he's still I mean he said again this past week something about you know not having power structures and you're just going like what are you talking about\nKeep going keep riding trains that I Know you definitely don't have passed Russia and you don't because you got rid of them listen when you ... your best to fund or right now is probably Bruce serving and he's sitting there and he's OK with the loss because he's going to go home and make babies present all you need to know about the raiders job ... bottom five\nDown SB Nation radio SB Nation I Am as we continue along on a Tuesday Morning on ESPN should radio\n[noise] this is pushing the God [noise]\nUh [noise] ...

years of existence or six years and in their existence until the Nineteen sixty nine team and then came from pretty much the basement to win the world series um and it was a big deal I Know I wasn't alive at the time but it was a big deal you know why the Mets are are orange and blue\nRun Culver yes go ahead\nIs a a combination of Dodger colors in giant\nColors that is exactly right so a badge and if you were living in New York and you were a Brooklyn Dodger fan or a New York giants fan and both of them I'm not just one both of them left\nAnd you were left in the in the city and when the greatest city in America the greatest city in the world and you didn't have a base a local baseball team you root for and you would spend your entire life hating the Yankees\nAnd all of a sudden major league baseball gives you this expansion team that's playing queens you get you know the the orange and the giants and the blue the Dodgers that's a team you're going to go to 'cause you're never going to be a Yankee fan never ever ever going to be a Yankee fan\nAnd you get this team and they're abysmal and Casey Stengel is the manager and he's they're losing a hundred and twenty games and you are watching them going please please turn this around I I Can't have the Yankees winning I Can't the Yankees are still around and then the Nineteen sixty nine when the world series\n[noise]\nIt's a great baseball story and the Orioles were really good\nBooks Robinson and so the ... on the state in Nineteen sixty nine little bit of history for those of you who are little too uh too young to remember where we have the final call we do it may be All right go ahead [noise]\n\n\nAre\nYou guys can see video and if you do have because their hair on your computer to go to YouTube and watch a video you can see the\nCrowd hollering and of course they're pouring onto the field yeah I've seen that scene in the number of times they don't believe they just go ahead and like it's a it's an ocean of people I mean imagine doing that today\nI Know I Know absolutely crazy or they were managed by Gil Hodges\nWho was a who made his debut in the forties for the Brooklyn Dodgers a and then manage the Mets and the Nineteen sixty nine World Series but that must have been in like an amazing time my father is a Mets fan and um [noise] that must have been an amazing time\nTo be again just realize you had a legitimate baseball team like losing your baseball team in New York\nLike all the reasons that but I don't really losing money\nWas chosen to be in for three teams and come to believe handled three teams it wasn't like they have the Yankees and then two teams that were\nJust a just barely surviving\nThey three legitimate fan bases like three teams in that city and to the left\nFor richer pastures in California the Yankees were like great ball in the city and they're like no not quite them and the Mets were born and then they they give you a World Series seven years they've been when they were the first expansion team to win a World Series they also um like they like the diamond\nBacks won the world series in two thousand one in a shorter time but I think the Mets obviously had that record for because it was seven years so they don't get a much bigger deal based on that more back yeah it really did\nI really did but again it goes back to something we've been saying when when we're doing these kind of retro pieces these going to this day in history [laughter] the Mets won the world series in five games and it was over now [laughter] I mean after mid October we were not even close to finding out who's in the world series yet\nBut one other thing I when I was looking up this thing and it it is another kind of interesting thing how the baseball has changed if you look up and just you can just go to ... sixty and I met you can go to any World Series in the seventies or whatnot you just look at the box score of ... of the games that were played and you'll\nIndia and the sixty and I met you can go to any World Series in the seventies or whatnot is just look at the box score of ... of the games that were played\nAnd you'll see games are played in two hours in twenty minutes to hours in Fifteen minutes later there was there was like there was like last night's game when Thirteen innings I get it but it was toward a half hours long\nGame one when two minutes to hours in Thirteen minutes attend any game what two hours in thirty three minutes a chant any game today it would be a you know you need to watching the ships that battle it along these games\nAre so they they go I like doing these little retro things I Can't wait till we get to the Superbowl time I love talking past Super Bowls\nSo my favorite things to them on the state history time is different surveys I think it's just because they they didn't go they didn't have all the pitching changes not yeah he's got a guy go in there forever no guy go for like two or your ...\nImaging\nI'm boarding W W ... around online at nine forty million dollars on the\nFollowing program is a public service of nine forty W.

I. S. T. TV\nThings about her being here tonight we starting tonight with credibility\nGovernor Walker as them this week four of your former cabinet secretaries have publicly criticized steal your former transportation secretary says you're inaccurate about state highways\nSecretaries of financial institutions corrections and economic development say they initially believed in your vision for the state but described your leadership with terms like schemes and cover up and quote micro management manipulation and mischief including directed not to leave a paper trail on major decisions\nHow does the fact that four of your appointees are raising these allegations affect your credibility\nWell thanks for the question and first off I Want to say it's a good evening and uh it's a little bit hard for me imagine being here tonight without my father and the audience so I Want to begin by thinking so many of you've offered her condolences including your Tony thank you very much for that\nOr eight years ago to Annette and I were worried that our kids weren't going to be able to find a job on a career because the unemployment rate was nine points three percent\nAnd since then we've seen a tremendous turnaround more people working in the state than ever before which is why we work in our workforce an over the next four years I'd like to canoe to grow the cheaper graduates here\nWhich is a good through your specific question it's simple I'm not afraid to help people with diverse opinions and get it\nFor years I had a cabinet member who wanted to raise the gas tax and I told the voters clearly I Would never raise the gas tax without an equal or greater reduction elsewhere in and there were no role or even an addition of my cabinet when I was in ... and I had a member of the cabinet there\nAction elsewhere in and their tax burden overall or even in addition to my cabinet when I was in county government I had a member of the cabinet there who work for a Democrat a United States Congress should I even had a personal eight in the past who work for Joe Lieberman who was a running mate with Al Gore when he ran for president two thousand\nI'm not afraid to have people with diverse opinions out there but why always will do is be straight with the voters of the state of Wisconsin I'll tell you what I'm going to do and then I'll follow up and do it\nAnd I hope you can see based upon our record we've got more people working in the state than ever before some of the best schools in the nation\nAnd your property taxes are lower today than before you started saying you have any your response to that Mr even\nAn thank you very much and thanks for the Wisconsin broadcasters association and the folks here tonight asking the questions\nAnd also in parks or particularly viewers watching ... and go over or is what's not forget about that\nSo it's a great question around that we've seen a playing out over the last few days or a Governor Walker talks about diversity but I look at this and a little different way and that is it's about how your governor and how the people Wisconsin trust to\nWhen you have for your for your top lieutenants and uh you you hire them a Scott Walker\nAnd a and they're talking about things like you know a alluding to not being truthful um making sure that ah that transparency was not an issue hiding things from the from the from the from the media\nMaking sure that uh it making sure that uh there was lack of and integrity in state government than the bottom line is and this was the thing that I think is most important of time and time again in in this discussion that we're we saw today\nWe saw people who are people that were your closest ... thoughts of attendance and and and the advisors saying that the integrity thing was very important what you put your\nYour ah your political agenda a head of the people Wisconsin how that is something that frankly is his very frightening to me as I said a sense that I Would change that going forward in fact I Can't imagine another governor that has\nTo even if you're out of time we're going to go to the next question and that is to Emily than in a job and KLW\nKeeping a focus on credibility\nMr even political reporting today and your department of public instruction confirmed that for a pathogen in your recently submitted department budget or plagiarize sections include Fifteen paragraph that have been lifted from a blog post\nAnd other paragraph that were taken from a liquor PDF entry without attribution\nYou've been a lifelong educator and your own department of public instruction website warned about the dangers of plagiarism justice we ask Governor Walker what does it say about your credibility that that's what happened under your watch\nFile citizens about Scott Walker has he doesn't have much I'll tell you that we dropped a few a few of citations from the back pages of a budget\nWe talked to the people involved\nIt was as a mistake and they fixed now the last thing I made in my life as Scott Walker lecturing me about the issue of uh of of of plagiarism frankly\nHe takes budget items directly from national organizations and high rise a high dollar sponsors passes on into law\nWas all change I'm barely changing and we're the issue about my budget is this is going to ask for a one point four billion dollars extra for the kids are Wisconsin that's what's important to be not citations\nOne point four billion dollars this is what we are going to be used to take care of the eight hundred million dollars of Scott Walker took all of a bunch of just a handful of years ago\nThat is what this budget is about where you can talk you we can be diverted into talks about citations all night but at the end of the day we know the kids have Wisconsin need a better budget than we've had for the last ... years\nThanking them and it was a year we find sure first off on the previous point let me be clear the Wisconsin council for freedom of information actually gave us a warrant for open government\nAnd in fact you can literally go to our website open book and see all the finances to state government and one of the national organizations gave us an a ranking rank and is the number three said in the nation for openness and transparency\nBut to the issue that was just raised in that question specifically I don't know if a teacher out there that would allow us students a hand in a term paper they plagiarized major portions of a document without a tribute particularly for what ... out there but but that aside ... let's talk about one thing I'm happy to copy and that is my friend Tommy jobs\nShe told me under the Obamacare exchanges her premiums are going up by almost two thousand dollars a month a month can you imagine that's\nSo well why she didn't failed to act or Obamacare brain as we are going up we put together a bipartisan solution we got Democrats and Republicans on board to pass our healthcare stability plan and just last week we got news that just as we predicted premiums will go down starting in January by over four percent\nAnd by ten percent from where they would have gone without our plan that's a savings in premiums have almost a thousand dollars now Tony's plan is to do what Minnesota did years ago\nIn Minnesota the premiums went up in fact two years ago this month the Democratic governor of Minnesota said the Affordable CARE Act is no longer affordable we cannot do that in Wisconsin are playing lowest premiums increase his choices and improves health care while we'll go ahead and cover pre existing conditions\nTo the emergency response ah that was a breathtaking a solar clay by the governor here's the deal folks\nScott Walker was running for president too long ago and he decided that being against the Affordable CARE Act was important piece to be in order to succeed in that ... that didn't happen and as a result of that decision\nHe has hurt the people was gone and he did not only that he uh pose Obamacare\nBut as a result of that opposition he did not take the Medicaid expansion money that the Wisconsin ... citizens deserve so he left hundreds of millions of dollars on the table and the reason why Minnesota has lower rates so Wisconsin does\nIs because and I talked to a person early on the campaign and then he said\nHe was living in La Crosse I going to continue working here but I have to move to Minnesota to get their health care thinking about that were driving people out of the state\nWe can't do that in addition Scott Walker I got to take that Medicaid money and we're going to we're going to plow it into the system and make health care more affordable is all but pre existing conditions are two point four million people in the state of Wisconsin that care about that including me I'm a cancer survivor\nScott Walker is talking on both sides of as though he wants to save a a pre existing conditions then but he's in federal court to get rid of Affordable Care act which will get rid of those protections so Scott Walker I've asked you a lot of times and you have an answer\nWhy should drop out of that last time is up we're going to go to the next question ...\nI have a number of confrontations on social media about mental health issues and how they impact area of family\nAnd I can tell you that I see the pain on the same thing on my record in in their story and in fact we have a feeling to share with you here Sherry from Madison that parents do not get surveys and cannot pay their can neat how and Danielle from Portage fed the biggest issue in aren't\nNow and you got any vitamin Cancun policy forum had a shortage of psychiatry in the lead to more than half of adults who need care not getting it now\nWhat is going wrong with the fate and what do you plan to turn over\nAll start out with uh my my we'll also K. through twelve education before money in the last budget and ah for mental health services that I could tell you a quick story how this played out in the state of Wisconsin in Ashland school as far north part of the state\nThey went to a referendum they they uh they modified some other schools that button every ... every school building they put in therapy room so that people can receive that therapy\nAnd bringing in a ... a practitioners from the area right in the schools so it fits rather that stigma so we put that money in the budget is starting to work we're asking for sixty four million dollars more in the state of Wisconsin that's what that's what we're going to be doing\nAn addition is does have to do with taking that Medicaid money I I'm going back\nI go talk to people all across the state of Wisconsin practitioner as well as house hospital or a ... if that money goes towards reimbursement of services if we don't take that money there's there you're going to be ... there won't be the higher level of reimbursement that's needed as a result\nPeople do get services is pretty simple\nI I was just west of folks over uh the uh Medical College in Wisconsin and they're doing some very innovative things at the state needs to support having a psychologist actually work with a\nFamily practitioners of northern Wisconsin away those people don't exist but if we want to have a healthy healthy society and especially in this area a mental health we must make that commitment and frankly we must take that Medicaid money can we walk\n[noise] well and most of those this year I think Tony and I agree the only to section is or you just talked about uh if you go back and look at politifact the facts are clear when Minnesota so the expansion premiums going up\nTheir premiums didn't go down until this year when they adopted almost the identical plan to what I just signed early this year will go into effect in January so we don't want to have happen what Mark Dayton a Democrat said two years ago and that is the Affordable CARE Act as the owner affordable\nFor and it comes to mental health services related to that you're right we actually do share a lot of the same place we took what was included in his budget requests two years ago 'cause when I travel the state was things the school officials that many of our town hall listening sessions that was an issue they said over and over again\nAnd they said we need it in the schools because a few years before that\nWorking with the legislature we actually provided the largest increase in mental health services in more than twenty more a governor had done in more than twenty five years\nBut it's still not enough we've got to work together to only a mental health but on trauma informed care my wife turnout is active in that than we know dealing with trauma an adverse child as experiences are incredibly important we need a partner together with the states with nonprofits with school districts and social service agencies all across the state of Wisconsin\nAnd as you mentioned when some of those uh it's a social media contacts out there I Know it's an incredibly personal issue\nBut my father who just recently passed away was a minister for many many years and throughout that time he suffered there were certain levels of mental illness as well and it's a struggle for many people we've got to break that stigma so people get the health care that they need to be healthy going for thank you and thank you for keeping time so well we're in\nPrince let's go to the next question Emily sounds\nSour transitioning to transportation\nPolling shows an African number ... ... and I are concerned about the quality of the roads and bridges when it comes to pollution Governor Walker you'd think clear that you won't raise the gas tax and some idea that you're open to Mr ... he's said everything is on the table\nWhat can you can see this evening to help crumbling roads and where will the money come from\nNext to the question you you mentioned polling actually the latest Marquette polls show that Seventy percent of the people in this day believe there there are roads and locally are good actually\nSo the question you you mentioned polling actually the latest Marquette polls show that Seventy percent of the people in the states\nBelieved there there are roads and locally are good excellent or fair so only thirty percent actually think the poor and we need to work on that all over the state has twice since I've been governor we've invested twenty four billion dollars into the state's transportation fun\nCompare that to the Twenty one billion dollars Jim door put it in fact during his time near the end of his tenure Jindal took over a billion dollars in rated it out of the transportation on we had to pay that back in\nListening to local officials as I once was in county government\nAnd they told us they needed a better partnership and so in the last budget we gave them the largest increase in Twenty years for local governments to maintain the roads and bridges were doing the same for a state highway than you did mention you're right there was a contrast Tony it said the day after the primary right here in Madison everything's on the table\nHe was asked does that include a dollar gas to gather excuse me a dollar a gallon gas tax decreased he said everything's on the table\nNow in a minute he'll say it's ridiculous it's why any number of other things out there but in the end he's not telling them what it is if you don't have a plan so after the election ladies and gentleman need to be ready for a massive gas to actually increase a dollar a gallon would be twelve hundred dollars for a typical family\nAre broach going for is to get local governments the largest increases they've ever had maintained are state highways and do it by not doing massive new energy in Milwaukee as the state has done over the past decade thank you what do you think Mr even holy\nMackerel is what I say a\nCourse people Wisconsin understand except for Scott Walker keep repeating a dollar a gallon is ridiculous it's never gonna happen\nLet's go back to what\nDoesn't work Scott Walker's policies Scott Walker has drawn a line in the than her own transportation and as a result our roads are crumbling we have people in northern Wisconsin they're scraping the ... of the fall off the roads are driving on gravel roads think about the\nUnique those so that idea\nWe have to change us in the state of Wisconsin I just I was just for the engineer the other day she was she was telling me she's worked on bridge project she's afraid that there was going to be a bridge calamity in this state so as we\nSit around and talk about a dollar a gallon out of how ridiculous that is our roads continue to crumble\nGoing forward and I have to tell you that twenty four billion dollars of our Governor Walker talked about but if you put that out against inflation worth the lowest level in Twenty years so going forward what we're going to do is really raw parsley for them to bring people together\nRepublicans and Democrats get this idea the only person in the way of solving this this ... infrastructure problem in the state of Wisconsin as Governor Walker going forward or I'm going to bring together Republicans and Democrats\nThe next question goes to Jessica\nContinue talking here about immigration and agriculture what many dairy farm in Wisconsin and he will find a melting pot in the milking parlor studies show more than half of the labor force our immigrant\nThose workers and the farmers who employ them live in fear of the increased deportation actions as we saw in Wisconsin just weeks ago and what that could mean to this day forty three billion dollar dairy industry do you believe immigrant labor I should remain a part of Wisconsin dairy industry and what would you push for as governor\nGovernor Walker you\nWill hear and as I mentioned uh we're a nation of immigrants animal laws when I was looking through some of my father's papers recently after his passing\nI saw some of the details about some of our ancestors Thomas ... my father's first name was alone came from South central wells where his father was a minor and he came here to America as a blacksmith because he wanted to pursue freedom and opportunities like so many immigrants do today\nBut he also can because this was a nation of laws and a stable government and so we need to hold those laws and Jessica that question probably would be best suited for the U.S Senate primary for US Senate debate I should say because those laws are dressed as a federal level\nDo I think we should have immigrants are open ... open to immigrants here in the state whether it comes deals with their ... yeah\nFor legal immigration and the state of Wisconsin we need people to come and we now have more people in the workforce than we've ever had before on the state's history we not only to keep our graduates here we need to bring people in from other states and other places to help\nIn the navy when well first of all we heard that a Governor Walker said no to the doctor trips and as far as in state tuition\nIn the navy when well first of all we heard that a Governor Walker said no to the doctor chips and as far as in state tuition other states have done it and that under the same circumstances\nBut what concerns me the most as we continue to pass on this issue and so with our president and this this campaign this campaign is not about Donald Trump as it's about Scott Walker and Tony Evers but it is about the governor's ability to call out\nBad public policy at the national level when when a\nYoung people were being ripped a ripped away from the parents at the border\nAnd people ask the governor Wisconsin whether he thought about that and he said it's a federal issue well it's not it's a human issue to human issue and the governor of the state of Wisconsin nice away on them that\nThe governor of the Wisconsin is a way on on the issue of immigration I won't work hard we have to have a comprehensive reform in the states we must be able to do that\nIn addition I went to provide a driver's permits for people that are working in Wisconsin and hanging out on that goes to our next question with the ...\nBeen keeping on you can I can\nTell me all made radio station and there's plenty to ask you this question about ...\nFilled up to your point of diamonds license in Wisconsin I tutor uneasy quiet social\nProof of Phoenix ship\nShould they be a way to ... conveniently undocumented him again\nQuotes Dr oh Wisconsin Joel\nHe saw how and when will it be done in the water yeah flash\nThank you again as I talked about before we're a nation of immigrants but we're also a nation of laws and that ... really puts us in violation of the federal law that's the reason why we need federal officials to stand up and make positive affirmative changes that allow for legal immigration and then the safe from anywhere around the world\nAnd the reason we need to do that is precisely what I mentioned the last question and the answer to the last question which is we have more people in the workforce in the state than ever before and a history\nWe need to bring more people into the state to work is why we're out actively recruiting people whether it's Midwest millennials or whether it's a alumni coming back from our public and private institutions or whether it's a way\nAround recruiting veterans at sixteen different military bases around the world and one thing that I'm particularly proud was where the number one state in America for veterans benefits all those things are about bringing people into the state of Wisconsin\nBut we need to be sure that were in compliance with federal law and that means that address issues like this we need the federal government to make those changes\nIt's you're either my uh my father in law came from Holland took a farm in ... county for years and then\nThen worked at color company and then the next wave of immigrants came and then the next wave of immigrants I can tell you that that is going to happen as long as I'm Alive and the state of Wisconsin or any any one of us we have to accept that fact so do I think that\nWe should have a ... driver permits for undocumented folks that are working in the state of Wisconsin the answer is yes\nPeople are undocumented folks are working hard at jobs all across the state of Wisconsin paying taxes paying into Social Security\nThey should have the opportunity pay to have permits but the state of Wisconsin also has the opportunity to hire good workers in addition when you get fat permit\nYou have to you have to learn how to drive safely in Wisconsin for me it's a win for the economy in a win for the workers and it was for the people Wisconsin\nGo to the next question and asked them\nWhat to talk about drunken driving and first than criminality\nDrunken driver and kill or injure someone every three hour into things according to the tea and yet we're company the only thing in the country then govern can pay their first than drunken driving charge a crime\nWe talked about this on social media and Christine from Madison represent a lot of the comments when you Tom she fed if God Forbid you only remember or two of your family too drunk driver then maybe you may think ... Duncan drunk driving laws need to change to\nHow in each of these were fine too quick scene certain verses having\nFirst of all I'll just talk about it in a in a different way\nThe hard work in our schools around alcohol and drug abuse has been very successful we're seeing a sharp decline of number you uses of drugs and uses uses of alcohol also and they and and less\nOf Britain binge drinking and also some of the good news is that we're trying to corral this problem that we have in a sense of\nWhy I think drunk driving is a serious offense absolutely and I believe it was I Believe there's ways that we can we can get there yes it should it should be fair eastern issue first time around there's no question about that I Would support that\nBut we also have to make sure that you know you just throwing people into the criminal justice system is not going to solve their problems\nIf it's as if it's a serious offense are viewed as a series of fast we after provide alcohol and other drug abuse ... or ... or proposals we have to provide mental health services we'd just hand incarcerate people think they're going to get better that's where my concern is governor [noise]\nWell this is a very serious issue and has been for years I remember when I was first in the state legislature for more with the uh the poor family and they just had a horrible case for a family member I think was\nIf I remember right I think there's a vigil or who killed or family member head\nHad been a repeat offender I think it was nine times one of the things that I'm particularly proud of his having worked with Alberta Darling ... really on a bipartisan group to a further criminalize multiple repeat offenders because at some point you're ... you're right we got to provide help and assistance but at some point when people are out multiple times on the road\nWith drunk driving a sense that is putting a risk to all of us in society out there\nAnd be on as part of the reasons why raise concerns after talking to law enforcement and public health officials\nAre about ... of legalizing marijuana you know I just saw a report from Canada that said I Believe in Canada now\nThey actually see a higher number of vehicle related crashes related to drug as opposed to alcohol way to make sure we don't have any impaired driving so whether it's alcohol related or drug related as well governor I think the question was first open criminality as opposed to civil\nBut my point on that is we need to go after not just the not so much the first offenders although we need to make it a taboo for anyone to be driving under the influence from alcohol or drugs or anything else\nBut we're the biggest threat has been and why we cracked down on that need to do even more is on people who are out over and over and over again all district change the law in the first thing you know I don't think Tony said that either I don't know they said that it's your even just to be clear\nI Would I Would I Would look at a ... making a criminal but I also it would have to be tied up with ways to not to incarcerate people but to to help them returned to society thank you both for that clarification Jessica I\nKind of agriculture\nIs incarcerated people but to to help them returned to society thank you both for that clarification Jessica I\nKind of agriculture for a moment\nWisconsin the dairy state has lost more than five hundred farm to cross the state here farmers the record low prices for milk or driving them out in the\nEye tentative new trade deal with Canada and Mexico promises to open new markets for dairy farmers but a serious problem or I mean there is simply too much milk being reduced to which they said in recent years has encouraged\nAs governor how would you remedy the issue of too much milk production and what steps can be taken in Wisconsin have family time governor we became a\nCritic thanks Jessica well this is a serious issue we're talking about for some time I was out the world dairy expo which just out with a bunch of farm groups who endorses yesterday in ... county I Know having grown up with a mom who grew up on a farm and farming is more than just a job it's a way of life for a lot of our farm families and they're hurting\nAnd I was happy to work with the president a year and a half ago to say that the the problems in Canada were causing a lot of farmers to get cut off from groups like grass and and so it was so pleased with the president held out to the very end to make sure those changes were made to open up more markets\nThat jak plaster salary plague and papa that's awful that was one thing like throw their showing it over and over here by now yeah and I get it the lifeguard I looks like there was I mean like even\nHeld the guy still wasn't good enough on the plate before that that was okay that was the penalty from before the ...

I was going to say I I didn't know you can lay the ball down\nDown I tend to yeah they went to the right side of not not quite a sweet but they went to the right side of the line on at first I lost a yard with Adrian Peterson and I think they're going to run and here again make Dallas used at least their second time out and then the question of its third in like eleven\nIf you're Alex Smith you may you sounded like a screen or something or use some clock and potentially allow you to stay and bouncing\nWell even if they're going shark and right yeah I listen to what I was saying I I still think you are running the football yeah there and I'll say it was\nJust a they decided to give it to the back well I guess that wasn't the worst place\nI got out for yards on it and so there is another time out some time off to you I mean he danced around here so I mean\nSo the question is here on third down I think 'cause it it's thirty nine Dallas has one time out left one twenty six to go first down into the game if you're Washington you can run it likely knock it the first time make Dallas used their last time out in Dallas would have about how in the play is let's say one Seventeen one Eighteen or so to go\nAnd what's the word you are on the football field Dallas should have not ... not terrible field edition but we need to go to get feel range probably fifty plus yards at least\nOr DU again be risky or do you trust Alex Smith veteran quarterback to not make a mistake and throughout his career he's the guy that does not Mr mistake so do you trust him to throw the football I think you throw the football\nI think they're going to do something similar I guess zone replay or just let him roll out and try to scramble\nYeah so I think it's going to be wrong with an option to dump it off the back or something like that to say about\nThat for sure path for where the always the complete opposite he's\nHere we go there is no straight but drop back out of the shock to an allergist gonna run out yeah he's going to run it himself is he going to get to the first down he's going to be short and out of town that's the mistake though that you are yeah that's what he knows that's bad on Alex Smith you've got to stay in balance\nThat's bad\nBut it was not a bad boy I mean they actually took off a decent amount of Clark to just stay in towns\nYou got to get out of bounds yeah 'cause you're right that would have got about they would've been a year or two yards side of the first down and the clock would roll to Dallas would use a timeout\nSo here you you don't get the first down in Dallas is enough to use on it that's the worst case scenario is if you're if you're gonna pass it you'd better get the first down if you're going to run it you know and it was a pass by billions of run it you got to make sure you make Dallas use the the last time out so here we go wash them punched the football back to Dallas\nDallas is going to get a return about the thirty six yard line they're going to have at their own thirty six one online to go by the time out and all they get a field but once I got a touchdown do there's plenty of time here and\nNow they're ... I think that was just a bad movie oh man he's a timeout ... I'm not even sure would it be a huge difference during the fields in Dallas has they don't have to get snow but you are but with a time out you can not just in this first play of course you can work at the state and bounds perjury was about ...\nYeah I mean not just on this first play you could even without a time that you could work the middle of the field but now you're going to be at work the middle feel for the whole drive because you're not even if you complete while in this ... you're not gonna use the time out on even if you complete one for eight yards here you don't have to use the time out to to stop the clock\nSo ... of course they're going to go out of shock on here and it's tipped any parent and dangerous pass their nearly intercepted by Washington's that stops the clock but a second then than one oh four to go in the ball game\nA year and it's tipped any hair and it changed race at their nearly intercepted\nBy watching that stops the clock but a second and than one oh four to go in the ball game\nAnd you had to ask that mistake you know if he returned back people won't remember it as much but number he followed the football in the end zone it was recovered by Washington for a touchdown that that was really the the play of the games at this point in time and somehow Dallas's fought their way back from that\nOr were they were down by a ten points and here we are it's a three point margin with the one oh four to go and they're facing a second uh ten from their own thirty six yard line Dallas on a\nBy next week if they could win this they would have had in the first place walk and trying to get in the first place somebody eagles lost today that press got taken a shot he had a man just\nOverthrows who was that cold be easily yes cold Beasley would've put them in red skins territory so you're going to third and ten fifty nine seconds or so to go with one time out but a shame if they have the right place to Adam\nAdam Adam open they're just overthrew Colby usually a little bit right let's take a quick break come back we'll probably have the finish of this one it between Washington in Dallas it's NFL rush\nKnowing where it's harder to help you achieve your goals we know how challenging and rewarding farming and this way of life can be you won't find financial experts with more knowledge in the rural route we grew up here many of us are farm kid through and through where do you have one in\nThousand whether you're building a house or a legacy\nAnd neighbors that company or financial have you back\nAnd we're ready to champion we're all together\nLearned more income here dot com company or financial equal credit opportunities lender\nIf you are behind on your bills than this messages for you how\nWould you like to have a large portion of your credit card debt or medical bills forgiven national credit card relief would like to give you free information on a proven debt forgiveness program it's not bankruptcy it's not consolidation this special program actually wiped clean the portion of your debt that is forgiven goal for your\nFree forgiveness information now eight hundred to like one six six or seven new that's eight hundred and two knowing one six six seven oh don't wait call eight hundred to nine one six six seven oh not available in North Dakota\nThe market's up that phrase is music to the ears of livestock and grain producers but there's more to it than just the direction of the market\nGash live stock markets are like a good puzzle\nPieces missing the puzzles worthless slaughter estimates the value of feed grains whether exporting wholesale demand or all pieces of the puzzle round the old veteran livestock reporter Jerry has or has been covering livestock market since Nineteen sixty six and knows what information is important producers when it comes to the markets let Jerry pastor put the pieces together for you round the\nBad news for America ... nine forty W W\nNot complaining high scores more of a social thing even though all these years has asked I had that long to have my age\nOr even during getting known if he already thinking is to\nDown near you finish ... or ... or ... general later the foundation and the ad council [noise]\nI'm voting in the midterm elections because my ...
