I don't know about I'm Sorry I didn't mean to put you on their eyes it up\nAnd we didn't even planted but this is what I was going to talk about here I suffered the worst beat and gambling I've ever had in my life this weekend and and I've been gambling or you know for a decent amount of years now\nI was ... I had the over in the Ohio State game and that was brutal Ohio State\nObviously it's brutal if you're in Ohio State than I was watching what that Ohio State then\nBut over sixty seven and a half I Believe the score was Twenty one to six going into the fourth quarter Twenty one day sick now maybe I could be wrong about that but there was there was well below\nSixty seven and a half going into the fourth quarter\nWell below and I'm sitting there and I remember the point in time after like the second untouched rushing touchdown or produce they had three untouched rushing touchdowns of like twenty five yards are more in that fourth quarter and I remember thinking to myself man like there there came a point where I was like I got to really start worrying about this\nI mean I was sitting there just cruise in like having a good time\nPerson next to without having a good time and she's a lot of states that but I'm sitting there like I got to pretend to kind of beyond your level but really I'm happy because my ... and then at the end of the night we ended up being on the exact same level like I went when the Purdue boiler makers got an interception for a touchdown as the final\nJoined it goes right off the upright but it was a defensive battle between the ravens and the saints Drew Brees during his five hundred touchdown pass\nSo we had this like pendulum back and forth what was going to give the ravens defense or the state's off it's like something had to give and that game actually turned in do what I was hoping for like it turned into a defensive battle the state's defense depressed me today man\nLike I mean going on the road like state which I bought the most often is somewhat limited okay I understand that but\nThe state ... it was not good at the beginning of the year\nI don't know what it is with them like last year it was the same thing like that that Britain was gay but what was the forty eight to whatever it was the wife is Patrick ... so they do the same thing last year and they just they seem to catch on to states defense remind me of the patriots fetch it'll a ball of overtime like don't don't you know what you see one two three four\nIt from the patriots opposite stops one is going to be later in the season same with the New Orleans saints deep and that's a good teams do by the way they do a ball of overtime and so that's why we got a fantastic in there\nAnd then of course the Redskins and the cowboys\nI mean that was a great game too it was a great defensive battle so I\nCan watch any kind of football the NFL gave me everything I Want it I got the Kansas City chiefs and the rams if I Want to my office of firepower and then I got the classic defensive and it wasn't bad football like it like that like you know is bad football today did you see over time of the buccaneers into brown that was bad football\nBut that was that was horrible it was that was one of those games where your watch your like nobody wants to win like it was just punch back to port yet interception or the browns intercepted James within that kept trade I mean I was going in that they can like this is going I kept saying to the person I mean I was sitting on the couch next to Bobby I was like this going to be a tie\nThis there's no doubt in my mind is going to be a tie\nAnd then I can kind of what what's the kick his name or three for ... Tampa Bay he missed an extra point he must uh thirty nine yards boom that guy is a fifty nine you order\nOut of nowhere just didn't like what what is going on with us today just in talk or this is an extra points for Baltimore and we had a ton of bears his that's his name I don't even know the Tampa Bay kicker missing thirty nine or feel goals and extra points and then that guy Mr fifty nine you order to win the game what is\nThe NFL is just absolutely crazy a balmy what is the biggest problem with Dallas his office right now I Know I'm all over the place we're gonna go round the NFL next but for the first segment I just want to kind of hop around\n... is it is that that first got to me to not look horrible today there were his moments where he looked at obvious like there was a path to his ... out of the backfield that was thrown out his ankles a ... but ... Elliott was there a is it coaching is it the offensive line is it injury is it that\nWhat is the biggest problem with Dallas his office right now man\nI think it is the coaching in the system that that is in I mean you look at his rookie year I mean he ... not many teams had tape on them and he was thrown about today is adjacent when he had receivers uh there were capable of taking over the gangs and doing the work and he could just hide behind the scenes and be dead\nBut this year they say he's back when you have to be the guy has to be the main attraction is\nSo weird because if you were to tell me these numbers that these wide receivers had today I Would have told you adapt numbers I Would have told you down with one of the game no problem\nMichael Gallup had eighty one yard touchdown Allen urged catches Seventy ... Kobe's like seven fifty six years that's fine\nLike that's probably the best ... production that down says receiving corps hats but they can't put it all together because as he kill Eliot pet Fifteen cares for thirty three are now you've got to give a lot of credit to the Redskins the Redskins or the that foreign to team that nobody knew was good but it's actually good\nThat I was like seriously I came into this year Bobby and I said the residents were going to finish in last place and I was pretty confident about that was like what we're going to see like mediocre Alex ... everybody on Washington I watched the whole game everybody on Washington is above average\nEvery single unit except for Adrian Peterson that guy has resurrected his ... can I get around a boss for Adrian Peterson I mean my goodness twenty four carry Ninety\nNine yards [noise] on a day where you ... did\nNot play I liked that Adrian Peterson seems was resurrected his career so look but uh but tell me a unit on the Redskins that is not good\nThat is not performing well nobody's great this is how I feel that this is my honest view of what the rest nobody's great Alex Smith is not a great quarterback Alex Smith did not get the two hundred yards he was fourteen to twenty five one Seventy eight one touchdown but he's the silent\nHe's just a fish it but everybody does their job you know they said do your job I feel like that's what the Washington Redskins are\nAnd so they beat the Dallas Cowboys today twenty to Seventeen where we come back we'll give you our top five games of Sunday oh it's a big sports nut over the net\n[noise] this is pushing the tribes [noise]\nOf [noise] ...

Manny hero lead Asian radio radio\n... videos here's Matt Harris and welcome back and this is over the Nigerian SB Nation radio that here is back\nWith us jump into the NFL weekend that was with Ryan van ... the NFL editor of the nation you can follow all of Ryan's work on Twitter at just ... beach okay so it was it was something we were talking about earlier in the ... you know the NFL made a rule change a couple of years ago and we're going to take these extra points and we're going to put 'em ten yards back\nBasically because we wanted extra points to not just be gimme so obviously this ravens game and then sort of missed extra points\nI said I'll ask you just as a general football fan do you like the way this rule is the fact\nThat it's we're ... we're all locked on our TV for every extra point now because kicking his now more of a challenge for two years did you like it the old way we're basically extra points wore a Jimmy you knew you were going to get that one point pretty much no matter what if you scored a touchdown how do you like you're a football game\nI like it and I find with the rule change I mean I you know I did not not often I agree with Bill ballot jak but you know he raised a pretty good point when he started these things are just\nAutomatic I think he was he you know in favor of making it even more draconian or uh or or you know eliminating it altogether which you know there's probably a case to be made there but I mean I I don't think I'm okay with it just because\nIt does make a little harder and it hasn't exactly I mean you know you're still seeing kicker is get what Ninety three Ninety four percent of the extra points that I Know it's been a bad year for kicker is but you know you you still got its you know not a given but mostly automatic I'm Still a believer that should be going for to most of the time anyway\nBut yeah I mean you know that that's kind of the the way it shakes out sometimes\nI thought these afternoon grains would just fantastic uh saint speeding the ravens twenty ... twenty three and then of course the Redskins being the cowboys twenty to Seventeen you know we talk and and I felt this year specifically about how the quarterback play has been great all of these points\nBut deep bench of late today I thought we got a really good sleep four o'clock games what was your biggest takeaway from the saints ravens game mine was have the same deep and it's not all that bad as we know that Drew Brees it'd be going on around the Baltimore stuff but\nI was just generally surprised at how well the same ... played today what was your thoughts on that game\nI liked that a lot you know another thing I really like to see what was just how aggressive\nThey were forced down call oh yeah we talk\nSo much last year about Doug Peterson in the eagles being aggressive and obviously they want a Super Bowl with that mentality but you know Sean Payton [noise] they they didn't they weren't providing for five five five or six I mean on those\n... you know fourth down at camp for the same today and they miss they got all but one of 'em and you know even on a first drive of the game they didn't they didn't end up getting any points to show for it but they still for nine minutes on the clock I mean that's nine more meant that\nYou know a nine minute drive that you know four or five minutes more than the ravens events wanting to be out on the field for that and I'm not a good way to be you know when you're playing a deep sense like Baltimore [noise]\nThe best in the league by any measure you know that's how you got to do it you can't play conservative against the group like that and the things off and probably asleep is not an oncology should be playing conservative with anyway so I I really like to see that I think that's a nice little preview of what we're going to see as we get you know down the stretch of the season and the January with some of these teams\nRyan van ... is our gas he's an NFL now editor in SB Nation you can follow Brian work on winter at just over the beach\nSo how good do you think these Redskins are I'm telling you I think they're really just kind of sneaky boring to team they kind of came out of nowhere at least for me I I honestly when this season started writes I had that lasted a division so I could not have been completely wrong when it comes to the NFC is\nWhat do you think is what do you think it's the Redskins stealing this year\nI'm not really sure to be honest with you I mean you know you got to give them credit for and you're like you say there are there are the top of the heat spending enough the east or not the\nYou know the eagles don't have a winning record the giants don't have a winning record the cowboys don't have a winning record that the division that's kind of\nWide open can go a lot of different directions but you know you can you got to give them credit obviously you know Jay group who's going to call a good often game anyway you saw that with Adrian Peterson I you know one thing I enjoyed about\nThe broadcast today was just you know the how much they pointed out how different Adrian Peterson is a now much more productivity is running out of the shock on like that you certainly have seen that\nWith him and he's been a big part of their off and probably you know I think most people just kind of assume this guy was just going to come in there and and you know keep the seat warm at the running back position all season but it's it's a lot and become a lot more than a defensive you\nKnow they're not a lot of household names on that beat them but they get the job done don't that\nThat's absolutely sure I can honestly do other than just normal I mean who is the household so when it comes to the other side near the cowboys attack Prescott you know what it is with statistical one of his better games was twenty to thirty five two hundred Seventy three yards but it's equal\nOh it was shut down when you look at the cowboys off what is the problem is it jak is it the lack of play makers coaching what do you think is one of the central problem was white Dallas's off into the popping right now\nWell I think the biggest thing for me without the offensive line injuries obviously it starts with Travis Frederick center that's a huge huge huge position I mean that's the question is that the quarterback of the offensive line and to not have a guy like that out there\nHe makes a huge difference in the running game and you see that from you know the the swings you get from week to week with that grew apart from planet earth I mean these these are great receivers ... you saw that they had a great game except for you know that ... in the end zone that resulted in a Redskin cuts down down there but\nUm other than that he had a really pretty nice game you know you've just putting putting the ball or needed to be they kind of got to play action going again even though the running wasn't\nWasn't all that productive but you know you just don't have you've just got kind of spare parts to fill in the receiving corps and that's not going to work you need a more reliable option 'cause it gets the ball and get some ... and getting them catch the bombing in them with some reliability and they don't have\nThat right yeah and it don't have consistency with it either Ryan ... is our guest a NFL editor and SB Nation you can follow all of riots work once winter adjust RV be so do you point to authentic wind injuries as the main reason why Jacksonville is often has been working right now or is it more of a plate mortals properly\nI you know the opposite of lying doesn't help\n'em but at the border of travel ... always been a Blake board of problem I mean sometimes\nThey can cover it up with a you\nKnow with a good running game and an aggressive defense but it's just not you know we saw that last year getting in the playoffs even let you know you you can't even on their better days they really can't play from behind when you have white portals like quarterback I Can't\nI mean I I you know for such a good team to go out and and you know not only keyboard those but the doubled down with a contract extension this off season I just it's even more of a mystery today\nYeah no I totally am with you when it comes to the taxes they have not won four games in a row but honestly none of them had been convincing went to San walking was a great today\nSo I totally am with you when it comes to the taxes they have not won four games in a row but honestly\nNone of them have been convincing ... was a great while I was twenty four one thirty nine a touchdown were located down here in Houston I'm trying to figure out how they put together four straight wins with how bad of an office of why they have ... how good do you think this team really is\nYou know that they shouldn't be better on defense I mean I I Will say that they definitely have the talent on defense I mean you give them some slack because the offensive line is absolutely terrible that left tackle is\nYou know he leaves the league and\nPressures in hip allowed under Sean ... I'm honestly surprised the shah ... was out there on the field today given you know he was in there were so concerned about his lungs they had them ride to Jacksonville on a bus rather than fly on the plane so you know to to go to send them out there that you've got off the line I mean that was\nA little bit of a head scratcher to begin with but who else do they have I I mean\nI think below Brian in over his head I you know nothing in the season gets me any indication that he's you know he he sort of falling backwards into these women I mean you know the most obvious example in that drink as the Colts game I mean Frank writes gave it to them with that you know as a gutsy for the call but it basically gave the game the Texans to when I got\nGay jak like hey I just if I you know my my biggest memories of being on a bus\nBobby I was a I ... I was set in the back you know way back when I was on the bus you know all the way to school and everything\nI uh I\nI Me and my friends who are idiots and we would throw gum like chewed gum out the window at cars like all the way to school and so one of these days the one of the one time on a bus we we threw gum at a car that accidentally hit a ah\nUndercover cop car so that wasn't good so the undercover cop followed our boss which does aren't allowed to touch the Jacksonville\nI followed on line and\nHe took everybody who was on the bus and he ... he basically you know try to figure out who was throwing gum at the undercover cop car and I talked to a cause I was\nScared the intimidating but his ... was anybody else out of us weapons nobody else father to go on the bus with\nLot on and the bus driver the yellow school bus all the way down to Jacksonville well hey it worked for straight wins for the Texas\nYeah off its device you to get a little better so he doesn't have to take a bus at an ex road game seven eight\nNine ...

Texas coast to coast I'm here probably beat through the\nGlass all fell first hour we'll get into some other stuff you're a second hour including\nThe NBA suspension handed down\nAbout Lakers rockets game ... ... ... that was fun Lakers are raised on raw do did he spit or did he not spit on Chris Paul well the NBA said that he's fat\nAnd so they gave Brennan grab a four game suspension which I think there's a little light\nIf you saw Brenda then grim clearly instigating a on James Harden and I I heard land their line talk about this a ... a local cell a morning show and he said he was to all the news that tonight talking about how I think he was the one who was saying that it was a little bit late I agree with the board games what Britain did\nIt seems to be like a pretty white penalty pushing James Harden and then we actually had you know punches thrown a at a rocket Lakers game race on ... three game suspension and Chris Paul a two game suspension\nUm but I Do think that this is great for the NBA\nLook I said after the U.S the fight that what they the antics and everything that happened up fighting the punching all that stuff that happened after the U.S see what that did for me as in terms of casual fan was getting me more into the rematch\nI I Am going to be in front of the TV watching the ... and that's what you want if you run a sports organization you want people watching your product\nThat's sold me it's the casual fan I'm like okay I'm going to watch McGregor versus could be the next time okay I Am going to watch the Lakers and the rockets the next time that they play violence look\nWe all watch this this is sports okay violence habits and violence is entertaining and that's cool like I don't think it's great like I missed the NBA at the evidence and they don't have that like hate that it used to have like there is genuine have between like you know the bad boys of the pistons you don't like the eighties nineties viewing days Jordan teams and\nHe is the problem we all know that now when it comes to the Dallas Cowboys\nI think again similar problem different solution I'm watching this cowboys game today by the end ... was jak great no but jak is what he is deputy serviceable quarterback if you put jak\nOn the jaguars I don't think that I I think the jaguars get wet okay the jaguars have to be a slightly better what I don't know like when you watch Dallas is so confusing to me why jak press like is it jak Prescott like not holding the ball too long I think it's the weapons to play calling us he kill Eliot\nIt just did a average like to point to yards of carry today\nThe office of wind is a little bit in shambles but I'm going to defend jak man I just think that Jack is not getting the help that he needs properly when it comes to the Dallas Cowboys to twenty to thirty five two hundred Seventy three yards a touchdown for him today finally got the deep all going that was nice to see if you're a cowboys fan of Michael Gallup\nAllen hurts five catches Seventy four yards coal Beasley seven catches fifty six yard\nI Know the office of wind is bad but to me it's not that big of a ... problem now tell me if you see it differently though but\nI don't really see any differently I I just think the the coaching the Jason ... situation I mean you know he's he has a hall pass is is\nNot the same hall pass that Martin Luther does yeah those two guys just I don't know why they don't win and the play offs but then I feel like they're never going to be fired like the Bengals were horrible tonight that off as against Kansas City a team that was ... you know their their deepest it's been a store glee bad\nLike those two guys Martin Lewis adjacent ... what is it going to take for them to lose their job\nTo resign and resign honestly uh resigned from the drug\nOr the Dow says what one win and the play offs and the judge and Jason Garrett era and I don't think the Bengals have won when in the playoffs under the Martin Louis area do that not at all\nSo at some point you've got like again both of those these sports you do not want to be like above average I feel like both Dallas and Cincinnati have been steadily above average we can get to the playoffs but then it's a first round exit every single year\nYou want to either you want you to be really good in sports are really bad I feel like the cowboys and the bangles both are just steadily above average I really do\nPretty much I mean only ... for Jason geared will lose his job to me he has a ... in\nThe long as the coach and they seem a mediocre fashion bad one good year which was ... when they were very impressive but I mean they're just going to be mediocre I mean we know wow receiver big names in the ...\nThat that needs that unloaded look this is not a knock on debt ... say that he needs play backers okay just a Tom Brady this year Tom ... the patriots often struggled at the beginning of the season\nEven the great Tom Brady struggled without weapons it is not a knock on to say that a quarterback needs help\n[noise] okay it's not like Jack is just one of those guys and the ... the cold Beasley cannot be your number one guy are you going to really get eighty yards out a Gallup every single game I don't think so\nSo look I I just I I just [noise]\nAnd and it's not you should never take away you know from credit from a guy like Patrick bought homes I've heard this Patrick bones oh well if he didn't have Kelsey if you didn't have honey we don't take away credit to somebody who's doing a lot with a lot\nBut also looking back and say what what is he really working with here\nI mean ... ... ... pages or the day like today like the ... and again this is not all about Dallas here you've got to give a lot of credit to the Washington Redskins okay the Washington Redskins to me are a very very talented football team\nAnd they are just going to get better as the season goes along their foreign to I don't think anybody could have seen how good they are but Alex Smith but it it is not great Adrian Peterson difference was the Redskins were able to run the football today the tablets to not\nMajor Peterson a twenty four carries Ninety nine yards\nAnd they were able to run the football and my goodness pickers coming up next I'm going to have probably a question because kicker is had some issues to it was a weird day

everybody I really do I I liked the or\nThe v the match ups of I look to David Price put together two consecutive starts that that's still up their determination the red Sox just hit and hit and hit I

bullpen and I don't think it's even close\nThis strategy for the the the uh the Dodgers is going to be to work Chris Dale and work David Price take pitch it so they can get to the Boston bullpen which has been so shaky or over the course of the last month month and a half\nI I really do think they're going to do that and we're going to be a pretty good World Series that was I was like I was saying I was watching college football on Saturday Night I was at the Ohio State park because the person I was watching the uh the ... they came with big oil has said bad so I took her to the official Ohio

road against the Chicago Bears thirty eight to thirty one All right rich I Want to start obviously no ... no problems today or did you anticipate them having as good of an op ed today as they did without Rob Gronkowski today\nSo I think I mean I'm not sure do it as a way to put it they score twenty four points fourteen came up with special theme today um but I felt they moved the ball reasonably well especially out there last stoning Michelle today\nAnd I felt they could compensate for the lack of Gronkowski but they they're three running backs on the roster um Michelle's the lead back James White surpassed catcher\nThen the third string guy is you know a third string guy so I was impressed with the fact that you were able to put a twenty four points against a very good bears fan\nUm despite missing Michelle more than Gronkowski to cause a jar scored and I felt stepped up and kind of fill that void as a as a deep correct guy that grumpy really does different\nDifferent areas gory end on the perimeter bronco in the middle so\nWe do we have an update when it comes to Sony Michel on just how big of a lost ... lost moving forward\nAll right so ah you know thirty one coaches in a league would step up and tell you after the game with him you report is the pages of a woman\nOutlier running I I'm not going to\nTell you but I Will say this I'm Michelle ... at five or six days in a training camp\nA ended up having a media rained missed all the preseason rush the training camp and the first game and see them had ACL surgery in high school at a steel surgery in college\nI'm anytime knee issue is associated with Graham I'd be deeply concerned bay of serious depth issues there James White close a game of today\nHe's a path catcher he's not a runner per se so they're going to be looking for someone at the trade deadline I Would think you find most show they're going to bring up for a serious amount of time\nWhich is our guest covers the New England patriots but a telegram 'cause debt a patriots have big thirty eight thirty one victory over the Chicago Bears today New England improving the five and two on the season Josh Gordon bunch of targets today for catches a hundred yards\nA twenty yeah but I mean these are numbers that you can when it comes to the average per catch that you know we all think of John Gordon that going great year he had any damage twenty five years to catch specifically in this game today\nBut rich do you see Josh court and becoming\nA more heavily game plan for when it comes to the patriots offensively moving forward [noise]\nSo yeah I mean I think there's no doubt they're working that work in a man I mean\n... you know they've been experimenting with them so far it's kind of interesting because you know you're trying to win game\nBut there's no doubt that they're working him into the ... trying to get him integrated ahah a much higher look it's brutal for anybody to come in that time he did in the season I mean even the guy is talented as Josh\nBy you miss the old TA you miss Minnie camp you miss training camp English preseason game\nIt's just brutal could drop in for something like that and especially the patriots\nYou know the merger teams in the league go out and they do what they do and we're going to be consistent doubt it we're gonna make you stop us the patriots game plan differently for every week every your own and\nSo he's not only trying to drop into the system but trying to drop into a game plan system on a week by week basis so something you'd asked me\nTo do last week in Kansas City he's asked to do differently this week again Chicago and ah you know but the bottom line is is athletic talent show him through today I mean fifty five yard or but the other forty five year three catchers those average ... aren't the cat yeah\nThat's pretty impressive and I are the best catch was not the fifty five yard or but\nThe earlier one where he adjusted any air reach back and caught the ball in the air\nAnd a lot of guys or try to catch that ball with their chest and snatched jak thing out of there and that's why Brady\nThey're not on the same page don't get me wrong but Brady has trust in him like Randy ... and I'm not putting jar scored in the same class as Randy Moss right right but like ... or Randy Moss here state if there are a big target who can adjust the air and pull that ball and he's a little bit off\nHey rich I I was reading something or maybe I was watching something and I saw that they put ... Walker right next to Tom Brady do you think you're you're you're talking about trust and you're talking about all that stuff's it did ... did that on purpose right because they want to bring they bring it in just going to do die you know he's had some problems\nYou're talking about all that stuff's it did they did that on purpose right because they want to bring they bring it in John Cornyn do die you know he's had some problems in the past but I'm right next to Britain like I just thought that was such a brilliant move by just ... but I guess it was dollar check who make those decisions but\nWhat what were your thoughts when you say okay Josh ... gonna be next to Tom Brady in the wild that'll help them get close to right off the field and hopefully that helps the on air ... on a field product\nSo on\nAnd I can't completely buy into that what I Will say is that what's intriguing is that Randy Moss is\nLocked there was placed right next to a Tom Brady locker as well but there's been plenty of guys next to him that have been a you know they put it's more of a the patriots tend to structure their locker rooms around position\nSo when you get in the skill position players there's only so many available open spots\nAnd they didn't have made one or two spots across the way on it but\nYeah I mean I think there is a little bit set on that um but quite frankly I I've never seen the two guys in the locker room at the same time so that doesn't mean and are conversing when the media's not allowed in for it you know it's forty five minutes over at eight to ten hour day yeah but uh\nBut you know but I mean I Will say again Randy Moss as the last ... significant but I saw an extra Brady and you can kind of make a connection\nNo doubt about it rich carbon is our guest covers the New England patriots were the telegram cars that you can follow all of Bush's work on the winter that rich garbage Gigi I Want to go back to Sony Michel close that I heard Rob Gronkowski say I think that maybe it was a couple of weeks ago was\nThat you were talking about this with James why not being a traditional running back he's more guys catches the ball out of ... you said that the patriots play action game is going to improve you said just a couple of weeks ago the plants in passing game is going to prove over the improve over the week because\nIt's deep and just have to respect the inside running game how Sony Michel run have you seen that over the last couple of weeks specifically the deep end just having to respect Sony Michel\n[laughter] yeah so I wrote after three weeks into the season I wrote Michelle and how he was just basically brutal I mean it's like\nSo fifty percent of its carries when the three yards last twenty five percent went to one yard last I mean this is the Patriot don't deal with negative garbage\nAnd Michelle was the machine said that and you know you look at it and like okay you know you just into the game how long is it going to take them well he caught a fast\nYou know the last couple of weeks\nBoom you know you saw today Eighteen yard run on the first carry second uh second touch was a a reception for sixteen Seventeen yard something in that range\nSo he he's become an integral part of the ... in a very short period of time since ... again going back to the nice thing missed all almost except for five or six days a training camp missed all this summer plus the first week of this season\nWas miserable because Ohio State was losing so we were all this is why I don't like to gamble by ... I'd like to gamble by myself bodies because there is no like when you go to a casino because there's only one situation out of four where with your with your when you're with another person it's actually point you're both winning\nBut then there's you know if one person's winning one person's losing your both losing it's no fun\nItself because no one's haven't taught so it just in\nGeneral your guy and you want to go out and you want to watch a game but with your girl do better on the game\nBecause then it turns into a miserable night she was already after we all have different levels you know 'cause Ohio State was was losing the game and I was happy\nYou know because it until up until the fourth quarter I was doing fine it was going way under and then by the end of the game we were both sitting there and we were miserable and what ended up happening Bobby\nWas I was like I Am just I've never had a game like that and she looked at me and she's like I really don't care like your your pain that you're feeling right now I I don't care so because she was dealing with the pain of Ohio State losing there's no winning nobody wins if you go on a date unless you unless of course you and your ... foot there's one in four chance\nThat happens so you know it turned into it kind of it well it turned into a great died at the end of the type of stress overnight evidence for [noise]\nNine forty WMA W born Afghans\nAnd online at nine forty WMA use on the off [noise]\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News\nWhere do you draw\nFrom ABC News\nCoverage or cancer who submitted five thousand Honduran migrants intent on getting to the U.S are now in southern Mexico ABC's met government is following\nThere are women and children here the elderly marching along with the young men and many of them carrying just couldn't bare essentials\nA plastic bag with some food and maybe a change of clothes\nMany than say they want to keep walking not just passed this next town up top but you are but it's Seventeen hundred miles they had a new report to the United states\nIn a series of tweets President Trump again lashed out against the care of\nU.S Geological survey says there's been two big earthquakes about a hundred miles off the coast of Canada is Vancouver Island one was six point eight in magnitude the other six point six the too far offshore to have any major impact surely experts a nose to nominee is expected as well\nTampa hosted the first Florida gubernatorial debate Democrat Andrew Gillum Tallahassee mayor hit Republican former Congressman Ron dissent those on that record\nHe spent six years in Congress and while in the majority party in Congress never pass a single piece of legislation and all that interested in governing he's interested in destroying dissenters counter to kill them has ... who's in his record as well or\nMayor ... leadership Tallahassee is the most crime ridden city and the entire state of Florida last year Tallahassee had the highest number of murders in the history of the city early\nVoting begins Monday and many Florida counties New York city police department to stop using one particular model of body cam after one of them started smoking before an officer shipped on Saturday unclear how many other police departments are also using this one camera\nIn a statement to manufacture of daily five says we're working closely with the NYPD to investigate this issue the officer was not injured however officer safety is the most important to the axon we will do whatever's necessary to quickly and safely resolve this situation the officers ... immediately remove it when he saw smoke\nMaybe so you're ... you're listening to ABC News\nEver wonder why European seem to speak so many languages maybe it's because they use battle the number one selling language learning habanero battles award winning technology gets you speaking right away whether you're learning Spanish French or German and best of all if you remember what you've learned and\nI always thought I was bad at languages but after using battle I can tell you I was just taught the wrong way\nUsing battles ten to Fifteen minute lesson you can be speaking confident linger new language within weeks I was amazed\nThat I could start having real nice conversation right away which so sad and now I'm speaking Spanish\nNo wonder battle is the number one selling language learning happen euro tried for yourself can see why battle is the quick way to get conversational in a new language like Spanish French were more you can try babble for free and go to battle dot com or download the app and try and for free\nThat battle B a B B.

F. L. changed the rule a couple of years ago to move the kick back ten yards they want it did not to be a gimme so my question to you Bobby is obvious you or not\nAn you are an impartial observers euro Texans fan and I'm an impartial observers okay I think if I had a raven color on right now one eight hundred seven seven seven to nine zero seven or ravens fan\nObviously you would say this is a bad rule it should be a gimme okay St Spencer loving this do you like\nIn the NFL that we literally had a game decided we I don't think we've had that since the rule change again decided on a missed extra point\nBecause again that's like it's just like the Dallas get if you move that intent yards it goes in and Justin Tuck it was funny like Justin Tucker was look he was genuinely shocked\nHe looked at in the broadcasters even said is there like he thought he kicked it correctly\nLike you know like we we there's the you know off the foot you know like you know off the bat if you hit a home run there's a saying like that I feel like kick his know off the foot if they kicked it well and Justin Tucker thought he kicked it while there's a kicking the Kansas City chiefs game tonight to that just the wind kind of took it and my dad is you know he lives back in D.C\nWhen we were talking after the game and he's like you know it was a windy day here very windy day so that could have affected the kicking down could affect the kick in Baltimore but let's get back to this do you like that the NFL extra points are not gimme\nOh yeah it's more challenging for the kicker I mean since the rule change happen this is probably been at least I Want to say just to estimate like thirty to thirty five extra points ms yeah or maybe more\nSo do you like your football game that ... that they're not going to be like OK before it used to be argued score test and you get them for\nIt yeah I'm On a lot of course I mean in especially like in a tight knit close ball game like the Redskins and cowboys was he was a measure of the ...\nOr ... and that's just a magistrate ravens yeah same game you know they scored a touchdown a bull headed down\nAnd you know kick have to point oh we've got a ball game is a tie game yeah ... ... with the St or we're going over time you already planning ahead is going to be over time and now the extra point move back ... you know a couple of years now\nIt's not a new ad is showing up and be an ass\nPlanning ahead is going to be over time but now the extra point move back for you know a couple of years now\nI mean it's not a new ad is it should be an ads drama is ... which is I'm always in favor of adding drama here's why I like it okay to reason it adds drama I've always been favor when I'm watching sports of more drama more drama more drama more drama okay\nThey it's it's great but also it adds value to a position\nOkay you need to have a good kicker on your team you do a you know what we see two pickers get fired already this year or the good guy and Cleveland can't make kicks a Mason Crosby would have if if it makes a cross was a rookie he would have gotten can you\nDo with the question about it but I like this you know the raven fan today will not like it but just a Turner I mean what are the odds of that happening I never missed an extra point his career and the one that you need to make\nAnd this is huge Bobby beats because look that asked the south or the excuse me that has the north I really thought Baltimore was the best team I really did Cincinnati is now becoming the bank the bangles are gonna bongo okay for the rest of the the the\nLady on bell coming back I mean look this deal this division is up for grabs man it really really is every single team and that division launched the Steelers are happy happy campers on their by week this week\nAnd I don't know what the deal with way beyond bell is but the Steelers find themselves in first place having not played a football game this weekend\nThat the bangles losing the ravens was the only team that doesn't have at least three losses in the division so that team that division totally up for grabs but I'm with you it adds drama and it adds position will value you need to have a good kicker I when you come back\nWhen we come back Philadelphia Eagles absolute misery for them today so within [noise]\nThis is that then is being put bullshit CJ bathroom did more than

auto parts use\nYears met here of the men welcome back and this is over the night here on every nation radio Matt Harris back with us jumped into the NFL weekend that was with Ryan van ... had SB Nation you can follow all of Ryan's\nWork on Twitter that just are the beads okay so why is it something we were talking about earlier in the ... you know the NFL made a rule change a couple of years ago and we're going to take these extra points and we're going to put 'em ten yards back basically because we wanted extra points to not just to be gimme so obviously this ravens game and then sort of missed extra points\nI was to outlast you just as a general football fan do you like the way this rule was the fact that it's we're ... we're all locked on our TVs for every extra point now because taking his\nNow more of a challenge or do you did you like it the old way we're basically get extra points wore a Jimmy you knew you were going to get at one point pretty much no matter what if you scored a touchdown how do you like your football game\nLike it and I I mean I'm fine with the rule change I mean I you know I tend to not often I agree with\nBill ballot jak but you know you raised a pretty good point when he thought the finger automatic I mean he was the you know in favor of making it even more draconian or or or or you know eliminating it altogether which you know there's probably a case to be made there but\nI mean I I don't think I'm okay with it because it does make a little harder at it hasn't exactly I mean you know\nYou're still seeing triggers get what Ninety three Ninety four percent of the extra points that I Know it's been a bad year for a kicker but you know you're you're still got you know not a given but mostly automatic I'm Still a believer that should be going for her to most of the time anyway\nYeah I mean you know that that's kind of the the way it shakes out sometimes\nI thought these afternoon Graham's were just fantastic said feeding the ravens twenty ... twenty three and then of course the Redskins being the cowboys twenty to Seventeen you know we talk in the NFL this year specifically about how the quarterback play has been great all of these points\nBut defensively to day I thought we got a really good late of four o'clock games what was your biggest takeaway from the saints ravens game mine was have the same deep and it's not all that bad we know that Drew Brees I was going on there on a Baltimore stuff but\nI was just generally surprised at how well the same defense play today what was your thoughts on that game\nI like that a lot you know another thing I really like to see what was your how aggressive they were with\nFourth down ... oh yeah we talked so much last\nYear about Doug Peterson an eagles being aggressive and obviously they want a favorable with that mentality but you know ... they they didn't they weren't arriving war five five five or six I mean on those\nNice horse down attempt for the same today and they meant they got all but one of them and you know even on the earth drive of the game they didn't they didn't end up getting any points to show for it but I don't burn nine minutes on the clock I mean not nine more meant that\nNo one nine minute drive that you know four or five minutes more than the ravens events wanting to be out on the field today and I'm not a good way to be you know when you're playing a deep and it's like all the more\nThe best in the league by any measure you know that's how you got to do it you can't play conservative against the group like that and I think the problem\nIn the sense like Baltimore the best in the league by any measure you know that's how you got to do it you can't play conservative against the group like that um if things off and probably asleep is not an nonsense you should be playing conservative with anyway so I I really like to see that I think that's a\nNice little preview of what we're going to see as we get you know down the stretch of the season and then in the January with some of these\nTeams Ryan van ... is our guest is an NFL now editor in as the nation you can follow all of rice work on winter it's just or the beach so how do you think these Redskins are I'm telling you I think there is like a really just kind of sneaky boring to team they kind of came out of nowhere at least for me I I honestly when this season started Ryan I had the last\nOf the debate it so I could not have been completely wrong when it comes to the ...\nWhat do you think is what do you think it's the Redskins stealing this year\nI'm not really sure to be honest with you I mean you know you got to give them credit for and you like you say there there are the top of the heat pending in the east or not\nYou know the eagles don't have a winning record the giants and I have a winning record the cowboys don't have a winning record that's a decision that's kind of wide open can go a lot of different directions but you know you can you give them credit obviously you know Jay ... going to call a good offensive game anyway you saw that with Adrian Peterson I you know one thing I enjoyed about\nThe broadcast today was just you know the how much they pointed out how different Adrian Peterson is and how much more productive years running out of the shock on like that you certainly have seen that\nWith him he's been a big part of their off and probably don't you know most people just kind of assumed this guy was just going to come in there and and you know keep the seat warm at the running back position all season but it's it's a lot and become a lot more than a defensive\nYou know there's not a lot of household names on that beeping but they get the job done don't that\nThat's absolutely true I Can't honestly do other than Josh Norman I mean who is the household so when it comes to the other side near the cowboys attack Prescott you know what it was to typically one of his better games was twenty or thirty five two hundred Seventy three yards but as he kill Alia was shut down when you look at the\nCowboys off that what is the problem is it is a lack of play makers isn't coaching what do you think is one of the central problem was wide Dallas as often as a popping right now\nWell I think the biggest thing for me with Dallas has the offensive line that juries obviously it starts with Travis Frederick center that's a huge huge huge position I mean that's the cliche is the the quarterback of the offensive line and to not have a guy like that out there\nHe makes a huge difference in the running game and you see that from you know the the swings you get from week to week with that grew\nApart to play makers I mean these these are great receivers ... you saw that day had a great game except for you know that myth in the end zone that resulted in a red skins down down there but um other than that he had to really pretty nice game you know you've just putting putting the ball where it needed to be the kind of got to play action going again even though the running wasn't\nWasn't all that productive but you know you just don't have you've just got kind of spare parts to fill in the receiving corps and that's not going to work you need more reliable auction to get the ball and get some yards for you and getting past the bombing in them with some reliability and they don't have\nThat right now man I don't have consistency with it either Ryan ... is our guest a NFL editor and SB Nation you can follow Brian's workman's winter it just started the beach so do you point too often said wind injuries as the main reason why Jacksonville is often isn't working right now or is it more of a Blake board all properly\nI you know off into line doesn't help 'em but at the Blake board of problem ... always been a Blake ... problem I mean\nSometimes they can cover it up with a you know with a good running game and an aggressive defense but it's just not you know we saw that last year getting in the playoffs even let you know you can't even on their better days they really can't play from behind when you have like portals like quarterback I Can't\nI mean I you know for such a good team to go out and and you know not only keyboard all but the doubled down with a contract extension this off season I just it's even more of a mystery today\nYeah no I totally am with you when it comes to the fact that they have not won four games in a row but honestly none of them have been convinced they went to San ... was a great while the twenty four one thirty nine a touchdown were located down here in Houston I'm trying to figure out how they put together four straight wins without bad of an office of why they have\n... how do you think this team really is\nYou know it might be better on defense I mean I I Will say that they definitely have the talent on the fence I mean you give him some slack because up into line is absolutely terrible that left tackle is you know he leads the league and pressure then hits\nAllowed on the show I'm ... I'm honestly surprised the shah ... was out there on the field today given you know he was in there were so concerned about his lungs they had them ride to Jacksonville on a bus rather than fly on the team plane so you know to to go to send them out there is that even with that off the line I mean that was\nA little bit of it had scratched to begin with but who else do they have I I mean\nI think Brian's in over his head I you know nothing I can turn in the season\nGives me any indication that he you know we eat sort of falling backwards into these wins I mean you know the most obvious example in that drink coke gay I mean Frank writes gave it to them with that you know as a gutsy for the phone call but it basically gave the game to the Texans to when I got\nI mean the raptors are\nThree

Baltimore's off into somewhat limited okay I understand that but the same defense was not good at the beginning of the year I don't know what it is with them like last year it was the same thing like the the\nIn Orleans gave up what was the forty eight to whatever it was the right fit faster every day so they do the same thing last year and they just they seem to catch on to states defense reminds me of the patriots off at ... over time like don't don't you know what you see one two three four\nIt from the patriots often times when I was going to be later in the state that same with the New Orleans saints deep and that's what good teams do by the way though\nThey do have all over time and so that's why we got a fantastic game there\nAnd then of course the Redskins and the cowboys\nI mean that was a great game too it was a great defensive battle so I\nCan watch any kind of football the NFL gave me everything I Want it I got the Kansas City chiefs and the rams if I Want to my office of firepower and then I got the classic defensive and it wasn't bad football like like like you know is bad football today did you see over time of the buccaneers into brown that was bad football\nBut that was that was horrible it was that was one of those games where your watch your like nobody wants to win\nLike it was just punch back and forth yet interception or the browns intercepted James went then I kept trading I mean I was going in that thinking like this is going I kept saying to the person I mean I was sitting on the couch next to Bob they always like there's going to be a tie\nThis there's no doubt in my mind is going to be a tie and then I can kind of ... what what's the ... his name uh for for the Tampa Bay he missed an extra point he missed the thirty nine yards boon that guy is a fifty nine you order out of nowhere just didn't like what what is going on with pickers today just in Tucker misses\nYou know in your book and that kind of fifty nine you order out of nowhere just didn't like what what is going on with her today just didn't talk or Mrs an extra point for Baltimore and we had a ton of bears his that's his name I don't even know the Tampa Bay kicker missing thirty nine or feel go that extra points and then that guy Mitt to fifty nine you ought to win the game\nWhat is the hell is just absolutely crazy a\nBalmy what is the biggest problem with Dallas the dolphins right now I Know I'm all over the place we're going to go around and got up on next but for the first step when I just want to kind of ...\n... is it is that that press got to me to not look horrible today there were his moments where he looked at obvious like there was a path to a deal out of the backfield that was thrown out his ankle a ... but it ... Elliott was there a is it coaching is it the offensive line is it injury is it that\nWhat is the biggest problem with Dallas is often right now I'm In\nI think it is the coach in in the system that back then I mean you look at his rookie year I mean he ... not many teams had table on them he was talking about today is a adjacent when he had receivers uh there were capable of taking over the gangs and doing the work and he could just hide behind the scenes and be back\nBut this year they say they use that to be the guy has to be the main attraction is\nSo weird because if you were to tell me these numbers that these wide receivers had today I Would have told you adapt Stanford I Would have told you Dallas one of the game no problem\nMichael Gallup had eighty one yard touchdown Eleanor it's five catches Seventy ... Kobe's like seven fifty six year that's fine like that's probably the best ... production that down says receiving corps had\nBut they can't put it all together because as he kill Eliot pet Fifteen cares for thirty three are now you got to give a lot of credit to the Redskins the Redskins are those that foreign to team that nobody knew was good but it's actually good\nThat I I was like seriously I came into this year Bobby and I said the residents were going to finish in last place and I was pretty confident about that was like what we're going to see like mediocre Alex ... everybody on Washington I watch the whole game\nEverybody on Washington is above average every single unit except for Adrian Peterson that guy has resurrected historic and I get around it bought for Adrian Peterson I mean my goodness twenty four carry Ninety\nNine yards [noise] on a day where yes Thompson\nDid not play I liked that Adrian Peterson seems towards resurrected his career so look but uh but tell me a unit on the Redskins that is not good\nThat is not performing well nobody's great this is how I feel that this is my honest view of what the ... nobody's great Alex Smith is not a great quarterback Alex Smith did not get the two hundred yards he was fourteen to twenty five one Seventy eight one touchdown but he's the silent\nHe's just a fish it's like everybody does their job you know they said do your job I feel like that's what the Washington Redskins are\nAnd so they beat the Dallas Cowboys today twenty to Seventeen when we come back we'll give you our top five games of Sunday oh it's a big sports nut over the ...\nIs a sports right this was when I\nSaid what Dan Rogers before I leave that no I just think that when you look at\nThe deed for him because he has to do better than I understand I keep seeing couch in their hand is one of the best young all friends of mine in the NFL today [noise] but if you look at Aaron Rodgers defense\nEach each it in him not being a hundred percent and he's not going to be a hundred percent the rest of the year that I really think there's deterrence is probably going to come back to bite them and ask and I don't know of it I mean even if you look at the division that they plan you look at your Chicago Bears\nI'm looking at the Minnesota via ... I'm Still going to think I Would like to see you Minnesota the benefit of the doubt because they won the division from last year the Minnesota is still the better team the best team in that division talent wise on both sides of the bomb Chicago is right there on them\nTuned into the sports right now we have from three to five Easter and not only on as a nation radio\nStations were just talking about six minutes upsetting the Orioles for\nThose also the same year the ingest enough sense the Baltimore Colts that's right the Mets won the world series in eighty six though to the giants so it looks like he wanted to just of the ... you got to put all your money into the Mets the Mets the Mets and Yankees the Yankees were\nMeant to lock it in the medical ... he he gets the nation I Am with Jodie weekday mornings from six to nine eastern contest re nation radio [noise]\nThis is pushing the God [noise]\n[noise] ...

this is over the night here and in the nation radio Matt Harris back with us jump into the NFL weekend that was with Ryan van of February the NFL editor head\nSB Nation you can follow Bryant's work on Twitter at just RV beat okay so it was something we were talking about earlier in the ... you know the NFL made a rule change a couple of years ago and we're going to take these extra points and we're going to put them ten yards back\nBasically because we wanted extra points when the not just be gimme so obviously the ravens game and then sort of missed extra point\nI'll ask you just as a general football fan do you like the way this rule is the fact\nThat it's over ... were locked on our TV for every extra point now because kicking his now more of a challenge or do you did you like it the old way where basically the extra points wore a Jimmy you knew you were going to get that one point pretty much no matter what if you scored a touchdown how do you like your football games\nI like it and I find with the rule change I mean I you know I tend to not often I agree with Bill bell a check but you know you raised a pretty good going right into the finger\nAutomatic I mean he was the Reno in favor of making it even more draconian or or or or you know eliminating it altogether which you know there's probably a case to be made there but\nI mean I I don't think I'm okay with it because it does make a little harder and it hasn't exactly I mean you know\nYou're still the kicker get what Ninety three Ninety four percent of the extra points that I Know it's in a bad year for kicker but you know you're you're still got you know not a given but mostly automatic I'm Still a believer that should be going hurt you most of the time anyway yeah I mean you know that that's kind of the the way it shakes out sometimes\nI thought these afternoon ... we're just fantastic said feeding the ravens twenty ... twenty three and then of course the Redskins being the cowboys twenty to Seventeen you know we talk and and I felt this year specifically\nAnd we're just fantastic St feeding the ravens twenty ... twenty three and then of course the Redskins being the cowboys twenty to Seventeen you know we talk in the NFL this year specifically about how the quarterback play has been great all of these points\nBut defensively today I thought we got a really good ... of four o'clock games what was your biggest takeaway from the saints ravens game mine was have the same defense is not all that bad we know that Drew Brees going on the Baltimore Sun but\nI was just generally surprised at how well the same defense played today what was just your thoughts on that game\nI liked that a lot you know another thing I really like to see what it was just how aggressive they were with force down\nCall oh yeah we talked so much last\nYear about Doug Peterson in the eagles being aggressive and obviously they want a Super Bowl with that mentality but you know Sean Payton [noise] they they didn't they weren't providing for five five five or six I mean on those\n... you know for us down attempt for the same today and they missed a they got all but one of 'em and you know even on a first drive of the game they didn't they didn't end up getting any points to show for it but I don't burn nine minutes on the clock I mean that's nine more minutes\nYou know a nine minute drive that's you know four or five minutes more than the ravens defense wanted to be out on the field today and I'm not a good way to be you know when you're playing a deep sense like Baltimore\nThe best in the league by any measure you know that's how you got to do it you can't play conservative against the group like that um if things off and obviously is not an nonsense you should be playing conservative with anyway so I I really like to see that I think that's a nice little preview of what we're going to see if we get you know down the stretch of the season and the January with some of these teams\nRyan ... is our guest is an NFL now editor in as the nation you can follow all of rice work on winter ... be so how do you think these Redskins are I'm telling you I think there's like a really just sneaky goods for into team they kind of came out of nowhere at least for me I I honestly when this season started writes I had them lasted\nA division so I could not have been completely wrong when it comes to the end of the east\nWhat do you think is what do you think it's a risk and feeling this year\nI'm not really sure to be honest with you I mean you know you got to give them credit for and you like you say there there are the top of the heat spending in the east or not\nYou know the eagles don't have a winning record the giants and I have a winning record the cowboys don't have a winning record that that division that's kind of\nWide open can go a lot of different directions but you know you can you gotta give them credit obviously you know Jay group who's going to call a good game anyway you saw that with Adrian Peterson I you know one thing I enjoyed about\nThe broadcast today was just you know how much they pointed out how different Adrian Peterson is and how much more productive years running out of the shock on like that you certainly have seen that\nWith him and he's been a big part of their off and probably don't you know I mean most people just kind of assumed this guy was just going to come in there and and you know keep the seat warm it the running back position all season but it's a lot and become a lot more than a defensive\nYou know there's not a lot of household names on that deepens but they get the job done don't that\nThat's absolutely true I Can't honestly do other than just knowing that I mean who is the household so when it comes to the other side here the cowboys but that ... you know what it was statistically one of his better games was twenty or thirty five two hundred Seventy three yards but as he kill Ali was shut down when you look at the cowboys\nOff what is the problem is it a lack of play makers coaching what do you think is one of the central problem was white Dallas's officers popping right now\nWell I think the biggest thing for me without the offensive line injuries obviously it starts with Travis Frederick center that's a huge huge huge position I mean that's the question is that the quarterback or the offensive line and to not have a guy like that out there\nHe makes a huge difference in the running game and you see that from you know the the swing you get from week to week with that group here the ... the planet earth I mean these these are great receivers ... you saw that today you had a great game except for you know that ... to an end zone that resulted in a red skins cuts down down there but\nUm other than that he had a really pretty nice game you know you're just putting putting the ball where it needed to be they kinda got the action going again even though the running\nWasn't all that productive but you know you just don't have you've just got kind of spare parts to fill in the receiving corps and that's not going to work you need more reliable\nOption is to get the ball and get some ... and get a union catch the ball in the end zone with some reliability and they don't have\nThat right now and that don't have consistency with it either Ryan ... is our guest a NFL editor at SB Nation you can follow all of Ryan's work on ... so do you point too often said wind injuries as the main reason why Jacksonville is often is it working right now or is it more of a play board all plop\nI you know the odds of lying doesn't help 'em but it's a blank board of travel ... always been a Blake ... problem I mean sometimes\nThey can cover it up with a you know with a good running game and an aggressive defense but it's just not you know we saw that last year getting in the playoffs even let you know you you can't\nEven on their better days they really can't play from behind when you have quite portals like quarterback I Can't I mean I I you know\nFor such a good team to go out and and you know not only keyboard all but the doubled down with a contract extension this off season I just it's even more of a mystery today\nYeah no I totally agree with you when it comes to the fact that they have no one four games in a robot honestly none of them have been convincing went to San ... was a great while I was twenty four one thirty nine a touchdown were located down here in Houston I'm trying to figure out how they put together four straight wins without bad of an offensive why they have\n... how do you think this team really is\nYou know they should be better on defense I mean I I Will say that they definitely have the talent on the fence I mean you give them some slack because we off into the line is absolutely terrible that left tackle as\nYou know he leads the league and pressures in hip allowed under Sean ... honestly surprised ... was out there on the field today given you\nKnow he was so concerned about his lungs they had them ride to Jacksonville on a bus rather than fly on the plane so you know to to go to send them out there that even set off the line I mean that was a little bit of a head\nScratcher begin with but who else do they have I I mean\nI I think Brian then over his head I you know nothing I can turn in the season\nGets me any indication that he you know we sort of falling backwards into these women I mean you know the most obvious example in that streak is the Colts game I mean Frank writes gave it to them with that you know as a gutsy for the call but it basically gave the game to the Texans to when I got\nYou know they've kind of been a you know rolling downhill from there just sort of a ... luckily picking up a few winds along the way\nA jak drive like hey I just you know my my biggest memories of being on a bus Bobby\nI was a ... and when I was in the back you know way back when I was on the bus you know all the way to school and everything\nI I\nMe and my friends who are idiots and we would throw gum like chewed gum out the window at cars like on the way to school and so one of these days one of the one time on a bus we we threw gum in a car that accidentally hit a ah undercover cop car so that wasn't good so the undercover cop followed by switch to shut off the top the Jacksonville\nFollowed are higher and\nHe took everybody who was on a bus and he basically you know try to figure out who was throwing gum at the undercover cop car and I\nTalked to her because I was scared the intimidated me

through nine I think they have the better starting pitching ones are once through three\nUm the ... the red Sox too but I Do think the Dodgers have the better bullpen and I don't think it's even close\nThis strategy for the the the uh the Dodgers is going to be to work Chris Sale and work David Price take pitch so they can get to the Boston bullpen which has been so shaky uh over the course of the last month month and a half\nI I really do think they're going to do that and we're going to see a pretty good world\nSeries that was I was like I was saying I was watching college football on

radio hero back when you went into the New England patriots bridges are being is our coverage of the three grams three is getting a victory\nOh man it was like on the road against the Chicago Bears thirty eight to thirty one All right rich I Want to start obviously no rock no problem today I did you anticipate them having as good of an op ed today as they did without Rob Gronkowski today [laughter]\nSo I think I mean I'm not sure do it as a way of ... put it they score twenty four points fourteen came up with special theme today um put the doping would devolve reasonably well especially at the last us stony Michelle today\nAnd I felt they could compensate for the lack of Gronkowski but they they're three running backs on the roster um Michelle's delete back James White to pass catcher and then the third string guy is you know a third string guy\nSo I was impressed with the fact they are able to put a twenty four points against a very good bears fans\nUm despite missing Michelle more than ... cars a jar scored and I felt stepped up and kind of fill that void as a as a deep correct guy that grumpy really does different different areas scoring\nOn the perimeter bronco in the middle so\nWe do we have an update when it comes to Sony Michel and just how big of a lost his business it's a last moving forward\nSo ah you know thirty one coaches in a league which step up and tell you after the game what the report is the pages of the loan\nOutlier right yeah and I can I tell you but\nI Will say this I'm Michelle ... at five or six days in a training camp\nA ended up having to me ... all the preseason Russia training camp in the first of all a game and sees him had ACL surgery in high school at a steel surgery in college I'm anytime I Need issue is associate with and might be deeply concerned\nThey have serious depth issues there James White close the game all today\nHe's a pass catcher he's not a runner per se so they're going to be looking for someone at the trade deadline I Would think if I'm Michelle they're going to bang for a serious amount of time\nWhich is our guest covers the New England patriots for the telegram good debt a patriots a big thirty eight thirty one victory over the Chicago Bears today New England improving to five and two on the season Josh Gordon bunch of targets today for catches a hundred yards\nA twenty yeah but I mean these are numbers that you can when it comes to the average per catch that you know we all think of John Gordon that one great year he had eight average twenty five years to catch specifically in this game today\nBut rich do you see John Cornyn becoming more heavily game plan for when it comes to the patriots offensively moving forward\n[noise] so yeah I mean I think there's no doubt they're working that work in a man I mean you know they've been experimenting with them so far it's kind of interesting because you know you try and win game\nBut there's no doubt that they're working him into the they're trying to get him integrated ahah a much higher look it's brutal for anybody to come in that time he did in the season I mean even the guy is talented as Josh\nAre you miss the old TAs you miss mini cams you miss training camp English pre season games\nIt's just brutal can drop in to something like this I mean especially the patriots\nYou know the merger teams in the league low and they do what they do and we're going to be consistent doubt it we're going to make your stop us the patriots game plan differently for every week every opponent\nSo he's not only trying to drop into the system but trying to drop into a game plan system on a week by week basis so something he's asked me to do last week against Kansas City he's actually do differently this week again Chicago and ah yeah but the bottom line is his athletic talent\nShow him through today I mean fifty five yard or but the other forty five year three catches those average ... aren't the cat yeah that's pretty impressive and are the best catch was not the fifty five there are there but\nThe earlier one where he adjusted any air reach back in ... in the air\nAnd a lot of guys to try to catch that ball with their chest and eat snacks jak thing out of there and that's why Brady they're not on the same page don't get me wrong but Bridie Hatch trust in him like Randy ... and I'm not putting\nJar scored in the same class as Randy Moss right right but like ... or Randy Moss he has said that there are a big target who can adjust and the air and pull that ball and if he's a little bit off\nHey rich I I was reading something or maybe I was watching something and I saw that they put ... Walker right next to Tom Brady do you think you're you're you're talking about trust and you're talking about all that stuff's it did ... did that on purpose right because they want to bring they bring it in John Cornyn new guy you know he's had some problems in the past\nPut 'em right next to ... like I just thought that was such a brilliant move by just knew it but I guess it was dollar check who make those decisions but what what were your thoughts when he's okay Josh ... gonna be next to Tom Brady in the walk and that'll help them get close to right off the field and hopefully that helps the on air ... on a bill brought up\nSo I I and I can't\nCompletely buy into that what I Will say is that what's intriguing is that a Randy Moss is locked there was placed right next to Tom Brady locker as well\nBut there's been plenty of guys next to him that have died you know they put it's more of a the patriots tend to structure the locker rooms around position\nSo when you get the skill position players there's only so many available open spot\nAnd they have made one or two spots across the way on it but yeah I mean I think there is a little bit set in that um but quite frankly I I've never seen the two guys in the locker room at the same time so that doesn't mean they're not conversing when the media's not allowed in for it you know it's forty\nFive minutes over at eight to ten hour day but uh\nBut you know but I mean I Will say again Randy Moss as the last ... significant but I saw an extra Brady and you can kind of make a connection\nNo doubt about it rich garden is our guest covers the New England patriots by the telegram 'cause that you can follow all the bridges work on Twitter at rich garbage G G I Want to go back to Sony Michel a cold that I heard Rob Gronkowski say I think that maybe it was a couple of weeks ago was\nThat you were talking about this to a James why not being a traditional running back he's more guys ... you said that the patriots play action passing game is going to improve you said just a couple of weeks ago the play actually passing game is going to prove over the improve over the week because\nIt's deep and just have to respect the inside running game\nSo there's a couple of weeks ago the play actually passing game is going to prove over the improve over the week because it's deep and just have to respect the inside running game how Sony Michel run have you seen that over the last couple of weeks specifically just defense is having to respect sunny Michelle\n[laughter] yeah so I wrote after\nThree weeks into the season I wrote Michelle and how it was just a basically brutal I mean it's like\nSo fifty percent of its carries when the three yards or less a twenty five percent went to one yard alas I mean this is the Patriot don't deal with negative power outage and Michelle was the machine for that and you know you you look at it you know like okay\nYou know you're just into the game how long it's going to take 'em well he caught a fast\nYou know the last couple of weeks\nBoom you know you saw today Eighteen year run on the first carry second uh second touch was a a a reception for sixteen Seventeen yard something in that range so he he's become an integral part of the ... in a very short period of time since ... again\nThey enjoy the production off the show for two thousand and maintain go
