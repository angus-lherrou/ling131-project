against Seattle now\nPlenty of times with more on the show OK Amory I Want to start with the undefeated Los Angeles for him they had a challenge today on the road again Seattle now\nThree years ago this would've been Thirteen to ... probably Seattle would have gone to win but we're we are three years later most of these aren't while the ramp definitely an office of team I think Seattle surprise me for certain today but\nThat decision by Sean ... to go for it at the very un force him one I was thinking to myself man that's one of those calls were the major cities a hero if he misses it man you're really starting to question him them but just overall your thoughts on the rams went over Seattle it definitely was a struggle to that\nYeah I I I really enjoyed that call because I look at how\nA seat in the cold there ... and I think when you look at it a situation where you have a chance to close up the game\nYou're going to do especially on a situation where it was\nFor them and just in the wet nature why not just try to quarterbacks sneak it in and get it and we just saw him against Americans Houston Texans and Dallas Cowboys where it was for him go from a half you outlined the type to go shopping and then throw the football so and he didn't get it obviously so\nThe goal for that to go forward that there's always someone shoots I think that's a big time by\nA strong leave and the Los Angeles right\nI Want to say in the NFC because this Vikings eagles game if I were to ask you to pinpoint the one thing or if maybe there's multiple things ah what do you think is the biggest problem right now with the Philadelphia Eagles all sense\nI think right now they don't have a ground game and that's the biggest issue they have the same receivers you got that right idea with Dallas got her now see more about what's that urged the all through Vineland still impact I think the big issues they don't have a threat in the backfield or do they want it ... this was a different theme quite honestly when they have the Garrett bought that think that\nWhat's being under sold about ... ... the problem is\nOn office this year is the fact that they just don't have the ability to run the football so it might be putting a lot of first on the phone was a lot of pressure on cars and went\nAnd the receivers are just starting to get by healthy but if they have the ability to run the football like they did last year I think that will be\nThe biggest difference as far as what they need off basically that's why you start to hear rumblings of them perhaps making a trade for someone that a levee on bills caliber to help jumpstart this groggy that to me is the biggest issue\nEmery ... is our guest a football game plan on or a football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter at ... ball game plan when I watch the eagles play though Emory and I hear you're saying about the running game\nI think part of it is play calling I I ... just seems to be thinking and dumping his way down to ... I don't know if this protection is do you think he is fully healthy because you know hotel back to them was complaining and I think it's totally reasonable for oh they'll come to complain about it and we'll talk about that in the second in terms of the the down field passing game with the giants\nThere's not much happening down field with the Philadelphia Eagles do you think Carson lunches fully healthy and do you think play calling as a part of that\nI I think Carson was today he showed a little bit more mobility than we've seen for him before but if we're paying out as he was speaking in so I'm going to last year or yeah\nIf you look for it yeah it was that he has this has done it and it starts to reach us is keep people away from looking at the actual target the outfield and how short he was throwing the football it was thrown a lot of bubbles grandfather's pop rock bottom Crawford and that's doing the same things now is that they don't have the run the games to to to ah\nHelp balance it out when they go flags and it gets to be shut down the field and he was doing some of the day he had some big some big taxes down below what was the key drop by our sons yet from air force in twenty I Believe author and twenty um but\nThey have always been the short\nPath game was sneaking guns past the games teams now are starting to clean up on these wide receivers taken those passes away you know starting to be a little more cognizant of what combinations come behind those shorter route I'm In that getting food by jumping a short while and then leave in the past the window while who behind them ah\nWith the ball with him behind their heads so I think deep is the spot or but the office is still the same I just think they really don't have a the ground game to take a lot of the pressure off what they do throwing the football\nMemory let's say in the NFC he's a it let's go to the O'Donnell Beck and junior comments which\nHas a New York giants fan myself honestly I did not have a problem with anything that'll do set and I didn't have a problem with the fact that it was that it came out right before the game basically saying I mean it's it's just obvious when you watch the giants play that they are struggling with their down still passing game I think the hard thing obviously is is what is most personal\nAnd we'll ... has a big problem with but look it is you talk about bulletin board material that is what Jay Lynn Ramsey is doing in terms of the other teams\nThat I I looked at this Emory as as oh back um junior putting bullets him a poor born material for his own team it was a challenge if they really looked at him as a leader in the locker rooms and your leader goes out and and basically called the entire team out\nAnd says look we got problems here with our heart and are down still passing gave I didn't have a problem with anything that he said and I have a problem that he didn't back to back off of it after the game did you\nNot at all and he hears a thing I think a lot of times certain players give protected in the media I feel as though uh the New York giants and some of the beat writers are doing that with\nA\nMan and I think that's the issue I think people are walking on eggshells around you live man he's been back who tried to sell everybody last year but we're going on and the and people booed him around them out of town so\nNow that you have the same situation going on this year you're looking at\n... ... there's something else as does the same problem with they had before ... ... who just got out of it and was able to speak publicly about it\nAnd at the end of the day it for the giants for thirty points for the first time in in two and a half seasons so you can't say his words in things enough to where they got production or they didn't get the outcome of the water is on the game but that's the best offer grew up with the head in quite some time\nNo doubt about I'm Henry ... is our guest sooner a football game plan covers the NFL you can follow him or his work on asphalt game plan to the Green Bay Packers often right now I think is a bit of a mess they were down twenty four nothing in the first half on a day weren't Aaron Rodgers through for four hundred and forty three yards in three touchdown\nBut he didn't protect the football he had to fumble as they had the return of those are the teams are I'm not sure when you watch this Green Bay Packers often is it more Aaron Rodgers is it more the confidence of wind I mean you talk about the eagles the one dimensional I mean there's ... there was no Packers running back who had more than ten Kerry said I\nDon't want to see the same question I I did about the eagles I Do about the Packers what is the biggest problem with the Packers off into it and if you want to put part of the blame on Aaron Rodgers I think I Would have to agree with you got to protect the football\nThat's the biggest issue I think you got to protect the football you also have to help them out you know he's not a hundred percent\nOr so you have to help him out and try to find ways to run the football this short fat again as a compliment throwing 'em or something with the run the game or just actually turn around and hand of all of the year two towns had failed back than our own jaws and she'll always stay half the run the football\nIt opens up everything else and when you're one dimensional where the guy that\nOften failed back then ... and ... they have the run the football it opens up everything else and when you're one dimensional with a guy that's not a hundred percent you're going to have outcomes bites you half a day plus they left Thirteen points out there on the field was misspelled go an extra point\nYeah I I the Packers are one of those teams they're just going to you I walked into this this uh this year Emory\nAnd I said okay the Packers are are the best team and that division the Vikings are slightly behind them and the only reason I put the Packers above the Vikings as simply because of the quarterback Aaron Rodgers is a super mega superstar but look if he's turning the ball over he's not that\nWould you put Minnesota like if you were to tolerate the NFC West I think it's really close ... I don't even know if he would put the the Packers above the bears right now because the bears are playing well I Know the Packers beat the bears what Vikings Packers bears ordered them one two three right now\nRight now I'll keep it will saying where habit I have a\nPackers bears wife was a lie\nAnd that's how I had a pretty season that's how I have it now I still believe\nAnd the Packers as far as getting things done around Minnesota to me has proven and what they will be throughout the season they're kind of hit or miss\nWas that it fits the yard or was it\nNot alright Bobby I kind of a was with the referees today which I have not been for most of the season\nLook there was a rule if you go below the waist this was not dragging the\nQuarter back to the ground it but it's not bringing a quarter back to the ground the dispute on this specific play with a huge\n'cause it ... it brought the Vikings was Seventeen at three lead a\nIt was it was was\nHe blocked in I did not think he was blocked in did you [noise]\nUm no because uh he really was like he just lost his ballots and then he fell to the ground it and you know you had a quarter of\nMilo is late so I mean that was my are can be you know just grab a leg he didn't do anything wrong grab the legs interesting and so they're going to apply the role and I understand it was a malicious maybe Fifteen Years ago that wouldn't have been a penalty but hey welcome to the new age NFL baby two thousand Eighteen\nAlright a quick our over tonight as finished radio [noise]\nNine forty and do you not what you were born Afghans and online at nine forty WMA huge on job\n[noise]\nOn ABC News\nI'm Richard chance to\nFlorida governor Rick Scott ordering states of emergency for twenty six counties in Florida is currently tropical storm Michael German southwest of Cuba headed for landfall in Florida and handle this storm will be life threatening and extremely dangerous\nMichael expected to intensify and possibly category to hurricane by the time it makes landfall in the panhandle by mid week\nYou cannot hide from storm surge so get prepared and get it out if an evacuation has ordered\nManager of a store or a limo crash killed twenty people says the intersection in ...

hundred and forty yards Jimmy ... catches Seventy six yards but I I just you give away Jody Nelson and I understand Jody Nelson was declining it's the same thing I look at the Packers and the cowboys and I say man there is such a difference\nBetween last year and this year in terms of plane making in terms of the big play factor and they both gave away their top wide receiver who I understand they were both the climate Packers giveaway Jordan Nelson he was declining last year I get it it was the regrets it\nUh the desk Brian doesn't signed with the Dallas Cowboys I understand you know this bright regrets it but the difference between these two officers is huge it really really is and the Packers I I I uh you know if I if I'm power ranking these these teams in the ... the north\nOr the Packers I Know or two in what are what are they now they're two and a two to Institute two in one it just think about this\nIs Aaron Rodgers does not give you the brilliant fourth quarter that he gave you against the Chicago Bears back in the week one week to whenever that was we're looking at a completely different division the bears are in much more of a power position obviously over the Packers\nI think they're the better team without a doubt overall everywhere if you look at the bears\nEverywhere except quarterback they're better everywhere\nKicker punter wide receiver defensive and cornerback everywhere they are better than the Green Bay Packers except for quarterback and Aaron Rogers was really yesterday outside of it to fumble foreigner forty two yards and three touchdown but I'm telling you what we heard last week and I don't play that I think I Want to go back on that\nBecause I I think that I I think there's a real deal is a real problem when Aaron Rodgers does not like the receivers that he has Aaron Rodgers does not like they're running game that he has can't trust the running game\nWhich I'm Still trying to figure out why it's Aaron Jones average five point seven yards carrying seven carried Jamal Williams average five point five yard to carry he had six cares how do you have two running backs who average over five yards of carry only get Thirteen carry the game\nWell one way is to go down twenty four nothing early but you could still go to what I felt it was forced I did not like to play calling for Green Bay today you've gotta you've ... you've got to be balanced in this league but I'll tell you what do you tell me if I'm wrong if I'm power rank the NFC\nNorth right now I think I'm going Vikings one just because I trust the deaths and the um I'm trying to find a whole\nAnd I can't find a whole on that team I Can't do it the bears ... can be a wholesome talked a chip is key you you have to a baby and sometimes you have to think of duck\nI think I'm putting the team in the end of the north and I can't believe I'm saying this because it is a quarterback leak and you can tell me if I'm wrong I think I'm putting the team but by far the best quarterback in the division as the third best team right now in the NFC North\nHow would you power at the end of the north I go Vikings bears Packers right now in terms of I think if we were in a play these games right now the Vikings will beat the bears the Vikings will be the Packers and the bears would be the Packers that's how I'm basing this on\nOh I'll I'll go\nBiking Packers in their yoga I like the bears the fence but like\nYou said ms are too busy can be a whole he could be a gay manager instead of a quarterback who can take over to ...\nHave said that he did a success down they'd had in his letter which I'm not saying we're going to get out of that that's what I'm saying you know no you're right what did you see that again this upcoming\nWeek I'm there to buy a week I

Sunday at the very least I'm there in contention though and they create their own that's\nYeah no ... without a doubt and it's a great division a race that Apollo was our guest covers the Steelers in the NFL for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette so James Caan or has another good day today a hundred and ten yards on the ground to touchdowns five point two yards a carry re one of the things one of the points that I've been making on my show constantly this year and I and I want to run by you\nIs that Ryan ... if you were to look at last year's roster and this year's roster\nRyan Shakespeare has actually been the bigger loss compared to leave your on bell if I were to tell you to write the guys that they had\nLast year that they don't this year would you put Ryan ... as the bigger loss of lazy on bail simply because of what you just said they almost have ... ... they haven't replace Ryan says you are but James Caan or has had some good games this year is that fair to say that she\nFears the bigger loss to bell\nNo I I think that's fair and I think I'm In a lady on below the better running back James counterfeit James Carter hasn't been the issue for the Steelers running game\nFarm subsidies second won't Helen jak rushing Caesar and those are the free games they just really got away football they won't committed to it I think she saw today\nWhen they were committed the water on the football I'm from the outset that pain that sort of set up a play actually the people down the field to browse so I think this was a good step in the right direction for the Steelers if they stay committed to the running game um I think this off ... off track\nHaven't been able to watch a full Steelers game start to center so I Want to ask you this when it comes to how teams cover the Pittsburgh Steelers and I haven't really paid attention to this\n... issues there is a fantastic wide receiver ... is he always facing single coverage because of the attention that Antonio Brown gas\nFor the most part yes I mean it's not every single play but he's opposing defensive coordinators had done their best\nTo take Antonio Brown I'm Out of these games if you look past\nI'm back at the past five seasons bomb he saw the most he thought the most prolific\nFive seasons stretching on the phone history in terms of your show um I really think the key and then later this year and it does open ended up working through Smith Schuster and some of the other titans and receivers on that theme\nSchuster didn't have a great game today um I think he had less than forty or anything but he did have a big touched on earlier on a sort of sport that off\nAnd have a great game today um I think he had less than forty or anything but\nHe did have a big touched on earlier on a sort of spark that awful incident get some girl or the\nRace that Apollo was our guest covers the Steelers and the NFL for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nHas play action always played a major reason as to why as to why the Steelers passing game is good in other words in previous years teams had to respect lazy on bell obviously so you could have just play off in El al ... you know these throw these long throws to Antonio Brown to do\nSo I think you kind of alluded to it but the fact that Connor did have a hundred and ten yards on the ground today I Would guess that that made Atlanta respect the running game and that was a major reason why the passing game was opened up\nYeah and I think they have to do that or even a little bit over the rest of sheer\nBomb when the Steelers have gotten away from Iran\nAnd they're they just evolved into the shotgun team that's going to throw the ball [noise] um every play a good defense is like the ravens last week were able to stop them so\nI think the more about what you are I I think the bigger the your menu becomes bomb as an office of corner and I think first year often to coordinate or Randy feet are\nCold his best game of the season for 'em they're almost fifty fifty and run past balance and I think that's what this team has to do 'em to be successful\nI feel like that's a theme with a lot of teams this year the you looked at the eagles and how they're kind of one dimensional little bit the Packers are a little bit one dimensional but definitely weren't today have you you've covered this deal is always the for a while now when you have been robbed us burgers [laughter] you know he talked about retirement last year and how he wasn't sure if he was fully into what have you seen\nAny kind of regression at all from him like in terms of his skill and his ability like people talk about Tom Brady and say wow he's forty to whatever he is and he has it\nRegrets at all have you seen any kind of progression in terms of Ben Roethlisberger is arm strength whether he's able to do in the pocket his accuracy as you covered his team has he regrets at all\nYou know I don't know if I Would call it over aggression it's kind of a weird thing he's second in the NFL and pass so\nUm but he hasn't been themselves this year he he doesn't have that same connection with Antonio Brown this most recent game you know taken out of the equation when they finally got on track through higher this year he hasn't been as accurate\nUm but I don't I don't sense that it's a problem with his arm strength I just sent us a problem with this time around\nAnd so it was one thing to take away from today's care uh still ... Antonio Brown\n... still only completed I think half of it is hard to tell me about but the fact that they completed a couple of the polls and they finally got over a hundred years together I think that might be I'm sort of a jumping off point for those two because those two have been right this entire season as they can get right\nUm I think that'll mean Beck thanks for the Steelers off\nSpray we had a situation in New York where oh they'll Beckham junior basically a he said he wasn't getting the targets down feel it was hard he basically had this moment it wasn't a a an emotional breakdown but he went public basically with with what was going on with him and what he saw was wrong with the giants\nAnd it's a team would only trade for lazy on if they were willing to give them the long term deal so if I'm lazy and I'm thinking to myself let them try and trade me because the team's not going to do that right unless they're willing to give them a long term deal like why trade for rental of lazy\nAnd they also tried to give ... but\nHe ... he didn't like it or leave he knows he knows where the Steelers are at yeah so why wouldn't you want to move on [noise]\nLike I understand why why the Steelers would want to move on from him but if you're leaving on why wouldn't you want to move on Libya said he's gonna come back I I I don't understand why ... here's what I don't get I don't understand why lay down south to come back at all this is that that's one thing I don't understand that that will have to develop over the course of the I don't have an answer for some of the night I citizen radio [noise]\n\nNine morning W W born Africans\nAnd online at nine forty WMA W. dot com\n[noise]\nOn ABC News\nBeing called the deadliest transportation accident\nIn the U.S than almost a decade twenty people in total are dead and ... here in New York after limousine Mr stop plowed into a group of pedestrians and a parked vehicle Serino also your sister was one of the people in the limo that lost their lives\nI was told that the limousine and what's going over sixty miles an hour I'm going down the hill hit on like miss a chat\nI was told that the limousine and what's going over sixty miles an hour I'm going down a hill hit on like miss a traffic stop on hit another car and then not other car had to put ...\nNational Transportation Safety Board chair Robert Sumwalt says they have a lot of work to do\nWe will not be determining the cause of the crime while we're on scenes that will come in a later date\nNor will we be speculating on any calls with the crime\nLeading the season tropical activity tropical storm Michael blowing it's sixty miles an hour or so south west of Cuba's western to western tip gathering strengthen heading straight ... expect\nTo be a hurricane by sometime tomorrow night into Tuesday Morning and then the latest forecast for the national Hurricane Center right in the category to status now like they making landfall sometime during the day on Wednesday all on the Florida Panhandle but there's gotta be on the right side heavy storms so Tampa the sides of Florida Georgia in South Carolina why pie and\nBack ABC News meteorologist rub ... after wrapping up his fourth visit to North Korea secretary of state Mike Pompeo went to China he says dictator Kim Jong own and he made significant progress sort of denuclearization deal and he's thinking South Korea for the work they're putting in\nIndonesian officials boosted the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami my almost two hundred to Nineteen hundred and forty four you're listening to ABC News\nAnd I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to manage share where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared all\nOur belts and it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without them at a sure\nIt's worth looking into their the reason is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here has a number for you\nEight seven seven twenty six Bible that's eight seven seven to six B.

Seattle surprise me for sure today but\nThat decision by Sean McVeigh to go for it at the very un force than one I was thinking to myself met it\nThat's one of those calls were if he makes it he's a hero if he misses it man you're really starting to question and Pam but just overall your thoughts on the rams went over Seattle it definitely was a struggle to that\nYeah I I I really enjoyed that call because I look at how a tea and the code every and I think when you look at it a situation where you have a close up again you're going to do especially on a situation where it was\nBoth an answer and things of that nature why not just try to quarterback sneak in and get it and we just saw on the game where we can use them in and out that was where it was four and go from a half year old line to go shopping and then Bogle football so and he didn't get it obviously so\nGo for that could go for that it's always someone shoots I think that's a big time by\nA charming and the Los Angeles right\nI Want to stay in the NFC because this Vikings eagles game if I were to ask you to pinpoint the one thing or if maybe there's multiple things ah what do you think is the biggest problem right now with the Philadelphia Eagles off such\nI think right now they don't have a ground game and that's the biggest issue they have the same or the or the veteran idea was that we got her now the warm up with that or\nThe ... virus still in fact I think the big issue if they don't have a threat in the backfield or do they want it ... the the ... and the court out of it when they had the Garrett's book that big that\nWas being undecided about what the problem is on all this years back they just don't have the ability to run the football field are you putting a lot of pressure on the phone a lot of pressure on cars and went and the reason is something to get back healthy but if they had the ability to run the football like they did last year I think that will be\nThe biggest difference as far as what they need basically that's why you start to hear rumblings of them perhaps making a trade for someone that a lumpy on bill caliber who helped jumpstart this groggy that to me is the biggest issue\nEmery ... is our guest a football game plan on or a football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter at ... ball game plan when I watch the eagles play though Emory and I hear you're saying about the running game\nI think part of it as a play called like I I Carson once just seems to be thinking and dumping his way down but the I don't know if it's protection is\nDo you think he is fully healthy because they're owed back on was complaining and I think it's totally reasonable for oh back to complain about it and we'll talk about that in the second in terms of the down field passing game with the giants there's not much happening\nDown field with the Philadelphia Eagles do you think Carson once it's fully healthy and do you say play calling as a part of that\nI think Carson would debate he showed a little bit more mobility than we've seen for him before but if we're being honest he was thinking it sunk and last year\nUh yeah it really is your first step is that he had to have done it in a century so to keep people away from looking at the actual target the outfield and how short he was throwing up on it was a lot of bubbles grains of top wrote about her coffers and that's doing the same thing now is they don't have to run again\nThe outfield and how short he was throwing the football it was thrown a lot of bubbles grains a lot of software out a\nLot of crossers and that's doing the same thing now is that they don't have the run the games to to to ah help balance it out when they go play actually hit the beach shut down the field and he was doing some of the day he had some big some big taxes down below what was the key drop by our sons differ on that for twenty I Believe author and twenty um but\nThey have always been the short\nPass the game was sneaking guns past the games teams now are starting to put up on these wide receiver seeking those passes away you know starting to be a little more cognizant of what combination there come behind those shorter route um but not getting fooled by jumping a short while and then leave in the past and why do why who behind them uh\nWith the ball with him behind their heads so I think deep is the spot or but the office is still the same I just think they really don't have a the ground game to take a lot of the pressure off what they do throwing the football\nMemory let's say in the NFC he's a it let's go to the odor back um junior comments which\nAs the New York giants fan myself honestly I did not have a problem with anything that'll do said and I didn't have a problem with the fact that it was that it came out right before the game basically saying I mean it's it's just obvious when you watch the giants play that they are struggling with their down feel passing game\nI think the hard thing obviously is is what is most personal\nAnd we'll go server has a big problem with but look it is you talked about bulletin board material that is what Jay Lynn ... he was doing in terms of the other teams that the I looked at this Emory as as oh back um junior putting bullets him a poor born material\nFor his own team it was a challenge if they really looked at him as a leader in the locker rooms and your leader goes out and and basically calls the entire team out\nAnd says look we got problems here with our heart and are down still passing gave I didn't have a problem with anything that he said and I have a problem that he didn't back after back off of it after the game did you\nNot at all and he hears a thing I think a lot of times certain players give protected in the media I feel as though uh the New York giants and some of the the writers are doing that with\nA\nMan and I think that's the issue ... people are walking on eggshells around you lived Manny been back who tried to sell everybody last year but we're going on and the and people booed him a random out of town so\nNow that you have the same situation going on this year you're looking at ... in the office supplies to something else going on those same problem if they had before oh the guy who just got out of it and it was able to speak publicly about it\nAnd at the end of the day it work the drive for thirty points for the first time in in two and a half seasons so you can't say words didn't think enough to where they got production or they didn't get the outcome of the water is on the game but that's the best offer come up with the head in quite some time\nNo doubt about I'm hammering hunters are stone or a football game plan covers the NFL you can follow him or his work on asphalt game plants so the Green Bay Packers off and sit right now I think is a bit of a mess they were down twenty four nothing in the first half on a day weren't Aaron Rodgers three or four hundred and forty two yards in three touchdowns\nBut he didn't protect the football he had to ... they had the return of those as a team or I'm not sure when you watch this Green Bay Packers often is it more Aaron Rodgers is it more of the office of wine I mean you talk about the eagles the one dimensional I mean this Packers knew there was no Packers running back who had more than ... today\nSo I feel the same question I did about the eagles I Do about the Packers what is the biggest problem with the Packers off and said and if you want to put the blame on Aaron Rodgers I think I Would have to agree with you got to protect the football\nThat's the biggest issue I think you've got to protect the football you also have to help them out you know he's not a hundred percent\nOr so you have to help him out and try to find ways to run the football or the shore fast and the compliment throwing 'em or something I'm at the run the game or just actually turn around and and the fall off the air too talented failed back then ... and she'll always if they have to run the football\nIt opens up everything else and when you're one dimensional where the guy that's not a hundred percent you're going to have outcomes like half a day plus they left Thirteen points out there on the field was miserable and extra point\nYeah I I the Packers are one of those teams that just couldn't feel I walked into this this uh this year Emory\nAnd I said okay the Packers are are the best team in that division the Vikings are slightly behind them and the only reason I put the Packers\nAbove the Vikings as simply because of the quarterback Aaron Rodgers is a super mega superstar but look if he's turning the ball over he's not that\nWould you put Minnesota like if he were to tolerate the NFC West I think it's really close ... I don't even know he would put the the Packers above the bears right now because the bears are playing well I Know the Packers beat the bears Vikings Packers bears order them one two three right now\nRight now I'll keep it was saying where habit I have a\nPackers bears five he was alive\nAnd that's how I had a pretty season that's how I have it now I still believe\nAnd the Packers as far as getting things around Minnesota to me has proven and what they will be throughout the season they're kind of hit or miss\nFranchise record with a averaging fourteen point six yards a carry today on just Fifteen carries for Isaiah crow out well\nI guess the jets don't need to be in the levy on bell sweepstakes it looks like they've got their running back as the crow well and of course with crow well looking pretty good for the New York jets that obviously made Sam ... Arnold look pretty good huh the theme of the show Bobby beats has been about ballads\nStarted to show that will end the third our if you're a balance football team you have a much better chance of being successful sand Arnold today three touchdowns\nNinety eight pass their ratings you only have ten completion for why do that when you can run the ball\nAt a clip of Fort Paine yards that carry Isaiah crow well congratulations to you know but then I [noise] [noise]\nI'm ...

five yards a carrier more and they had a quarterback because they're for foreigners forty yards and they lost the game that should never ever happen\nWhen they go to another undefeated team the Los Angeles ramp there five you know Jared golf looks great I Love everything about Jared golf three hundred Twenty one yard touchdown guys throwing darts no he's not a system quarterback but how does the rams when the game\nOkay see I was sick don't have the roads are\nFor their money there's no question about it they win the\nGame because time girlie how to run at the end to close it out I don't think he didn't get the first down he had three touchdowns tool in the game Seventy seven yards he didn't get the first day on the body if you watch the end of the game\nTo grill the the call is for him and it's a half back\nTo the right side of the lie he stops Dennis tracks it's to the left and just runs for nine yards and then how about the holidays on Showtime it back on forced down in one he says you know what\nWe play to win the game that's what we do we play to win the game and I want to tell you what he goes forward on force down and won the ball still in his territory and he says I got a big quarterback Jared\nGo off and I believe that I can go and get the one yard with the ... up by ... by one or two whatever it was up by two ball in my own territory\nI'll tell you what Sean

well they need to run the football so that's my third team okay they don't want to talk about here in this opening segment Iran's been she's balanced Packers not just who also is not balanced whatsoever and one of the main reasons they lose today\nOh that Philippe ... eagles\nEagles now two and three on this season J uh July eight carried to twenty nine yards window small with three carries twenty seven yard all on the arm of Carson when do I believe it's still hard there's play calling issues going on there thinking and don't get down to the all\nThe eagles I understand they won the super bowl last year but they lose to the Vikings today and I think a major part of it is because they are not balance the Minnesota Vikings could sit back and wait for Carson once was going to bring them\nI don't care that you have a great quarterback I don't care that you like to pass the football I don't care that the quarterback\nPastor Randy average quarterback passed a rating them as

is this team should have won by a lot more they were one of five and the right job I had so many opportunities to specifically inside the five yard line\nI mean what happened at the end of the half was absolute disgrace not only that and I think we'll go and take the three points and they end up not getting any points and the end of the drive with Bill a brand it looks to go for it on for thing

follow him or his work on Twitter at apple gambling you heard him plenty of times before on the show okay I'm right I Want to start with the undefeated Los Angeles ramps they had a challenge today on the road again Seattle now\nThree years ago this game would have been Thirteen to ... probably Seattle would have done to win but we're we are three years later both of these aren't while the rams definitely an office of team I think Seattle surprise me for sure today but\nThat decision by Sean ... to go for it at the very un force in one I\nWas thinking to myself Mitt it that's one of those calls were if he makes it he's a hero if he misses it man you're really starting to question him him but just overall your thoughts on the rams went over Seattle it definitely was a struggle to that\nYeah I I I really enjoyed that call because I look at how\nA tree in the code every and I think when you look at it a choice on where you have a cold up again you're going to do is what was the choice was\nAn answer and things that nature why not just try to quarterbacks sneak in and get it and we just on the gang American ... and ... ... where it was four and go from a half year old line go shop down and then Bogle football so and he didn't get it obviously so\nThe goal for her to go for that choice oh shoot I think that's a big time by a charming and the Los Angeles right\nI Want to stay in the ... because this Vikings eagles game if I were to ask you to pinpoint the one thing or if maybe there's multiple things ah what do you think is the biggest problem right now with the Philadelphia Eagles off such\nI think right now they don't have a groggy and that's the biggest issue bad the same or the or the better it idea was that was that are now being warm up with that or\nThe ... virus doing that I think the big issues they don't have a ... and the fact you know they want it ... the ... and the court out of the one hand the guarantee that big that\nIt's being undecided about what the problem is\nOn all these years they just don't have the ability to run the ... by putting a lot of pressure on the phone a lot of pressure\nAbout what what what's the problem is on all these years the fact that they just don't have the ability to run the football so it might be putting a lot of pressure on the phone was a lot of pressure on cars and went and the receivers of new starting to get back healthy but if they had the ability to run the football like they did last year I think that will be\nThe biggest difference as far as what they need all basically that's why you start to hear rumblings of them perhaps making a trade for someone that a levee on bills caliber to help jumpstart this groggy that to me is the biggest issue\nEmery ... is our guest a football game plan on or a football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter at ... ball game plan when I watch the eagles play though Emory and I hear you're saying about the running game\nI think part of it is play calling I I ... just seems to be thinking and dumping his way down to say I don't no such protection is do you think she is fully healthy because\nYou don't hold out back to them was complaining and I think it's totally reasonable for oh they'll come to complain about it and we'll talk about that in the second in terms of the the down field passing game with the giants there's not much happening\nDown field with the Philadelphia Eagles do you think Carson lunches fully healthy and do you think play calling as a part of this\nI I think Carson with today he showed a little bit more mobility they always seem to put him before but they were paying out as he was thinking it stunk and last year\nUh yeah it really is your first step is that he has this has done it in a century so to keep people away from looking at the actual target the outfield and how short he was throwing the football it was thrown a lot of bubbles grandfather stop wrote about\nCrawford and they're doing the same thing now is that they don't have to run the games to to to ah help balance it out when they go play actually hit the shut down the field\nAnd he was doing some of the day he had some ... some big tax bill one was a keen drop by our sons yet from air force than twenty I Believe author and twenties um but they have always been the short\nPass the game was thinking don't pass the games teams now are starting to clean up on these ... the risk taking those passes away you know something to be a little more time to sort of what combination there come behind those shorter route um but not getting food by jumping a short while and then leave in the past and why do why do who behind them uh\nWith the ball with him behind their heads so I think deep is the spot or but the office is still the same I just think they really don't have a the ground game to take a lot of the pressure off what they do throwing the football\nMemory left saying the NFC he's a it let's go to the odor back um junior comments which\nHas a New York giants fan myself honestly I did not have a problem with anything that'll do set and I didn't have a problem with the fact that it was that it came out right before the game oh they'll basically saying I mean it's it's just obvious when you watch the giants play that they are struggling with their down feel passing game\nI think the hard thing obviously is is what is most personal and we'll ... has a big problem with but look if you talk about bulletin board material that is what Jay Lynn Ramsey is doing in terms of the other team\nThat's I I looked at this ... as as oh back um junior putting bullets him a poor board material for his own team it was a challenge if they really looked at him as a leader in the locker rooms and your leader goes out and and basically calls the entire team out\nAnd says look we got problems here with our heart and are down to a passing game I didn't have a problem with anything that he said and I have a problem that he didn't back to back off of it after the game did you\nNot at all and here's the thing I think a lot of times certain players give protected in the media I feel as though uh the New York giants and some of the writers are doing that with\nA\nMan and I think that's the issue I think people are walking on eggshells around ... Manny been back but who tried to sell everybody last year but we're going on\nThe people booed him around him out of town so now that you have the same throwing things going on this year you're looking at ... and the officers' lives to something else going on no it's the same problem they had before hold\nUp back who just got out of it and was able to speak publicly about it\nAnd at the end of the day it for the giants for thirty points for the first time in in two and a half seasons so you can't say his words didn't things enough to where they got production or they didn't get the outcome of the water they didn't want the game but that's the best offer grew up with the head in quite some time\nNo doubt about I'm Henry ... is our guest don't or a football game plan covers the NFL you can follow an Murray's work on asphalt game plan to the Green Bay Packers our sense of right now I think is a bit of a mess they were down twenty four nothing in the first half\nOn a day where Aaron Rodgers through for four hundred and forty two yards in three touchdowns but he didn't protect the football he had two phone bills they had three turn all those as a team\nOr I'm not sure when you watch this Green Bay Packers often is it more Aaron Rodgers is it more of the office of line I mean you talk about the eagles one dimensional I mean this pastor there was no Packers running back who had more than ... today\nSo I see the same question I did about the eagles I Do about the Packers what is the biggest problem with the Packers off and said and if you want to put the blame on Aaron Rodgers I think I Would have to agree with you got to protect the football\nThat's the biggest issue I think you got to protect the football you also have to help them out you know he's not a hundred percent\nOr so you have to help him out and try to find ways to run the football where the shore fast again as a compliment throwing 'em or something with the run the game or to actually turn around and hand of all of the year or two towns had failed back than our own jaws then she'll always stay half the run the football\nIt opens up everything else and when you're one dimensional where the guy that's not a hundred percent you're going to have outcomes like half a day plus\nThey left Thirteen points out there on the bill was miserable and extra point\nYes I I the Packers are one of those teams are just going to see I walked into this this uh this year Emory\nAnd I said okay the Packers are are the best team in that division the Vikings are slightly behind them and the only reason I put the Packers above the Vikings as simply because of the quarterback Aaron Rodgers is a super mega superstar but look if he's turning the ball over he's not that\nWould you put Minnesota like if he were to tolerate the NFC West I think it's really close ... I don't even know if he would put the the Packers above the bears right now because the bears a point well I don't know the Packers beat the Vikings Packers bears order them one two three right now\nRight now I'll keep it will saying where habit I have a Packers bears why he was alive\nAnd that's how I had a pretty season that's how I have it now I still believe\nAnd the Packers as far as getting things turn around Minnesota to me has proven and what they will be throughout the season they're kind of hit or miss\nThe only way to do this every week was that the fifteenth yard or was it not\nHi Bobby I kind of a was with the referees today which I have not been for most of the season\nLook there's a rule if you go below the waist\nThis was not dragging the quarter back to the ground if there's not bringing a quarter back to the ground the dispute on this specific play with this huge because it brought the Vikings to a Seventeen or three lead a it was it was was he blocked in I did not think he was blocked in did you [noise]\nUm [noise] no because uh he really was like he just lost his mad at us and then he fell to the ground and and you know you\nHad to quit as well as late so I mean that was my are can be noted rather live he didn't do anything wrong grab the legs interested in it so they're going to fly the role and I understand it was a malicious maybe Fifteen Years ago when the benefit of the but hey welcome to the new age NFL\nBaby sue thousand a seeing eye a quick our over the night as finished radio [noise] [noise]\nI'm voting WMA not what you were born Africans\nAnd online at nine forty WMA W. dot com\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News\nOn return to the search for answers is on after\nTwenty people twenty people were killed us go Harry in New York when the limousine failed to stop at an intersection hit pedestrians and a parked car National Transportation Safety Board chair Robert Sumwalt\nSunni fatalities as just\nI've been on the board for for twelve years and ah this was one of the biggest loss of life loss of lives that we've seen in a long long time in\nFact it's the deadliest transportation accident in the U.S in almost a decade\nAccording to the end of one of the victims the limousine modify two thousand one Ford Excursion was packed with people celebrating a birthday all Eighteen inside including Q A newly wed and the driver killed two other pedestrians nearby struck in the crash did not survive ABC's\nAerial rush of late in the season tropical activity blowing it sixty miles an hour a tropical storm Michael is hundred and forty miles or so south south west of Cuba's western tip heading for Florida's panhandle could be a category ... hurricane by Wednesday's landfall Florida governor Rick Scott today is the time to get a plan\nDo not put it off\nThere isn't any reason not to be prepared to keep your family say just declared states of emergency and twenty six Florida counties exiled Saudi journalist ... who wrote for the Washington Post vantage last week after a visit to the Saudi constantly in Turkey to show he was critical of the royal family some fear he was murdered\nTurkish authorities have publicly said they are investigating and journalists and Turkish authorities were allowed to inspect the concept and the ... appear to be empty that was not one that we see pictures of complex being opened there's nobody that so the question is where is Janelle now what happened to\nHave bases markets will for a SpaceX falcon nine rocket blasted out of California's Vandenberg air force base late last night but a communication satellite into orbit for Argentina the rockets first flew back to Vandenberg inland and you're listening to ABC News\nHave you ever thought about saying goodbye to your job just walking into your boss and saying I quit and how would you like to commute to work without ever leaving your home\nWell not long ago at thirty nine year old entrepreneur from a billionaire family spent twenty million dollars in three years to find the best home based business in North America he researched Seventy different companies and when he found the only one that had a real long term potential he bought it\nAnd right now he's looking for people to help him turn this company into his next billion dollar success story\nSo if you're serious about making money from home without having to leave your home will grab a pen because I'm about to give you the address of a website where you can learn all about this unique in rare opportunity write this down W.

as the north\nThe Green Bay the Green Bay Packers are just a mess offensively and and I was starting to touch on this in the first hour but\nI mean Aaron Rodgers I Am not putting like Aaron Rodgers completely out of the picture when it comes to blame because he did turn the ball over twice and it was for ...\nOkay the Packers were down twenty four nothing so early in this game for the life before you could blink\nBut you've gotta have the ability to stay balanced you've got to have the ability to run the football and the Packers do have plain makers like the Dallas Cowboys are in trouble right now because they don't have play makers and it it's just so evident\nThat ... got his nobody to throw the football to nobody I mean he's he's out there on an island man like seriously as detail Eliot had seven receptions that's formal receptions than any other cowboy that\nOnly two assumption tourist ... that was the most receptions by a cowboy wide receiver today and that was the aren't they Thompson to exceptions for Nineteen yard Tehran Austin at that one cat for forty four Rico Gathers one catch for thirty two so yeah sure you could say the cowboys had a little bit of a big place at factor tonight that was nice that they can we give them a round of applause for that I\nDon't know I [noise] I mean I saw some big place\nTonight I guess but that could barely get over two hundred yards it took the overtime so surprised that gets over two hundred yards so that's a team that doesn't have plain makers the Packers\nDante Adams is applying make or at least you know nine reception the hundred and forty yards Jimmy ... catches Seventy six yards but I I just you give away Jordan Nelson and I understand Jody Nelson was declining it's the same thing I look at the Packers and the cowboys and I say man\nThere is such a difference between last year and this year in terms of plane making in terms of the big play a factor and they both gave away their top wide receiver who I understand they were both declining\nPackers giveaway Jordan ounce and he was declining last year I get it as the regrets it or the desk Brian doesn't signed with the Dallas Cowboys I understand you know this is Brian regrets it but the difference between\nThese two offices in huge it really really is and the Packers I I ah you know if I if I'm power again these these teams in the ... the north\nOr the Packers I Know or to and what are what are they now they're two and a two to Institute two in one\nIt just think about this is Aaron Rodgers\nDoes not give you the brilliant fourth quarter then he gave you against the Chicago Bears back in the week one week to whenever that was we're looking at a completely different division the bears are in much more of a power position obviously over the Packers either the better team without a doubt overall everywhere if you look at the bears\nEverywhere except quarterback they're better everywhere\nKicker punter wide receiver defensive and cornerback\nEverywhere they are better than the Green Bay Packers except for quarterback and Aaron Rogers was really yesterday outside of it to form a foreigner forty two yards and three touchdown\nBut I'm telling you what we heard last week and I don't play it I think I'm going to go back on that because I I think that I I think there's the real deal is a real problem when Aaron Rodgers does not like the receivers that he has Aaron Rodgers does not like they're running game that he has can't trust the running game\nWhich are still trying to figure out why it\nAaron Jones average five point seven ... seven carried Jamal Williams average five point five yards of care he had six cares how do you have two running backs who average over five yards a carry only get Thirteen carries it a game\nWell one way is to go down twenty four nothing early but you could still go to what I felt it was forced I did not like the play calling for Green Bay today you've gotta you've ... you've got to be balanced in this week but I'll tell you what part of you tell me if I'm wrong if I'm power ranking Vienna the north right now\nI think I'm going Vikings one just because I trust the debts and the um I'm trying to find a whole\nAnd I can't find a whole on that team I Can't do it the bears ... can be a whole sometimes a tribute to you you have to baby him sometimes you have to take a duck I think I'm putting the team in the end of the north and I can't believe I'm famous because it is a quarterback leak and you can tell me if I'm wrong\nI think I'm putting the team but by far the best quarterback in the division as the third best team right now in the NFC North\nHow would you power right be out of the north I go Vikings bears Packers right now in terms of I think if we were in a play these games right now the Vikings will beat the bears the bike is will be the Packers and the bears would be the Packers that's how I'm basing this on I'll I'll go\nBiking Packers in their yoga I like the bears the fence but like you said ... can be a whole he could be a gay manager instead of a quarterback who can take over the\nGate having said that he did a successor they'd had it as well I don't ever which I'm not saying we're going to get out of that that's what I'm saying you know no you're right what\nDid you see that again this coming week I've been to buy a week I mean you don't know what Mitch which are basically you get to the game but I Know with Aaron Rodgers on we'll get to the\nGame yeah is it to be for this is it that day because everything is defense it's it's running game than the ... it's ... it's plain makers I urge or\nBy the way real quickly before we go to break the AFC North which we're going to get into a little bit next v I asked the north and the ... the north are really the two divisions right now where I'm scratching my head and I'm saying to myself how to do that is why I asked Emory that question I disagree with Emory are coming up next coming up next we'll do that we'll talk about the ... the north and we're going to\nTalk about the two or three you know teams who are not going to make the playoffs as overnight SB Nation ready

I've got a very big win today the Pittsburgh Steelers ray photo is our guest the covers the Steelers on the on a cell for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette fired outright before we get to the office which obviously was great today forty one Seventy and victory over there\nHe covers the Steelers and the NFL for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nOutright before we get to the office which obviously with great today forty one Seventeen victory over the Atlanta Falcons dealers was the two two and one of the season drawn to talking to one in four defensively that is obviously been concerned this year when it comes to Pittsburgh losing Ryan says here before we get into this game what is the biggest difference they used the on the field defensively just\nAs a whole if we're looking at the Steelers from a macro point of view this season where is it Ryan she fears loss to sell the most\nI think is just overall inconsistency all while she was a stabilizing force in the middle of that the fence or he was created against the wall and he was great against the hours\nMore ever had to take them off the field and the Steelers didn't address that I'm In the dry so they want us to take a linebacker in the first round but because they want to take 'em so they addressed it by signing free agent John Bostic\nHe's been okay um but he hasn't been for the level of rice said here so I just think the overall\nUm consistency in the middle of that the fed is has sort of been spotty through the first five games and if they could get that figure it out based on what they did take us the falcons maybe they can turn a corner a little bit but I still think this is science has a long\nWay to go what is the deal with Ryan says he or she ever going to play football again do we know\nWe don't know and I think the Steelers um I I think Ryan ... she plays again and I think that she always want him to have that um you know short care out there um for him but uh he's walking and I think so\nYou know the fact that he's walking after I'm not spinal cord and yeah spinal cord injury he suffered last December I I think that's probably\nThe best case scenario so we have about a affirmed final word yet on his career but it's a it doesn't look likely that is ever going to play\nWell thank God that he is walking it's so amazing to see those pictures of him on the sidelines cheering him when he is walking but let's get to this game Steelers over the falcons forty one Seventeen [laughter] what was what did they do right today like what would the Steelers go back and watch tape of this game what are they going to be most proud of\nWell I think they play complimentary football\nUm for the first time all she's really special teams or haven't been very good this year\nThey had to walk ... set up for ... for short field touchdown ah the the fence scored a touchdown so it was really all hands on deck yeah Ben Roethlisberger I'm Antonio Brown guck going today but I think it was just the first true sixty minute call for the Steelers this season\nAnd boy did they made it I mean if you want to drop on them all on 'em they would've had a tough time making the playoffs at the very least onto this game at Saturday Sunday at the very least I'm their income and so now I'm a regular Odessa\nYeah no ... without a doubt and it's a great division a race that Apollo was our guest covers the Steelers in the NFL for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette so James Caan or has another good day today a hundred and ten yards underground two touchdowns five point to yard to carry\nRe one of the things one of the points that I've been making on my show constantly this year and I and I want to run by you is that Ryan ... if he were to look at the last year's roster and this year's roster\nRyan ... has actually been the bigger loss compared to have you on bell if I were to tell you to write the guys that they had last year that they don't this year would you put Ryan ... as the bigger loss of lazy on bail simply because of what you just said they almost have ... ... they haven't replace\nRyan Shakespeare but James Caan or has had some good games this year is that fair to say that she fears the bigger lost about\nNo I I think that's fair and I think I'm going to lay the on the bed around him back James harder but James Carter hasn't been the issue for the Steelers running gag farm subsidies second won't Howard jak Russian Caesar and those are the free games they just really got away football they\nWeren't committed to it I think she saw today\nWhen they were committed to run it on the football I'm from the outset that pain that sort of set up a play actually the the post on the field to throw their proud so I think this was a good step in the right direction for the Steelers if they stay committed to the games um I think this off ...\nHaven't been able to watch a full Steelers game start to center so I Want to ask you this when it comes to how teams cover the Pittsburgh Steelers and I haven't really paid attention to this it would you miss shoes are issues there is a fantastic wide receiver ... is he always is facing single coverage because of the attention that Antonio Brown gas\nFor the most part yes I mean it's not that resemble play but he's opposing defensive coordinators had done their best\nTo take Antonio Brown I'm Out of these games if you look past\nI'm back at the past five seasons balmy he's had the most though he's not the most prolific\nFive seasons stretching on a film history in terms of an inch so um I really think the key and then later this year and it does open ended up working through Smith Schuster and some of the other titans and receivers on that team\nSchuster didn't have a great game today um I think he had less than forty are receiving but he did have a big touched on earlier on a source of fat off from the get some girl or the\nRace that Apollo is our guest covers the Steelers and the NFL for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette has play accent always played a major reason as to why as to why the Steelers passing game is good in other words than previous years\nTeams had to respect way beyond bell obviously so you could have just play off in El al ... you know these throw these long throws to Antonio Brown to do\nSo I think you kind of alluded to it but the fact that Connor did have a hundred and ten yards on the ground today I Would guess it that made Atlanta respect the running game and that was a major reason why the passing game was opened up\nAnd I think they have to do that or even a little bit over Sheepshead progress share\nUm when the Steelers um have gotten away from Iran\nAnd they're they just evolving into the shock on the team that's going to throw the ball [noise] um every play a good defense is like the ravens last week were able to stop them so\nI I think the more about what you are I think the bigger the your venue becomes\nBomb as an office of corner and I think first year often coordinator brand new feet are cold his best game of the season for 'em they're almost fifty fifty and run past balance and I think that's what this team has to do to be successful\nI just feel like that's a scene with a lot of teams this year do you look at the eagles and how they're kind of one dimensional little bit the Packers are a little bit one dimensional but definitely weren't today I've covered this deal is obviously for a while now which when you add\nHas been Ross burgers [laughter] you know he talked about retirement last year and how he wasn't sure if he was fully into what have you seen\nAny kind of regression at all from him like in terms of his skill and his ability like people talk about Tom Brady and say wow he's forty to whatever he is and he has it regrets at all have you seen any kind of progression in terms of Ben Roethlisberger his arm strength what he's able to do in the pocket his accuracy as you covered his team has he regrets at all\nNo I don't know if I were caught\nAnd in terms of ... arm strength what he's able to do in the pocket his accuracy as you covered his team has he regrets at all\nYou know I don't know if I Would call it over aggression the weird thing he's second in the NFL and pass so\nUm but he hasn't been themselves this year he he doesn't have that same connection with Antonio Brown his most recent game you know taken out of the equation and then finally got on track through high this year he hasn't been as accurate\nUm but I don't I don't sense that it's a problem with his arm strength I just sent us a problem with his timing is one thing to take away from today's care a hole in still toenail brown\nLaws are still only completed I think half of his targets to Antonio proud\nBut the fact that they completed a couple of deep balls and they finally got over a hundred years together I think that might be some sort of a jumping off point for those two because those two have been right this entire season as they can get right um I think that'll mean big things for the Steelers off\nLet me tell you a story about two families litter very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed paying for the mortgage\nUtilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life\nInsurance just go to Sandra insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible it
