Patrick bombs you know is that is his second game of the first season that he's getting to start all the games comes in those six touchdowns against the Steelers you're telling me that was in a cast against pets you have to go on the road in game number one\nTo play the Los Angeles chargers you're telling me that's not a task that over the course of the entire pockets this was the first test for Patrick my home's big test\nI think I did the cheeses why is even tested because the defense is awful still really really bad this is my concern\nWhen it comes to Kansas City it really is my concern\nUh playoffs you need that defense to make us that guess what they're quarterbacks in the lead who can make the throw that case in a mate do the\nDenver Broncos got the ball with like a minute and ten seconds on their own twenty five yard line\nAnd they almost went Seventy five yards after ... homes pulls off the brilliance Showtime that caller I still think they need a new name not show time then we have Showtime that was deion Sanders right wasn't deion Sanders Showtime\nWas primetime excuse me God now I feel terrible about that that was bad\n[laughter] that was not good Showtime I guess okay fine Dionne you can be prime time and moms to be Showtime after Showtime\nComes down and out scores the Broncos fourteen to three in the fourth quarter\nRight and your defense just is I mean dude this defense it's horrible they are the worst tackling team I've ever seen in like the last five\nYears maybe I think it's safe to say that the beginning of the game was going exactly how Denver wanted it to go\nThey were running the football well Royce Freeman\nReally really good Philip Lindsey really good combination and they did the Denver Broncos did at the beginning of this football game exactly what you had to\nDo to keep Showtime off the field something to do you run the ball when you're ... you know you wouldn't you wouldn't you there's a great quarterback on the other side you got to run the football\nAnd that's honest I keep going back because this is my team but I keep going back to the giants won Super Bowls against the patriots they kept on very off the field\nBecause they had to run again they're ruining game is still important in the NFL\nWhy the costs to go out and get lazy on bell 'cause then Andrew Luck won't have to throw the ball sixty sixty two times but if you're chief's fan and you're watching this\nYou just have to hope that the defense can get it figured out so they don't waste what potentially is a very very special rookie year\nIn Kansas City having said that they did come up with a big big stop down the stretch okay they did and now you\nCan talk about the hook and wider play I'm Bobby let me bring you in here real quickly before we go to break\nWas that the correct call to go with the hook them latter because to me you had to a U.S two options with that last play if that was the call to do like a crow route on ten yards the question was do you\nRisk running out of time and just receiving that ball and going down because when the Broncos receiver caught the ball past the first down there yet about twelve seconds\nSo do you risk not getting a play off which would have been the risk if he would have not done the whole can ladder or do you do with the Broncos did you take the risk and do the hook and water and risk getting out working obviously you know hindsight is twenty twenty\nYou would either one call and other play or just tell him to go down and hope that you can get another playoff but what did the Broncos make the right decision and the execution just wasn't there is that your read on what\nHappened I think that's what it was on a cordless phone and cut the ... I think the initial reaction was to hook in that it would Emmanuel centers curling up and receiving the ball but it just wasn't educated a perfectly because they've and mayors ended with the ... the law to to cut the hook like he would have been going up and gone to the end zone\nSo that's where you do give the chief defense a little bit of credit because there was a hand you're you're you're rolling your eyes a little bit and that stuck in there are a little bit you just think it was bad execution all Rochester and\nAll around by Denver I mean do you bring up the mayor's Thomas overthrown by case keen them I mean\nThat well that's the ... yeah that's the place the hooking ladder never should have happened you know this is our started lives off by saying you know Denver should have won the game yeah I mean that they they they there's no doubt about it yeah they I mean just overdose on them and now that I'm sad it's big dude that as a throw\nEvery NFL quarterbacks to me yeah let's be honest okay that's a that's a receiver who's wide open ... going down the side lied and you have a ball from the twenty five yard line\nOn the near sighted cash that you got to go to the far side of the field a wide open strict wide receiver down the sideline you've got to make that throw yeah do you do so look I mean I I Am taking nothing away from Patrick bumps bronco should have won the game tough day in Denver all around that's next door with an I\n... I mean the only thing that would've been interests me to really upped the ante confused for when it's available money not in the next thing you know your own two in one you know so [noise] but to me I think they know what they do is to do I think they're going to try to get the best offer and as soon as they speak in all Amy I'm only now\nJames Harrison Ford and if a space for the U.S [noise] uh\nCJ out saying hey I honestly goes if I may be on bill I totally agree on that was the day he said November thirteenth feels\nI come back to practice their numbers for November thirteenth does and I think an injury and practice so therefore I can give them credit for the season and I just feel go hand in pretty much in that strange that said if he really wants to do that I just because he's like he's going to be really wants to be more because we raise November thirteenth likely the guy if he's not backed\nBy November thirties which is we can see for for free agency tuned\nInto the sports right now we have from three to five eastern only on ... radio as they should have a man of you may remember me from all battles with ...\nYou should radio as the nation's\nTop man of you may remember me from up battles was Tom Brady you still in ... he is how to be twelve to Tom Joey both is exciting program where people can take their body more efficient and make more active will Peyton let me go oh\nManning is so good at that speed ...

S. E. C. championship game to watch which is to Alabama and Georgia that potentially there there'll be a one last team or because those two would play each other in that situation I Know this is a tough question to start but in that situation could you see the one last S. E. C. team getting in\nInstead of Notre Dame who in this scenario would be undefeated\nBaby um yeah I it's hard for me to imagine an undefeated major oh I see a major conference theme of course nobody not in a conference in football but\nYou know there that level of team it's hard for me to imagine a team of that caliber or team you know putting up an undefeated record getting left out then I probably won't believe it until I see it uh the situation you describe is probably the only situation would that could happen or\nWhere the you know you're only lost one of the playoffs team's probably the number one team that case then you don't see that happening but uh I ... I don't know ... thunder lead an undefeated Notre Dame would be\nUm I I think it's something to swallow but the thing about Notre Dame though with their strength is scheduled to be a problem and you know they can't predict Michigan is currently the only two right increments schedule I don't pretend you're tech crack but back in the polls this week or not but\nYou know they're playing without their starting quarterback now and they're you know us maybe they'll creep into the ranking says they don't let you get still has a lot of games so to Stanford so you know the end of the year you know what thirty kids will gonna be like that could have a bearing in that kind of stereo\nLet me ask you this question in ... Virginia Tech and they didn't call back and there are number twenty four this week so Notre Dame please average in effect do you see a loss a project that last time the rest of Notre Dame scheduled Pittsburgh navy northwestern Florida State Syracuse at USC Virginia Tech this week I mean to me it's a very reasonable thing to say Notre Dame is going to go undefeated\nWell it certainly get the paper and I believe in all of those games that you know if the if Josh jak who was playing for Virginia Tech this week I don't think Notre Dame the favor but that's not the case so uh you know the only other game really among bill that looked like a\nPotential problem may be lucky as us the that's the big rivalry game but the u._s. eats freshman quarterback will have also full season under itself by then so uh but yeah it's it's a uh\nI I think it's a situation where it got her name on the ... at this point will will be upset law\nYeah and then it's going to come down to Mandy we leave Georgia out or do we leave Alabama out is still make lump sum and Ohio State go the distance Jerry ... is our guest covers college football for CBS Sports you can follow Jerry's work on Twitter ... CBS\nAren't so Clemson south believes that Trevor Lawrence's injury as the next screen how serious should ... be taking the Clemson fan so I'll be looking at an injury like this regarding their quarterback\nWell be since ... if it's a deck spraying the watch because the you know a concussion you never know\nHow long you're going to be out with a concussion for the next grade he could probably come back from relatively quickly maybe even this week or the back of played well ah especially used as he got his feet and remote little bit later at that game to get their accused but you don't want to be in a position where you know you're doing that on the line at\nYou know that was the wrist or with a\nWith Brian leaving early\nYou know there are now you know you don't have a a period back up for an experience you know quarter back in the town is he is you know there's there is a drop off but he doesn't play so obviously confirmed that he stays healthy\nNo doubt about it I Want to go back to the snow to do this playoff situation here by when it comes down to an if Washington were to run the table or they obviously lost all burned to start the year but if Washington were to run the table\nOr is it safe to say that Washington strength of schedule would beat out Notre Dame the strength of schedule but Notre Dame would be undefeated in that situation obviously but in terms of strength of schedule who gets the edge in your opinion Washington or Notre Dame\nProbably Washington but it depends on how offered finishes the yearbook probably Wall Street to a field that but it wouldn't matter because they put the undefeated but the person really describe you know the the loser of the Alabama Georgia game\nWhy it's conference championship team to walk will be the number one team for\nThe committee right at the Washington doesn't have that luxury offerings are going to be that the upper one key so it's not really the same area oh by the strength of schedule is doing a battery but it it it just the fact regardless but the the last ... plants because of who they want to\nYeah no doubt about a series Tom our guest is college football for CBS Sports you can follow his work on winter at J. P. palm CBS what was your biggest takeaway from Penn State Ohio State that game obviously really good on Saturday either positively or negatively on either team just your biggest takeaway\nI don't really have any negative take away from me that last plane kind of curious play called I think they you know sort of over on it but uh yeah I thought they saw early with terrific\nFive and ... and into running and passing\nAgainst a pretty good Ohio State the parents I don't have your you know came back well in a game where he was really pressured and struggled at times he got Randall rattled to the point where you could go back further\nAnd uh and I thought he showed a lot of maturity especially with the fourth quarter leading that comes back it's a\nI thought it was just a really positive ripple he's obviously not much to take off but I don't think that they are quite poorly\nObviously there's a big separation between Alabama and Georgia Ohio State collapse in Alabama without a doubt clearly the number one team of the country but at this point in the season is how big of a separation is there between ... and guys like Duane Haskins and we'll greener when it comes to the Heisman Trophy\nWhile it's hard to say I mean I don't know the ban has really been fully tested\nOr get you know they haven't played the better and play though as you yet they haven't played Robert yet you know the\nBattle played Georgia or you know let's just be a ... the the championship keep going you know the better test they're coming from Alabama but then went to er put some big numbers in games like that you know that's where he has a chance to separate themselves I don't know that anybody you're kind of arena for themselves the high rate guess\nYeah I Know that's one of the I I just the fact that he has played a full ... makes that that whole thing interesting to me or LSU number five in the country job or oh three touchdown passes two hundred Ninety two yards but it was obviously again still miss what\nAre you buying the analysts you this year as the legitimate contender and what are your thoughts on Joe borough obviously the LSU passing game has improved from last year this year but just your overall thoughts on LSU in their future\nSuch just on Joe borough obviously the LSU passing game has improved from last year this year but just your overall thoughts on LSU in their future this year\nI was very skeptical at the beginning of the year and I thought they were free pizza number twenty five and I I I'll beat the pride stand up there a ... a worker eat\nUp the debate scheduled ...

I mean just than just the list of names Trevor stimulant broadcasts Wyler Paxton Lynch\nAnd none of them are good last year and I feel like if you're a Denver Broncos fan and you're watching this last drive and you're like oh man look we got him he can't him leading to try all the way down one twenty eight to do we've got about twenty five yard line\nI mean I ... I didn't think they were going to get as far down as they did which again is you know a big reason you know a big fault ... has to go to the Kansas City chiefs I mean that defense is just Swiss cheese man I mean really it is awful they can't tackle it is really bad\nAnd case Tina I'm leading them all the way down you're a\nBroncos fan you're thinking man All right was it that way out there and then on the last play the one that you needed to do that as a ... that is a throw that every NFL quarterbacks should make\n... times get five a corner right on the sideline twenty twenty five yards away and it's easy for me to say but I'm not an NFL quarterback I'm not being paid millions to to make that throw I'm being paid pennies on the dollar and talk to you here that's what I Do so look I mean tastes can't him he didn't get the job done today\nYou can look at the numbers and you can say our case can be good in the first half he was a good game manager like he's keen them had good\nGain manager numbers today two hundred and forty five yards Twenty one or thirty three of ... twelve and complete passes no touchdowns\nDid throw an interception but he was he was like managing the game the Broncos in the first half were running the football twenty carries between Philip Lindsay on Royce Freeman let's see if I could do math twenty carries a hundred and thirty six yards and two touchdowns that is what got Denver a lead\nIs running game you're not looking at the numbers how are you going to correct me\nNo no no I was like trying to think of like Russia's per yours like you know uh so I mean that's about like at least six yours brewers between both of those guys so\nYes I mean I'm guess what you mentioned the case keen on him and he looked okay like you look like what he which is supposedly like when you got to run again bad than good and the first half he'd be going to\nHave this project does make the necessary plays on third down in three if it gets to those situations like pays Keno didn't have to take over the game and like you said earlier the Broncos was over thinking I started off because we've got to be aggressive we gotta we\nGotta run its puzzles type style of spread offers like the ... and\nThey got to you again yeah they didn't see you again we're in the ball rolling the bombs that Europe is gay should have been thirty the Thirteen ...\nSo that's what you were thinking you know it's I I that's what I said in the first hour huh so that's what you were thinking as you were watching you know when I when I was thinking when I was watching it on like why are they I I all I kept thinking was\nPatrick well homes ... in his fourth no I guess it's a fifth career start for her so this is the impact that Patrick malone's he is intimidating the Broncos yeah that's what I was thinking he is affecting the play calling on the other side\nAnd it was twenty three Thirteen that's a and it was for a quarter like those are those are the type of moments where you just run the ball\nTwenty three Thirteen nine minutes to go nine and a half minutes ago I think I lost that yeah you're on the ball\nThe bend you get first they're not the first thing you do what you were doing in the first half of them and I I just didn't think that that was what they do I I\nAnd look I mean look this is what Brady dies then what Rogers does this is like oh my goodness if we don't get a first down here on this one play and we don't get it right here oh they're going to ride is going to ...\nThis is like oh my goodness if we don't get the first down here on this one play and we don't get it right here oh they're going to write is going to come back on the field and he's going to he's going to score and it that way you're gonna have exactly what Patrick bones today\nYou know to to quit turned on drugs\nThirteen of sixteen lawn does touchdown Dr ... for a hundred and fifty three yards a hundred and Ninety two yards passing outside of the pocket that is the most amount of passing yards outside of the pocket by any quarterback in the NFL and the past decade\nIncredible Kansas City breaking the heart of Denver sports fans for the second time today\nWhat was the first time that that do it and I\nThis is pushing the God [noise]\nI think the Panthers plus sick they lost seven I mean those are the games are given to them you know where but I mean that's a team of the authors I thought that we were lucky outright and they had some opportunities to store back leave they had a leak dry I don't know what in the world Cam Newton was doing\nIn the last two minutes of that game they hadn't one time out there down by seven\nThey had no urgency\nNone they took their time they're walking to the line of scrimmage I'm up there going guys if you need to feel fine\nIn which I if they were going to kick a field goal I was cool with that but it is that what a covered and I would have been on the radio today talking about the fact that the Carolina Panthers new to the point spread because they they were playing for a field goal and there was no point to get a feel go down by seven but they did it anyway that didn't happen but they had no urgency\nTo end up pushing me on Monday through friday for new the three eastern on SB Nation radio\nBusiness like ... or ... you think Dallas hopping ... where's your San Antonio takeout

take care of the cubs today three to one so there's a plane game today cubs\nWe'll play the Rockies tomorrow Yankees in athletics who are the pitcher is going to be in that game ooh both managers are playing the game of cat and mouse who's gonna bite first who's going to reveal who they're starting pitchers going to be going to be Jay ...\nThat's going to be an interesting game how the Yankees manage that game it's going to be very fascinating to me because last year Louis Severino goes just one inning\nAnd part of the Joe Jr already brilliance Bobby beads was piecing together when things failed for the week Severino how he managed and obviously you get the pictures a lot of credit for going the rest of the time\nBut how he was able to master piece eight innings of baseball together after your starting pitcher you added ... ... if you're the Yankees last year you at a definitive eight and it was several you know there is no definitive base for the Yankees this year\nOkay Jay happens your guy J has the hottest of all of them right now but he's not that I'm a classified Jay half as a bona fide ace Berliners a bona fide age ... sales up bona fide it\nAll right uh Jay half not a bona fide age and you can't piss Luis ... who used to have a RINO a you hit the IRA and the second half of the seasons like five point for the ... the last three or four stars has not been great there's no bona fide age to the Yankees at\nSo that's and by the way the Yankees the da's don't have that either Sherman I so that this could come down to I think it could come down to a screw up by a manager keeping a pitcher in too long\nFor letting him you know or or or um or not not long enough bringing in the wrong pitcher\nI really think that this playing game Yankees versus they going to be fascinating um is that should be fun so that's coming up tomorrow Jon less diverse Kyle freeway and coming up today and Rocky's versus cause but I I just want to make this one point here before we do bet that gets that line I Want to just go back to how difficult it is to be a Marlins fan\nBecause they arguably two years ago\nHad the best power hitter in the game and John Carlos Dan\n[noise] one of the best young and up and coming baseball players in Christian yell at each\nAnd one of the best pitchers in all of baseball that would be Jose Fernandez and it's obviously so sad what happened with Jose Fernandez his death\nOn a boat but when you really think about it they had those three guys and when you look across baseball right now the cornerstones of the great teams are built on three guys the red Sox ... JD Martinez Christian Bale\nHouston Astros Justin ... Jose all too very Alex bragging at\nThe cornerstone of an obviously those teams are filled out there are a little bit but the Marlins had those three guys that they needed and I obviously the moral instinct now but if you just look two years ago this is why it's typical Jose Fernandez was a tremendous pitcher tremendous pitcher\nAnd obviously John Carlos Stanton is helping a playoff team the Yankees and Christian yellow which is going to win the national league MVP this year so the Miami Marlins\nThis has happened before but then too you know that pledge Rodriguez ... of the list goes on and on and on\nIt's got to be so so difficult but that's what it takes I really think of baseball three guy and I think one of them has to be a pitcher it takes three guys for you to really come into a season and say All right I Believe that my team can go the distance this year All right let's go get\nThat line and asked out Bobby beats I have nothing in\nFront of me I don't know anything um I I actually\nHave not been keeping my record on this\nI I think I'm doing okay I sort of really good week one I think I hit three right on the money [noise]\nOkay so if you\nKnow this game that we have played every single week if I Do get the answer right [noise] then Bobby is going to play\nIf I get the answer wrong I got to come within two on these NFL lives if I get the answer wrong you'll hear that\nI have to come with the two of what the line is [noise] for weeks five of the NFL season about if you want to throw a college game in there and just you know throw me off\nTo jail for her to do that you've made me looked on that side All right\nWhat's our first came out of the first game to me on the list that is for my curiosity ah Minnesota Vikings versus the facility\nOh the first game gives me on the list that is from ... uh Minnesota Vikings versus the Philadelphia to\nWrite this book to us again by the side dot com you promote code when one twenty five and get a one hundred twenty five percent bonus at the dotcom alright\nPhiladelphia Eagles home for the Minnesota Vikings\nPhiladelphia Eagles losing a close game against the Indianapolis Colts obviously a minute what am I talking about they did that two weeks ago they beat the cold they lost the Tennessee Titans last week\nMinnesota Vikings are also coming off a tough loss these are two mad teams Bobby too mad team Minnesota on the road against Philadelphia I'm going to say don't obviously a Super Bowl winners [noise]\nI don't think it's more than a field goal but I'm trying to figure out which way I Want to go here alright Philadelphia's at home I think it's a pick up I'm gonna say really mind as to\n\nA actually fairly favor yeah the only by three by three\nSomething within two maybe within I got the Iowa okay Philly mind yet sounds about right like I mean honestly like\nMinnesota going on the road I I I I Would like to I think I think Minnesota's the better team overall yeah but the fact that Phillies at home and Minnesota I just have to last ... one of them the buffalo ... but they're both they can go to the history of the game I think it'll be a fantastic came to that tape I Want\nTo go about and that will be a late night late afternoon they okay a lot of the early or how about this right here in\nNew York times during the Carolina Panthers oh man what a horrible game this is going to be this is in New York this is actually a very well\nGod it's going to be worse it's going to be ... it's going to be okay it's it's definitely at least touched outlook the giants officers law they I've lost all ... they bought two out of three I was getting my whole back and body\nLike I was like a used in the tent made me get my whole back a little bit as the week before that against Dallas you can't protect anybody can throw the ball down to build\nThe eyes but say going Barclay had sixteen targets for it because they are they're just dumping and dumping a dump it and so that might not confident the turning a little bit if they beat Houston and then it just back to ...

the\nNecessity I don't have the exact quote in front of me unfortunately but he was talking about how the role of the point guard\nIs to distribute and if they point guard is shooting the ball twenty five twenty six twenty seven times the game\nThan what they are doing actually is hurting the teen\nNot only in terms of the points that you were able to put up and the winds that you are able to get but they hurt the mo Jo and the chemistry of a basketball team because you're kind of taught growing up Bobby that if you are a point guard you are supposed to distribute that is your job that's why the\nParallel that people make all the time between football and basketball is\nThe quarterback is the point guard of the team and the point guard is the ... and you know the quarterback\nThat people

Seventy five yards to go okay they were able to get all the way down the field and they had a play\nWhere they come to this is after the failed attempt to dumb areas Thomas downside like they have a play where they try to force it to a wide receiver do you remember his name\n... okay Sutton catches the ball with ... seconds to go in bounce Broncos have no time outs\nHe catches the ball in balance and he tries to hook in the latter play which is one balls that you have a call right there by Vance Joseph that was designed to trying to pitch it to I guess the NATO Sanders right\nAnd so it the conversion was not completed and the ball was stripped away and complete pass game over so a lot of people are saying what are they doing\nWhy didn't sudden just go to the ground and then you can go to the line and you could spike the ball and you can get one more point oh you make it sound so easy people in that camp\nTo gather yourself if they're forced out of ten first of all there would've been confusion because it was very close whether he got the first now\nAnd so at that point the referees I guarantee you the referees would have had some kind of hesitation on is this the first down as it's not till we moved the chains do we not\nMeanwhile clock is tick tick tick tick ticking case keen of trying to get everybody up to the line there would've been an issue I guarantee you Bobby if you go back and you watch the play there would have been an issue with the spotted the ball\nAnd so and I and even if there wasn't an issue I Do believe and I'll ask you this do you believe that they would have had time with ... seconds to go that's when he caught the ball okay\nGet the ball the referee referee puts it in the middle of a field case Cain and telling everybody All right and that's because like the boss like the ball who knows there's eleven people on the field maybe there's that one dumped person that stupid left tackle or stupid left guard is like they can only ... maybe we run a play here you know\nTwelve seconds that's all you would have had not even ten seconds eleven seconds that's all you would have had to gather yourself get\nTo the launch scrimmage and spike the football on a play where we're not even sure if the spot would have\nBeen spotted they first out so would that have been the correct way to go or do you take the risk on the hook them ladder not working\nAnd that's what they chose to do they chose to take the risk on the hook up by the way the play was probably call I don't know if this question was asked do you know the U.S through the press so I don't know if there was asked was that the caller was that in ...\nOn the button set and decide oh I'm catching this and we might not have time so Emanuel Sanders ... like do you think that was that was a play called right\nI think it was I mean it was it a little designed to be the play but it just wasn't executed\nWill there wasn't executed well both would they have been better off to just call the play without the hook up the ladder would they have time to get another playoff or opinion\nThat me and my opinion just the spotlight when he ... he was behind the first known to get it within the for progress kind of dragged him out that's when he tried to do the latter part of the who is allowed to shut up though it's a man he was saying the ... the spotting though the\nBall you think that would've been a problem that would have been a problem that that is what I'm saying yeah those are the\nFor progress of the heat of and try to get down like ... and tried to get everybody together\nThat would have been a problem that's what I'm saying yeah those are the for progress of the heat of and try to get down like ten seconds and trying to get everybody together that would have been complete chaos is what they might have been like a second or two left on the ...\nYeah and and do you take that risk\nLike I'm ... the coaching staff is not done they were looking at the clock and they were trying to figure out what the best play call was they needed to get the necessary artist which was ten eleven yards so that they they felt very confident I think just in that crowd route and general\nDude it was very close to being executed\nIf they would have been able to get that a hand\nOff to a manual Sanders I mean if he catches that he might go in the ... you really want or\nNeed to get to add about about about split at least six or five or five or six seconds on a\n... do you think would have gone out of bounds\nOr he would have made a way for hundreds of the get out of a relief so I'm thinking of the play he had a low crease right there on and uh so yeah he could have got about ... says some time\nI think a lot of people in Denver today on the shows are going to just questioned the call and they're going to say really\nYou think you could execute a hook and\nLike I mean seriously the the announcer was was\nKind of blown away at the call but I just you know that's a tough one that's a tough situation or the other option those were the options want it to\nThe other option to take a shot at the end zone that yeah you could you could have tried for twenty are tasked with you know Denver's good receive it may know standards to marry St Thomas can't double team both of them\nSo I mean that would that would have been the other option but this is all you know in the past the Kansas City chiefs are porno and Alex gold previously or the last show he was talking about all you know it spreads protected I've all just wait until ... comes back to earth\nI don't know if this guy coming back to earth than he looks like the real deal still I mean we can ... the girls are impressive touchdown depressive but the point you brought up about the no interceptions\nThat might be the most impressive thing when you look at Patrick moms in what he's been able to do this year I when we come back we're going to look at every single three and one team in the NFL\nAnd I'm going to tell you are they legitimate contenders to make the conference championship game or not this is over than I\nDid this just over the night with Medicare up probably play

E. C. championship game to watch which is to Alabama and Georgia that potentially there there'll be a one last team\nAh because those two would play each other in that situation I I Know this is a tough question to start but in that situation could you see the one last S. E. C. team getting in instead of Notre Dame who in this scenario would be undefeated\nBaby um yeah I it's hard for me to imagine and undefeated major art major copper theme of course they're not in a conference in football but\nYou know there that level of team it's hard for me to imagine a team of that caliber are getting you know putting up and undefeated record getting left out then I probably won't believe it until I see it uh the situation you describe is probably the only situation where they're going to happen or\nWere you know you're only wants to want to play off probably the number one team in that case and uh you know maybe that happened but uh I I don't know ... undid lead an undefeated Notre Dame will be\nUm I I think it's something to swallow but the thing about Notre Dame though they're going to schedule could be a problem and you know the Stanford Michigan is currently the only way you get ... back in the polls this week or not but\nYou know they're playing without their starting quarterback now at ... you know us the maybe they'll creeping ranking to Michigan still have a lot of games or some Stanford so you know the end of the year you know what thirty kids will be like that could have a bearing in that kind of stereo\nLet me ask you this question at Virginia Tech and they didn't call back in their number twenty four this week so Notre Dame played that Virginia Tech do you see a loss of projected loss on the rest of Notre Dame scheduled Pittsburgh navy northwestern Florida State Syracuse at USC Virginia Tech this week I mean to me it's a very reasonable thing to say Notre Dame is going to go to defeat it\nWell it certainly could be favored I Believe in all those games that you know if you're just jak or was playing for Virginia Tech this week I don't know today with the paper but that's not the case so uh you know the only other game really among the ... on like a\nCentral problem maybe one of us the that's the big rivalry game let\nUs each freshman quarterback oh have multiple though by then so uh but yeah it's it's a uh I I think it's a situation where they ... at this point ... ...\nYeah and then it's going to come down to demand do we believe Georgia out or do we leave Alabama out assuming collapsed in Ohio they go the distance Jerry ... is our guest covers college football for CBS Sports you can follow Jerry's work on Twitter at gp palm CBS\nSo Clemson staff believes that Trevor Lawrence's injury as the next greenhouse serious should ... be taking that Clinton fans so I'll be looking at an injury like this regarding their quarterback\nWell her being spent the next spring well watch because you know it can charge you ever know oh you're going to be out with a concussion ... rain he could probably come back\nIt's an extreme but they're still watch because you know it can judge that you never know\nHow long you're going to be out with a concussion for the next grade he could probably come back from relatively quickly maybe even this week or the back of played well ah especially just as he got his feet under him a little bit later at that game to get their split you don't want to be in a position where you know you're doing that all the law I\nKnow that was the risk a with a\nWith Brian leaving early\nYou know there are now you know you don't have on a theory it's back up for an inexperienced no quarterback in the town is the is you know there there is a drop off if he doesn't play so obviously concerned that he said ...\nNo doubt about it I Want to go back to this noted in his playoff situation here boss when it comes down to it if Washington were to run the table or they obviously lost the offering to start the year but if Washington were to run the table\nOr is it safe to say that Washington strength of schedule would beat out Notre Dame the strength of schedule but Notre Dame would be undefeated in that situation obviously but in terms of strength of schedule who gets the edge in your opinion Washington or Notre Dame\nProbably Washington but it depends on how offered finish it a year but probably washy or is that what it wouldn't matter because Notre Dame put the undefeated but for the person area you describe you know the the loser of the Alabama Georgia game\nLost his conference championship game to walk we will be the number one team\nFor the committee right or the Washington doesn't have that luxury Auburn Dr ... number one ... so it's not really the same scenario ... by the strength of schedule is going to matter it just it just a Packer regardless but the the last ... plants because they want us to\nYeah no doubt about Jerry Palmer guest summers college football for CBS Sports you can follow his work on winter at J.

is my concern ah playoffs\nYou need that defense to make a stop guess what they're quarterbacks in the lead who can make the throw that case in a mate dude the\nBroncos got the ball with like a minute and ten seconds on their own twenties\nThe throw that case ski in a mate do the Denver Broncos got the ball with like a minute and ten seconds on their own twenty five yards wide and they almost went Seventy five yards after ... home pulls off the brilliance Showtime that column I still think they need a new name\nNot show time do we have Showtime that was deion Sanders right wasn't deion Sanders show time he was proud to excuse me God now I feel terrible about that that was bad [laughter]\nThat was not good Showtime I guess okay fine Dionne you can be prime time and moms can be Showtime after Showtime comes down and out scores the Broncos fourteen to three in the fourth quarter\nRight and your defense just is I mean dude this defense it's horrible they are the worst tackling team I've ever seen in like the last five\nYears maybe I think it's safe to say at the beginning of this game was going exactly how Denver wanted it to go they were running the football well Royce Freeman really really good Philip Lindsey really good combination and they did the Denver Broncos did at the beginning of this football game exactly what you had to do to\nKeep Showtime off\nThe field something to do you run the ball\nWhen your defense you know when you when you there's a great quarterback on the other side you got to run the football and that's an artist I keep going back because this is my team but I keep going back to the giants won Super Bowl is against the patriots they kept Tom Brady off the field because they had to run again\nThe ruining game is still important in the NFL\nWhy the coach to go out and get\nLevy on bell 'cause then Andrew Luck on after throw the ball sixty sixty two types but if you're chief's fan and you're watching this you just have to hope that the defense can get it figure it out so they don't wait what potentially is a very very special rookie year in Kansas City\nHaving said that they did come up with a big big stop down the stretch okay they did and now you can talk about the hook and wider play I'm Bobby let me bring you in here real quickly before I go to break\nWas that the correct call to go with the hook them ladder because to me you had to a U.S two options with that last play if that was the call it a bit like a crow route on ten yards\nThe question was do you risk running out of time and just receiving that ball when going down because when the Broncos receiver caught the ball past the first down stick you had about twelve seconds\nSo do you risk not getting a play off which would have been the risk if he would have not done the whole can ladder or do you do with the Broncos did you take the risk and do the hook and butter and risk it not working obviously you know hindsight is twenty twenty\nYou would either one call another play or just tell them to go down and hope that you can get another playoff\nBut what did the Broncos make the right decision and the execution just wasn't there is that your read on what\nHappened I I think that's what it was a cordless phone and cut the ... I think the initial reaction was to hook a ladder would Emmanuel centers curling up and receiving about ... to a perfectly because if it mayors ended with a cut above poodle cut the hook like he would have been gone ever gone to the end zone\nSo that's where you give the chiefs the fence a little bit of credit because there was a hand you're there you're rolling your eyes a little bit the way and that stuck in there are a little bit you just think it was ...\nDown here and all around about Denver I mean do you bring the mayor's Thomas overthrown by case keen them I mean\nThat ... well that's the point yeah that's the play off the hook in ladder never should have happened you know this is how it started off by saying you know Denver should have won the game yeah I mean they they they there's no doubt about it yeah they I mean just overthrown him and now that status big dude that as a throw\nEvery NFL quarterbacks should make yeah let's be honest okay that's a that's a receiver who's wide open mhm going down beside lied and you have a ball from the twenty five yard line on the near side has that you've got to go to the far side of the field a wide open strict wide receiver down the sideline you got to make that throw yeah you do you do\nSo look I mean I I Am taking nothing away from Patrick bumps\nBronco should've won the game tough day in Denver all around that's next door\nIs a force right I mean the only thing that would've been interesting to me to really upped the ante ... what is the AOL Monday Night and the next thing you know your own two in one you know so\nBut to me I think they know what they do exist or do I think they're going to try to get the best offer and that sort of a speaking of levy on male and female James hairs in warmer and it's a Pittsburgh Steelers are\nThe J out saying hey I honestly goes if I'm lend me on bill I totally agree on that was the day he said November thirteenth feels\nI come back to practice their numbers for November thirteenth and then I think an injury and practice so therefore I can give them credit for the season and I just feel go hand in pretty much in that's James is saying if he really wants to do that aren't just because he's playing like you're going to be really wants to be more of a week since November thirteenth likely the he's a he's not backed\nBy November thirties which we can see for for free agency\nTune into the sports right now we have from three to five Easter and that only on as a nation radio just as bad as the nation radio\nEvery weekday from into three sang tune into all of the nation radio for life points from Las Vegas Vegas angle on all boy from the NFL to the NBA on fishing the odds they've never on solemn out on Twitter asks voice ...\nThis is Carla from Toronto Raptors you're listening to ask ...\n... out of the nation rainy of enlist in all the time all the nation live downtown\nPhoenix should have you done to the Mexican restaurants yes I have how much do you pay for chips and salsa nothing's really anything I don't pay anything they come right in the table and they bring me the solvent I just started and the fact that the rebels hotel you got to be twenty two dollars song\nYou ... chips with fire roast is also in Guatemala that guacamole and veteran made in Mexico and blown up or driven up that day oh you gotta be kidding where people want to you know you get the first place for places like ten dollars thirty thirty bucks\nThis was like prices for like an apocalypse right who are like we haven't seen an apple in Twenty years or this is the last two major you will ever that end up planet earth like the guys are Chaplin from the burned out faces walking around with burned up cars in the city and they're just like I've never even seen a banana\nSB Nation I Am with Jodie weekday mornings from six to nine eastern bunch as a nation radio\nActually watch your team play might kill nowhere to go through that ... ... ... eastern half and Dallas Fort Worth and telling him in the bars of their favorite diamonds and having all the more\nYou leave town maybe some of the best places to shop for see something in a site called your math has extensive coverage on all the things put him in the city or a\nHundred dot com dot com\n[noise]\nHunter map dot com or ... ...

E. C. championship game to watch which is to Alabama and Georgia that potentially there there'll be a one last team\nBecause those two would play each other in that situation I I Know this is a tough question to start but in that situation could you see the one last S. E. C. team getting in instead of Notre Dame who in this scenario would be undefeated\nBaby um yeah I it's hard for me to imagine an undefeated major major copper record or indicted accomplishment football but\nYou know there that level of team part for me to imagine a game of that caliber are getting you know putting up an undefeated record getting left out that probably won't believe it until I fear the situation you describe probably the only choice record but ah\nYou know you're only wants to want to play off the probably the number one team in that case then you don't do that but uh I Know why I don't know ... undid leader undefeated Notre Dame would be\nUm I I think it's something to swallow but the thing about Notre Dame though they're trying to schedule could be a problem and you know the Stanford Michigan currently the only Jew right over the crack back in the polls this week or not but\nYou know their way without their starting quarterback now it ... you know us the maybe the ranking illness is still have a lot of students pampered though you know the end of the year you know what thirty kids will be like that\nYou may be they'll creep into the ranking too you know they should get still has a lot of tough game so to Stanford so you know at the end of the year you know what thirty kids will be like that could have a bearing in that kind of stereo\nLet me ask you this question in Virginia Tech it and they didn't call back and there are number twenty four this week so Notre Dame please have Virginia Tech do you see a loss of projected loss on the rest of Notre Dame scheduled Pittsburgh maybe northwestern Florida State Syracuse at USC Virginia Tech this week I mean to me it's a very reasonable thing to say Notre Dame is going to defeat it\nWell it certainly get the paper and I believe in all of those games that ... you know if the if Josh jak was playing for Virginia Tech this week I don't think not hurting it would be favored but that's not the case so that you know the only other game really among those that looked like a\nPotential problem may be looking at us the that's a big rivalry game but the U.S each freshman quarterback will have most of the ... the ... by then though that but yeah it's it's a a\nI think it's a situation where ... ... ... at this point will will be upset law\nYeah and then it's going to come down to a man do we leave Georgia out or do we leave Alabama out assuming Clemson at Ohio State go the distance Jerry palm is our guest covers college football for CBS Sports you can follow Jerry's work on Twitter ... people on CBS\nSo Clemson south believes that tremor Lawrence's injury as a next screen how serious should ... be taking that Clemson fan so I'll be looking at an injury like this regarding their quarterback\nWell being sent to the extreme that they're still watch because you know it's interesting you never know\nHow long you're going to be out with a concussion for the next spring he could probably come back from relatively quickly maybe even this week or the back of played well uh especially used as he got his feet and remote little bit later at that game to get Syracuse but you don't want to be in a position where you know you're doing that on the line at\nKnow that was the risk a with a with Brian leaving early you know that are now you know you don't have a very it's back up for adoption experience you know quarter back in the town is the is you know there there is a drop off so he doesn't play so obviously there was a concern that these days don't\nNo doubt about it I Want to go back to the ... did his playoffs situation here by when it comes down to it if Washington were to run the table or they obviously lost the offering to start the year but if Washington were to run the table\nOr is it safe to say that Washington strength of schedule would beat out Notre Dame the strength of schedule but Notre Dame would be undefeated in that situation obviously but in terms of strength of schedule who gets the edge in your opinion Washington or Notre Dame\nProbably Washington but it depends on how a ... year but probably washy there's a real good but it wouldn't matter because the other day with the undefeated but for the first that area that you describe you know the the loser of the Alabama Georgia game\nLost his conference championship team to walk will be the number one team\nFor the committee right at the Washington does it have that luxury Auburn dot going to be that number one key so it's not really the same scenario or the strength of schedule a battery but it it it just a factor regardless but the the last ... plants because of who they want to\nYeah no doubt about uh Jerry Palmer guest summers college football for CBS Sports you can follow his work on winter at J. P. palm CBS what was your biggest takeaway from Penn State Ohio State backing him obviously really good on Saturday either positively or negatively on either team just your biggest takeaway\nI don't really have any negative take away that mean that last plane kind of curious play called I think they\nYou know sort of over on it but\nUh yeah I thought so early with terrific five and ... and into running and pass state\nAgainst a pretty good Ohio State the parents don't have gifts you know came back well in a game where he was really pressured and struggled at times he he got Randall but he did get rattled to the point where he could come back from it\nAnd uh and I thought he showed a lot of maturity especially you know the fourth quarter leading that comes back it's a\nI thought it was just a really positive game purple themes obviously that let's take off but\nI don't think that they ...\nObviously there's a big separation between Alabama and Georgia Ohio State Clemson Alabama without a doubt clearly the number one team of the country but at this point in the season and how big of a separation is there between to what end guys like Duane Haskins and we'll greener when it comes to the Heisman Trophy\nWhile it's hard to say I mean I don't think that'll be an has really been fully ... at\nA gas you know they haven't played the better they haven't played LSU yet played on her yet you know the\nBattle of lake Georgia it you know which would be a teacher in the ... keep going you know the better test are coming from Alabama and then went to er put some big numbers and games like that you know that's where he had a chance to separate themselves I don't know that anybody is ready to do the height of the race I guess\nYeah I think that's one of the I I just the fact that he has a plate of food ... makes that that whole thing interesting to me or LSU number five in the country Joe borough three touchdown passes two hundred Ninety two yards but it was obviously again still miss what's yours\nAre you buying LSU this year as a legitimate contender and what are your thoughts on Jill borough obviously the LSU passing game has improved from last year this year but just your overall thoughts on LSU in their future this year\n... I I was very skeptical at the beginning of the year and I thought they were free seat the number twenty five and I thought that I'll be deprive the stand up there because I didn't think they weren't going to be\nUp to the face the schedule they ... the Miami um they want to offer so you know that they show that there is a contender there's somebody they got it right away and make it Alabama and Georgia and oh\nSo you know those are obviously going to be very difficult to fight the other dog can both be thinking of the fat burns so\nYou know I think you've got to take you seriously by the playoff or adults take them down\nYeah no I ... without a doubt Jerry ... is our guest covers college football for CBS Sports you can follow Jerry's work on winter Sanjay people on CBS or CBS let's go to the big twelve or the big game is going to happen at the very end of the year between Oklahoma in West Virginia but based off of what you've seen from both of those teams so far\nSo then if you're faced with Alabama and Georgia and Notre Dame\nOnly two of those teams could get it yeah it Georgia and Alabama or on the table we were talking about this briefly yesterday in Georgia and Alabama run the table and they're only lost one of those teams is going to have to lose because they're going to play each other and the championship game [noise]\nSo do you put the potentially undefeated Notre Dame and or do you put Georgia Alabama apply the way this is why we should have play a game of college football because he had the exact same situation last year except it was Alabama who lost the SEC title game and it was either of them are all how safe\nAnd that committee chose to put them in would they leave Notre Dame out in that situation I'll leave you with that over the night I finished

I mean just the just the list of names Trevor simian ... Wyler Paxton Lynch\nAnd none of them are good last year and I feel like if you're a Denver Broncos fan and you're watching this last drive and you're like oh man book we gotta teach can't him leading the track all the way down one twenty eight to do that's about twenty five yard line\nI mean I don't think I didn't think they were going to get us far down as they did which again is you know a big reason you know a big fault ... has to go to the Kansas City chiefs I mean that defense is just Swiss cheese man I mean really it is awful they can't tackle it is really bad\nAnd case cane I'm leading them all the way down you're a Broncos fan you're thinking man All right well the hell out there\nAnd then on the last play the one that you needed to do that as a ... that is a throw that every NFL quarterbacks should make\nThe ... by the corner right on the sideline twenty twenty five yards away and it's easy for me to say but I'm not an NFL quarterback I'm not being paid millions to to make that throw I'm being paid pennies on the dollar and talk to you here that's what I Do so look I mean case can't him\nHe didn't get the job done today you can look at the numbers and you can say I K scam good in the first half he was a good game manager like he's keen um had good gain manager numbers today two hundred and forty five yards Twenty one thirty three a fish and twelve and complete passes no touchdowns\nDid throw an interception but he was he was like managing the game the Broncos in the first half were running the football twenty carries between Philip Lindsay on Royce Freeman but see if I could do at twenty carries a hundred and thirty six yards and to touch that that is what got Denver a lead\nIs the running game you're not looking at the numbers how are you going to correct me\nNo no no I was like trying to think of like Russia's per yours like you know a ...

well homes ... in his fourth no I guess it's a fifth career start if of course this is the impact that Patrick bonds\nHe is intimidating the Broncos yeah that's what I was thinking he is affecting the play calling on the other side\nAnd it was twenty three Thirteen that's a and it was for a quarter like those are those are the type of moments where you just run the ball twenty three Thirteen\nNine

JD Martinez Christian Bale\nHouston Astros Justin ... Jose all too vague Alex bragging at\nThe cornerstone of an obviously those teams are filled out there are a little bit but the Marlins had those three guys that they needed I obviously the moral instinct now but if you just look two years ago this is why it's difficult Jose Fernandez was a tremendous pitcher tremendous pitcher\nAnd obviously John Carlos ... is helping a playoff team the Yankees and Christian college is going to win the national league MVP this year so the Miami Marlins\nThis has happened before but then too you know that pledge Rodriguez ... the list goes on and on and on it's got to be so so difficult but that's what it takes I really think of baseball three guy and I think one of them has to be a pitcher it takes three guys for you to really come into a
