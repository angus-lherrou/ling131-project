us he covers the ramp Orange County register you can follow riches work on winter I'm rich underscore Hamad aren't rich all obviously there's a number of things that are really impressive about their team\nIf I were to ask you to pick the most impressive thing what would that be\nWhy I think just the office of consistency of everybody saw the rats often labs are and what Boise toward but personally I was\nConcerned about a regression just because you know ... year of of have to watch that office to watch what chocolate said ah does this game comes up with the formation I thought they the you know there'd be a little bit of with us but there was this one starts out all of this but the habit of five\nOr thirty points every game or advertising for over four hundred fifty yards per game and then even that old on rent or with their top three receivers parental\nPerk up all go out and they still has the second half of the east coast so the way that they've been able to hold the ball a book like that or maybe it shouldn't be surprised but the bill has been the post office or\nDo we have any updates regarding the injuries that happened on Sunday\nYeah I mean you never know with somebody and we all do you know it felt like a a spring break or something really can't predict how the brain react but for\nEverything that job like that so it's like it's the best case scenario I guess the best way to put it to a neither one of those guys it's like a lingering symptoms but they think OK ... after the game a day of course there is a political as we know so it's kind of out of the rams fans are really out of the players and\nI just kind of how they respond ear over the next couple of days but generally pretty optimistic that they both of those guys cook for a cup of like be able to play with other\nRich and our guest covers the Los Angeles ramps you can follow riches work on Twitter enriched underscore Hamad does it for the Orange County register okay so the rams had a forced down in one they're in their own territory they have the lead I think everybody would just assume that you pump the ball in that situation\nBut not Sean ... at what was the what was the explanation for why he had so much confidence that you could just give the voltage Eric Goff who is a big quarterbacks\nAnd they were able to get that you are because that was an incredibly risky move in and honestly rich it's one of those where you kind of looked like an idiot if it if it doesn't work and the Seattle Seahawks them back and win the game but you look like a hero world thinks on the day is the greatest coach and he is like going to have a coach obviously\nWhat what was the explanation after the game for why he ultimately decided to go for it\nYeah fascinating I mean that that is a good I mean I'm sure there would have been put for coaches here but the way that played out it was a minute thirty nine left there was a measurement because it was a third out are really close\nBy Seattle called time out I mean initially he he had the ... team ready to go yet they\nWere on the sideline ... and if it was a situation where there wasn't a clock stoppage I I think they would have punted because like you just said that's the first instinct of course you\nAre but then you know the game things got slowed down the other call because I Would absolutely should done\nBecause they just off the clock there was a measurement so there was this inordinate amount of time for them to stand there and think about it and often supplied with a ... year said hey let's do for those go for it\nAnd you know what you're showing the credit he said hey after the game he said this is the players game you know if the players at that amount of confidence that they think they can get it\nThen you want to put the players in that situation now I'll put US law asterisk on this also raises the pets was stuck back yesterday they ended up tightening up\nIn the fourth quarter they actually played pretty well the fourth quarter especially a last eras or to uh but they been given up the yard and given up some point though I think uh McVeigh particularly he you know being the ... the guy that he is I think\nThat the situation if you have to put the ball the office of than or you know that have you tried to with it I think ...\nAll at all probably felt a little bit more comfortable with his office\nSo I thought when the Kansas City chiefs play the Denver Broncos and obviously we have to five teams left in the league when the chiefs play the Broncos I thought the Broncos might have set a little bit of a blueprint in terms of how you can contain but she used to just stay in it with them until the fourth quarter\nAnd that's getting pressure with four guys and not every not everybody has the capability of doing that the personnel to do that\nBut look the bronco stay tight with the chiefs so to see all the time with the rams because of the big place so it's something that you just said there were ... to the big place why do you think that was and when other teams go back and look at this game on film what are they going to see from the ramp secretary that they're going to try to attack\nYeah you know ... it's a little bit of a different but obviously they don't have a fully back there are ethical perjury a couple of weeks ago Marcus Peters is out there again this is the old you know ... that\nWhere you know a half now the talk of the wrath of say Oh yes\nOut there again this is the old you know ... that's how where\nYou know he has a a ... now the talk of the reds I say I just by you know even though the or you know better or\nFor for ... theory Bob strayed so you have to think that plays into it but\nHe put all that on the table I mean he just took the idol had a great game plan Russell Wilson is the guy who was on like a you know in the quarterback the rams that base so far his ability to keep ... lived in the pocket Russell did really well with some play action plays yesterday\nAnd it give credit to Seattle for ... that run first\nOr they did a very good job with that which way this is for an susceptible to separate those play action to a place that that Russell sold very very well and I was able to find some guys down the field so yeah\n... balanced by Seattle I I think when you're talking about the stuffing or ah is moving the ball against this ... you have to be able to write it first ah and if you can do that that I think it sets up some other things that keeps that be fenced off Alan cold that\nBut you know what who we talked about about

Matt Harris jumped into the NFL revive has concluded our goals are is our guest\nOther sports exchange you can follow our work on ... balls or seven to one All right Drew Brees setting records tonight most passing yards in NFL history is obviously a tremendous accomplishment are your thoughts on the whole evening hours\nIt was obviously a great easy but I Can't keep keep thinking that\nHe's obviously you know with a night passes but it's not as if he doesn't have a lot of football left and and I I I think one of the most remarkable things of this is that I don't know how long you're going to play\nSeason another two seasons I mean who knows I mean by the time he's done I mean he's going to have it could potentially have you know eighty five thousand passing yards yeah I mean that's that's just like ridiculous\nTo even contemplate but yet it it certainly certainly possible I mean he he shows no signs of slowing down you know no signs of not wanting to play anymore and I mean and I've been saying this mat\nFor about a year now everybody every time everyone in the you know everywhere would be talking about all the wonder of Tom Brady playing at the age of forty or forty one and and every time I Would hear that I say well how come no one talks about ... ... I mean Drew Brees about a year and a half younger than Tom Brady\nAnd and and so you know he's ... it'll be it'll be forty I'm I think is January you know the ... you know after the seat in the regular season is over and like I said you know signs of slowing down\nAnd and and I mean it's four hundred and Ninety nine touchdown passes Peyton Manning's record for that is five thirty nine so that'll take you know that probably will not happen this year but certainly a very likely will happen next year and it's it's just amazing it you know it's just amazing but\nEvery time I say it's amazing I put in perspective just the way the game is played now and just consider this\nOf the top ten all time passing yards leaders and NFL history\nFive of them are active yeah right now\nSo we are in you know great days of NFL quarterbacking with a lot of guys like to we just mentioned um and and then ... burger and Philip Rivers have guys who are still playing into their you know their late thirties and even in their forties so so that's you know that's pretty amazing\nAnd here's what's also amazing power died he did not have I did a little bit of research on this because I remember him when he was in San Diego and he was not good he did not\nHave a four thousand you're passing season and all six years that he was in San Diego and his pastor raining the last four seasons he was there or Seventy six sixty seven or no for an eighty nine those were the last four years that he was in San Diego so I\nJust to me what's amazing about that I wanted to comment on this is how improbable at was that he ... he could get to this milestone right\nOr you ... you know it's a good point and and you know he did by the way he was playing it leaves later in that period was holding off of the ascension to Philip Rivers are starting quarterback job and who knows what might have happened had he not injured his shoulder than the last game of that last season in San Diego\nBut you know he was showing you know some of that so that progress but as it turned out\nGame of that last season in San Diego but you know he was showing you know some of that so that progress but ... as it turned out\nHe landed and just the perfect situation and there weren't a lot of themes interested in mainly because of the shoulder surgery\nAnd Miami wrote him off I was saying there's someone the other day Miami wrote him off mic saving it was the head coach and they signed Dante colpepper instead and just think of this cold peppers laughed NFL season for two thousand nine and here we are nine years later and Drew Brees are still going strong but he ends up\nIn New Orleans with Sean Payton\nAnd just talk about a perfect marriage of a quarterback head coach and an officer system\nThat I just took you know what was able to coach and capitalize on all of his ability and he hasn't had great receivers you know along the way that when you look at it I spent some some good ones no question about it\nBut I don't know I don't think there's any hall of famers in there but ... wherever you put out there on the field for him he finds a way to get into football\nHow are both are is our guest of the sports exchange you can follow Howard's work on Twitter each soldier seven to one I'm really glad that you mentioned the word system because I was talking about this earlier in the show and we were talking about this maybe it was last week with their golf\nIs Drew Brees not a perfect example of why the quote unquote system quarterback is not a criticism of that quarterback because Drew Brees like you said\nIt perfectly in this system didn't necessarily fit the system that was the San Diego chargers but we obviously are taking nothing away from Drew Brees by saying he fits the Sean Payton system because the system pretty darn good that is not a criticism of a quarter back to me to say he is a system\n[noise] oh no no no you're absolutely right and then and also a part of it too because it's not only the system is a philosophy of just throwing the football an awful lot and when you're when you're putting up five thousand yards passing season\nIt's because you're throwing the ball a lot and you know there's not a lot of long passes you know a lot of them are you know short stuff\nBut it's the philosophy but I'll say this when the saints have been really good\nIt's when they've had a running game and that's that's the you know when the when they went to the Superbowl they had to run again he'll be four last year when they have the combination of Ingram\nAn album Kamara before that what were they seven and nine three years in a row I think so overall he was long for five thousand yards but they weren't winning a lot of football games and so\nSo so that in itself you know you wonder about okay is this really the great philosophy\nOr to have and I think sometimes coaches get carried away when they have great quarterbacks an excellent passers where they just broke too much and forget that in my mind it's still about if you want to be a championship team it's still about being balanced on our sense\nAnd and certainly that's what the same story last year and now with anger him back we'll probably get get back to that more this year\nAnd in an NFC or the NFC East isn't very good at the end of the north has a lot of questions you know Atlanta's off to a slow start mostly because\nOf all the injuries on defend yeah\nAnd and so but you still Caroline is pretty good you know and then you have the rams there there's not that many really top level teams at least right now\nIn the NFC and so you have to look at the same ... just like last year you know let's be honest I mean they would have been one game away from the Supreme you know they would have been one game waiting for the super bowl if they didn't have that crazy play happen against them in the you know in the playoff game against the Vikings so that they had to me they've got just a good chance does anybody in the NFC of you know getting to the super bowl\nYou know when you look at this and as the Howard I you you mentioned how the NFC East is absolutely brutal I found it interesting how okay Jay ... goes on on the injured preserve today which is obviously terrible news of the eagles this is by far the worst division and all of football I mean who do you believe in in any of these ... and in the division I I think nobody\nBut to me the eagles can put themselves over the top like getting a going out and at least a tempting\nTo go out and getting lazy on bell now they restructure the flex er Cox contract today and sources whatever say that this was not to go out and get lazy on bell\nDo you think it would be wise for Philadelphia Pittsburgh and try and make something happen for lady on bell because to me he is a different maker and when you look at the eagles you talk about other states are about the eagles are not balance it all\nAnd they say it's like twenty nine yards at the last guy to the eagles the eagles or the Packers for example are not balanced at all what at least they'll make the eagles balanced shouldn't they make that phone call\n[laughter] well yeah I I Would think they can make the phone call or we don't know you know what the prices in terms of the compensation and you don't know if the eagles would you know I mean you're just documents for aid for someone because he can play the second half of the season and then potentially losing so what is it going to take\nBut I Am Twenty years paying winters you can get

buy anything this chips there there's all different kinds of stuff in a vending machine and I'm always like why am I going to waste my money I don't have a sweet tooth really I really don't I don't like chocolate or anything like that um but the Yankees lost tonight obviously in an absolutely horrific fashion\nAnd so you know I see these commercials or that knickers will make you feel better\nAnd so I said to myself you know what I Need to pick me up let's see if this is false advertising and so I go in and I buy myself a Snickers now I Do feel better and I will make the argument and people will tell you that Milky Way or the best\n... it's it's not true knickers is without a doubt and I'm not just talking about the the feel better the commercial and everything it's not ...

know it's terrible stuff it pissed on a bottle you know like you you don't want that you want something with a little bit of flavor Snickers brings the perfect amount of flavor along with the crunching is of having that peanut in there\nSo I Will contend with anybody that knickers is without a doubt the best candy of available a ... to me as a second\nOkay dirt Devinsky I really look at as a pioneer for um international players ... just does not get highly drafted if they are convinced he is not successful how many international players in the NBA\nDo we look at one of the NBA draft is happening and the scouting report says have is a little ... year old could potentially be next jerk ... see\nDirt Vicki was a pioneer for international basketball players that ... we draft toll Germans and tall Spaniards and tall whatever overseas in the NBA draft in the top twenty because ... ski worked out\nHe's literally a pioneer in that that and he's gonna be a hall of famer let me give you one more MBA example Steph Curry went to David said three point shooter okay\nYoung is selected for I Believe was it thirty this year in the NBA draft by the Illinois ... okay he's elected third in the NBA draft this year why because tray young can shoot three\nAnd ... and because yeah because ... excuse me stuff you're Steph Curry can shoot threes and Steph Curry worked out he went to David ... and he turned into a special players going to be a hall of famer that is the reason for a young goes number three\nIt is Trey on doesn't play a lick it effects\nOkay tray young his boss his skills I think are overrated simply because they have Cory has tremendous ball skills so we say OK he looks like Steph Curry the acts like Steph Curry he shoots these electric like Steph Curry oh so he must have\nYeah so we say OK he looks like Steph Curry he acts like Steph Curry he shoots these electric like Steph Curry oh so he must have he can get to the level of Steph Curry when it comes to ball handling skills\nThose two guys Steph Curry and Dirk ... pioneers in terms of how we look at prospect coming out of the draft\nWhy was Baker Mayfield selected number one this year he's short\nThat was a criticism but people overlook that and said short people can be successful in the NFL why do people say that at the quarterback position\nDrew Brees Drew Brees as a pioneer in terms of how we look at NFL prospects he is and I'll tell you what he he was going to be a bigger may feel it'd be he is better for the comparison\nBaker may feel so is it who said oh I see he could be the next Drew Brees was Baltimore's defensive coordinator that said I feel a little Drew Brees everyone was saying oh it's still a little Drew Brees and we all went oh okay let's use the breaks but he's the brakes\nBigger may feel I Will give him that I watch Baker Mayfield he he has ... decision not like Drew Brees but I think he can get there like I see the early he is the egg of the Drew Brees phenomenon\nI think it's a little bit over hype to say you're going to be the next Drew Brees because Drew Brees just set the record for the most passing or they're not at all history but look I Love\nI Want to mention one more thing every board go to break and talk about the dreadful Yankees Drew Brees is the perfect example of do not want anyone ever doubt you and your ability\nAnd it might not happen for you early in your career if you're an athlete listening to me right now you might have to play five years in the minor league baseball player you might have to do it\nYou might have to play five years in San Diego and not be elite and not be a pro bowler and not come flying out of the gate\nBut Derek Jeter had a great quote which I use in my life and I'm sure Drew Brees uses in his and you should use in years you might not be the most talented person on the face of the earth but there's no excuse for people to work harder than you\nThat it's something that I Will take to heart every single day and drew\nBrees said that to his kids as he came to the sideline today he told a niece that work hard and you can achieve anything I thought that was a really special moment a really special moment\nWhen he went to his kids in the middle of the game and he said look you can achieve anything that you want in life just like I did now obviously the best lesson was taught right after that close to his kids he went over to Sean Payton game a quick ... let's go in the game\n'cause that's what Drew Brees it he may be short he may not have had the best years early in his career but he is now throwing the most passing yards in NFL history and in his next game he will after the five hundred touchdown club so congratulations to Drew Brees\n[noise] I give\nYou a standing ovation by

auto barge videos fears met here of the nation radio Matt Harris back with you jumped into the NFL revive has been boarded our boulders or get the more\nYou can follow our work on what are they both are seven to one All right Drew Brees setting record tonight [noise] most passing yards in NFL history is obviously a tremendous accomplishment just your thoughts on the whole evening hour [noise]\nIt was you know obviously a great evening but I Can't keep keep thinking that he's obviously you know with a Ninety past but it's not as if he\nDoesn't have a lot of football and and I I I think one of the most remarkable things of this\nIs that I don't know how long you're going to play another season another two seasons I mean who knows I mean by the time he's done I mean he's going to have it could potentially have you know eighty five thousand passing yards yeah I mean that that that's just like ridiculous\nEven contemplate but yet it it certainly certainly possible I mean he shows no signs of slowing down you know no signs of not wanting to play anymore\nAnd I mean like you and I've been saying this mat\nFor about a year now everybody every time everyone in the you know everywhere would be talking about oh the wonder of Tom Brady playing at the age of forty or forty one and every time I Would hear that I'd say well how come no one talks about drew ... I mean can read about a year and a half younger than Tom Brady\nAnd and so you know he will be it'll be forty I'm I think is January you know the ... you know after the season the regular season is over and like I said you know signs of slowing down and and I mean it's four hundred and Ninety nine touchdown passes Manning's record for that is five thirty nine so that'll take\nYou know that probably will not happen this year but certainly a very likely will happen next year\nBecker for that is five thirty nine so that'll take\nYou know that probably will not happen this year but certainly a very likely will happen next year and it's it it's just amazing it you know it's just amazing but every time I say it's amazing I put it in perspective just the way the game is played now and just consider this\nOf the top ten all time passing yards leaders in\nNFL history five of them are active yeah right now\nSo we are in you know great days of NFL quarterbacking with a lot of guys like the two we just mentioned um and and Ben Roethlisberger and fill of rivers have guys who are still playing into their ... their late thirties and even in their forties so so that's you know that's pretty amazing\nAnd he was also amazing power died he did not have I did a little bit of research on this because I remember him when he was in San Diego and he was not good he did not have a four thousand yards passing season and all six years that he was in San Diego and his tacit raining the last four seasons he was there\nWere Seventy six sixty seven one oh four and eighty nine those were the last four years that he was in San Diego so\nTo me what's amazing about through these unless you comment on this is how improbable it was that he is typically to get to this milestone right\nOr you have ... you know it's a good point and and you know he did by the way he was planning it leaves later in that period was holding off of the ascension of Philip Rivers or to the starting quarterback job and who knows what might have happened had he not injured his shoulder in the last game of that last season in San Diego\nBut you know he was showing you know some of that so that progress but ... as it turned out\nHe landed and just the perfect situation and there weren't a lot of themes interested in mainly because of the shoulder surgery and Miami wrote him off I was saying there's some of the other day Miami wrote them off the saving it was the head coach\nAnd they signed Dante colpepper instead and just think of this cold peppers laughed NFL season was two thousand nine and here we are nine years later and Drew Brees are still going strong but he ends up in New Orleans with Sean Payton\nAnd just talk about a perfect marriage of a quarter back in a head coach at an officer system\nThat just took it you know what was able to coach him and capitalize on all of his ability and he hasn't had great receivers you know along the way that when you look at it I spent some some good ones no question about it but I don't know I don't think there's any hall of famers in there but\n... whatever you put out there on the field for him he finds a way to get into football\nHow are both are is our guest as the sports exchange you can follow Howard's work on Twitter each soldier seven to one I'm really glad that you mentioned the word system because I was talking about this earlier in the show when we were talking about this maybe was last week with Derek ...\nIs Drew Brees not the perfect example of why the quote unquote system quarterback is not a criticism of that quarterback because Drew Brees like you said\nIt perfectly in this system didn't necessarily fix the system that was the San Diego chargers we obviously are taking nothing away from Drew Brees by saying he fits the Sean Payton system because this system pretty darn good that is not a criticism of a quarter back to me to stay the same a system\n[noise] oh no no you know you're absolutely right and then and also a part of it too because it's not only the system as a philosophy of just throwing the football an awful lot and when you're when you're putting up five thousand yard passing season it's because you're throwing the ball\nA lot and you know there's not a lot of long passes you know a lot of 'em or you know short stuff but it's it's a philosophy but I'll say this when the saints have been really good\nIt's when they had a running game and that's that's the you know when when they went to the super bowl they had to run again it will be four last year when they have the combination of Ingram\nAn album Kamara before that what were they seven and nine three years in a row I think so overall he was known for five thousand yards but they weren't winning a lot of football games and so\nSo so that in itself you know you wonder about okay is this really the great philosophy or to have and I think sometimes coaches get carried away when they have great quarterbacks an excellent passers or they just throw too much and forget\nThat in my mind it's still about if you want to be a championship team it's still about being balanced on our sense and and certainly that's what the saints were last year and now with anger him back we'll probably get get back to that more this year\nAnd in an NFC where the NFC East isn't very good at the end of the north has a lot of questions you know Atlanta's off to a slow start mostly because\nOf all the injuries on defense yeah\nAnd and so but you still Caroline is pretty good no and then you have the rams there there's not that many\nThat really top level teams at least right now in the NFC and so you have to look at the same ... just like last year you know it's it's I mean they would have been one game away from the super\nYou know they would have been one game wait for the super bowl if they didn't have that crazy play happened against them in the you know in the playoff game against the Vikings so they they had to me they've got just a good chance as anybody in the NFC of you know getting to the super bowl\nYou know when you look at this then as the Howard I you mentioned how the anesthesia is absolutely brutal I found it interesting okay Jay ...\nGoes on on the injured reserve today which is obviously terrible news for the eagles this is by far the worst division and all of all I mean who do you believe in in any of these ... and this division I think nobody but to me the eagles can put themselves over the top like getting a going out and at least attempting\nTo go out and getting lazy on bell now they restructure the Fletcher Cox contract today\nAnd sources would ever say that this was not to go out and get lazy on ...\nDo you think it would be why from Philadelphia Pittsburgh and try and make something happen for lady on bell because to me is a difference maker and when you look at the eagles he said about the eagles are not balance it all\nThey had like twenty nine yards at the last guy to the eagles the eagles or the Packers for example are not balance at all when it later on down to make the eagles balanced shouldn't they make that phone call\n[laughter] well yeah I I Would think they should make the phone call or we don't know you know what the prices in terms of compensation and you don't know the eagles would you know I mean you're just documents for aid for someone because he can play the second half of the season and then potentially losing so what is it going to take\nThat if they want a hundred and twenty five percent bonus only with the promo code when one twenty five I probably I think we can do this now the worst division\nAnd all of football [noise] there's no question about it [noise] the and asked the leaf [noise]\nThe Washington Redskins getting pounded today by the New Orleans saints [noise] there is not a team in the NFC East that has more than two wins right now [noise]\nWe're five weeks in the season [noise] the Redskins or two

of things that are really impressive about this team if I were to ask you to pick the most impressive thing what would that be [noise]\nWhy I think just the office of consistency everybody saw the rats office labs are and how much how many points scored but personally I\nDon't know about a regression just because they don't seem to have a ... year of have to watch that office to watch what John said ah does this game comes up with the formation I thought maybe you know they see a little bit a bit of a split there where you start to figure out a little bit but they have at five\nThirty points every game are averaging for over four hundred fifty yards ... and then even the game on the you know read or or their top three receivers parental\nConflict both go out and they still ... the second half of the fence so the way that they've been able to hold the ball a point or maybe it shouldn't be surprised but but it still has been the most depressed about the ...\nDo we have any updates regarding the injuries that happened on Sunday\nYeah I mean you never know when somebody can show though you know it felt like a a spring break or something really can't predict you know how how the brain react but\nFor everything that job based so it's like it's the best case scenario I guess the best way to put it in terms of uh neither one of those guys it was like a lingering symptoms but they think okay after the game a day\nOf course there is a political as we know so it's kind of out of the rams fans are really out of the players and I just kind of how they respond ear over the next couple of days but Charlotte those that are pretty optimistic that they both of those guys cooks cup uh like be able to play outside that\nRegime and our guest covers the Los Angeles ramps you can follow riches work on Twitter enriched underscore Hamad does it for the Orange County register okay so the rams had a forced down in one they're in their own territory they have the leader I think everybody would just assume that you want the ball in that situation\nBut not showing the execs at well let's see what was the explanation for why he had so much confidence that you could just give the ball to Jerry ... who is a big quarterback\nAnd they were able to get that you are because that was an incredibly\nRisky move in and honestly rich it's one of those where you kind of looked like an idiot if it if it doesn't work and the Seattle Seahawks come back and win the game but you look like a hero we're all things on the days the greatest coach and he is he's a coach obviously what what are we explanation as to the game for why he ultimately decided to go for it\nYeah fascinating I mean those are the shirt or as the players are into it I mean\nI'm sure there has been put coaches through but the way that played out it was a minute thirty nine left there was a measurement because it was a third out a really close play Seattle called time out I mean initially he he had the ... team ready to go out and\nThey were on the sideline ... and if it was a situation where there wasn't a clock stoppage I I think they would have punted a because like you just said that's the first instinct of course you\nAre but then you know the game things got slowed down Seattle call this kind of out which they're absolutely sure done but because they needed to stop the clock\nThere was a measurement so there was this inordinate amount of time for them to stand there and to think about it and ... here say hey let's go for it let's go for it\nAnd you know what your credit and he said hey after the game he said this is the players game you know if the players are out that amount of confidence and they think they can get it\nThen you want to put the players in that situation now I'll put his law asterisk on this also ran to the parents was stuck back yesterday they ended up tightening up\nIn the fourth quarter they actually you know play pretty well the fourth quarter especially\nOn that last ear easier to uh but they been given up through the arts and given up some point though I think uh McVeigh particularly he you know being the ... the guy that he is I think in that situation if you have to put the ball at the office than or you know but have you tried to with it I think a big pay\nAll it all probably felt a little bit more comfortable with his office\nSo I thought when the Kansas City chiefs play the Denver Broncos and obviously we have to five teams left in the week when the chiefs play the Broncos I thought the Broncos might have set a little bit of a blueprint in terms of how you can contain the chiefs and just say in it with them until the fourth quarter\nAnd that's getting pressure with four guys and not every not everybody has the capability of doing personnel to do that\nBut look the bronco stay tight with the chiefs so to see all the time with the rams because of the big place somebody and you just said they were susceptible to the big place why do you think that was and when other teams go back and look at this game on film what are they going to see from the ramp secretary that they're going to try to attack\nYeah you know it it it's a little bit of a different look obviously they essentially back there ah you know you have to go for a couple of weeks ago markets Peters is out there again this is the old you know ... that fell where\nYou know he he has a ... now the talk of the ... let's say I just by you know even though the or better a better\nFor me for creating area a spray so you have to think that plays into it\nBut put all that on the table I mean they had all had a great game plan Russell Wilson is the guy who was on like a you know in a quarterback the peso bark\nHis ability to keep alive the pocket Russell did really well with the player action place yesterday and the credit to Seattle for first dabba ... that run first\nUh they did a very good job with that which ... ran susceptible to separate those play action a place that Russell so very very well and was able to find some guys down the field so yeah\nGood balance by Seattle I I think that when you're talking about stopping or a is moving the ball against this ramps ... you have to be able to write it burst ah and if you can do that that I think it sets up some other things that keeps the deepest off out a little bit but you know what we talk about about giving it to the the\nDo that that I think it sets up some other things that keeps that be fenced off ... cool that but you know what we talk about about getting the season about how the ... kind of look bulletproof how they you know just kind of an iron how were you ever going to move the ball against them but there's been some ... whether it's been injuries or whether it's been\nA you know play action type stuff or throwing the ball and the themes in the middle of the field you can move the ball or against the defense so there are certainly some things that they're going to have to tighten up and for sure they're gonna have to take it up before the game against the chiefs that Mexico\nRich salmon is our gas he covers the Los Angeles Ramsay the Orange County

because I after George sprint came off the the DL mid August he'd had seven extra base hit the whole rest of the year but going to the post season and all he does is it dangerous\nYou\nKnow that's all he does a lot but I think one of the areas you said yesterday he actually said that they said was the moment I think George is one of those guys they just have a tendency to folks a little bit more under high pressure under most where they know that makes you might be watching the show\nSo I asked Bergman did call them the show's throws a it is it is kinda ... it's kind of amazing to see like a you know they still have a lot of young guys on this team to the\nCore guys are all younger guys but you're like big live they live for the biggest moment and we always see these pictures of you know George and\nAnd Carlos got their arms around each other and they're hanging out there talking to you know you see the camaraderie\nOf this team and they do seem to be a truly you know pretty tight knit group you played in baseball for a long time is this something that is\nMore often unique than normal to see it seemed that is this closely knit\nAbsolutely and you know I saw a with a couple of those guys doing some radio shows I've talked to a bunch of ex major leaguers and that's one of the questions that I always kills you know these guys are ... we know that okay for all paper all feel these\nGuys can put a major numbers they're they're highly talented athletes are highly tells the baseball players but when you watch your team go out and when like they do it through with such joy it makes a lot of us who played the game a little bit more envious because of the way they go out literally looked like they support each other\nAnd everything around this team for the last two or three years where they\nPlay the game a little bit more envious because of the way they go out and literally looked like they support each other\nAnd having been around this team for the last two or three years where they've been in that winning atmosphere is it's it's true it's pure\nAre these guys want to see each other do well because they earn and understanding that if everybody does their part to the best of their ability this team is going to be a very good so why not encourage that guy to go out and put up numbers because if they have six or seven guys like they Canada's light up put up numbers they're going to be unstoppable\nBlooming the Indians as opposed to have a pretty good both men and the Astros just beat them around like you know they were ... kids and you know we saw what they did the bullpen last year let alone some of the best aren't as a major league baseball\nIt it's almost like it doesn't matter who they play it doesn't matter who Hitchens they never look you get that pitcher and go and we'll just guys down there and this guy is great they look at him like the lunch\n[noise] no you're exactly right and I don't know what it is we have seen it throughout the course of the year and the last couple of years where\nThe Astros from the seven thing on and have some of the best numbers in baseball I Know the A's were up there this year but you really felt like the Astros were kind of just you know the biding their time are taking some pitches a little more selective against starters\nTrying to wear them down and get the ball and\nUm I Know it's a it's a technique that they use where they want to put a lot of pictures on the starting pitcher just to get them out of there but I don't know if it's actual intent that they know what to expect from guys out of the opposing both kinds but when those guys come in and you can put out a match ups you want but you're not going to match up with guys should go up there with malicious intent\nLight the Houston Astros do and they put two guys 'cause usually relievers don't like they like to attack the zone\nWhere starting pitchers usually try and set guys up relievers come out and the taxes on and try and put guys away early\nAnd the ashes are absolutely ready for it but it's it's it's amazing to me that a playoff chain Kim a playoff relief you know a whole can come out against these guys and the Astros still put up numbers like they do either playoff both ends that they're doing this to that's what makes it even more impressive\nIs emblem Astros TV analyst with us on the bench you assign are common sideline like fourteen years major league baseball World Series champion\nUh with us on a hotline you know well there was a there was a a a lot made out about the Astros acquisition of Myrtle sooner\nAnd there was a lot of concern that bringing in a player like that you know is is it gonna cause backlash in the locker room are guys going to be that there were a lot of Astros are on the team who previously had spoken out\nVery strongly against anyone associated with a domestic violence or anything like that and there was concern maybe they would be some kind of negative effect I'm not seeing a negative effect if there's something that I'm not seeing because\nIt doesn't look like they ban it and I mean I Know that they they also have their convictions but on the field and it doesn't seem to be any kind of issue\nAnd that's that's one of the unique things I think about yeah she was Columbus and bringing on a guy like a tuna and and baby Joe took into account maybe he did and I'm not sure but it's worked out to their benefit and I think a lot of it is due to the fact that these guys understand\nYou know the the severity and the gravity of the situation around too soon though\nAnd they handled it properly while they were were what they do away from the fall farther away from ... is there a deal and maybe there's some guys do have that separation\nWhere they say hey as soon as my teammates were going to play hard on the field but I'm not going to associate often feel I don't know because I haven't hung out with them off the field but that could be the scenario and that was very similar to some of the situations that I was in but you know guys that I played with him that has similar\nA nose issue is happening to them off the field but that being said we also heard a lot about and I and I it has to be the fact that it shouldn't have won the lottery in the sense that she's coming to a championship team so the focus was a little bit different\nFocused on winning a championship so they're looking at a student at as a cold is or they're not looking a coup soon as the as the person I Know that's maybe a little to fly by wire cut and dry but that was how the approach to put ocean also won the lottery in the sense to be coming into a club house with good young talent\nWho really you know is is welcoming and now it's even more welcoming them maybe a lot of us thought because they've taken him in so well on the loudest sooner to go out there and focus only on baseball not over here in Studio stuff and\nBaggage that came with them so I get the ashes clubhouse and those guys inside their own or work conversations were made refugee and she has something to do with it out to be but they did a great job of handling a very tough situation and focusing on baseball which is their primary concern", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "09"}
