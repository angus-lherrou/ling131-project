Patterson also has a lot more comfortable and you can just see it looked like Jim horrible every week is adding something different to this often\nIn watching Jim ... off and just through the years he was a lot of formation is a lot of different place in ballot things like the Michigan off and can handle all of that\nWhen you go to survive Michigan has improved but I Do think there are tests for this group a head you know they uh Wisconsin defensively not as good as they were last you lose a lot about Michigan's often of wine or Saturday against Michigan State but I think it's the highest they lose the game\nWill probably comes down to hold through the vantage and I think they have to give an edge to greenhouse gases that quarterback um over shape Patterson but I think it needs to continue we're headed for that uh you know kind of a game like we saw a couple of years ago when it came down to that spot at the end of the game but it'd be a really fun batch of\nAll it's going to be grade C blasted as our guest house football editor for Apple on sports\nYou can follow Steve's work on Twitter at apple on Steve Notre Dame what do you make of them right now are they would generally the fourth best team in the country right now they have struggled now into games where I did not think that they would struggling and last week they have it it took a touchdown pass with like five minutes ... minutes ago and the games to get to get the edge over Pittsburgh where does your overall thoughts on Notre Dame right now\n[laughter] you know I think Notre Dame kind of an all facets their just powers you know I think maybe in a neutral field is Michigan and Notre Dame played tomorrow you know I Would probably pick Michigan Michigan has progressed a lot\nThen the the first week of the seat this but you know I think that the difference for Notre Dame coming week one to two week eight now\nIs invoke a quarterback yeah he has given Notre Dame eight big time shot in the arm um as far as being able to you know throw the intermediate passes and open up the passing game Notre Dame defense the way they're fine seven on the fence it right up there as one of the best in college football texture William coming in at running back has really helped who\nI think maybe the biggest concerns at Notre Dame has\nYou know the wind has been inconsistent that was the price I mean the last quarter males and and my ... that's been oh so you know I think there are some flaws with his team you hypothetically looking down the road ... Ohio State of constant or Alabama\nThey're going to be an underdog in the playoffs so I think they're kind of settled in comfortably number or not a lot of outside with his team but they're also just dial it across the board good defense hum and improve quarterback and some really interesting skill position but I still think there are step behind a Clinton or Ohio State\nRight now I see what happened with West Virginia a couple of weeks ago when they lost the Iowa State I mean they they I'll admit I did not watch that football game But West Virginia ... when I see a hundred yards passing for will Greer that to me is just a warming what happened in that game of the state I kind of had them in a sleeper\nAnd what does this mean for Texas just chance those two teams will match up in a couple of weeks the Texas now it's a real chance to beat West Virginia and your opinion\nAbsolutely you know I I think Texas right now it's been in their prime position to get into the big twelve championship game I mean you know they may be Baylor on Saturday um you know they probably weren't as sharp as as we saw against Oklahoma\nBut most importantly they got to victory especially outlawing same Ellen gr left do the injury and I think looking ahead you know we could end other Texas\nOklahoma free match it in the big twelve championship game but I think you know the proper West Virginia\nIt's a tough place to play at Iowa State into this program under ... Campbell has made big strides over the last couple of seasons we saw last season's were they beat Oklahoma and really the key to use that kind of becoming the new Kansas State\nOf the big twelve they're just the teams don't want to play on the road because they're good on the fence their secondary is is one of the better groups in the big twelve and they were also able to get pressure on ... and seven times\nWith the pressure they were able to generate the death in the secondary I was just kind of had the perfect formula and then especially once they get their ground game ... they've had a an improvement quarterback in freshman ... look really good um over the last couple of weeks so you know I think they just added up to West Virginia has some flaws\nBut they probably weren't exposed because of the schedule and they went on the road and tough environment against the ... the fence\nAnd those showed up on Saturday So I like I said is kind of a you know maybe at the end of the year a fringe top twenty five ... but I think the path is open up a protected there's a clear favorite right now that there's twelve with a potential rematch against Oklahoma\nTwenty five but I think the path is open up a protected as the clear favorite right now that there's twelve with a potential rematch against Oklahomans truck champion\nJanet how much fun would that be I mean we do every single college football fan wants to see that be a rematch because that was one of the year so far I mean I was just an incredible watch the bias in our guest college football editor for up on sports you can

if you can pinpoint any single way route anything that LSU can I can do defensively to try and stop Alabama is there any way they use the LSU pulling off an upset against Alabama later in the year\nI think the path for el issue is to hope Alabama turns the ball over a couple of times it's going to require one of those efforts you know Alabama is just so perfect weekend and week out it's going to
