I don't like I don't care what Dana White says you can come out and talk about how\nThis is not good for the U. S. C. and this ... this is exactly what the U. S. D. once\nAnd the fact that we're still like to work this dispense it's like well we have here\nTo me is a story and we're storylines continuing to develop now what other sport quote unquote sport does this the WWE and I've compared the U.S the a little bit to the WWE just in a sense of the press conference the walk up into the brain\nThat's what we have here we have a walking reality show that is just going to continue and continue and right now I don't look at these suspensions at all it's bad for the U. S. D. I look at that as the next chapter\nOf this could be McGregor story and who when they whenever they fight next who knows I'm just as interested in the months leading into that fight\nAs the actual fight because it's a reality show sure\nEvery event that's going to occur between now and whenever they do fight again again they are ... I agree with they're going to fight at some points on whatever happens whether comment\nSuspensions even heck it could be was banned for the country for six yeah it all adds to the dramas that expecting yeah it's it's just a story and then it's just a story line that it's just going to continue to develop and develop and\nI like both of you guys I heard your last segment I'm a very casual man like I I I don't I don't love the sport I think you're interested\nIn the last probably two years and it's a combination of McGregor may weather and it's a combination basically since the great you're really going to see and I've actually become we weren't\nThirty one that's six and a game where you at every single thing to fight for I mean the division is horrible Dallas Cowboys thinking and jumping out of ... eagles couldn't figure out there often really has cost the ones really healthy Redskins give up forty one points on Monday Night football giants come into this game one in five years they still have a chance\nThey still have a check yeah every five or thirty one it six\nThat's what the game started out ads and I'm watching the night and I'm thinking man as a giants fan and now and not only is this season going to go down the tubes put now you're gonna I'm gonna have to watch a Sam Darnell\nWho the giants passed on quarterback is the most important position of football Dallas Cowboys fans will tell you that\nOkay Dallas Cowboys fans I'm not sure I'm comfortable Dallas Cowboys fans are with their fourth round pick jak Prescott\nOkay or their head coach Jae ... quarterback means something just ask Alice school Kansas City chiefs fans how quickly does that city and that pain completely turned around when you get it right and you'd ramp but then I like Patrick bombs Houston Texans I think are very much in the right direction you get a guy like the show and wants to can you stay healthy\nQuarterback is the most important position on the field and sometimes you take risks\nI I understand that Sam Darnell might've been a risk okay Sam donor was a pro ready\nBut you you know the fact that the the giants thought that they could win this year\nWith a guy anyway many who was who was continually showing signs of regression over time it wasn't just this year this did this did not come out of nowhere him throwing a you know it's not being good generally in the rain or not give it you know him throwing balls behind wide receiver this is not just happen overnight\nOkay this has been a continual regression overtime and the fact that the giants I said this is the one day when the draft was going on I yelled at the TV when they drive to say I'm Barkley and I'm taking nothing away from Salem Barclay\nIt is absolutely everything to do with position of value and the giants not understanding position of value there it you know what they have to do right now Bobby I Know the jaws giants fans now\nIs there one in five there there are six or six games in the season here we got tend to go all giants fans have got a whole to the high heavens that they go on and Fifteen\nBecause guess what there is a great not a good quarterback prospects\nThere is probably a better quarterback prospect that's coming out next year in Herbert from Oregon Bobby is one of bodies picks of the week that guy okay that guy can play football and he's going to be a good pro quarterback he's big he's got the accuracy you can see it\nOkay there are questions about Baker may feel so now this is just what sometimes kind of stinks as a sports fan\nWhen you you never want to be mediocre\nSo so I all giants fans tonight after watching the disaster that just happened today against the Philadelphia Eagles all giants fans are thinking themselves men now I've got a root for them to lose\nWe went from literally five hours go thinking that it's a possibility to win the division okay oh now that the junior the guy was hit in the air conditioners tonight and it was you know punching the punting that last year okay he's the leader we're all supposed to believe that the locker room is okay you go to go to Caroline and put them and I saw\nOffensive performance only it was like to point sixty three are filled will be okay that's what I was willing to buy into that comes game last week and all this week I the locker rooms okay the giants fans go from oh we can win the division two All right now we've got to lose\nSeriously that that's what that's what my mindset is right now you got a tank you get the trust of the process there now in full on Philadelphia Seventy Sixers mode get Joel and beat as a motivational speaker and that I don't know making he called place you think Joel and B can call place\nNo things even if he can play left tackle I saw an eight soldier Michael Bennet blast by NATO soldier on a possession number three today the soldier your your twelve Thirteen fourteen Fifteen million dollar a year man did you see that play\nLet it out and get it says the I'll tell you the play Bobby ... seven uh it was a it was Seventy three at this point giants gives a field goal okay right after the the eagles scored a touchdown on their opening drive after that terrible many past\nOkay seven three ballparks back to the eagles and then the eagles act upon giants like the Fifteen yard line seven to three eagles have the lead but it's okay they survive the opening punch that Eli Manning gave themselves\nAnd then guess what you're on your tenure blind and Michael Bennett comes I mean it wasn't even close I don't even think they soldier touched Michael Bennet and and Michael and and it was almost a safety ... Nate soldier who just got beaten has to collapse on the ball at the two yard line\nNate soldier I ... I I Would just throw him it left tackle I don't know maybe he can replace Eric flowers who is just cut this week a first round pick I\nGuess it would take an actor Eric flowers Bobby beach you know do you do is take and I think it was literally the next pick\nYou know us time to really\n... it was taken right after that now okay type girl that ... I if I'm a giant like seriously I Know what it feels to be a jazz fan right now I Know right now\nThis is what it feels like complete atrocity an absolute disaster tonight and again they better really sick you you're you're rooting for them to go on that one and Fifteen if you're a judge them\nOn the other side of the eagles looked OK they look pretty good Carson went slip back to form did not thinking and Duncan down the field that was nice I'm Alison Jeffrey getting him more involved I Do question though when it comes to Philadelphia because it does look like they're going to go with this kind of Seventy five twenty five thing uh in terms of ratio a pass to run\nA I Do question if that can work within the rest of the NFC\nLet's talk about the rest of the honesty part I'm done but I I I I promised I thought to myself I Want to get too upset but you know what an hour have passed after the game [noise] talk about the rest of the honesty next to tell you that\nThis is three to

you and blend jumping weren't fantasy football thing with Christ on the run than\nFantasy football so on this network every Tuesday night you can listen to it you can find on with her and lead them to hiring so\nThink we have an interesting match up in terms of just on the field was impossible really interesting fantasy ... things in the Denver Broncos Los Angeles ... game now look\n... homes had his worst games and it was still a good game against the Denver Broncos defense in this once again is in Denver [noise] what kind of production do you see Sharon ... because for me example my of Jared\nGo off and I have Andrew Luck and I'm not going to ask you to you know pick for me because that's what I'm supposed to do on the fantasy football in our culture and New York to play the jets but to use the Jarrett costs numbers taking the decline this week Chris simply because Denver gave Patrick bombs to run for their money and we all know how good homes that\nI don't think so I think you can buy your go off as a style like quarterback number one now he might be back in value but\nNot this is not the the no fly zone at the last two three years this is not a I D than that is going to really scare anybody so you can fire a Geron golf now it does sound like brand and cooks and Cooper cup they both what last week when the concussions they were both limited in practice\nIf those guys don't go but it sounds like you're trying to get the right direction that would be the only reason I wouldn't play Geron golf\nBut if nothing else you've got the little Dopp oftentimes girlie so you could still be looking at you know two fifty to two Seventy five and two to three touchdowns which would be more than than adequate for to be one value\nThe only the only reason I ask that is because the Broncos uh you know I ... at home this game is in Denver and I think they're great home team in that as a great home field advantage that is one of the late afternoon games the other interesting late afternoon game to me is the jaguars plane the cowboys down the Dallas Cowboys defense obviously has the strength of this team\nBut would you imagine if you have ... on your team which I'm not imagining many people do but maybe your quarterback is on a by this weekend you had to go get like ... I\nThink this could be one of those weeks that you would play him simply because there is no ... for net TJ yelled and is injured he's going to play but it's a small Charles they literally just cut off the street so\nI think the cowboys could put the jaguars it started long situations which would give blade portal the opportunity to throw let's say you have a quarterback on your on by this week\nOkay and maybe play portals still in free agency would he be one guy you would go after simply because of the lack of running game that Jacksonville could have this week\nI think he's on the streaming map if you've got somebody that\nThat's been on here roster I Know but the thing about morals and sold Jekyll and Hyde boredom back mortals good or bad board all last week we saw bad morals but foreigners step chance but he had four hundred thirty yard and he had won rushing score and garbage time so those patterns that\nYou're looking at them by we you could possibly ... you could possibly plan I wouldnt fire him up so well with a whole lot of confidence but he's always that threat for big game when ... when I went in or no doubt it seems like this Jacksonville off and it's not for whatever reason\nPlay better that they're more balanced with the jails and and I can't for the life of me figure that out\nYeah hey I'm with you Chris subs is our guest host that fantasy football so every Tuesday night on the network SB Nation radio you can find Christmas work on Twitter at C. M. tubs I'm All right so obviously the huge game this\nWeek is this Sunday night or chief sent patriots let's say you have Josh Gordon okay you picked up just scored and you took a flyer on them and like the thirteenth around\nTwelve round something like that because you thought that he might give you some production in Cleveland now he goes to New England I think the emergence of sunny much Sean I'm Talking about this a lot either sunny ma shows the X factor for the patriots often simply because now New England has a running back\nWho they can actually give the ball to and he can run in between the tackles the running back it's not simply just a threat out of the back bill and Rob Gronkowski talked about the fact\nThat this is our is brings a play action\nGames if you have Jeff Gordon do you play him in a game like this weekend because the chief deep and we know is vulnerable and we kind of saw the very beginning I think last week of what the patriots often can really become with Julian Edelman backs Sony Michel had two straight good games I was just going is going to see a lot of deep shuts down to steal do you\nI absolutely one hundred percent stone cold agree with you on that and that and it's really a shame that this game Gordon is going to have his breakout and it isn't going to be you know earlier on in the day the cheese secondary just\nAwful and she's got to put up some points but I think this is the game that Tom Brady shows everybody that\nHe is still a top two or three quarter back in this league and all the hype is going to be on the home but especially if you're playing a daily fantasy say like a FanDuel are drafting this is a great time to fire up Josh Gordon I really love him in this match us\nSo we are top two running backs this week when you make your board every weekend and talking about fantasy football who do you think are going to be in the top two or three in terms of points production based off their match up\n[noise] [noise] well I I really like Todd girlie against the Broncos because you saw what Isaac rollout get right I mean two hundred and Nineteen yard last week\nAnd girly is stronger he's got a much better off and divide and he's got that much better ability to cut and run a I really do like Chris Carson against the Oakland Raiders and I tell you what you talked earlier about the Denver ah their Denver rams game yeah\nThe rams are giving up five yards per rush and that's including again and again it's been a soda that they had ... ... ... Russians and basically all the gave up on the run and getting their their runs he found the underbelly has been really really saw\nSo I I think if Chris Carson and Mike Davis can rush for a hundred and eighty four yards and thirty two carries there's no reason to think that the combination\nOf bill of Wednesday and writes Freeman wouldn't be able to do the same those those are some guys that I really like\nI also want to keep my eye as well on Ronald Jones coming out to buy it mentioned that that was they got the barber coming into the air for Tampa but he has that anything with his opportunities\nI think not not only did the buccaneers make the change the gym is one thing but I think we're going to the changing of the guard is held back as well\nOf course ... that would be interesting Chris ... is our guest a host of that fantasy football so every single Tuesday night right here on this network SB Nation radio you can follow Christ is work on Twitter at the um tough hike Carolina Panthers in Washington Redskins\nCould this be a game where we see a Cam Newton three hundred three hundred and fifty yard game and here's the reason I say that the Washington Redskins are ranked number six against the ... still\nChristian McCaffrey I think personally well ... the two part question I think he could be limited what are your thoughts on that and do you think can Noone could really have a ...\nSo Christian McCaffrey I think personally well ... the two part question I think he could be limited what are your thoughts on that\nAnd do you think can Noone could really have a bust out game we really kind of waiting for that from candidly North Carolina wants to run the football but after seeing what Drew Brees it did last week to Washington right down to Drew Brees him do does not Drew Brees\nBut I could see this being a gamer Cam Newton has about three hundred three hundred fifty are so what do you think of camp and Christian McCaffrey for this week against the Redskins the fence I gave up forty one point someone in football\nI don't know that I'm going to be looking at a real big game for for ... because he didn't look good coming off the by and he didn't really look all that great against the giants so I'm going to temper my expectations we can do on the other side\nYou know Christian McCaffrey here's a guy that you're tagged early David Johnson levy on bad oh a Alvin ...

with the minor\nBelong to a high five super contest ... you can find all those links to Greg's work on a Twitter page edgy unit underscore eighty one All right Greg well I gave you might walk to the week last week and you agreed with me we were both wrong it was the Baltimore Ravens against the Cleveland Browns\nDid not work out well although really should've because Baltimore ... touch down in the game which still trying to figure out\nSo I'm looking at another bred very similar to that and it's another team that I really like and they're on the road so it's kind of the same situation as last week\nSo I Want to run this by you to see if I should be on guard with this Chicago Bears minus three and a half coming off of by I think this is a really good bet going down to Miami Dolphins completely losing it and the second half this is a team that I never believed and even though they were when they were three you know but the\nBears defensively how is Miami going to move the football do you like Chicago minus three and a half this week\nI actually took the Miami Dolphins plus three and a half I and I actually on the\nDolphins and this one I think the rights and it was actually a decent quarterback and I just don't know what we're going to get out and rituals you miss the wise I mean it's a field if you're sick stop trying to get into buccaneers the press a lot of space that probably one of the bottom ... in all of football\nBut with that said the beer the very very solid but does he like a different team when they hit the road as compared to what all\nLifetime that are out there playing against the wall e Arizona Cardinals\nThey barely won that game right to point and if they would win this game by two points that would not be a cover I think the bears are more of a home team they're very young and I think that going to Miami gives the dolphins a little bit of advantage I think Kennedy stills was actually going to cover up that secondary\nMm okay well let me uh I I look at it this way right if you I think the playing this game actually and I'll give you what my I I might teaser of the week 'cause I always do one teaser every single week\nAnd it involved this game I like the under specifically in this can be understood at forty one and a half I teased it up to seven points to forty eight and a half so let me just run this by you okay I had the bears Miami Dolphins game and under forty eight and a half\nAnd then I said I think both teams will struggle to score either both teams will struggle to score and the jaguars cowboys games how they get to forty I don't know but again it's a teaser so I moved up to forty seven and a half\nAnd then I really liked the Packers your Green Bay Packers they set up minus the half you teach that seven down if you get 'em at less than a field goal so what do you think over all of that that was my play of the week that I've been talking about a lot on the air this week Green Bay Packers minus a two and a half\nThe jaguars the cowboys game under forty seven and a half and then I have the Chicago Bears Miami Dolphins came under forty eight and a half\nBoy two games are games I actually stayed away from I think that the bank or should be able to lock up the forty niners I just don't have enough faith ... said to them being able to cover the current Vegas line which is why I ask where you take a look at why because the Packers\nAnd let's face it they probably should have won the game gets alliance last week there were four of us feel goes from Crosby and none of them is Dr ... and on top of that and the Packers also got really lucky with a phone call it was ruled the law on on uh the Packers are really should have been\nThere ball I like the five yard line or something like that instead of the wind you first and goal and that that was very very unfortunate game if you back the Packers in that one and then taking a look at your other game with the Jacksonville Jaguars versus the Dallas Cowboys\nI don't think there's going to be a ton of points court or that that I think though wind between forty and forty and a half on the total is very very tight if I really had to play it I Would go over just because we have seen the ... the ... the parents got a little bit expose against kids the cheap because\nLet's be out if you're the chief for thirty points last week and Patrick ... really didn't have that could've again yeah it was actually more or less the running even though I was able to get the job done so\nThe jak looked a little bit sketchy if I had to play that game I Will take Grover do getting the forty seven and a half to two forty and have good move there just because I think that that is a game that could fall right on like a total forty to forty five a book like\nThat ... Peterson is our guest of that school was the pie or along with high five to super contest podcasts he's on the ... did that the dot com hotline when is with us you can follow grunt work on Twitter or at the unit underscore eighty one so I Will be at the\nBill Texans game this weekend and the Texans are favored by double digits in this game why\nBecause the bills are team that we just have no idea what we're going to get out of your mind a couple of weeks ago they were catching sixteen points against the Minnesota Vikings they wind up putting that gave All right there next week they go to lamb voted take on the Green Bay Packers they score a grand total of zero point that game corny to nothing\nThen they come back for the next week and knocked off the titan because of pretty much a field goal but so I end up paying search or I should say the bills are just such a deep bottling team one week actually look halfway decent\nThe next week they're getting blown up by thirty five point there's really no in between with this game and the Texans are coming up and I went against the Dallas Cowboys and keep in mind the week before they probably had a bit\nBeing blown up by thirty five point there's really no in between with this team and the Texans are coming out for a nice went against the Dallas Cowboys and keep in mind the week before they probably had a big confidence losing weight against the Indianapolis Colts even remember the old one port of Portland for a little\nField I've no idea why they did that actually punted on a draw\nThey weren't for the win and they did not pay off for them so the Texans are right now ... riding high it's all very good quarterback and they have a good quarter back into shot walks and hooking up with new cop can ... I think for the best spiders bigger than the game I think that's why it's there and I just stayed away from this phone altogether\nIs a game that you're staying away from it as well the patriots versus the chiefs I mean look I think this is going to be the best game of the weekend Greg patriots their favorite by three points because that's the three that they are given because they're the home team the over under Senate sixty so let me just start there\nDo you think sixty [laughter] what do you think of that until the ... sixties to even even too low of a total for game like this\nI just came over sixty and they and they felt that are still\nProfess Charles effect the I mean\nThe chief keep in mind they play the game that had it all forty bar last week versus the Jacksonville Jaguars to cheat he showed a little bit of life and they still have guys like me for a company that are able to rush the pastor so I Do things that I\nI'm going to be playing this game funder was that said I actually did it make a play on this game I like the New England patriots and the reason why is because\nIn the parade dollar check era dating back to the other one\nQuarter backs under the age of twenty five that play on the road in part grow only twenty three all tied\nAll you need to do is have the patriots won by a field goal\nI really feel good about this one just because we've seen the patriots ever since they lost that game to lie and they've been steam rolling their opponent by and he went into Fox ... through you know they got crushed next week they take on the Indianapolis Colts dangerous absolutely boiled them in that fourth quarter I think that the patriots were Julian Edelman\nAnd Josh coordinate the disposal of Tom Brady are going to be able to win this game I at least it's not just\nLet me push back on your grand just a little bit here okay obviously we have the chosen one the golden arm the you know Showtime and Patrick bummed out there what do you like about the patriots defense that really gives you the confidence they can cover the three\nWell we took a look at the last week against the Indianapolis Colts anger ... came to throw the ball sixty three times in that game and yet the patriots even was able to hold up I Believe they gave up to try to junk food that game and that was going to Andrew Luck throwing the ball left and right\nNow keep in mind the chiefs are up and running game it's going to be a little bit better obviously Karim ... is eight ... upgrade to high end to the Colts had running the ball for like Fifteen carries for forty five yards a night game so\nI Am keeping that in mind but with that that actually do like the way the Patriot act and playing defense past couple of weeks\nHe also did a good job of locking down right down the hill and companies so I think the patriots are picking up on them I think they can hold the troops to something like twenty four points scored thirty one themselves to get at some point when\nAn extra twenty five percent bonus that is a one hundred and twenty five percent bonus only with the ... when at one twenty five you know every time I talked to ...

S. C. and and my perception again it is is that it's good for the USC he's a big fan of a sport gigantic fan of sport so he probably will give you the all right this is not good\nOpinion of it he might come at it from Danny wife's point of view saying look USC is trying to make the ... the image one thing and these kind of\nThings that happen or not good for the image of the USC I completely disagree because if the casual fan I'm walking on the reality show we now have a reality show\nYeah the New York football giants who are not one in five\nAirline manning has lost the locker room there are reports that came out that look behind closed doors several giants players I'm reading a quote from aid that's been article behind closed doors several giants players have expressed frustration with Mannix performance\nOne player specifically commented recently about manny's inability to do anything against covered to end zone defensive and pro football focus has a website I really like\nPro football focus came out with some interesting statistics which I did not realize until I read this article manning okay one of the major criticism that older Beckham has had is the inability to throw the football down the field\nAnd these statistics prove that OK Manning's average depths\nPer target on third down this year is seven point one nine yards that is not that far okay that ranks twenty eighth of a week now here's the compound that statistic okay\nOn third down and for yards or more evenly manning has twenty nine forty that's a good number right that Seventy two percent third down at Fort twenty forty Seventy two percent\nHere's where we get into trouble two hundred and Seventy three yards zero interceptions two hundred Seventy three yards twenty nine forty two hundred Seventy three yards\nBut just third teen of those twenty nine completion have resulted on for of up in the first down third Tina that twenty nine so again going back to the beginning of that sentence third down and for all you need is for yards\nAnd ... and he's made twenty nine completion and third team of the twenty nine only Thirteen other twenty nine Bobby\nHave resulted in first and that means that he's got multiple third down enforce any complaining to your passes now where does the blame do you watch the game I don't necessarily completely put her on Eli\nBecause you watch the game tonight and you watch the giants progressively throughout the year the office of line I mean do you watch the office of wine and the second half I mean again I compare them to human ... and the first hour\nHe really had no shot so look\nThis is the locker room has trouble or do that can junior and his antics tonight's going out he's yelling at having a deep conversation with an air conditioner\nThat turned physical with his fist punchy I imagine if he turned into David Wells remember David ... New York people will remember this David Wells punched the wall he's got the David Wells mind\nBut he's a much more valuable player than David what David Was broke his hand punching a wall after a game\nI bring this up just because New York fans will understand that I don't know maybe it's just the energy in New York brings out this stuff in in their athletes we're strong shepherd flipping trash cans we had ... back in June of last year's of punting that\nThis year it's an air conditioner I mean he was having a detailed conversation go back when you get off the roads and I watched a video of oh don't let them junior having a detailed conversation with a at an air conditioner tonight\nOn conditioner\nBecause he can't talk to anybody he already talked to his team right he did that so tonight because things were going badly I mean how immature can you\nAnd because you can't talk to anybody he already talked to his team right he did that so tonight because things were going badly I mean how immature can you be Bobby ... punching an air conditioner tonight\nThis is the leader this is the one everybody this is the captain [noise] I don't know the ranks of the military I'm Sorry but this is your Heine is this is a guy everyone's going to get behind I Know your heart you thank you that'll work\nI Know you're high and it's just not a member of the military I'm telling you this is due they're supposed to go behind you leader is punching an air conditioner when you're down by twenty points I I just think\nThis is gonna fall so fast for the giants in freefall\nAnd again I'll stress this point I'm watching the game say going Barclay had a great game but the giants made the wrong decision the giants should've drafted Sam Darnell with the number to pick and it's a giant fan you're gonna watch the next ten years\nIf they don't get dressed in Herbert if they if they really did which is I'm hoping is what happens is a giant fan here you don't want it Fifteen Herbert out of Oregon that guy looks like a pro quarterback used thanks so much you pull the felt Philadelphia Seventy Sixers process thing here and you'd be so bad that you draft yourself a quarterback\nAnd that would be okay here's the silver lining if you're a giants fan\nLet me give it to you somehow it's like throwing up with three pointer that was so bad\nThat you get the offensive rebound okay sure they throw up to three pointer shouldn't have thrown up to three pointer by drafting say going Barclay okay but it was such a awful decision that guess what\nYou might end up with the number one pick is a bad metaphor but you might end up with the number one pick next year because he has shown your aggression overtime and you could end up with like a junior cycle and Barkley\nAnd Herbert that his name right Justin Herbert Hoover yeah that's a future manning he's expired yes [noise]\nI hate to say it I hate to say it 'cause you know the giants won two Super Bowl to civil MVPs\nBut there is no role for him on this team the team in young they look ready to move on and the game was the tone of this game was set tonight Bobby when he went through a horrible pick on the first possession and that led to an eagles touchdown even ... even should retire\nI don't think I'm overreacting he should retire after this year he should go out he's going to be a hall of famer but there is no room for him on this team and he's not going to be one of these guys have mentors Herbert if he comes in\nBut I'll tell you what the New York to apologize absolutely awful tonight and they should take the rest of the season we talk about taking his bad in sports\nTanking would be the wise decision right now for New York one in five it ain't happening this year\nWill get you the bad and go get yourself a quarterback for the future because the jets have hope giant can get some help by being really bad I when we come back we're going to talk about the best game of the week in the film is opening

radio dot com Leo Raleigh auto parts studios\nHere's Matt Arab and welcome back and there's there's no but the night SB Nation radio Matt Harris back with us let's jump into our vantage they vote ball ... with Chris tubs he runs that fantasy\nFootball so on this network every Tuesday night you can listen to him you press you can find on Twitter at the M toss All right so I think we have an interesting match\nUp in terms of just on the field which is impossible really interesting fantasy prospects in the Denver Broncos Los Angeles ramps game now looks Patrick buy homes had his worst game and it was still a good game\nAgainst the Denver Broncos defense in this once again is in Denver what kind of production do you see Jared ... because for me example I of Jared go off and I have Andrew Luck and I'm not going to ask you to you know pick for me because that's what I'm supposed to do on the fantasy football in our culture and New York to play the jet\nBut do you use the Jared Goss numbers taking a decline this week Chris simply because Denver gave Patrick bombs to run for their money and we all know how good homes that\nI don't think so I think you can buy your go up as a style and quarterback number one now he might be back in value but\nNot the the no fly zone of the last two three years and this is not a I'd eat then that is going to really scare anybody so you can fire a Geron golf now it does sound like brand and cook the Cooper cup they've all what last week with a concussion they were both limited in practice\nIf those guys don't go but it sounds like you're trying to get the right direction that would be the only reason I wouldn't quite Geron golf [noise]\nBut if nothing else you've got the wound up off the tiger early so you could still be looking at two fifty to two Seventy five and two to three touchdowns which would be more than than adequate for the one value\nThe only the only reason I ask that is because the Broncos uh you know I think at home this game as in Denver and I think they're great home team and that is a great home field advantage that is one of the late afternoon games the other interesting late afternoon game to me is the jaguars playing the cowboys down the Dallas Cowboys defense obviously has the strength of this team\nBut would you imagine if you have Blake borders on your team which I'm not imagining many people do but maybe your quarterback is on a by this weekend you had to go get like ... I\nThink this could be one of those weeks that you would play him simply because there is no wonder for net TJ yelled in is injured he's going to play but at a gym all Charles they literally just got off the street so\nI think the cowboys could put the jaguars it's a third of long situations which would give blood boil the opportunity to throw let's say you have a quarterback on your on by this week\nOkay and maybe by bottles are still in free agency would he be one guy you would go after simply because of the lack of running game that Jacksonville could have this week\nI think he's on streaming map if you've got somebody that\nThat ban on your roster I Know but the thing about my morals and sold yet on hide boredom bad morals good or bad mortal last week we saw bad morals reporter step since but he didn't have or hundred dirt yard and he had won rushing score and garbage time so those patterns that\nYou're looking at a by when you could possibly ... you could possibly why am I wouldnt fire him up though with a whole lot of confidence but he's always been bred for big game when he when I went in\nWhy am I wouldnt fire him up so well with a whole lot of confidence but he's always that threat for big game when he when Lenin or no doubt\nSeems like this Jacksonville off and it's not for whatever reason they play better there there are more balanced with the jails and and I can't for the life of me figure that out\nYeah hey I'm with you Chris subs is our guest host that fantasy football so every Tuesday night harness network SB Nation radio you can find Christmas work on Twitter at C. M. tubs I'm All right so obviously the huge game this week is this Sunday night or chiefs and patriots let's say you have John scored it OK you picked up just scored and you took a flyer on them and like the thirteenth around\nTwelve round something like that because you thought that he might give you some production in Cleveland now he goes to New England I think the emergence of sunny my son I talked about this a lot\nEither sunny ma shows the X factor for the patriots often simply because now New England has a running back\nWho they can actually give the ball to and he can run in between the tackles the running back it's not simply just a threat out of the backfield\nAnd Rob Gronkowski talked about the fact that this is now is brings they play accident game if you let Jeff Gordon do you play him in a game like this weekend because the chief deep and we know is vulnerable and we kind of saw the very beginning I think last week of what the patriots often can really become with Julian Edelman back sunny Michelle had two straight good games\nI scored is going to see a lot of deep shuts down to feel do you\nI absolutely one hundred percent stone cold agree with you on that and that and it's really a shame that this game record is going to have a break out and it isn't going to be you know earlier on in the day that she's secondary just\nAwful and she's got to put up some points but\nI think this is the game that Tom Brady shows everybody that he is still a top two or three quarter back in this league and all the hype is going to be on the homes but\nEspecially if you're playing a daily fantasy say like a FanDuel or a drafting this is a great time to fire up Josh Gordon I really loved him in this match us\nSo your top two running backs this week when you make your board every weekend you're talking about fantasy football and who do you think are going to be in the top two or three in terms of points production based off their match up\n[noise] [noise] well I I really like Todd girlie against the Broncos because you start with Isaac ... right I mean two hundred and Nineteen yard last week and girly is stronger he's got a much better off and divide and he's got that much better ability to cut and run a I really do like Chris Carson\nThe Oakland Raiders and I tell you what you talked earlier about the Denver ah the Denver rams game yeah\nThe rams are giving up five yards per rush and that's including again that gets Minnesota that they'd Galvin protect Russians and basically all the gave up on the running game ... they're they're run defense the underbelly has been really really saw\nSo I I think if Chris Carson and Mike Davis can rush for a hundred and eighty four yards and thirty two carries there's no reason to think that the combination\nOf Philip Lindsay and Royce Freeman wouldn't be able to do the same\nThose those are some guys that I really like\nAnd I also want to keep my eye as well on Ronald Jones coming out to buy it mentioned that that was they got paid Barbara coming into the air for Tampa but he has that anything with his opportunities and I think not not only did the buccaneers make the change the gym is one thing but I think we're going to see that changing of the guardian held back as well\nOf course ... that would be interesting Chris ... is our guest host of that fantasy football so every single Tuesday night right here on this network as the nation radio you can follow Christmas work on Twitter at the um tough\nHike Carolina Panthers in Washington Redskins could this be a game where we the eight Cam Newton three hundred three hundred and fifty yard game and here's the reason I say that the Washington Redskins are ranked number six against the rod so Christian McCaffrey I think personally well a two part question\nI think he could be limited what are your thoughts on that\nAnd do you think can Noone could really have a bust out game we really kind of waiting for that for candidly no Carolina wants to run the football but after seeing what Drew Brees\nIt did last week to Washington right now is the last two Drew Brees him doing this not Drew Brees but I could see this being a gamer Cam Newton has about three hundred three hundred fifty are so what do you think of camp and Christian McCaffrey for this week against the Redskins defense I gave up forty one point someone in football\nI don't know that I'm going to be looking at a real big game for for ... because he didn't look good coming out to buy and he didn't really look all that great against the giants\nSo I'm going to temper my expectations which can do on the other side you know Christian McCaffrey here's a guy they caught early David Johnson lady on bad oh a Alvin ... Christian McAfee these are all guys that are counted on to be big big part of the passing game but\nThe U.S that outcome offering you an extra twenty five percent bonus that's a one hundred twenty

Patrick moms Houston Texans I think are very much in the right direction you get a guy like this on ... knee stay healthy\nQuarterback is the most important position on the field and sometimes you take risks\nI I understand that Sam Darnell might have been a risk okay Sam during it was a pro ready\nBut you you know the fact that the the giants thought that they could win this year\nWith a guy anyway many who was who was continually showing signs of progression over time it wasn't just this year\nThis did this did not come out of nowhere him throwing a you know ... if not being good

I\nThink this could be one of those weeks that you would play him simply because there is no water for net TJ yelled in is injured he's going to play but a Jamal Charles they literally\nThose weeks that you would play him simply because there is no limit for net TJ yelled in is injured he's going to play but at a mall Charles they literally just cut off the streets so\nI think the cowboys couldn't let the jaguars it's some sort of long situations which would give blood boil the opportunity to throw let's say you have a quarterback on your on by this week\nOkay and maybe ... distilling free agency when he the one guy you would go after simply because of the lack of running game that Jacksonville could have this week\nI think he's on the streaming map if you've got somebody that\nThat than I Am here roster I Know but the thing about ... board on since so Jekyll and Hyde board will buy more of those good or bad mortals last week we saw bad morals but before interceptions but he did had four hundred thirty are and he had a long rushing scorn garbage time so those patterns that\nYou're looking at a bye week you could possibly ... you could possibly plan\nI wouldnt fire him up so well with a whole lot of confidence but he's always a threat for big game when ... when I went in for next out it seems like this Jacksonville off and it's not for whatever reason they play better they're they're more balanced with the jails and and I can't for the life of me figure that out\nYeah hey I'm with you Chris ... is our guest host that fantasy football so every Tuesday night on the network as the nation radio you can find Christmas work on Twitter at C. M. tubs I'm All right so obviously the huge game this week is the Sunday night or chiefs and patriots let's say you have John ... okay you picked up ... and you took a flyer on and I'm like the thirteenth around\nTwelve round something like that because you thought that he might give you some production in Cleveland now he goes to New England I seen the emergence of sunny my son and talked about this a lot\nEither sunny Michelle as the X factor for the patriots often simply because now New England has a running back\nWho they can actually give the ball to and he can run in between the tackles the running back it's not simply just to throw out of the ...\nAnd ... broadcast he talked about the fact that this is now is brings a play accident game if you let Jeff Gordon do you play him in a game like this weekend because the ... we know is vulnerable and we kind of saw the very beginning I think last week of what the patriots often can really become with Julian Edelman back sunny Michelle had two straight good games\nI scored is going to see a lot of deep shut down the field do you\nI absolutely one hundred percent stone cold agree with you on that and that and it's really a shame that this game Gordon is going to have is break out and it isn't going to be you know earlier on in the day that she's secondary just\nAwful and she's going to put up some points but\nI think this is the game that Tom Brady shows everybody that he is still a top two or three quarter back in this league and all the hype is going to be on the homes but\nEspecially if you're playing a daily fantasy say like a FanDuel are drafting this is a great time to fire up Josh Gordon I really loved him in this match us\nSo your top two running backs this week when you make your board every weekend they talking about fantasy football who do you think they're going to be in the top two or three in terms of points production based off their match us\n[noise] [noise] well I I really like Todd girlie against the Broncos because you start with Isaac ... dead right I mean two hundred and Nineteen yard last week\nAnd girly is stronger he's got a much better off into the line and he's got that much better ability to cut and run a I really do like Chris Carson against the Oakland Raiders and I tell you what you talked earlier about the Denver a Denver ramps game yeah\nThe rams are giving up five yards per rush and that's including again that gets Minnesota that they had Galvin cook protect Russians and basically all the gave up on the run and getting their their run defense the underbelly has been really really saw\nSo I I think if Chris Carson and Mike Davis can rush for a hundred and eighty four yards and thirty two cherries there's no reason to think that the combination\nOf Philip Wednesday and Royce Freeman wouldn't be able to do the same\nThose those are some guys that I really like\nAnd I also want to keep my eye as well on Ronald Jones coming out and buy it mentioned this I was they got paid Barbara coming into the air for Tampa but he has done anything with his opportunities and I think now not only do the buccaneers make the change the gym it's one thing but I think we're going to the changing of the guardian held back as well\nOf course ... that would be interesting Chris ... is our guest host of that fantasy football so every single Tuesday night right here on this network as a nation radio you can follow Christmas work on Twitter at C. M. tough\nHike Carolina Panthers in Washington Redskins could this be a game where we see a Cam Newton three hundred three hundred and fifty yard game and here's the reason I say that the Washington Redskins are ranked number six against the ... so Christian McCaffrey I think personally well ... the two part question\nI think he could be limited what are your thoughts on that\nAnd do you think Cam Newton could really have a bust out game we really kind of waiting for that for candidly North Carolina wants to run the football but after seeing what Drew Brees it did last week to Washington right now is the last two Drew Brees noon is not Drew Brees\nBut I could see this being a gamer Cam Newton has about three hundred three hundred fifty are so what do you think of camp and Christian McCaffrey for this week against the Redskins event that gave up forty one point someone in football\nI don't know that I'm going to be looking at a real big game for for ... because he didn't look good coming up to buy and he didn't really look all that great against the giants\nSo I'm going to temper my expectations which can do on the other side you know Christian McCaffrey here's a guy that ... early David Johnson maybe on but I Do a Alvin ... Christian McAfee these are all guys that are counted on to the big big part\nOf the passing game but Washington they're allowing Ninety two and a half years so less than a hundred yards rushing and allowed five rushing touchdowns this year\nSo they the Redskins as well defensively they rank nice in the league against a passing place so they're very good against the past ... drove where he's at home I I think\nThe Redskins I don't think are a real good team but they're very underrated defensively the though I I Would trust Christian McCaffrey because he is I mean you you obviously can't say because the\n[noise]\nHaven't even talked to tubs the to know to play outside Jeffrey tonight yes outside\nJeffrey [noise] why\nSay going Barclay thirty seven points\nExcept party that's all I got down why are you still got dear God and\nKnow what I mean oh you ... ... soldiers that have a real team to root for oh\nHave a fantasy team to root for hey hey I have three fantasy team to root for and I have gambling baby ... overnight [noise] [noise]\nI'm boarding WMA not while you were born Africans and online at nine forty WMA dot com\n[noise]\nABC News\nI'm Richard ... and ... retirement accounts got you were in us stock indices looked to reverse the downward spiral of the last two days worries\nAbout rising interest rates signs of a slow down in the global economy and concerns over U.S China Trade Center markets into a tailspin against the Dow plunged more than five hundred forty point down over Thirteen hundred in the past two sessions and all more than five percent of the most is given up since February ABC\nDario all bigger President Trump not pleased with reason interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve\nI think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is we're all\nThat said Jerome Powell appears to be safe is chair of the nation's central\nBank no I'm not going to be her mom just disappointed uh at the ... but I think it's far too fast\nCustoms data shows China's trade surplus with the U.S widened to a record thirty four billion dollars in September exports to the U.

Cleveland Browns did not work out well although really should've because Baltimore\nDinosaur touch down in the game which still trying to figure out\nSo I'm looking at another friend very similar to that and it's another team that I really like and they're on the road so it's kind of the same situation as last week so I Want to run this by you to see if I should\nBe on guard with the Chicago Bears minus three and a half coming off of by I think this is a really good bet going down to Miami Dolphins completely losing it and the second half this is a team that I never believed in even than they were when they were three you know but the bears defensively how is Miami going to move the football\nDo you like Chicago minus three and a half this week\nI actually took the Miami Dolphins plus three and a half I Am actually on the\nDolphins than this one I think the Ryan than it was actually a decent quarterback and I just don't know what we're going to get out and rituals risky but why it's I mean it's a field if you're sick stop trying to get into buccaneers the fence a lot of space that\nProbably one of the bottom probably be fences and all of football\nBut with that said the bears the very very solid but does he like a different team when they hit the road as compared to a whole lifetime that had thorough they played against the wall the Arizona Cardinals\nThey barely won that game right to point and if they would win this game by two points that would not be a cover I think the bears are more of a whole team they're very young and I think that going to Miami Dolphins a little bit of the oven and vantage I think Kennedy stills was actually going to cover up that secondary\nOkay well let me uh I I look at it this way I write a while you I think the playing this game actually and I'll give you what my I I my teaser of the week 'cause I always to want to use or every single week\nAnd it involved this game I like the under specifically in this game the understanding forty one and a half I teased it up seven points to forty eight and a half so let me just run this by you okay I had the bears Miami Dolphins game and under forty eight and a half\nAnd then I said I think both teams will struggle to score high they both teams will struggle to score and the jaguars cowboys games how they get to forty I don't know but again it's a teaser so I moved up to forty seven and a half\nAnd then I really liked the Packers your Green Bay Packers they set up mine is to have you teach that seven down you get 'em at less than a field goal so what do you think over all of that that was my play of the week that I've been talking about a lot on the air this week Green Bay Packers minus a two and a half\nThe jaguars the cowboys game under forty seven and a half and then I have the Chicago Bears Miami Dolphins came under forty eight and a half\nBoys two games are games I actually stayed away from I think that the Packers should be able to lock up the forty niners I just don't have enough faith ...\nSaid to them being able to cover the current Vegas line which is probably around ... ... where you take a look at why because the Packers I mean let's face it they probably should have won the game gets alliance last week\nThere were four men still goes like Mason Crosby and then I missed out on top of that and the Packers also got really lucky with a punt call it was ruled the law on on uh the Packers are really should have been\nThere a ball I like the five yard line or something like that instead of the line at first and goal instead that was very very fortunate and gave him if he backed the Packers in that one\nAnd then taking a look at your other game with the Jacksonville Jaguars versus the Dallas Cowboys\nI don't think there's going to be a ton of points court that said I think though wind between forty and forty and a half on the total is very very tight if I really had to play it I Would go over just because we have seen the ... level up on the fact that the jagged defense got a little bit pose against against the cheap because\nBe honest here the chiefs for thirty points last week and Patrick ... really didn't have that kind of a ... yeah it was actually more or less the running game that was able to get the job done do the jags looked a little bit sketchy if I can to play that game I Will take their over though getting the forty seven and a half instead of forty and a half\nTo move there just because I think that that is a game that could fall right on like a total forty to forty five a book like\nThat ... Peterson is our guest of that school was the minor alone with high five to super contests contests he's on the beat the ... with us you can follow grants work on Twitter ... and the unit underscore eighty one so I Will be asked to build\nTexans game this weekend and the Texans are favored by double digits in this game why\nBecause the bills are team that we just have no idea what we're going to go up keep in mind a couple of weeks ago they were catching sixteen points against the Minnesota Vikings they wind up putting that gave All right there next week they go to lamb voted take on the Green Bay Packers they score a grand total of zero point flus that game twenty two to nothing\nThen they come back next weekend stock off the tongue because of pretty much a field goal ... so\nAnd the pain search or I shouldn't say the bills are just such a deep bottling team one way to actually look halfway decent the next week they're getting blown up by thirty five points there's really no in between with the team and the Texans are coming out but nice went against the Dallas Cowboys and keep in mind the week before they probably had a big confidence losing weight and getting the Indianapolis Colts\nEven remember the cold front part out for them for a federal appeals\nI've no idea why they did that I actually\nPrinted out and draw they weren't for the win and it did not pay off for them so the Texans are right now ... riding high it's all very good quarterback and they have a good quarter back into shot walks and hooking up for the cop can I think the best spiders secrets of the game I think that's why it's fair and I just stayed away from this phone altogether\nIs a game that you're staying away from it as well the patriots versus the chiefs I mean look I think this is going to be the best game of the weekend Greg patriots are favored by three points because that's the three that they are given because they're the home team the over under a set of sixty so let me just start there\nDo you say sixty [laughter] what do you think of that until the sixties to even even too low of a total for game like this\nI just can't get over sixty and they and they saw the ad or still professional the friends I mean\nThe chief keep in mind they play that game that had it all forty bar last week versus the objects jaguars cheap cheap and showed a little bit of life and they still have guys like the foreign companies are able to Russia's pastor so I Do think that I\nI'm going to be playing this game under what's that said I actually didn't make a play on this game I like the New England patriots and the reason why is because in the brain dollar check ... dating back to the other one\nQuarter backs under the age of twenty five that play on the road in part grow\nOld twenty three outside all you need to do is have the patriots won by a field goal I really feel good about this one just because we've seen the patriots ever since they lost that game to lie and\nThey've been calling their opponent finally went into Fox for her you know they got crushed next week they take on the Indianapolis Colts they just absolutely boiled them in that fourth quarter I think that the patriots with Julian Edelman and Josh coordinate that it's supposed to\nNext week they take on the Indianapolis Colts they just absolutely boiled them in that fourth quarter I think that the patriots were Julian Edelman and Josh coordinate the disposal of Tom Brady are going to be able to win this game I at least ... let me push back\nOn your ... just a little bit here okay obviously we have the chosen one the gold unarmed Showtime and Patrick homes out there what do you like about the patriots defense that really gives you the confidence they can cover the three\nWell we took a look at the last week against the Indianapolis Colts\nAnger ... came to throw the ball sixty three times in that game and yet the Patriot the phone was able to hold off I Believe they gave up to chart junk but that game\nAnd that was going to Andrew Luck throwing the ball left and right now keep in mind the chiefs are up and running game it's going to be a little bit better obviously Karim ... is a a upgrade too high and to be called tad running the ball for like fifty carries for forty five yards a night game so\nI Am keeping that in mind but with that that actually do like the way the patriots had been playing defense festival we\nAlso did a good job of locking down right down the hill and companies so I think the patriots are picking up momentum I've been taking over the
