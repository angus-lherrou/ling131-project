handful of years or so it's a really tough environment really that the ... are facing the party broke doesn't go especially\nThere's a lot of things are really concerned me I feel like I'm In eternal optimist when it comes to the badger state they just when the next six games and Ohio State in Penn State you know like they get into a some sort of a off the field accident\nAnd none of their starters can put the badgers have an outside chance at that at that point in college playoffs that's how I usually approached the badger this game was got me worried for life for different reasons one of which is the uncertainty at the quarterback position one is going to\nEvanston to play northwest around the world where the ants had some hiccups and losses in the in recent history and you just don't know what you're going to get\nOut of northwestern from week to week basis no matter what year it is or what team they're feeling they can come out\nAnd play really really well and beach you can come out and just be a complete dud Stanley an egg on the field and the badgers could roll\nThe badgers might win by for touchdowns tomorrow they might lose that I think is the part that has me a little uneasy about the matchup altogether\nAnd finally our final topic always usually off\nTopic not usually anything pertaining to anything hurting and Josh\nLet's talk about movies yeah we have a

valleys thirty yard line\nOff of the phone bill recovery [noise]\nWhat an unbelievable turn of events and it was all river valley in the first half until the very final seconds and lakeside Luther was able to break through now in the second half the defense comes up with a three and out a form of recovery and lakeside Lutherans got the ball deepen river valley territory with an opportunity to take their first lead of the night\nAnd I didn't see who recovered that fumble but either way it's first intends for the warriors\nAnd the Blackhawks twenty nine miners who is going to drop back the passes

Adam blanketed Bailey than stopped through across the field high up in the air will Julie the comeback about ten yards for the ball caught it\nEscaped one tackle and then on the second hit lost the ball and it looks like lakeside pounced on it and they did recover it\nYeah it's going to go as a Fifteen yard past before the phone call and it was good enough for the first time but he just kept fighting for yard is and that's when the ball came loose [noise]\nAnd off over the book does breaks one tackled spin through another one nice eleven yard\nPick up moves that Shane was seven forty left lakeside winning twenty to Thirteen\nAnd you're right you can't fault jewel and necessarily in that situation did a great job coming back for the past but that was a dangerous pass by Bailey but you'll read it perfectly but just scored it out give the warrior defunds credit we talked to that in the pre game\nTheory turnover machine that is now turnover Seventeen on the ... here\nFor a formal Thirteen interceptions\nAnd it comes at a bad time for river valley as a now modest takes it himself and he's going to be close to another first down looks like about a nine yards gain\nBut obviously river valley facing a deficit and the lakeside Lutheran rushing attack really starting to find his groove right now you can believe we're going to see a lot more uh carries here as lakeside losing tries to keep the clock running as we now or\nAre under seven minutes to play here in the game\nAnd the getting an eight yard pickup by Jack ... and you're right this has been ball control office in the second half to drive by the warriors going eleven plus minutes going just Seventy or eighty four yards combined\nHandoff book the book that said it's a line of scrimmage one of the first times we've seen book they're really gain nothing on the ground give credit to the right side of the defense of lying\nBy river valley yeah no doubt about it to ... had a great night at Ninety yards unofficially right now closing in on that hundred yard mark but now a key third down here for a more so for this Black Hawk defense\nAs they need to get the ball back in a hurry here first out here for the warriors and they can be in business\nAs the final minutes start to take away\nSix minutes and ticking for the warriors it's going to be a hand off this time to phony shiny\nHe breaks it up the mail and now he's had some website is that the twenty the tea in that sense the five is he in the end zone no sign from the ... vessels now and now we have a weight sledding still no single fits a touchstone I think they're going to Mark I'm just outside the end zone we'll call it a thirty six yard run\nBy Casey pony ... plenty Shani\nHe went up the middle Josh and then broke it to the far side and that was a foot race got pushed out near the goal line no signals by the officials they are going to mark them short\nFor satellite official did waivers hands but he was trying to grab for the flag at the same time so it wasn't a real clear signal and it looks like the penalty is going to be an sportsman like conduct against lakeside Lutheran after the play\nWe do have a river valley player shaken up on the field and while they're tending to them we want to thank lewd keep plumbing and heating and ... bakery and catering both and Jefferson by\nJohnson bacon Fort Atkinson and by Tyler stuff you're American family insurance agency in lake mills\nAnd Josh with five forty five left you wonder if it was a there was a a penalty on lakeside obviously is unfortunately conduct so it's going to back them up\nBut you wonder if this won't hurt river valley more especially if they can't stop this office in right now they haven't been able to stop the often hear the second half instead of being first and goal and possibly getting the ball back even down to scores like said as a chance to really dwindled is clock down a few\nMinutes yeah they can actually run the ball a little bit more here but\nAt least ... river valley to use their time out early via hand off the book done first in ten and again because it happened after the play the ball a spot at at the one that gets backed up Fifteen yards the sixteen so it's first intent on the\nRiver valley sixteen vote is going to get it to yard run and the clock is ticking Josh five and a half you wonder at what point does river valley look to take a timeout to stop the clock [laughter]\nYeah at this point I'm you know the clocks working against them if they don't come up with the turnover they're going to be in big trouble here is lakeside Lutherans in scoring position and even has an opportunity to kick a field goal based on where they are right now\nBooked in Tampa and the backfield hand off ... going to go left side he'll get back to the original line of scrimmage but the clock Josh more importantly for lakeside Lutheran under five minutes and still ticking away [noise]\n\nAnd lakeside very content to why in this play clock down to inside five seconds each time yeah mark move\nHis river valley is not in a rush or certainly lakeside Lutheran isn't going to be either\n\n... gets the snap everyone rolls to the right side monitor keeps it himself he'll pick up about five yards will say\n\nIn his lakeside Lutheran decides what they're going to do here on this fourth downplay we do have another update from a

his thoughts on how good or the ... you know last night as that game was getting over we were still on the air and I was talking about in and give them all the credit in the world one five in a row there in first place\nAnd in a nice spot there and the AFC South but I saw a ton of reactions hey Bobby\nAnd went to the er the title game there Sunday Night Football\nStaying in the NFC outweigh the sea hawks and the lines it's simple for me and this guy in the winter stays alive in the playoff hunt and the losers out\nWhen it comes to this discussion given the fact that the division the NFC North\nRight bears will get to them in a second Packers have a tough tough to either bigger dogs against the rams this week and I mentioned already the Vikings with the same so if you're the lines if you want to have any chance of the postseason fill you got on the same and same with the Seahawks and the CIA search team that nobody really gave much of a chance to even be in\nThe conversation for a postseason look this year given that as a rebuild maybe they're a little bit better than we thought was how they performed button and I liked the lines of the game by the way but I think the loser of this we can write them off in terms of finding a way to get into the post season on the enough seaside\nYeah I made a ... must win for the lines and I actually the ... the head you went to Miami defeated them\nAnd then you'd be days fast I mean to see how tough on decent like they used to but they still can be dangerous at times when I Want to do so [noise] ah the NFC North is is is is you know have the big right here because they play to the Pakistani around and\nWhy last year likely lobby about I mean if\nYou're the lions you you can be looking at the rams of course being the\nPakistanis easily lose lose this week on the Vikings saints is a toss up game it's a pick on the video game there\nAnd then the bears we don't know what I mean they've lost sooner or we don't we don't know what to expect them into the bears bounce back and that's kind of our next question we'll get to so it's an opportunity for the lion's but I think if you're trying to get in the postseason is was again you need to win on both sides in Seattle is starting to come by but starting to play a little bit better I just don't know while they may be better than we thought\nHow good Seattle really is the choice\nYou know the snacks make a big impact in his first gave me a straight it of course over from the giants I don't know how much he's expected to play\nOn Sunday on the fence on line for the lives but it certainly can't work her can't hurt I should say and and hopefully it's something that the lines get going yeah\nI'm In and they like you said it it's a big win for them if they could get this wind trade it for snacks Los Angeles nickname trade it for ... so I mean I don't know how to\nAct as he will be I mean we just got to the scene loose leaf so it's probably a couple of [noise] I mean some snaps or whatnot but it is a big big win for this can be a big win for the lines that they can secure continuing\nTo go around the NFL how 'bout to Vienna sees Washington at New York so the giants we know their story or a match to me that they've already mailed it in and clearly they're selling everybody off snacks as we just mentioned Eli Apple now with the New Orleans saints trouble with Eli and back then it goes around with the giants right now who knows what the story will be by the time this game is over\nBut Washington I again I don't know out of the division leaders in the NFC you can make a very strong case other than the north where we don't really know who's going to come out there yet\nThat there are certainly one of the weaker playoff seems but Washington with the wind here and I expect them to when there's no reason why I think that why why anybody should have the giants can be Washington Here there really isn't I mean it's in New York maybe that ... we've seen the giants are terrible football to Washington to get the five and to be the first time in ten years\nAlex Smith comes over he's not going to lose your games with the turnovers I think certainly come playoff time that'll be a different story in terms of actually coming from behind that's just not his cup of tea\nBut Alex written and the son of Kansas City ... he's a very good quarterback and he's got to keep you in games for the most part and he has a chance to get to the red skins to five and two for the first time in a decade and the second time in a while and this millennium so he's doing something\nThat they ended up their however doesn't mean this office has been great but it's good enough to beat this giants football teams are officers twenty fifth endpoint for twenty four in total office and so that will be concerned maybe in the postseason but right now against the giants team no problem I expect Washington to a ticket to five and two how about that a NFC\nAccent that I watched it since role in this game\nI mean the giants are they're selling everything I mean you could focus on their three he lived ... in their bedrooms yeah they are they paying for you mentioned the word ... to ... so\nAnd I think the risk of getting hold on to it as they say they just lay their type of games a sub defense run the bottle age when Peterson surprised ... who is still having a great season so far is of his age as caliber so I think Russia's role in his ...\nQuarterback in two thousand eight for the Washington Redskins with Jason Campbell's so evidence five and ...\nThe last one Monday Night football everybody expected this one of the ugly\nBuffalo or the patriots member no Josh Allen still Nathan Peter Ben's on the bench

just kind of look how things are scheduled extremely easy to wrestle at\n... and that's also bought product to finding the worst I mean if you can weigh things we can only go for a good human rights

I Hope I'm only you can call in nine when review and Lincoln and they're probably going to one of the vision that could have probably number four feet\nAnd they're going to get a good chance of

rematch that crazy playoff game with the Vikings and the saints there and and this one's a pick 'em in and rightfully so although the Vikings now it's like they have a a couple of guys banged up that can impact it ... what do you make of these two teams at this point in time and certainly the NFC North where things are kind of live in a large him at that top that division\nYeah I really only two teams are a threat or have shake\nA Philadelphia deserve you know if you do but at this point the eagles to hook up to like the pain that won the super bowl so\nI like saint skiing I Do the same to

particularly well and play with standard this seems after playing ... just a horrific thing require against the box\nHas come to play and they've gotten better and better each week they win this game all of a sudden ... six in ... and they host around the next week so this is a really good game between craves it could be fighting for that by we get that wild card around all on the side of the raft\nAnother team you kind of looked often after this coming Sunday might be at five and two it's the Washington Redskins and the giants as we do and the fire sales be gone there there are a mass Washington with Alex Smith despite it off and that really isn't that impressive whatsoever but he's not made mistakes that is what I like it does and\nYou look at Washington ah should win this game and get to five and two how could you think the Redskins are\nI think I'm at school during the shooting I think their quality team but there are limited team I think the kinds of tribes out by like he he's a good player who's gonna win your game plan on going to lose you any ...\nUsually a feeling here they just don't make a play\nSo I'll get the Redskins I didn't have a good shot of winning the problem is are they better than Minnesota now or in the ... you know other than the rams no if they get the other gets a fair they're probably better off than I think there are all things I don't condone ...\nOut but I just I have a hard call I wouldn't have the right school you know people who are in January and saying yeah I think that roster ... can be the top who were recruited and

B respond to that argument\nThat one kind of got out of the blue one a day kind of ... but it does seem like\nA three point shot him and I was not to join\nYeah basically I'm a anybody who shares profited any a\nA gambling are related to a sports betting a three star really bad or by that state regulators particularly Nevada New Jersey so or the c._e._o. and some of the top you know people in the company argument we get closer and extensive background check\nAnd I'll go say every two years um and er operators who have left the Jersey word about it because they couldn't pass muster or they had to let somebody go because they wouldn't pass muster and so uh\nYou know it it doesn't necessarily mean that\nAnybody in these major sports are at the top or you know unsavory characters it just means that they have to undergo something that a lot of people don't want to go through even though they may be swayed clean and it's just an inconvenience and and a little frustrating um that's what I Will be tried to dismiss away we don't have to do that\nBut I don't see how they can make a piece of the profits from a sports betting and avoid the expense of the regulatory framework at a set up for anybody who\nWere there any point they were from the conference at the ... and the American gaming association agreed upon with regard to sports betting\n[noise] well yeah they're they're trying specially an AJ side um they post extensively oppose illegal sports betting and they would like to see like when you try to make a\nMake a stronger position on try to eradicate those and and so that's something that you know they can they can get rehired they agree on the entirety of the games and that's\nCrucial I mean it's not just crucial leaks which is more obvious but um if you're offering a wager about the sports that are also has to be a convinced that the the the bad is on the up and up so they agree on that so there there's a lot they agree on and\nYou know they can get out from under the integrity issue I think that you know they're going to be a lot more productive discussion between the two\n[noise] you know I ... I was also surprised to read that a rep from the major league baseball said the professional baseball was the perfect sport for him play betting what exactly did they say about that\n[noise] ah well the couple of people said that including a\nA Joe asks her from a William how us the British maker that's basically the U.S has a lot of art and ocean resort and actually the monitors and he was a base where\n... among the Coursera beyond my gateway to thousands of career dancing courses for many of the world's best universities so what can we do for you\n... and the perfect way too much and mail may have been amazing nice to meet the mass production on\nMy almost doubled when I was learning of course there is the reason I'm no ... developed skills I Know are in demand whether\nYou want to own your skills your qualifications or switch careers of course there were provides access interactive learning experiences from schools like the University of Illinois there is in the university university Monday and you can join ... free just next door one one side the around to sign the realm\nOf course there is liberating because let me take control of my education learn what I Want to learn and changed my whole life to increase\nTheir for free next door when one side of the room to find the ... year according to success dino are one one did you sign the around the around [noise]\n\n[noise] you're listening to the house of cards oh\nI've got to show how are we don't we don't show now show hey it's all about ratings maybe we don't um\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\nWe'll\nGo back to ... with the here for those of you just joining us I'm Talking with John Brennan from us match dot com and enjoying online gambling dot com\nWell speaking of FanDuel New Jersey sports books all just first I guess speed bump or hiccup or whatever you want to call it then that was the decision by fandl to pay an eighty two thousand dollar bet the the originally\nDenied as Lloyd for people who aren't familiar with\nThe uh the new story and John what exactly happened with regard to FanDuel and the employee bet that is a gentleman named\nYeah there was a late the late game about we gave him a Broncos raiders game the point at which one team clearly was going to lose the game the Broncos and then they um they had a big big a big play that put them in great position to win\nThe the uh you didn't play better yeah didn't make the adjustment for about eight seconds so that was an opportunity and twelve people did it eleven on line and one person at the mental and um they basically got Seventy five to one odds against the Broncos winning when they were already eroding so\nIt was pretty much ... money and they got it and saw the gentleman in person one eighty two thousand\nAnd it's a little murky do they have to pay\nYou know the sort of seismic shift that David rebuff from New Jersey gave me of course we made in Las Vegas was to basically say that you know now that the fans to wind up paying but they would have to pay a future a\nIs a sort of a dividing line now I'm like you're a if you put out a bad line\nThat's your fault you know and there's a conspiracy or there's a section and there are some you know insider trading type things ah he's not going to make the\nOperator pays going to say well you guys are trying to cheat sheets on the money but if you make a mistake like a sort of human error or they're going to have to pay 'em it's interesting it's it's good for\nA consumer to know that you know again if you'd be honest broker you just don't have to lie and say oh that works for me I make a better eye when that's nice but probably not probably not too happy about it\n[noise] you you know we ... that was so interesting because I was talking to lawyers who we're talking about both sides I mean they were saying no fandl doesn't have to pay and then I got you know you have to pay and ultimately everyone thought that ... just paid just as a PR\nPlus another ... not only not only did they do that but they I think they chose eighty two random people on the rap and gave them each a thousand\nDollars I mean I remember that specifically because I checked my FanDuel lap and I lost [laughter] but um [laughter]\nSo it is that these subtle manner now is that now department of gaming enforcement rag now or is that just David Reebok saying this is what's going to happen in the future\n[noise] well it is complicated I'm probably for the operator is that if they choose they probably could sue ah eating or ... I don't have to pay state it semi by last year and your crew that so out of the pain but\nThat one was a lot of problems one is you're checking off already people want to please yeah you're actually showing your boss which is a complicated and also a court said a lot of course our country understand what you're saying basically that\nYou know the story and they feel it could be department transportation or whatever by our mental protection I they say they can do something they pretty much tougher to them they don't accord doesn't want to say well you say you can do it near the expert we know better where the court battle I could do that so the really starting to be\nA war that the experts in big it was really a problem the legislation ... meaning\nIt's true that we you know in Trenton they could pass a law that clarifies that's further definitely have to pay every time or you don't or whatever so the court is kind of kick it back\nSo it it's a beach for a one operator to win that case and they go in that case they take off their boss so I think that you're going to find that the operator will be more careful and making these bats which is good and uh I think they do oh I think you're gonna wind up paying out\n[noise] you know the eighty two thousand dollar uh when was the big news story but has there been other problems with regard to the sports betting industry and New Jersey that haven't been well publicized that you've heard of war that there are some issues still being worked out within the books or within the sports betting apps\nAre no other than that app storage where basically a candle and then asked because they already had a cruel for their doubt that the sports side\nSo when they made up occasionally I just felt right through and the app store and this isn't true when the institutions to banks and so I actually had fears about it is really legal that we all know so that's a little bit of an echo but I'm pretty much all been resolved now almost\nAn a gun generally pretty slowly it's kind of thing when there is a blunder and it gets all the headlines because it's the only under a lot of blunders that nothing gets a lot so it's been pretty soon they'll\nKnow ... or John before you spend a lot of people were talking about a New Jersey and how they go about their sports betting business I Know you you came back\nBut we're all [noise] you know ... or John before you send a lot of people were talking about a New Jersey and how they go about their sports betting business I Know you you came back from ... um I Know you were tweeting about a hearing in Illinois about sports betting and you mentioned about Washington DC [noise]\nAre you getting the impression that people around the country that they're going to be following New Jersey's models sports betting or are they developing their own methods when it comes to sports betting\nA New Jersey against reference at Emory discussion clearly I'm Better at it and then about a boat or known as very meticulous or\nArbiters of who gets to offer Watson who does it so they they trust those two states important but like Washington DC is the only a region so far that is now talking about going with sports betting they don't have a casino or race track so they have the kind of have their own model but that's all the different\nUm Illinois trying anonymous bill basically like Pennsylvania and where you know upper sports betting or maybe you expand something about horse racing or or ... or\nUm you know they have other issues going on so it's kind of complicated but um I think ultimately when possible or states will kinda defer to a New Jersey does and most importantly what the highlights sports betting Mississippi goes out\nThat all that West Virginia is slower to take on it and it's not going to have it right away but I think the numbers that than yours you caught up in September for online is clarifying for all states now that if we're going to offer this week definitely want to offer this uh online as well\n[noise] you know it's interesting that I rented a news story that Los Vegas sports books are now trying to become more like New Jersey in that they can be offered their sports runners they they can remotely\nA put money into their account or starting an account is that what's happening in Las Vegas that they're seeing what's going on in New Jersey and they're adjusting their business is\nA I think so it's been a little arcade for [laughter] how do they have this deal I mean it it didn't matter that much because almost everybody who goes to Nevada either lives or er visits Las Vegas or say or what do you know [noise]\nUm and there's much somebody else a round the state or even ... casinos so nobody in Nevada lives too far from like us you know so it didn't really matter that much but you had the shop in person but of course in New Jersey all the casinos are in one place in the southern part of state for laxity so you can have people three hours away\nI'm who are very casual possible players are going to say well I'm not driving six hours roundtrip just sign up\nSo that's why the Jersey didn't require that and uh they found out I think about is reacting to what a Jersey does take all states are pretty much got to decide\nYou know I don't I asked this question I I Know if there's any one influential in New Jersey in the sports betting world you've probably talk to them on or off the record and now you look I knew things are going green ... people are making lots of money\nTo welcome back down

little MBA you might get into the world series we'll talk a lot right here on as being Asian radio and SB Nation radio dot com\nI think one of the first things we may get into his Thursday Night Football I think it's pretty impressive what the Houston Texans have been able to do in terms of like a win streak but are they a team that is for real in terms of the standing they are a top of the AFC South\nAnd division that look like\nIt was going to turn around\nBut now with the lights of Jacksonville and tendency is that a scary division anymore or was it ever\nBut we'll get in the NFL there's a bunch of college football games that will discuss will look at some of the lines I like to get into that as well we'll talk Texas will talk\nFive games in a row regardless of who you played an regardless of the strength of schedule that's really tough to do in the NFL that's really tough to do\nAnd whether or not this is just a quick ride for the Houston Texans\nAnd they'll go back to being the Houston Texans that many of us know that still really difficult to do now ideally\nThat shouldn't be the case there are the top the AFC South with a decent cushion it's still early\nBut let's take a look at their schedule\nThey are on the road in Denver against the Broncos\nAnd\nThey'll have a by then they're on the road against Washington\nWho are actually right now the top of their division and if you look at the next four games they actually have a relatively favorable schedule depending on how good these teams are will get into that a little bit later\nThan the Texans face the titans\nAt home and then the browns at home so all those four games\n\nIf they win two of those I think they're in great shape I think they are in really good shape regardless of what the Jacksonville Jaguars do I don't necessarily see them going on a winning streak perhaps they would turn things around but that defense\nLast year was enough to carry that team as long as Blake borders didn't get in a way\nAs long as Blake board or didn't completely create a disaster the Jacksonville Jaguars defense was what carried that team and you just don't see a mirror image even of what this team\nIs this is this season as opposed to what it was last season\n\nBut I Do love\nSome of the officiating and some of the calls that were made in that game and look officiating I guess they're kind of an easy target we can continue to bash him but honestly sometimes it's necessary\nTroy Aikman was on the broadcast from what I've seen on Twitter bashing some of the officiating bad calls going ... against

like last season and I'm pretty sure they're tired of everybody mentioning that\nRight they they got to let go of last season they have to perhaps create an identity or or just an identity\nThat perhaps that they had last season because whatever they were doing last season was working and whatever they're doing this season is just not working as much and now they go overseas something they're actually familiar with\nAnd they play in the stadium\nThe eagles are only a three and a half point favorite but is there any advantage that I can really point to\nThat the Jacksonville Jaguars have against the the eagles\nThey've obviously shown from a defensive standpoint again last season mostly\nThat they could be that defensive team that could carry them\nPretty far\nIf they produce just enough on often like I said earlier before the defense carried the team as long as Blake border then get in the way and make it an absolute disaster\n\nThey've since traded for Carlos Hyde will that help anything\n\nSo it's going to be interesting to see what the jaguars can do there I like the eagles I don't think the fact that they're traveling overseas is going to make that much of a difference\nI think it's important for them I think there are more well rounded team I expect them to handle the jaguars\nNot necessarily kill them but a definitive when for this eagles eagles squad

get into a my predictions and we'll talk about what I feel about some of these games but we'll get right into it and we'll talk\nUm [noise] let's start with Miami Miami at Boston College now\nI like Miami Hurricanes look or they might they might have a problem moving the football because you really can't trust their quarterback play look ... ... at one point ... here was was benched\nOr at one point I think he thought his football career was over\nA but\nAh he earned his he earned a spot back despite are getting that emotion or they kind of depended on him after he was\nBenched they kinda ask them to make a run and make a comeback or I think it was it was it was a multiple it was a to score deficit and\nHe didn't deliver but he came close so he he earned his spot so because of the the quarterback Blaine that's kind of the question mark but I think the big point is pretty much\nEverything that Boston College does in terms of officers running the ball I'm not saying everything like literally everything\nBut a big idea of their officers running I think they're hurricanes do a good enough job against the run and that's the reason why I like the hurricanes there at minus three and a half\nI Believe they started off as the dog\nOr but I like uh I think their mind is three and a half right now are the lines I'm looking at I like uh the hurricanes I expect him to take care of business hay and and they might even win by a touchdown um they're good enough to be\nUm Boston College or let's move on this time a Texans saying them there on the road at Mississippi State a bunch to consider when looking at this game now in terms of defense I Am not worried I'm not worried I think Mississippi State\nCan do just well\nAnd just fine defensively the problem is Nick Fitzgerald we know he commits a lot of turnovers he's kind of a an interception and turnover machine\nAnd the bulldog off ants\nKind of a an interception and turnover machine\nAnd the bulldog off ants is kind of it's kind of one dimensional or so\nWith an M being a top twenty or a top team I should say\nAn rushing yards allowed a PR play\nI think that really helps and I'm now I'm not so sure\nThat and then wins by three or more points\nBut if I had to give you a pick I Will say yes if if killing month can have a decent game which I think he will I don't see why the acts can't take care of business\nSo I actually see and pulling off the upset on the road against Texans saying that\n\nWe move on we keep it moving this time Clemson at Florida State a minus fourteen for Clemson on the road or and I think that's just a lot of points that's a lot of points even for Clemson and look there's no question Clinton's\nDefensive line is probably one of the best if not the best in college football they're absolutely role in\nUh\nAnd Florida state's offensive line has really not performed well this season at all\nSo it's tough for me to believe that Florida State has a chance and winning this game do I think that Florida state's gonna make it competitive enough to keep it within fourteen points were less than fourteen points I think so\nI think ah despite a\nClemson being probably you know probably the de facto ACC champion uh I think I think it's safe to say Florida State as motivated enough [noise] so I like Clemson but I don't expect\nThem to cover [noise] here's a\nHere's a here's one that I actually like Iowa plus five at Penn State or it didn't open at plus five obviously but or even a plus five I'm calling the upset\nI liked the hockey guys\nOn the road I Do I really do I think um\nI think I was without a doubt the tough is the the best team Penn State has faced all season long I really do and I think this is going to be a dynamic that perhaps Penn State may not be ready for\nA plus five I'm totally would that I like Iowa or I like Iowa there\nAnd I think the final game that I Will get into in terms of college football is Texas this is a big game for Tom Herman minus three on the road against Oklahoma State\nUm look I think\nThis is a really really motivated team I really really believe that uh despite the Maryland last which I Know is a really bad look\nAnd you can also make the argument that they're just not consistent or they haven't been consistent enough but I really think Tom Herman and this team really wants to get to the big twelve championship I really think that they want to win this thing\nAnd that's the reason why I think Texas wins on the road or against Oklahoma State and I think they cover\nI wouldn't be surprised if it's two scores I'm willing to go as high as ten points I think Texas is motivated and I think they're going to be ready to win this game as being Asian radio as being Asian radio dot com it's a fan of react our no Chris

county Toyota you can get dropped by anytime just walk in you don't have to buy anything you don't have to unveil out anything which you can ask for an assigned O'Neill outside fishing kept\nYou know by and large on average we are in in a bright spot we've got great quality dear oh we've got good numbers that we're ... we're in the golden days of deer hunting and said to Georgia\nOr before I get to a Mitchell with another question then we are where we are and it's good how long does it take us to get that way [noise]\nIt took a lot of years you know by the turn of the uh turn on the twentieth century uh we had almost annihilated every year in the state uh through habitat destruction and market hunting and it's from the Nineteen twenties until Nineteen Seventy five which was our major uh restocking effort\nAnd then uh we didn't see the population get uh up to a good level until the Nineteen nineties and then it quickly jumped out of control\nRemained over abundant until about two thousand Bob and we got it to the down ... down a little bit too low and then we brought it back up and the last five to five to six years and now we're in a perfect spot so it's been a a a long way and the big roller coaster ride with the deer population\nI Want to include Mitchell in a minute but I I Want to if we don't get before the next break but I Want to handle the following question [noise] how is it that you managed when you had too many here\nFor the habitat how what two did you manage to put it back under control to ... question\nWell there are a couple of different things uh season linked bag limit and the number of the ... those are the major drivers and and what how we control the deer population and to do all of that you gotta have hunters yeah\nThat's the guy yeah otherwise you'd have to hire it done\nBut I well we pay our we\nHave to hunters we wouldn't have the money to hire though that you're right\nWell that's that's good so you know I I think it helps\nThe more you know the more you understand more ability you have to enjoy whether you're fishing hunting or whatever the case might be if a guy on the way to the ... now and he knows how many here in Georgia and the role that you guys play maybe it expands his vision while he's sitting in the deer stand watching the deer walked by and find out\nHow does this all happened and how long did it take I think it ah it allows that got to enjoy the seasons more and it is opening day so a lot of ... in ... and then I asked how many people will be hunting [noise]\nWell what got uh about three hundred and fifty thousand a deer hunters and the state of Georgia and I am not a good a percentage of them are going to be in the woods on up new weekend\nOkay we're going to handle some questions some uh when we get back I have a question for Mitchell and then for both of you when we get back I Want to I'm going to ask for some tactics okay hunting tactics\nFor ah the guy who doesn't have a belief\nThat is a kind of food money in and everything and we'll talk about that and this is O'Neill for all for a seven to zero seven fifty eight hundred nine seven to eight to five five a Michel ... game warden and we'll have a question for him and and we have a college at will look into when we return [noise]\n[noise] so\nIt's kinda weird hearing that speak saying this to be negative about ... he's put together like an absolute monitor right he's six for six five so he's about two hundred and twenty five pounds and he jacked up like you do to get massive arms\nHe's a phenomenal after these massive leg and then you hear of hard to get like this high pitched voice and it's tough to kind of take it in when he's talking it's like wait staff voices coming out of that now it's just bizarre because he has like a Texas accent is usually where we are taxes meant\nSpeak they have like a deep voice withdraw he has a high voice with the drawl but nonetheless that is something that has got to be weird I guess in a fairly Andy Reid described his voice as a frog he sounds like a frog how\nTight snow this broad don't speak but I can see where any Reese coming from where you have a frog was to speak that

out of the violations that you're forced to investigate\nThem but a out of them violations that you're forced to investigate what is the biggest surprise to that person who says what do you what are you after me for what I Do wrong\nThe biggest surprise for most people are license violations I mean people that are\nYou know hunting illegal usually know that other than they'll go to the store go on line they'll buy a license and they won't get the proper license now Georgia has made the effort don't correct in that then the last year they've simplified done away with some license and combine things together to help out\nBut like I said the biggest thing people get in trouble about that they're not aware of is buying the wrong license\nOkay well that's not bad that's not bad or good but it's not necessarily bad it not not they don't have a couple of phone somebody with eight or ten they're in the truck\n[noise] that's right so I mean and we try to help out in that situation if we have service we can help him perched license in our truck I'm\nGenerally speaking we would lot more for saying by licenses and we would the ride them a ticket in that situation uh so we we try to be helpful there because most people that have gone and taking the effort to buy something\nOr at least trying to do the right guy\nAnd you're not [laughter] [noise] and you're not throwing rocks at them because of that\nNo as long as I Try and we will work with them in case you\nAsked me if I was OK Now let's go to some of the callers if you will listen to let's go back [laughter] skews the gas and let's go back and talk to mark calling again from Camden county and let's put it back on their good morning mark\n[noise] or you have a question mark I Believe\nYes I'm trying to find out what the legal justice ill that harder than put bite your property long okay\nMitchell alright the legal distance for deer there's not a specified distance this time\nThey tried to mirror the law for home which is fifty yards from a property line but there were some deal with the law was written and it was left out what you'll probably see in the next year so it'll change to that also made the fifty yards but\nThat the more clear specified this until my dear and fifty are don't home\nOkay does that answer your question mark yeah because I was actually giving air written warning for\nWell in Chicago several different resource officers and say education issue between resource officer and I guess it can falls into the hog hunting issue\nYeah it is a deal for that because it is very specific in the hall gunning those fifty yards\nHow well they are but my question\nIn every ... when you get a flu shot and brought it from beginning to you're going to be assured that you're giving see

San ... in the bottom of the jury is by no means there is a legal or not that close to the line\nFrom Mitchell why don't you comment hold on Mitchell you comment police\nSays no legal setback for stand on the on the line so they can actually be on the line tree now they cannot\nShoot into your hunting club but uh they can actually ... foot to stand on the line if necessary or if they wish I know it's not courteous and we asked people not to but there's no law against that\nWell you've got some rascals next to you there Bryant\nLast hour and\nYou you can't really say illness or I mean they start ... downloads oil a day that got out was solved way for years grown up so\nI Can't say that on the other side they say sort of you know about a mile a whole range but I don't I Would\nWant to make sure that I mean as as I say that because I've been staying home I got one vote a class of one voting fliers I got some nice boss so this way and I don't want to have because so many people just give us some in their own jobs I mean but I ...\nMichel comment well I I Wish everybody was courteous but they're usually not now if they are coming home to your land physically and interrupt in your hunt\nI mean a year in the stand I drive by you there are some walls that can deal with that um and if you want contact your local ranger or local game warden and they can give you the ... called the landowner affidavit\nWhich means is asking that the state prosecuted anybody that those who wrong in this case okay\nI'm now like I said there's no legal setback for them putting staying there but it's like ...\nStaying right national there is a plumber out up more coming by as\nFar away so you could I'm not going to be here but a nicer sale but\nYou know this ... try to avoid conflict with them\nBut like I said if you if you run and keep running into problems to contact your local guy more than the they'll come out take a look at it help you with the landowner affidavit process\nThan if they should shoot of deer on your property then they have crossed the line and um they can be prosecuted that point where they are\nLiterally child child you may want to see our ... a nice day you bet thank you\nGood luck this season you know something else that helps out in those circumstances is just communication just talk with diverse you're not always just ... it might not always gets you somewhere but sometimes you know if people realize that their impact and somebody else it sometimes it can it can work out then you you can form a relationship with your neighbors\nWe always encourage people to form cooperatives and\nUh you know ... you know people that want to protect younger bugs and quality deer manage we we really encourage the formation of multiple property cooperative so you know building up that communication can bridge a lot of those gaps and and uh won't work every time a but you know sometimes it helps just to go to\nMaybe they don't or maybe they don't know that you're there uh what say let's say he's up next Jeff is calling from social circle good morning Geoff\nGood morning Neal how are you a lovely recalled in your own body\nThat is a yeah let me introduce

traded a man he was supposed to be an amazing you know coming from the rams um\n[noise] but he lie apple I mean I can understand that one I can understand you're going to drop effects I can understand

Connor\nUm Bell's not back yet I still think they're off at ... you know a ... it has to be top three in the NFL I think they're combination of Antonio Brown and juniors Mitch tooth or is there\nIt has to be top three in the NFL I think there are a combination of Antonio Brown and juniors Mitch juice or is\nThere without a deal that and dig I don't think anyone else and compete with the deal was um but the browns are always going to play the dealers or the brass at any other coach I Would say that but I was going to win this game but the fact that\nYou you do have a new dog with well you um what's his name was the bronze coach that then why can't it was this huge actually ... he doesn't even deserve a name a I think he hold him back one hundred percent\nUm I don't have the right coach for the theme around think you should be the head coach of any game and that's why I'm given that the Steelers it's going to be very close I'm going to say Twenty one Seventeen Greg when he got\n... and I think especially with this game being at home from Pittsburgh I don't think we see a repeat of what we saw a ... in their first matchups this season I Love Baker Mayfield I Love a lot of aspects of this dish Brown's team play at the end of the day I just think the Steelers you're gonna kinda\nBounce back from this rough start and kinda\nTake some frustration out on a lonely Brown's I Know the brands are are much better on this year than they've been in years past and I know that they're very competitive\nFor whatever reason I Can't get the I'd be out of my head that big bands that matches your lights off Cleveland um icy kinda wanna she's she's performance is happening today are not today starting tomorrow on Sunday [noise] um [noise]\nI think Antonio Brown is going to go off\nI think that I'd Connors going to have a good game um I I think they're just kind of over this this levee on bail drama I think they're over kind of these obnoxious media headlines I think they should want to go out there and and dominate a football game especially at home I I kind of see just being like a thirty five to ten and kindness for\nFools All right so we're on different wavelength on this one I really\nI think it will be close but if it's a blow out at the blow it I've been ... so I'm for that I'm real quick I was talking about the Redskins\nAnd the dry Redskins forward to the giants won insects for some reason was part of the only one and one at one point in Vegas the usually trying to get us to\nBet on the red skins and eerily force in the paper that drive but I don't think it's going to happen this time uh\nI think Alex Smith is going to have himself a day\nUm I think ... Peterson can go round regards I really\nDo think that there was one that then I think the wind when it by over ten points I'm going to say it's going to be twenty eight fourteen Redskins and who knows the giants may have even less people by the time the game happens okay what do you think\nThe accurate than a hundred percent I think um ... you know they're going to be adjusting to kind of tissue personnel and just having such an ugly game at home I think Alex Smith wins this one by at least two shots [noise]\n... finds has got a really fancy soy with a um an Harrison the Austrian three lines three and three\nLions favored by three to game of threes I really I like the line but like how they're they're bouncing back from the early\n... opening game and now they are now I think it's definitely in the right direction\nI'm Matt Stafford gold and said I'm Marvin Jones I Love all three of those guys I think Harry on Johnson and if you listen to the show you have him on your team because I told you to trap them unfortunately I'd unless my own device that I don't have the money though I just thought it was true\nSo those would be my four stars I'm Stafford I think it's going to light a Seattle there is no morally\nDuring the boom there is no more legion of doom is this a legion of gloom so news you've started saffron you can start Kate you've ... you've started carry on Johnson I like all those guys on the flip side Russell Wilson I just I think he's one of the over most over and players on the NFL and and then there's no qualms about saying that\nUm I don't really like anyone on Seattle those waiting Doug Baldwin's really ... than I Would honestly thought pilot a walkout over Doug bald on 'cause I think he's on the most consistent player on the train now um I think the lions when this one I think it's going to be talking about like twenty twenty fourth grade when he got\n[noise] yeah I I like your score prediction that will defend Russell Wilson just a little bit I I I don't know if he necessarily overrated but he was definitely a byproduct of just a really great team and now that they've kind of had to pay their franchise quarterback the rest of the team just really isn't up to snuff [laughter] um\nI don't think that's necessarily just fall I still think he's a good athlete\nBut he's definitely not going to give you those kinds of numbers that we were used to seeing earlier in his career on the line to really benefiting from from kind of helping out early portion of this new map Patricia regime a kind of installing a new era of toughness um I Love them at home here and I think they went by probably a touchdown", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "27"}
