his game with everybody body\nAnd it was like I I kind of like had a premonition I'm not kidding like I had it for I saw ... go back and every every buddy everybody's used it knows the typical Brock interception\nHappens on an overthrown passed now granted I thought there was pass interference or some kind of face masks on that play or something referees were horrible tonight there might be a couple of more referees Beck and fire tonight because there was one that was fired yesterday\nA and there might be a couple of days I mean they were terrible on all counts like not just not in favor of the Texas not in favor of the doubt and I just thought to referee play it was just really bad tonight\nBut that patch that first broadcast while a pass just sailed I mean anybody in Houston remember is that that playoff game against the New England patriots\nAnd they didn't stand a chance and the second half because I swallowed through three intercepted I feel like every single one of them failed\nBut that's what happens [laughter] hey how to use the debt that we're going to go out to energy stadium that's where our guy Jake as men is out there right now ah Jake asthma is going to call into the show up covers the Houston Texans ... pm radio in Houston\nI'm taxed and big win forty two to twenty three of the Miami Dolphins ... got a pack so I this was one of the ... the first days where I I really like I went up there the\nPole in my apartment complex that like went up by the pool and I just read a lot today I was I was a real sports today Bobby real sport just like I read probably an hour and a half NBA news NFL News I'm excited for the show okay when we come back we'll talk a little bit about the tax it's OK twenty five past the hour we're going to go out to energy stadium but we're going to mostly get into\nBoston Red Sox have a hole in their line up\nBoston Red Sox have a hole in their line up okay we need one more power hitter what do we do all we get JD Martinez now the granted no one can predict that Judy Martinez was going to do what he's been doing this year but Jeannie Martinez is the glue\nThat's what championship teams need they need glue okay what is going to make this team which is an eighty five percent right now to a hundred percent\nJimmy Butler is that possible glue if they have any possible chance the Houston Rockets of taking care of the Golden State warriors\nThis is the move to make use sellout you give what ever the Minnesota Tim Walz won and by the way the Minnesota timber wolves if they don't accept this possible traits a river trade\nRight if this is real and Darryl Maury actually went to Minnesota for future first round\nHere in Minnesota how do you not do this Julie Butler's told you that there's going to walk out the door go walk out the door done what made a whole big steak remember the first practice All right I'm going to grab the for worst players on the bench and I'm going to scrimmage against the other for starters guess what I'm going to win\nTom pivotal you may remember that Jimmy Butler does not want to be in Minnesota\nI Want me to the gym I miss the Jimmy ... that was for Jimmy ... but we can't use that any more so now we're going to use it for Jimmy Butler Bobby beach I Want me to the gym managers Jimmy\nJimmy Butler to the rockets makes sense for everybody everybody this is what you do you sacrifice now I'm telling you that if the rockets get Jimmy Butler they're going to beat the Golden State warriors no I'm not telling you that\nBut I'm telling you this last year the Houston Rockets made it a series with the Golden State\nWarriors okay and part of the reason a huge part of the reason they were able to do that\nIs because the defense painted defensive improvement for the Houston Rockets for two years I've lived in the city now Bobby for two years okay and the defense I followed the rockets pretty costly for two years and the improvement for two years ago to last year defensively was huge part of the ...\nAnd a lot of the reasons are harder to prove it because he got caught Chris Paul Chris Paul is kind of a defensive captain that they have and I know that they lose their defensive coach okay who that a lot to do with that\nBut this is the move that you need to make you you again just if you go back to watch the Utah Jazz game thirty eight points for Donovan Mitchell\nWere the Golden State warriors have Kevin Durant Steph Curry who's gonna who is going to guard those guys right now with the team that is right there\nSo if you're rockets fan right now and you're listening you're saying you're strapped to like my friend out in Los Angeles he's like you gotta be kidding me future pit which by the way is the maximum that you can do\nYou know that's the maximum that you can actually you know put in a trade\nSo I'm telling you what this would be a great trade for both teams and I really hope it happens from Minnesota steak\nAnd I hope it happens for the rockets sick because this is will and and you know what I always you know I trust I generally like Bobby I trust like what smart people are thinking Gerald ... is a smart guy there are more knows how to build a team or knows what he's doing okay so you know\nIf he thinks for future first Trump he he didn't he is not going to offer for future first draft pick\nFor a guy who he doesn't believe can help them win now I Love rockets fan you should love this aggressiveness\nUsually wins in sports it has\nIn baseball OK it ... the Golden State warriors smart with their draft picks but aggressive as well going out to build the rest of that team Los Angeles ramps favorites to win the super bowl right now aggressive go out and get done and are endemic to go out and get markets Peter\nOkay go out and get Brennan cooks okay Peterson cooks were trade\nAggressiveness usually wins in sport so you should not have any hesitation as a rockets fan if yourself for first round pick\nThis makes sense to me on all counts for everybody I when we come back we're going to go out to energy stadium Jake as men covers the tax in a very SPN radio and Houston or going to talk about this Thursday Night

Jake all of a sudden\nOh this is a very fun team to cover I Would imagine there as long as there was the first three games or the regular season and everyone was like okay this is going to be miserable we're starting to think about draft picks now they want five an hour or five in a row I I'm not going to ask\nThe stereotypical question how did he often do this tonight so let me ask you this that the big problem when it came to the Texans this year it has been in the office of why did you see improvement with the off in the line from your seat up in the press stuck to allowed to Sean watching to have the time to deliver the football down the field tonight\nMad absolutely and you know just see your point when they started oh and three of the show the conversation wasn't just well what are they going to do and the draft that is built by and going to survive that after he went orange swath of last year and they gave him a four year extension and the off season that was questionable and a lot of people didn't quite understand the rationale that decision\nYou know that all being said the fact that they were on the other five and thirty sitting at first place and they ask you to have you got to give a variety is chaotic credit how do they do it tonight well you're right the off at the blind a shower walk them wasn't back that I end this really goes back\nTo the Jacksonville game as well the last two weeks that comes off as wide as got a tremendous job it's not even just passed protecting\nIt also running the football is the second strike a memorial or as ran for over a hundred yards ... based on the ground Patty average almost I'm going to have yard for Kerry longest running the game of the ... yard run they ended up sending up a touchdown drive for the acting and really after being down seventh and nothing early in this game the Texans often really just went on a Roy\nTheir end up on the team a hundred and eighty eight totally yards on the ground watching quite as bad as well as you could possibly clammy he had more touchdown passes that I was five when he had in completion is only four sixty them twenty to thirty nine I mean he nearly a

I Want to first start with the New York giants a team that are in the last Monday Night football this past week do you see the giants\nAre going to do one is Fifteen do you think the tanking Israel is simply possible for the giants do not win one more football game\nThat not at all they they have way too many good players for that to happen I mean we saw while they're all through several of the foreign Barclay ... who's used our own separate I mean they're going to the fact that will be they have a lot of downloading scene so I can foresee them going at least a six and seven and nine but not one of the Fifteen\nBecause they are uh you know very talented more so than something or in the NFL\nAssets versus the giants because it's on a you know the giants and I almost indecision now where I'm rooting for the team to lose which is is just horrible All right let's let's go around the NFL here I Want to start with this bronco sees can because this was one of the more interesting game the first time these two teams looked up\nBroncos ran the ball well on the first half and they were able to get pressure was four in the first and then the second half happened and Patrick ... magic habits do you think is wrong because you're going to have similar\nSuccess in arrowhead stadium this this week\nI don't think so because when you look at what has happened since then\nIt seems the parents have gotten better actually there are starting to feel a little bit more uh assignments our gas down or they're slowing down against the run and you know they're starting to still be opportunistic defensively and their office and find a balance so there's something to be free bus more of all\nOfficers all federal he's I think the bronco team will see the same can't sue she's seeing these are are we going to buy them for ... but not all these things and you can so\nYou thought when she sees the bangles forty five to ten that was more of a a a positive mark on the ... was a diminished the mark on the bangles do you think the bangles they're going to\nDo what they're traditionally you know Eddie ... Louis teams do kind of downplayed defensively down the stretch so that was more they do a representation of how good the chief Stephens or the strike that they made\nA I Would say so because I still looking for that as a theme that you have in theory and the AFC because of what they have often ladies they're going to start to find a way to get their ground game guard festival there are getting guys back\nIn the fall and I think that we've seen that you know is right up against ... really good football teams that difference between good and great and what you saw last you've seen the cheese and the bangles\nEmery ... is our guest covers the NFL owner or a football game played you can follow him or his work on were at at ball game plan still look one thing that we have seen this in itself is a good teams are two dimensional yeah we obviously know that that she can run and pass the rams are obviously going to pass\nI'm looking at this New Orleans Vikings game and I think it's an interesting match up in this sense I did not realize that I talked about this a little bit this week\nThe states are the number one team against the run do you think of biking and we all know the you know the St give a big play the game and the Vikings after you only do they can pass the football but should biking be fearful of possibly being one dimensional in this game because the saints do stop the run and they don't have dealt with this week\nThat it should be fearful because to saying who on the same sign a trade it for you like apple who's already passed and every other corner opposite of Marshall that them or do they have out of office oath instantly they've written a secondary to\nThey have her cousins that quarterback and the last time for this thing it was because the lack of choice no football\nOr against the thing when he was the Redskins that law they get back to that game and stay in front of the best comebacks 'cause the season and the superdome so Kirk ... game last week ... ... is not that good of a quarterback in the if they get to the wealthy are one and I'm I'm ... them all but at least four times and that ball game\nI think the thing with the way they apply pressure with you they said they made us back Mariette well with the way they were offering\nCame close to face a on that side of the ball I think that the recipe for disaster of four teams like Minnesota so\nReal simply who usually wins that game I think it will be the best team in the weekend\nI think going with would easily that followed him because of her cousins factor and because of the fact that the Vikings don't have a direct a true threat in the in the back to a motel because miraculously get healthy ... said they don't have a true threat\nIn the back door and I think they are limited ... office will be despite having to dynamic receivers are at their disposal\nSo speaking of not having a true threat in the backfield let's go to the other big NFC game this weekend as the Green Bay Packers against the Los Angeles rams I\nIt was kind of shocked at the wind in the game in Vegas the fact that Aaron Rodgers the top three top for quarterback on you know he's the top three quarter back in this leak Aaron Rodgers is getting I Believe nine points is what the line is that now do\nYou see the rams struggling in this game do you think Green Bay can cover that spread\nIn Green Bay and cover that spirit because of\nThe fact that Green Bay has more receivers and your you cover\nIs a great ... threatened if you're talking about for sometime in the ... maybe\nBased wide receivers that then I'll like average I was in the back of your guests football back bill they had an expert in time on camera so they do a lot of different things where it's tough to really blowout\nRebate when I say a blowout in the NFL about if only for more yeah and that's a line at nine and a half nine forty that's a little bit too much before a team that has a great quarterback\nAnd has really good option to on the river even good tired in a ... by assuming grant so I think that game was going to be a you know nine points ten points I think everybody has a little chance to knock off the right\nIt'll be interesting I Love the rams tough stretch coming out there next four weeks or not easy Emery ... is our guest covers the NFL owner a football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter at ... ball game plan so you mentioned the New York jets\nSo our two rookie quarterback that everyone has their ... year Baker Mayfield and Sam Darnell\nHoskins this week for both of them on the road to ... to play the bears Lewis struggled will say might be a little bit mad they've lost two in a row and then you have the Cleveland Browns who are going on the road to finish the Steelers the team coming off the by do you foresee like I Do like those are those are both of those rookies Sam to Arnold and vigor Mayfield having tough\nWeeks this Sunday\nDon't know it's it's a little bit different because you look at the jet take\nOn the air that the different uh different bears the things that we've seen so far the season of clue back there's not a hundred percent and if he's probably not going to play in this ball game\nThat's one huge element that going to be missing it's all the Sam Donaldson technical far you can say the same thing about Mr ... who's part I was not\nWorthy of the second overall pick this the bears may think over ... over a guy that's playing\nA role to play it on Thursday Night Football and and the shah Watson or fat in my home so I think that's going to keep this game close and the death of the great ... of the fire pressure their ballot versus the rendezvous for a job in in him and getting all go there\nThat's going to keep this game clothes and the death rate from the fire perjure their power birth the rendezvous for a job and and\nAnd and getting all of them are down to the Greek out last week in Minnesota is getting to be a lot closer than if I see the start of a player out the dawn of over ... even though the bears have better skilled position yeah ... wedding but I don't see them going to think about you know on the flip side\nThis is a different browse office is a civil space but we won\nA world in which the ties so I think when you look at the brown weird for me so that all the bills buttering is still struggling to sustain driving\n... points up on the board of taking the federal level by in Pittsburgh I think they're gonna hit their stride I think this one may be the ... uh NBA as the as the browse office just can't get out of their own way\nSpeaking of hitting their stride I I'm always interested in the London games because I don't think either team is really at their best to chargers I I thought\nI looked outlined last week when they play the Tennessee Titans and it was only six and a half points I think the chargers are better than six and a half points over the place but you never know when it comes to the London games do you see either the jaguars often or the eagles office\nDo not think victory but that's it other than that the package of a one point went over the bears and a three point went over the forty niners ramp to have a difficult for weeks coming up why Aaron Rodgers favorite by nine points coming up next our excuse me ... getting ... coming on that ... Peterson well joined the show a\nGambling he's out in Vegas I'll ask you about that spread nine points for Aaron Rodgers he's Pakistan too and then so we have ... and then we have\nSeen the Viking guy

when the Oklahoma City thunder were competing with the Golden State warriors are going to grab that this was a close game tonight the thunder and the Celtics there was a close game\nBut Russell Westbrook business fifteenth shots\nHe is played two games this season let me tell you it's an amazingly\nAlarming number if you are in Oklahoma City thunder fan right now Russell Westbrook it's not amazed I might be overstating there's there's only two games in the regular season\nBut Bobby he is one of eleven from three to start why is he right is Russell Westbrook shootings five three pointers in a basketball game\nHe uh he shot five tonight and he shot sticks against the king the first night that Russell Westbrook played Russell Westbrook stats are great thirty two points twelve rebound say to that but you're lost to the kings\nThe first one of the season for Sacramento was against the thunder it okay see one thirty one to one twenty\nK Russell Westbrook I said when I was watching the first game of the season against the warriors\nOkay I thought things flowed better\nThings for well what do you remember me saying that I was like I watched that game I was like OK okay a Russell Westbrook not playing why are the thunder even in this ball game\nThey were Thirteen points down or Thirteen points are under dogs in the game and I'm pretty sure they beat the spread warriors had everything going format that they had all of their starters going it was their ring night it was at home all the momentum Russell Westbrook best players on the sideline\nAnd the thunder work in the game deep into the fourth quarter\nAnd that night I'll just give you the rest of those guys number twenty seven points for Paul George Twenty one points for Dennis\nSchroeder Dennis Schroeder okay came off the bench against the kings and tonight again he came off the bench he was for ten ten points in twenty four minutes either Dennis ... minutes need to go up his touches need to go up Russell\nI I'm not that I Can't put it on Westbrook but Bobby I was watching some of this game and things just when I see him getting Fifteen ... hit more rebounds that points tonight Russell Westbrook did\nOkay see has a problem their own for I I you know we I just when I watch this team by I don't think Russell Westbrook can lead a team to a championship I just really don't believe that\nBut look this I and I look I could I said at the beginning of the year that Oklahoma City was going to finish third that was my production I said defensively they are better than they were last year\nRussell Westbrook was five of twenty tonight just Thirteen points okay when we come back we will roll around the NFL or top five games of the weekend so the ...\nThe ring there's also a low key

number nine first number seven I was talking about more than ... our Iowa Penn State or number Eighteen verse number Seventeen I'll tell you what the most interesting game for me Bobby before we get into the NFL\nIs Notre Dame navy okay and the reason why\nThat is the most interesting game is again I'm looking at the top I'm OK okay Alabama's off this weekend a constant I don't even know who they play but that should be you know comes to play not off the top of my okay\nNotre Dame okay they need to get a convincing went on the board there the number three team in the country prove your number three cake navy lost to Houston last week forty nine to thirty six before that navy felt at temple air force and SMU\nOkay so they got four straight lost his coming into this game against Notre Dame who beat Pittsburg by five points two weeks ago they had to buy okay\nNotre Dame is often supposedly got a lot better and opened up with e and book the new quarterback I kind of want to see that this week Bobby you're the college football fan do you think that's going to happen\nAnd I think it can happen I think Notre Dame you know that that week off\nGiven them time to regroup given them time to rethink night dummy coming into that ... game they were\nTwenty some point you know favorites but you know only won by Steve Martin where they have that much were they were dead much twenty three twenty four point fingers but I think they could bounce back to the Navy's coming off a bit last you'll H A us took care of those guys Sony\nNot ... if you were forty nine Notre Dame there the number three team of the country they are they are I Wanna see forty points on the board from no today\nYeah I mean but you know Ken the browsers running that often as you age so that's that's even though that's a little different yeah the low speed pays a post office but yeah I think no catnip to score\nSo compare the two off that and what you see from Notre Dame is a national audience doesn't know the Houston you know they they have to heroin low compare the two officers that Houston runs compared to Notre Dame can they replicate what used to it\nI I think they can be if they ever Notre Dame is more of a slow paced type of team traditional in the ... get to play call a formation and sometimes the shotgun sometimes the appeal comes into play but Houston is bad taste like they run in three places like that\nSo if I'm Notre Dame don't take a play out of that will just keep the pay is going off into so every team runs a two minute off and yeah ... practice\nThat before the season even start a like you know I Would that's what I Would do if I'm do today and things are kind of black and maybe pick things up look when you score when you put forty nine points on a team yeah that's the

Matt Harris was jumping the NFL gambling with Greg\nPeterson you can follow Greg foregone whenever I see you to underscore eighty one and Greg is a ... with the wider along with high five the super contest podcasts talking NFL gambling All right Greg and want to start with the first one I tweeted as your earlier\nIn the week I always try and get some tips from you met a set a New England patriots or fourteen point favorites in this game I I Do everything I'm here we don't know about ... feet we don't know about sunny myself but for you told well you told me on the earlier in the week the ah the patriots should have no problem covering this fourteen right\nThey should have no problem at all in turning coal to blow out the hope was bill came by to talk of thirty seven to five wives week I mean this is the bill's theme that they have nothing going Derek\n... and four turnovers last week and if they put in and they pick her brain he has\nDiners options were Seventy nine her town I Know ... feet are men but he's picker men in my book and this is a team that might not have shot in the ... well yeah this is a bill Keene that's terrible at all\nBut their term on special teams they're terrible I'm Alive they're\nTerrible the quarterback position and their breath wide receivers arguably Calvin badger rendered by the fact disappointment and to probably be cut from the I mean honestly there is no redeeming qualities of taking the bills I Know that like for keen on the road is not necessarily the sharpest played to me but at the same time I think it's the only play that you can have on this\nFor a for for comfort ability reasons you know historically I I I as I recall the patriots and the bills I and I'm just going by trends here I Know with the personnel or who was on the field but trend why don't the patriots have at least one close game with buffalo every year\n\nOh I I remember the bills\nKnocked off the patriots and like two thousand and three I mean I Do recall too many close games with the bill versus the patriots off the top I personally yeah I'm sure that they're out there\nI'm just ... they're just not coming to mind right now because all I could think about is the bill throwing intercept\nPoint [laughter] All right let's go to another AFC battle the Pittsburgh Steelers are home for the Cleveland Browns Steelers are coming off of by Cleveland Browns Olin three on the road this year\nI always have trouble individual battles Elaine ... more than a touchdown just don't matter who it is playing who who do the teams are again I guess it's different if it's the bills and the patriots but I just should should you worry if you're the Steelers if you're a Steelers guy Atlanta eight on the grounds at home\nI wouldn't because in the last three bedrooms between these two teams are bonds of covered actually all three of those games\nWell with that said the Steelers look to be running in the form I really liked the way that I taught her running for the Steelers when it's likely the on bells Dr ... back to the game here that report and yet you again so\nYou can pretty much cross their mouth but it looks like Ben Roethlisberger is finding a report to Antonio Brown and company I think that late second touchdown against the bangles really help them things out in regard to the chemistry between those two keeping Antonio Ron happy\nAnd the ... the fight somebody football they used to be going over time almost every week they went over time already four times this year if I had to fix died I'd probably go\nTo browse but this is probably will not going to be staying up from a tight perspective\nGreg ... Peterson is our gas dose of that school was the minor along with high five the super contest podcast or talking NFL\nGamble you could follow all of the great work on whether it's a unit underscore eighty one\nSo the last time the Broncos didn't the chiefs play to was a close game and the Broncos if I recall were actually winning at the half\nThey did it by running the football they did it by getting pressure what sport now this is a different animal because the Broncos are on the road this time Darren arrowhead ten point though is that too much for the chiefs to lay against a team that arguably gave him their tapas game of the season outside of course of their one loss against the patriots\nYeah I mean I Would argue that arrowhead and ... of the toughest places to fight in the NFL\nI think that it's a little bit too many points though just because you do take a look at the ... it's not a good defense because bond or rushing pastor you have to think that the team is going to have some added confidence because they played by Thursday so they're going to have a little bit of actor right\nAnd like you spend a lifetime of these two teams played it was the single game I watch the Broncos why'd\nYou got to think that the defense is still going to be there for the Broncos but the big question is what are you going to get our case keen on week by week you just don't know and they absolutely polarize the Arizona Cardinals but then again we felt terrible a couple of weeks earlier I get the New York jets and this is a Broncos themed I Believe\nHas won like two of its life and game down the road and I think it's actually a worst trend that that the Broncos has not been a good road game oh he's seen the Kansas City chiefs third girl or a team and obviously that that forty thirty to forty lost against the New England patriots but that's one of their heads up along the way they really did Randall the jaguars which we're seeing\nThe jaguars really unravel before our very I regardless\nVery impressive when they just completely steam rolled over the bangles as well I mean I don't think anyone cite thirty five point where he taught me in that game I certainly did that so it's a tough call but if I had to make the point in this one I Would take the ten points just because you lose touch them and if you go you go there to push\nGreg let's go to the jaguars because look you are right and I I was actually wrong way but I ended up winning my my bet a an Indian Game last week when you told me last week you said beware of taking the chargers and at that point I\nAnd they win but I ended up winning my my ... uh uh in the game last week when you told me last week you said beware of taking the chargers and at that point I had already taken the charges but it's a good thing I tease that down to just to pick them it was six and a half\nOr you were just like you never know with that field and and and it's a good thing to tell you I mean I I bet really just I should not have won that game but I ended up winning because the titans\nChose to go for to do is to correct that in the Philadelphia Eagles jaguars game in London this weekend the under these off and it's really the are not moving at all board all we're told us on a short least\nPolice or the eagles give up a Seventeen point leaving the fourth quarter last week off and it's really kind of is not what they were last year so the over under set of forty three if you're playing this game I Would I Would play the under\n... by the by the total I play the under and walk but I actually like the tide the eagles below their four eagles are like thirty points in this spot from everything that I'm seeing and you just take a look at the jaguars they\nHave nothing going for them right now at least in the case to the eagles they wore a Seventeen point science we we saw them playing some good uh football before the Carolina Panthers were it would make that come back in the fourth quarter and if I'm going to drugs and quarterback if I'm going to trust cars the one\nOh one more than ... ... to like you said was benched for college cash for quarterbacks and the second half last\nWeek I mean that the team that right now is nothing going for them\nWherever we get out of what are we going to get out of Carlos Hyde\nNobody has any earthly idea because without on her part at the St Louis completely lost the Jacksonville the fact that been playing very well either we saw them against the Dallas Cowboys give up over forty points night game they were just completely ... from that one I just have no faith in the Jacksonville Jaguars right now\nI'm going to take the the eagles they're not really the point\nYeah I gave up betting the Jacksonville Jaguars after that I've played them against the titans and they lost nine distinct after looking good the previous week like corals that don't like four hundred yards\nAnd then the Ninety six I gave up on them at that point grant Petersen is our guest you can follow all of great work on Twitter at ... unit underscore eighty one he's out in Vegas hosted that's gold with the lighter along with high five is super contest podcast\nOkay so great we talk about this one game every single week\nWhere I look up and down the line and I'm confused I look at one game and I find one game I'm like I don't understand why the line is the way that it is and so I take a step back and I talk to you about it\nThe Redskins minus one okay these are two teams going in opposite directions I Know this one is on the road Washington is coming off a very nice when in the division against the cowboys the giants traded to other defensive players this week they can't protect the quarterback\nWhy on earth or the Redskins only favorite by one point in this game\nWhile I Will give you my expert opinion here I'm no earthly idea and I took the Redskins as well and still complete joke that this\nWide furtive very out in the ... but I Do it up picked on and I just took the right to say that they play and this is the Redskins theme that they've got a law that lucky I mean they got lucky in that game it gets cowboys that throws at five yard penalty probably\nI I think in their prime time game Texas and Oklahoma State I think Oklahoma staking coveted three I don't know when a gang damages in in Oklahoma is instill water okay yeah so I mean that's going to be a great match a big match up the last chance for the UT to prove that they have a chance to get into the ...\nAnd of course they have West Virginia coming up next a\nBad boy

series or a little bit next ah but Joe Buck a pack your bags he's got to bring one of those\nBig suitcases you know I Wonder ... where do you think Joe Buck list do any like LA New York I'm assuming one of those\nDo you know I I wanted to know why I wanted to say St Louis oh because the\nJob because of his yeah but that's ...\nHe lives on the road but that is tough like the life of the play by play guy I did play by play for a little bit two years when I Lived in Nebraska I mean it's not on the level of planes but it's a lot of bus ride yeah when you're like lower level I don't know if Joe Buck ever really started lower level but when you start lower levels of play by play guy there's a lot of bus ride a lot of like five\nSix seven hour bus ride and if you're in the mid west or is a lot of cornfields a lot of rides where you're like what have I ... ... am I going in circles here okay Kansas looks like the brass to Nebraska looks like Iowa you know I I Lived out there and I love that part of the country and I know we got listeners out on that part of the country right now that keep on driving salute you truckers man I'm gonna tell you what those\nRoads can seem awfully boring at times especially when you're on the road like every single Saturday but uh he's in planes he's doing just fine he's on a bus ride staying at like the holiday inn express he's at the ... he's doing just fine\nOkay Houston Texans over the dolphins forty two to twenty three yet to Sean watching two hundred thirty nine yards to a year five touchdowns hey Ishaan watch it had a heck of a lot of fun tonight\nOr how we got a frog or whatever they want to have her on a lot of\nBad they did and hey I'll tell you what the dolphins played the Texans for the first oh about five minutes of this game opening five minutes they ran the ball well and then we had of course are big ... throwing a\nPick sticks which Bobby beats your the Texans fan or you're just hoping for one of those tonight right I mean yeah the thing that brought up there all of the overthrow passes that you saw and especially the patriots in the playoffs a couple of years ago and the Texans fan yeah to just be hoping for at least two of 'em that I write\nWell yeah I mean it's good to get one and honestly I was you know great great rookie Justin ... actually I got they've cut right here for you if you want to play ... I just want to hear this week so yeah\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIt's not I mean I Know is is you know it was good it was it's still you know warm inside like ... yeah\nOctober October that over ... here we go Rogers over like at the top ... that\nThing that prior to ... I feel the negative thing he\nDefeated the ... he competed against the dolphins I mean ...\nThing that ... to ... I feel all negative thing I mean the feed it to\n... he competed against the dogs and I mean competed against alliance yeah\nAnd I mean I I don't know I guess he wrote up but I think he has a good record in October and that's what it\nIs it I think so I always thought it was like mocking Brock because like oh no I think he actually\nHas a beef in record they'll five over five hundred recognized that so\nIt wasn't terrible I mean outside of that one play yeah oh you're smiling you want to hear that again don't you\nWant to look at job up here boy one more time because Joe Buck to me as I heard it the first time age it it sounds like he expected this to happen\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThat he was caught off guard by ... throwing in over\nIn on it or not at all but this is a good way to put it takes is a fire straight wins for these guys\nAnd uh it just felt good at you know it was a compete and it was it was very competitive in the beginning but the show why so many ... comfortable he was in rhythm I mean five hundred down passes today to let us last night's Emmy with zero interest option so that is a positive note you ought to take it\nOr if you're a Texans fan this is what you wanted to see at the beginning of the season is what you saw a pre the shuttle often injury last year\nAnd look I think the biggest difference of today's game with the offensive line\nThe office of wind was great the running game was great I mean they were just hitting on all cylinders and I do think this is now the bar for them I had ... villa ... look bill O'Brian has taken a lot of heat this year and I think deservedly so at the beginning of the year clock management sometimes off\nBut you give them the long term contracts he did you see them like celebrating in the locker room today like throwing confetti it's just like you know this is it's a good feeling\nLike I like our our furniture are covered the team as long as they got up and he was there the night he was talking about how like everyone's just happy like this is a win where you could just you now you go on the road you're all happy when you go on the team plane go into Denver next week\nOn the road for the next two taxes on their life by now they I mean they have a legitimate deep the game with four and Hopkins and it's just I think again it just comes down to and we've been talking about are all year\nYou can't be one dimensional and they were not one dimensional tonight they were able to run the ball and it all starts in the trenches that we they they win at the point of attack on the defensive side of the ball with cloudy and watch\nIt the off at the side of the ball with the other team has always wanted to point of attack and tonight that was not the case okay when we come back we'll talk a little bit about the world series game three tonight out in LA and also oh no oh recruiting by one city to get an NBA star over than I\nDid this over the night with ... like if you watch you play he steps in to the ... like this are watching blitz coming I got to get out of pocket he made his car and you know what how can I make my office of wind look worse off stepping in to the point and then I'll go down like a stack\nOf potatoes that's exactly what are you I'm ... and then he got a letter tackle Nate soldier he gave that they have out Fifteen million dollars a year to did you see him I mean if you go back and you watch the game made soldier is a complete atrocity I get a\nThere's some kind of bonded with Malcolm Butler like one of the worst the typical Horner back this year in the NFL I think there's some that are there have earned every white okay there was the New York giants quarterback by the way I forget his name but it was about why because he got burnt on

Harris back with you lead to jump into the NFL we can come up\nAmory ... he's on the show every\nWeek owner of a football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter that s a ball game plan alright every um I Want to first start with the New York giants a team that uh the last Monday Night football this past week do you think the giants\nAre going to go one at Fifteen do you think this tanking is realistically possible for the giants do not win one more football game\nBut not at all they they have way too many good players for that to happen I mean when you're talking about their offer it started off the farm Barclay oh the outback who joined us German Shepherd and they're going to move back healthy they have a lot of data on that theme so I can foresee them going and leave\nA tip to nine but not want it to me because if they are oh you're very talented more so than something or in the NFL\nYeah I had a that versus a giant because it's on the you know the giants and I I'm almost in the position now where I'm rooting for the team to lose which is it's just horrible All right let's let's go round the NFL here I Want to start this Broncos chief's game because this was one of the more interesting game the first time these two teams hooked up\nBroncos ran the ball well in the first half and they were able to get pressure with four in the first half and then the second half happened and Patrick buy homes magic happens do you think the Broncos are going to have similar success in arrowhead stadium this this week\nI don't think so because when you look at what has happened since then that seems deep and gotten better at ... or something to put a little bit more\nUh assignments down gap style or their sports team down against Iran and\nYou know they're starting to still be opportunistic defensively and they're often find the balance of the stuff that you bring more of all of the office will be so I don't think the Broncos team will see the same can choose the earlier in the ... important but not all the things when you can so\nYou thought when the chiefs beat the bangles forty five to ten that was more of a a a positive mark on that she's defense that was a diminishing mark on the bank goes do you think the Bengals are going to\nDo what they're traditionally you know Eddie ... Louis teams do kind of downplayed defensively down the stretch so that was more of a a representation of how good the chiefs Stevens there are the strike that they may\nI Would do because I still looking for that as a team that you have experience in the AFC because of what they have often ... they're going to start to find a way to get their ground game guard that's who they are good guys bad\nIn the boat and I think that we've seen that you know just right up against a really good football the difference between good and great and what you thought last in the cheese and the English\nEmery ... is our guest covers the NFL owner or a football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter at ... ball game plan so well one thing that we have seen this in a cell is the good teams are two dimensional we're we obviously know that the chiefs can run past the rams are obviously can run a pass\nI'm looking at this New Orleans Vikings game and I think it's an interesting match up in this sense I did not realize that I talked about this a little bit this week\nThat the states are the number one team against Iran do you think the biking so now we all know that you know the safety of a big place in the past and game into biking stuff the Olympics look they can pass the football but should Vikings fans be fearful of possibly being one dimensional and the game because the saints do stop the run and they don't have to cook this week\nThat that'd be it should be fearful because I think one thing sign a trade it for you like apple who's already better than every other corner opposite of Marshall\nTwo things one that same signed power trade it for me like apple who's already passed and every other corner of opposite of ... Marshall that are more as if they have a rough and so instantly they upgraded and the secondary to\nThey have cousins that quarterback and the last time for some of the things it was because his lack of situational football\nAgainst this thing was he was with the Redskins that allow their kids back in that game and stay in front of the best comebacks of the seasons are in the super dome so ... ... I was at a desk game last week president is not that good of a quarterback in if they get to the ... there are one and I'm I'm the jet should pick them up or at least four times and that ball game\nI think it's the same with the way they apply pressure will see this as they made a secondary ... with the way they are often can't push that pays\nA on that side of the ball I think that's the recipe for disaster a four team like Minnesota so\nReal simply who do you think wins that game I think it will be the best team in the weekend\nI think it's going to easily and that falls and because of the current pheasants back there and because of the fact that\nThe Vikings don't have a threat of true threats in the in the back door and left out because miraculously get healthy and is ready to go at a hundred percent they don't have a true threat in the back door and I think they are limited in what they can to office there'll be despite having to dynamic receivers are at their disposal\nSo speaking of not having a true threat in the backfield let's go to the other big NFC game this weekend that's the Green Bay Packers against the Los Angeles rams I\nIt was kind of shocked at the wind in the scheme in Vegas the fact that Aaron Rodgers of top three top for quarterback wow you know he's the top three quarter back into sleek Aaron Rodgers is getting I Believe nine points is with the wind is that now do you see the rams struggling in this game do you think Green Bay can cover that spread\nThin Green Bay and cover that spirit because of the fact that Green Bay has more receivers and your a cover they do a great job of spreading the feel you're talking about for sometime in the states maybe\nThey threw wide receivers that then I like Aaron jaws and the fact that you can guess football back bills they still have to expect in time a government so they do a lot of different things to where it's tough to really blowout\nGreen Bay and when I say a blow out in the NFL and talking about sampling some more yeah and that's a line at nine and a half my point that's a little bit too much before it seemed that has a great quarterback and has really good options on a rumor even good tired in\nA lead by Jimmy Graham so I don't think that game was going to be a you know nine points ten points I think everybody has a legit chance to knock off the rain\nAnd it'll be interesting to look the rams tough stretch coming up their next four weeks are not easy Emery ... is our guest covers the NFL owner a football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter at ... ball game plan so you mentioned the New York jets store to rookie quarterback that everyone has their eye on this year Baker Mayfield and Sam Darnell\nTossed games this week for both of them on the road to ... to play the bears who has struggled will say might be a little bit mad they've lost two in a row and then you have the Cleveland Browns who are going on the road to face the Steelers the team coming off the by\nDo you foresee like I Do like both of those those are those rookies Sam Donald and Baker Mayfield having tough weeks this Sunday\nI don't know it's it's a little bit different because you look at the jet taken on the bears that's a different a different bears the sense that we've seen\nSo far the season for a little math is not a hundred percent and if he's probably not going to play in the ball game that's one huge element that's going to be missing it's all up to stamp Donald protecting the football you could say the same thing about Mr ... who's quite honestly not\nWorthy of the second overall pace that the bears made to go grab him over a guy that's playing a role played on Thursday Night Football in in the show a lot them or pet my home so I think that's going to keep this game clothes and the jets deep as of the great job and apply pressure they're solid versus the run to do it for a job in in\nHim and getting off the field and third down through the green job last week in Minnesota\nI think those games will be a lot closer than if I take the upside of a player I Would the dawn of over ... even though the bears have better skill position yeah talking to parents weddings but I don't see them blowing the steam out you know on the flip side this is a different browse all those this is still a space and we won\nA world in which they tired so I think we look at the brown wooden thing for me so in that office still buttering is still struggling to sustain Dr Lynn\n... points up on the board that team that some of the upper by Pittsburgh I think they're going to hit their stride I think this one may be the route or in the AFC as the browse office just can't get out of their own way\nSpeaking of hitting their stride I I'd always interested in these one didn't games because I don't think either team is really at\nTheir best the chargers I I thought I looked at that line last week when they played the Tennessee Titans and it was only six and a half points I think the chargers are better than six and a half points over the science but you never know when it comes to the London games do you see either the jaguars all sense or the eagles often\nOr they're going to be a playoff team I don't think there's any question about that a real early on here and the NBA let me ask you a question what is more surprising to you the Oklahoma City thunder our own for for the Detroit Pistons are for it\nDoes say under or for piston is always going to start then they settle out at the end of the season but I say the thunder on for I mean despite Russell missing a couple of games kind of is to\nTell them it's a game that you know it just you know ... is on the big enough seasons huh yeah I think they're surprised [noise]

I saw ... go back and every every but everybody in Houston knows the typical Brock interception\nHappens on overthrown pass now granted I thought there was pass interference has some kind of face mask on that players something referees were horrible tonight there might be a couple of more referees deck and fire tonight because there was one that was fired yesterday\nA and there might be a couple of them and they were terrible on all accounts like not just not in favor of the Texas not in favor of the dog and I just thought to referee player was does really bad tonight but that path that first broadcast by law passed just failed\nI mean anybody in Houston remembers that that playoff game against the New England patriots\nThat they didn't stand a chance and the second half because I swallowed through three interceptions it I feel like every single one of them failed\nBut that's what happens [laughter] hey how to use the debt that we're going to go out to energy stadium that's

twenty five past the hour we're going to go out the energy stadium but we're gonna mostly get into the Houston Rockets and a big opportunity for them that next that's where he began to get a lot of fears overnight [noise]\nBoston Red Sox have a hole in their line up okay we need one more power hitter what do we do all we get JD Martinez now granted no one can predict a JD Martinez was going to

hundred percent\nJamie butler is that possible glue if they have any possible chance the Houston Rockets of taking care of the Golden State warriors\nThis is the move to make use sellout you get what ever the Minnesota Tim Walz won and by the way the Minnesota timber wolves if they don't accept is possible to it's a real betrayed right if this is real and Darryl more you actually went to Minnesota for future first round pegs\nHere Minnesota how do you not do this Julie voters told you that they've got to walk out the door go walk out the door done what made it home they stick remember the first practice All right I'm going to grab the for worst players on the bench and I'm going to scrimmage against the other for starters guess what I'm going to win\nTom pivotal you may remember that semi butler does not want to be in Minnesota I Love me from Jim I Need some Jimmy Jimmy\nWas for Jimmy ... but we can't use that any more so now we're going to use it for Jimmy Butler Bobby beach I Love me from Jim mommy's Jimmy\nJimmy Butler to the rockets makes sense for everybody everybody this is what you do you sacrifice now my telling you that if the rockets get Jimmy Butler they're going to beat the Golden State warriors no\nI'm not telling you that but I'm telling you this last year the Houston Rockets made it a series with the Golden State warriors okay and part of the reason a huge part of the reason they were able to do that\nMade it a series with the Golden State warriors okay and part of the reason a huge part of the reason they were able to do that\nIs because the defense pay the defensive improvement for the Houston Rockets for two years I Lived in the city now Bobby for two years okay and the defense I followed the rocket pretty closely for two years and the improvement for two years ago to last year defensively was huge harder to ...\nAnd a lot of the reason it harder to prove it because you've got court Chris Paul\nChris Paul is kind of a defensive captain that they have and I know that they lose their defensive coach okay who that a lot to do with that\nBut this is the move that you need to make you you again just if you go back to watch the Utah Jazz game thirty eight points for Donovan Mitchell\nWere the Golden State warriors tap Kevin ... who's ... who is going to guard those guys right now with the team that is right there so if you're rockets fan right now and you're listening you're saying\nYou're strapped like my friend out in Los Angeles he's like you gotta be kidding me future ... which by the way is the maximum that you can do you know that's the maximum that you can actually you know put in a trade\nSo I'm telling you what this would be a great\nTrade for both teams and I really hope it happens for Minnesota steak and I hope it happens for the rockets sick because this is ... ... and you know what\nI always you know I trust I generally like Bobby I trust like what smart people are thinking Darryl Laurie is a smart guy there are more knows how to build a team or knows what he's doing okay\nSo you know if he thinks for future first round he he didn't he is not going to offer for future first pick\nFor a guy who he doesn't believe can help them win now I Will rockets being used to love this aggressiveness\nUsually wins in sports it has\nIn baseball OK it ... the Golden State warriors smart with their draft picks but aggressive as well going out to build the rest of that team Los Angeles raft favorites to win the super bowl right now aggressive go out and get done and are endemic to go out and get markets Peters\nOkay go out and get branded cooks okay Peterson cooks were trades\nAggressiveness usually wins in sports so you should not have any of the patient as a rocket span if you are now for first round pick this makes sense to me\nOn all counts for everybody I when we come back we're going to go out to energy stadium Jake gas meant covers the tax in a pre SPN radio in Houston or going to talk

with you\nNFL we can come up with Amory ... he's on the show every week owner of football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter that s a ball game plan alright every\nOf I Want to first start with the New York giants the theme that are in the last Monday Night football this past week do you think the giants are going to go wanted Fifteen do you think is tanking is realistically possible for the giants do not win one more football game\nOr not at all they they have way too many good players for that to happen I mean when you're talking about they're all very subtle off the farm Barclay oh they'll back from Joe used German Shepherd ebb and they're going to move back healthy they have a lot of elements thing though I can foresee them going at least\nA six and seven and nine but not want to say because they are oh you're very talented more so than something or in the NFL\nYeah I had asked that versus the giants and because it's on the you know I was a giants fan I I'm almost in the position now where I'm rooting for the team to lose which is it's just horrible All right let's let's go round the NFL here I Want to start this Broncos chief's game because this was one of the more interesting game the first time these two teams soaked up\nBroncos ran the ball well the first half and they were able to get pressure with four in the first half and then the second half happened and Patrick homes magic happened do you think the Broncos are going to have similar success in arrowhead stadium this this week\nI don't think so because when you look at what has happened and then\nIt seems that better actually there are starting to play a little bit more uh assignments down gap filed a there is falling down against Iran and you know they're starting to still be opportunistic defensively and they're often find the balance or something you pretty much more of all\nOf the office that I think the bronco team will see the fame and she said earlier is that quite often than not these things when you can\nSo you thought when the chiefs beat the bangles forty five ... that was more of a a a positive mark on the chief's defense that was a diminishing mark on the bangles\nAnd when the chiefs feeds the bangles forty five depend that was more of a a a positive mark on the chief's defense that was a diminishing mark on the bangles so you think the Bengals are going to\nDo with their traditional lead you know Andy ... Louis teams to kind of downplayed defensively down the stretch so that was more they do a representation of how good the chiefs Stevens there are the strikes that they've made\nA I Would say so because I still looking for that as a team that you have experience in the AFC because of what they have often believe they're going to start to find a way to get their ground game guard fest where they're going to get guys back\nIn the fold and I think that the team that you know just ran up against a really good football team so that the difference between good and great and what you saw last week between the cheese and the bangles\nEmery ... is our guest covers the NFL owner or a football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter at ... ballgame plants so look one thing that we have seen the scent of cell is the good teams hard two dimensional we're we obviously know that the chiefs can run and pass the rams are obviously can run and pass\nI'm looking at this New Orleans Vikings game and I think it's an interesting match up in this sense I did not realize that I talked about this a little bit this week\nThat the seats are the number one team against the run do you think the Vikings and now we all know that the you know the St give a big place in the past and game in the ... the Olympics or if they can pass the football but should Vikings fans be fearful of possibly being one dimensional in this game because the saints do stop the run and they don't have Dava cook this week\nI think they should be careful because to things who are in the same sign a trade it for you like apple who's already passed and every other corner opposite of Marshall that are more that they have on a roster so instantly they from Britain and the secondary to\nThey have their cousins that quarterback and the last time for this thing it was because his lack of choice no football or against the thing when he was with the red skins that allow them to\nGet back in that game and stay in one of the best comebacks of the season and the\nSuperdome so ... ... I was at a desk game last week president is not that good of a quarterback in the if they get to the ... there are one and done um the jet should have picked them up or at least four times and that ball game I think the same with the way they apply pressure\nWith the they sent they made the sec Mary ... with the way they are often can't push that pays a on that side of the ball I think that's the recipe for disaster a four team like Minnesota so\nReal simply who do you think wins that game I think it will be the best game of the weekend\nI think no one was willing to easily in that balls and because of the current pheasants back there and because of the fact that\nThe Vikings don't have a threat of truth for it in the in the back to unless delving miraculously get healthy and is ready to go to a hundred percent they don't have a true threat in the back door and I think they are limited in what they can grow offensively despite having to dynamic receivers are at their disposal\nSo speaking of not having a true threat in the backfield let's go to the other big NFC game this weekend that's the Green Bay Packers against the Los Angeles rams I\nWas kind of shocked at the wind in this game in Vegas the fact that Aaron Rodgers the top three top for quarterback wow you know he's the top three quarter back into sleek Aaron Rodgers is getting I Believe nine points is with the wind is that now do\nYou see the rams struggling in this game do you think Green Bay can cover that spread\nThin Green Bay can't cover that spirit because of the fact that Green Bay has more receivers and your a cover\nIs a great job of spreading to feel you're talking about for sometime in the said maybe they three wide receivers that then I'll like Aaron jobs in the back those you can guess football is back bills they still have that extract some time on camera so they do a lot of different things where it's tough to really blowout\nGreen Bay and when I say blowout in the NFL I'm Talking about ten points the more yeah and that's a line at nine and a half nine point that's a little bit too much I mean for a team that has a great quarterback\nAnd has really good option to own a rumor even good tied in a ... by immigrants so I don't think that game was going to be a you know nine points ten point I Would think Green Bay has a legit chance to knock off the rain\nAnd it'll be interesting I look to ramp to have a tough stretch coming up their next four weeks are not easy Emery ... is our guest covers the NFL owner a football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter at ... ball game plan so you mentioned the New York jets store to rookie quarterback that everyone has their eye on this year Baker Mayfield and Sam Darnell\nTalk games this week for both of them on the road the jets going to play the bears who have struggled Jose might be a little bit mad they've lost two in a row and then you have the Cleveland Browns who are going on the road to face the Steelers the team coming off the by\nDo you foresee like I Do like both of those both of those rookies Sam Donald and Baker Mayfield having tough weeks this Sunday\nI don't know it's it's a little bit different because you look at the jet\nTaken on the bears that's a different a different bears the sense that we've seen so far to see them as a little math is not a hundred percent and if he's probably not going to play in the ball game\nThat who won huge element that's going to be listening is all of this damn Donald protect the football you could say the same thing about Mr ... who's quite honestly not\nWorthy of the second overall the bears made to go grab him over a guy that's playing a play it on Thursday Night Football in in the show I watch them or pat my home so I think that's what McCain since getting close\nAnd the jets defensive agreed that the fly pressure\nThey're solid versus the run to do it for a job in in him and getting to build on third down through the green job last week in Minnesota I think those games will be a lot closer than if I think the upside of a player I Would think Donald\nOver Trump is even though the bears have better skilled positions to talking to parents wedding but I don't see them blowing the theme out you know on the flip side\nThis is a different brown all the facilities face when we won a ... and which they tied so I think we look at the brown\nWe think are may still in that office spills buttering is still struggling says the same drive than ... points up on the board a team that some local by Pittsburgh I think they're going to hit their stride I think this one may be the ... or in the AFC as the browse office just can't get out of their own way\nThinking of hitting their stride I I always interested in these London games because I don't think either team is really at their best the chargers I I thought\nI looked at that line last week when they played the Tennessee Titans and it was only six and a half points I think the chargers are better than six and a half points over the titans but you never know when it comes to these London games do you see either the jaguars all sense or the eagles off and it's\nDo not think victory but that's it other than that the Packers of a one point went over the bears and a three point went over the forty niners ramps have a difficult for weeks coming up why Aaron Rodgers favorite by nine points coming up next our uh excuse me ... getting ... coming up next our grant Petersen well joined the show a\nGambling he's out in Vegas I'll ask you about that spread ... points for Aaron Rodgers he's a Pakistan too and then so we have\n... and then we have seen the Vikings ... states have won five straight games Vikings have won three straight games and we all remember last

I Want to start with the first one I read it as your earlier in the week I always try and get some tips from the man said the New England patriots or fourteen point favorites in this game I I Do everything I'm here we don't know about ... we don't know about Sony Michel\nBut for you told well you've told me on the earlier in the week did a debate you should have no problem covering this fourteen right\nThey should have no problem at all ... and blow out the hope was bill team by talk of thirty seven to five last week I mean this is the bill's team that they have nothing going there are catered sending four turnovers last week and if they put in your career and he has\nDiners ... career Seventy nine her town I Know same as Peter man but he picked her rent in my book\nAnd this is a team that might not have shot in the ... well yeah this is a bill Keene that's terrible it out of their ... special teams they're terrible I'm Alive they're terrible at the quarterback position\nAnd their breath wide receivers arguably Calvin Benjamin who set up just white men and to probably be ... from the I mean honestly there is no redeeming qualities of taking the males I Know that laying fourteen out on the road is not necessarily the sharpest play to me\nBut at the same time I think it's the only play that you can have on this day\nFor a certain comfort ability reasons you know historically I I as I recall the patriots and the bills I I'm just going by trends here I Know what the personnel who was on the field but trend why don't the patriots have at least one close game with buffalo every\nYear\nOh I I remember the bills knocked off the patriots won like two thousand and three game [laughter] I don't recall too many close games with the bill versus the patriots off the top I persuade yeah I'm sure that they're out there I'm just not they're not coming to mind right now because all I could think about is the bill throwing intercept\nPoint let's go to another as the battle the Pittsburgh Steelers are home for the Cleveland Browns Steelers are coming off of by Cleveland Browns Olin three on the road this year I always have trouble individual battles Elaine ... more than a touchdown just no matter who was playing who the who the teams are I guess it's\nDifferent if it's the bills or the patriots but it's just ... should you worry if you're the Steelers if you're a Steelers guy Elaine eight on the grounds at home\nI wouldn't be can sit in the last ... between these two teams rounds of covered actually all three of those games\nBut with that said the Steelers look to be running in the form I really liked the way that Connors running ball for the Steelers looks like lady on BALANCE Act to be back to the game he has our report a year to a game show\nYou can pretty much cross your mind off but it looks like Ben Roethlisberger is finding a report to Antonio Brown and company I think that late second touchdown against the bangles really helps them things out in regard to\nThe chemistry between those two keeping Antonio Brown happy and the ... the plane from Britain football they used to be going into overtime almost every week they weren't overtime or four times this year if I had to fix tied I'd probably go to browse but this is probably will not going to be staying up from its type perspective\nGreg ... Peterson is our guest host of that school was the minor along with high fine the super contest five cats are talking NFL gambling you could follow all of the great work on Twitter edgy unit underscore eighty one so the last time the Broncos didn't the chiefs play to was a close game and the Broncos if I recall were actually winning at the half\nThey did it by running the football they did it by getting pressure with for now this is a different animal because the Broncos are on the road this time they're in arrowhead ten points do with that too much for the cheese to lay against a team that arguably gave them their puppets game of the season outside of course of their one last against the patriots\nYeah I mean I Would argue that arrowhead and mile or two of the toughest places to fight in the NFL I think that it is a little bit too many points though just because\nDo take a look at the number Broncos he's not a good defense\nBecause Byron Rushing pastor you have to think that the team is going to have some added confidence because they've played last Thursday so they're going to have a little bit of actor right\nAnd like you spend a lifetime of these two teams played it would be single game I watch the Broncos why'd\nYou got to think that for the fences still going to be there for the Broncos but the big question is what are you going to get our case keen on week by week you just don't know and they absolutely pulverized Arizona Cardinals but then again we sell the most terrible a couple of weeks earlier against the New York jets and this is the Broncos seemed I Believe\nHas won like two of its last game down the road and I think it's actually a worse than that though the Broncos have not been a good road teams are we seeing the Kansas City chiefs to grow through team and obviously that that forty thirty to forty lost against the New England patriots but that's been there ... heads up along the way they really just banned all the jaguars which\nWe're seeing the jaguars really unravel before our very regardless very and parts of war and they just completely\nSteam rolled over the bangles as well I mean I don't think anyone cite thirty five point waiting taught me in that game I certainly did that so it's a tough call but if I had to make the point in this one I Would take the ten points just because you lose touch and go you know they're flush\nGreg let's go to the jaguars because look you are right and I I was actually wrong way but I ended up winning my my ... a a an Indian Game last week when you told me last week he said beware of taking the chargers and at that point I had already taken the charges but it's a good thing I tease that down to just to pick them it was a six and a half\nOr you were just like you never know when that field and and and it's a good thing to tell you I mean I I really just I should not have won that game but I ended up winning because the titans chose to go for two\nSo is the correct back in the Philadelphia Eagles jaguars game in London this weekend the under these often really are not moving at all ... we're told us on a short least police or the eagles below Seventy point lead in the fourth quarter last week off and it's really kind of is not what they were last year so the over under set of forty\nThree if you're playing this game I Would I Would play the under\n... by the by the total I play the under involved but I actually like this by the eagles below therefore eagles are lying three points in this spot from everything that I'm seeing\nAnd you just take a look at the jaguars they have nothing going for them right now at least in the case to the eagles they wore a Seventeen point science we we've solved them playing some good uh football before the Carolina Panthers were able to make that come back in the fourth quarter and\nIf I'm going to drones and quarterback if I'm going to trust cars don't want a whole lot more than ... ... to like you said was benched for college cat four\nQuarterbacks and the second half last week\nThat the team that right now is nothing going for them wherever we get out of what are we going to get out of Carlos Hyde nobody has any earthly idea because without butter part at the St Louis completely lost the Jacksonville the fact\nThat been playing very well either we found them against the Dallas Cowboys give up over forty points that night game they were just completely bullets in that one I just have no faith and the Jacksonville Jaguars right now I'm going to take the the eagles they're not really the point\nYeah I gave up betting the Jacksonville Jaguars after that I ...

I think you're looking at maybe a Q. V. value when you know the browns\nThere to Pittsburgh I Know it's a real game Baker Mayfield not going to be overwhelmed but I'm going to roll with bigger may feel right now in that match up\nSo I wanted to ask a quick on some running backs and Chris Thompson that looks like it can be a game time decision I Know they're trying to get them back from multiple injuries down in Washington but Adrian Peterson my goodness I mean these become a must start every week\nAnd it's surprising to see what Adrian Peterson has been able to do\nAnd the thing about it and you nailed ... a town is the fact that he's not a peep the guy he's never been a guy that's going to catch the ball out of that field you know Chris Thompson even when he's healthy is a black the option\nAnd your fellow free bibs did last when he can score to receiving touched down so Adrian Peterson to me as an RV too in a standard you know he's a flex play in a P P. R.\nYep Kris Thompson I think with the way that the way the threat is ... and I don't for the life of me I Can't figure out why this Sunday's game against the giants is a is a pick them I just I Can't get over that I'm wrong with Adrian Peterson because I think\nDon't for the life of me I Can't figure out why the Sunday gained against the giants is a is a pick them I just I Can't get over that I wrote it Adrian Peterson because I think Chris Thompson as good as he is right now the Redskins figured out that you can get to prevent then you can like Chris Thompson fit for another week or so and get them healthy\nPrint tub hates U.S interests are nation radio eyes at two teams playing each other that might have to run with backup running backs because both teams soldiers are down we know sorting Michelle's out\nFor New England now show McCoy can be out as well with that concussion so criticized free for the bills versus Kenyan border now taking Sony Michel spot for the patriots you James White pill in New England to deal with what who do you like in in that kind of expanded role capacity\nI crossed the ivory against New England because I don't know how Bill Belichick check is going to use Kenyan barter and I mean you you saw him when he played in Philadelphia\nI don't know that he the guy that can carry the number one load maybe he is but I don't know that he's ever gotten the opportunity I mean ten ... for thirty six yard but this is going to be a James White game\nAgainst buffalo at least we know that Chris ... is a black play yeah I mean ... you know the the patriots have allowed at least nine yards or a score this year to every ... to a running back and every game so I think you're looking at a higher dealing with Chris ... I just\nYou get up Kenyan barred go off but I just don't know that I trust the ballot jak\nI don't know if you've ever seen anything like what's going on with Julio Jones in the history of fantasy sports but I had him now the last two years um I I don't I don't know what to do and I can't not stardom I Can't train them so I'm stuck watching him grabbed the eight ball or a hundred and twenty yards and again stay out of the end zone\nI at this point we saw ... weeks ago he is going to regret to the main eventually Julio Jones is going to get into the hands on it\nOr you sure about that [laughter]\nI mean it it's gotta happen right I mean you can catch a hundred and\nSeventy three one forty or ... or ... you can't put up those sort of numbers and not reached the end zone I'm a big believer Avon and you don't it just died and it it'll happen sooner rather than later I mean he's got Washington Cleveland Dallas New Orleans\nSometime and the next three weeks he's going to score at least one\nDo you have a wide receiver you can give us that may not be an obvious selection like a a Jody Nelson or Tyler Boyd in Cincinnati somebody to kind of keep an eye on and maybe play if you have an opportunity to\n...

I wanted to get your thoughts\nOn Thursday night let's start with the good the Houston Texans have clearly the race that rough part and our heroine will touch on the bad the minus William solar moving forward but at least some thoughts on what you saw the positive now with the show and watching them is Texas team now winning five straight\nYeah no it isn't that great and you have to look at who they pay the best of the quarterback they've based not the most uh you know daunting a re pastors in the league but uh\nYou know ever since to go through a\nTough sell their own three you know they hang on against Andrew Luck they beat the Dallas Cowboys I Know the bills quarterback change I Know ... with the jaguars just\nA you know they they made a switch there as well he was struggling and ... you know obviously you last night we got we got to put it in perspective as the guy going back to the face he won the terrible I mean I don't think you put it all and it wasn't great but\nYeah it's office really come on last year's they got the wrong game going and and protected walking really well\nBy now the negative and that's the concern confirmed of course by below Brian will pull us out to the season torn ACL how much damage has that due to the momentum built by the Texans so far\nYeah I mean the other half is clearly the most important non quarterback on all sides and you know the ... role and all that but without solar\nRunning those those deeper out those over routes those seven to nine that everything that helps kind of open things up and give them options vertically or you know I just don't know how they feel that I mean Hawkins the wizard we saw him make an incredible catch that was called back because of a push off\nWell you know we saw the blown coverage obviously by the dolphins but really I I I feel like well for the X factor and he's been battling all these different injuries Pam strings and cabs and things like that\nYou know this one's got a thing but sort of get hurt them I don't think they have a player on the roster even if the coup cutie comes back healthy really who can mimic what he does in terms of stretching the field\nBarricade and joining me a punch interest of the nation radio Eric covers the NFL for pro football we can we follow him on Twitter at ... at home\nYou know I'm In Philadelphia and it's been up and down the them to say the least and two losses in a row or or to be fair run and run into two games to stretches the up and down from Philadelphia but I'm nervous personally as a fan of the eagles this late portals miss came as been dealing with an injury and in fighting\nFor some reason they treat Jackson a part of me London is a better home than Jacksonville the eagles popping down man I don't know of\nAs ... every time I think so competent to the point of what some might take it to the bank bagels are gonna when they lost\nAll close games to write and I mean you know ...\nPoint lead twice\nI Know and you know and they and they had to climb back against the buccaneers I Know that ended up being a close game so you know ... ... the close scores make you think okay there there there are a few plays the way but as you said\nA lot of late you know the the titans gay watching the you know the defense able to stop Mario don't all those sports down\nThe way but as you said a lot of the late you know the the titans gay watching the you know the defense and able to stop Mario don't all those sports downs and you know kind of just\nUnable to seize control against the Vikings team that had been kind of ... for a while they're you know the Carolina game you know the historical odd but their chance the winning above Ninety six percent\nUp Seventeen nothing you know in the fourth and then even even when it was Seventy six their chance we're closer to Ninety nine percent to win that game so that puts in perspective\nHow bad it is and and you know you could point to a number of factors I don't think costs went up I mean he's played well yeah and so it comes down to the office of wind that one game but defense all kind of fill those toys than you know them to come and get their mojo\nBack to London game so you throw that in the mix here how do you see her play out with two struggling off and you know the league you've covered it for a while every now and again when you have to struggling off and since that can lead\nTo when you get them together on the same ... that could lead someone off into the explosion out of nowhere\nRight or wrong team could go crazy other one's still stuck in mutual and and the London factor can't be overlooked I mean you know sometimes the travel plans or affect you I mean I think people covering the raiders have said why gluten attempted to bring them in last minute it's beyond them so\nYeah it's just getting a job but I think it's the eagles game over there too so that the largest stuff you know but yeah I mean\nBeyond that you you know you really can't make too many excuses for that I understand it's an unusual circumstance over there\nAnd let's chat boards deepest look they prevented teams from moving the bad effect ugly but this is not been a big play defense this year I Want to make sure I I clearly say that boils has been one of the biggest problems in the design of past year and all that\nBut this play making defend somebody year ago
