Americans just stand on goods and services that will spur greater economic growth\nWill fix so much for that question I think first of all before answering the question I'd like to take a moment and just discuss the fact that we had the shooting a\nSynagogue or shot up and it's just it's a result of this white nationalism that we're seeing um it's it's a shame not to say anything but it's even worse to be complicit with what's going on\nNot invite Brian in his opening a question when he answers the question that at least you know at at least talk about it that this thing did happen on what's going on as far as with a tax scam people were not better off than we were two years ago oh we had a tax scam past eighty three percent of all the benefits went to the top one percent\nThat's that's unacceptable and right after that we were told that now we're gonna have to tighten our belts because now we can't afford Social Security Medicare and Medicaid these are earn benefits that people are paid into their entire working life\nUm we can find a way and it's not by rewarding the wealthiest donors in the country it's by getting them to pay their fair share so that the middle the hardworking middle class people can get ahead\n[noise]\nNext question well I'm I'm Sorry Mr Sam\nThanks very much first I'd like to thank W cello and W. W. for hosting tonight's debate tiger in here and great just session about the issues as Mr prices are references your previous kind of\nAbsolutely there's no room for those actions and our society in any way shape or form and I think it also I Will get a chance to talk about that a little bit when we get to hopefully civility in politics or in this discussion\nAs relates to the question at hand I think what we've seen here in the town of jeans a week fallen on hard times so the general motors plainclothes eight nine years ago\nAnd we've come a long way or not that's where we need to be but we did is in Washington we started to put implement policies but any real impact on the economy right here in Janesville and across the first congressional district did you come into Janesville you may very well have seen a big billboard\nNoticing jobs Fifteen Fifteen hour we're coming back or not where we need to get you there still a long ways to go the tax reforms that were put in place for a significant step in the right direction\nBut we need to continue down that path and continue this economic progress we need to lower the cost of health care we need to solve the skills gap and make sure that workers are prepared for the job in the future\nWe can't afford to take a step back to the failed economic policies the past supported by Nancy Pelosi and Randy Bryce together we need to take a step forward and continue this economic growth so that everyone has an America has had a job where they can live the American dream\nRipe figure like a thirty second ...\nThat we address our workforce needs here in Wisconsin as it relates to our legal immigration system\nGive you an example if you go out to a dairy farm there's no program for dairy farmers to bring in immigrant labor to assist them we should be identifying our workforce in age and mirror that up with our legal immigration structure\nI was recently a chatting with two gentlemen make an actor or who are originally from Romania they risk their lives to escape Albania under communist rule or they own a restaurant here just outside of Beloit terrific individuals\nThey came to the United states through a legal process or spectacular citizens here and then I say it's an F operate a spectacular restaurants but we need to do is step one secure the border and then step to I'd like to work on a legal immigration system that's rational and logical\nThank you Mr price I'll go through these questions I'm for you as well do you support the building of a physical wall on our southern border no\nDo you support the idea of a multi year plan that would give dreamers a path to permanent legal status in the U.S yes do you believe that federal government authority should be following our current immigration laws until new policies are you\nKnow I have an issue with with all the policies are currently being implemented\nSo then there's a broader question will allow you to stand up and up your idea what changes in our immigration system what you thought they sign like that\nWell first of all we're not going to try kids away from their parents and stick to my dog cages that's not what the United States\n[noise]\nUm and we we were told by Congress that we're going to have a clean DREAM Act in place on February ... that didn't happen I'm I'm looking forward to doing that once we take back control of Congress not only could put in place or something for the dreamers to stay here this is the only country they know they know they they were brought here\nOr it wasn't due to their own choosing their parents brought him here that's the only country they know many don't even speak their native tongue\nThey they were brought here or it wasn't due to their own choosing their parents brought him here that's the only country they know many don't even speak their their native tongue\nAnd we need to provide a clean dream ... we also need to provide ... so that their parents can stay here we need to keep parents together it's it's about if you want to talk about family values that's number one thing that we have to do\nUm but as far as when it comes to ice Brian mentioned things you like preventing terrorism or drugs just Freeman child trafficking sometimes comes off as far as things that ice might be responsible for\nNothing can be further from the truth the FBI is responsible for terrorism right now I used as a bigger ATC than the FBI\nUm the da's responsible for drugs that common then also child trafficking I don't know what you call that once you can reunite a child with their parents and you have to send them out to a foster care there are so many other things that we could do 'em but this these are the things that we need to start on\nRight now to keep families together and find ways to keep them thinking let's just out there in second\nI there's a clear disagreement here Randy Bryce supports abolishing ... step program in particular addresses terrorism human trafficking drug trafficking just\nA few weeks ago long men and women are law enforcement community and ice arrested people involved in human trafficking in Green Bay\nThe people free from that human trafficking I don't think we're too disappointed that I came in\nAnd broken out of that situation I there's a real opportunity to make our community is more safe I think in particular that's why I earned the endorsement of all six six sheriffs Democrats or Republicans life because the policies I'm advocating for make our communities let's say it may make our community is more safe Randy Bryce his policies would make our communities less safe [noise]\nI Would\nHave been mind I Would remind the audience that we ask you this I refrained semi partying and making noise while we're hearing answers I missed it by thirty second\nBut we have members of ice ... ice agents calling for them for for calling for the evolution of life there's they're clearly stating that they can do what they were hired to do because they've been turned into Donald Trump's deportation force\nUm I tend to agree with that and as far as making making our country safe I wore the uniform of this country in defense of this country I was willing to late all my life for it to have somebody say that what I Want to do is is going to make us less safe I find that very disrespectful\nPleasure you and make the the policies you advocate for we make our communities less safe\nI respect your service to our nation I think that's very different than the policies you advocate for I think we should make it clear distinction there\nI respect your service to our nation I don't believe your policies would make our communities safer I think they make them less safe and I think six sheriffs of the across the political spectrum across the entire first congressional district agreed that my policies and make our more say if your policies would make our communities less safe\nBut Brian if we have if we have people in the immigrant community there are afraid to call the authorities because they're afraid of of what might happen to them I mean we're having people that are legally here being detained by ice and incarcerated\nI'm ... I don't know how that makes a safe if we have more people that are willing to report for crimes and work with law enforcement agency I see that it's making us safer to rip apart families there is no way that that that is making the country safer\nAt all I think we'll move on to the next question [noise]\nThank you [noise] prior to the passage of the Affordable CARE Act or Obamacare there were an estimated forty eight million Americans without health insurance\nOr number which fell to a low of under thirty million before increasing the past year to about thirty two million uninsured Americans today premiums are increasing both in and outside of the a C a marketplace along with the cost of prescription drugs so Mr Mr style you first\nWhat does Congress need to do next to address is such\nA great question what we need to do is be focused on how do we lower the cost of health care to make it more affordable and more accessible what happened under Obamacare the Affordable CARE Act column of your life it drove up the cost of health care when you drive\nUp the cost of healthcare makes it less affordable and less accessible to hardworking\nFamilies right here in Wisconsin so my focus is how do we lower the cost of health care and how do we improve quality you do that by putting a patients and doctors centered approach you need to have individuals have some stake in the game as they're making their healthcare decisions\nFor me when I was in school I had a high deductible plans for the first time ever I control some of my health care dollars when I went and looked for a\nDentist I shop price balanced out cost and quality that's not appropriate\nIn every situation but there are situations where individuals need to be in control of some of their health care dollars I think that stands in stark contrast rainy prices for both Randy Bryce would suggest a government takeover of healthcare\nThat would end primary insurance as we know it would destabilize Medicare that millions of seniors rely on\nWhat we need to do is focus on lowering the cost of health care not\nAllowing a government takeover of health care that is a thirty two trillion dollar program the rainy Bryce does not offer a solution as to how to pay for or a myth that he's going to dramatically raise the debt when you just stay focused on lowering the cost of health care and doing that by putting patients and doctors at the center of the decision making process\nCould I could follow up given the free market emphasis of our health care system in the U.S though how how would Congress or implement lowering the cost of healthcare you give me some specific legislative proposal\n... in in particular what we can focus on is HR says so it's just a is allows individuals to control some of their health care dollars sort of go back to my high deductible plan while I was in school for the first time ever rather than going to any dentists and not worrying about\nThe actual cost of the service I was in charge of my health care dollars shop the dentist and found a price and quality pointed mash my needs that forced a market effect to lower the cost of care and improve quality that doesn't apply to every\nSituation that doesn't work if you get in a car accident or you have a heart attack that's where you need carry immediately but in situations where individuals can control some of their health care dollars and in particular through H essays and other plants there was a real opportunity\nOkay Mr Bryce thirty seconds\nBut I think when we're talking about health care of all you know the most of us struggle to pay for it I was diagnosed with cancer at a time when I did have insurance that's a scary place to be a little bit of a different story here on a what a millionaire has to go through as far as being for his health care the two stories are a little different\nMr ...\nOh yeah yeah you you look at your plan it would it would end the employer sponsored care so for the millions of people in Wisconsin to rely on their employer to have their care to be able to choose their doctor\nA government takeover of healthcare which end our current system where individuals get to choose their doctor it pushed government in charge of the decision making process rather than individuals in their doctors\nThank you [noise] [laughter]\nI'm ... I'm ... I'm Sorry did you find what you did you ... I'm Sorry did you get Ninety seconds I I may I was like All right\nNo I mean we're talking about you know\nYou get Ninety seconds I I'm a I mean I like that All right\nNo I mean we're talking about you know people don't like paying twenty percent off of there from their payroll deduction to have healthcare this is going to this is going to be less again it's the Koch brothers study that has shown we're gonna save two trillion dollars I don't know where we're getting this enormous price tag from\nWhat's the problem but what's the price but the what's the price\nOf thirty thirty two trillion dollar where are you going to pay a trillion dollars were\nReally they liked Mr Right answer [noise] thing [noise]\nRight now we're we're probably paying more for the insurance than anybody else every other industrialized country around us has some form of universal healthcare I just talked with a man last night at do is from England that's in in Tom visiting and he said well we have is fantastic\nFor it to work every place else I mean this is not going to be perfect just going to have bumps but it's something to that bar people definitely deserve especially when you're talking about given one point five trillion dollars away to the richest people and we're getting nothing in return for\nThe wealthiest among the CEOs and and corporations that paid very little in taxes we need to take care of the people that do the work that maintain everything that's going on in this country um that's why that's why the approval rating is so low and then once people feel that they're being listened to\nYou're going to see a change and that's why I'm confident you're going to see a lot of new faces in Congress come November let's just hours in that can be ...\nYeah I think that stands in stark contrast rainy braces history\nIs a history of being an obstruction we go back to the protest that occurred in Madison and twenty eleven Randy Bryce is one of the organizers of it what got accomplished in those protests absolutely nothing\n... wants to go and throw a wrench in the wheel of government we need to stand for it and try to get more done on behalf of the American people and stay focused on how do we continue to grow the economy not how to become an obstructionist Mr Right\nWell if I were there wouldn't be so many corporate attorneys millionaires that are all sorts of jobs there wouldn't be so many jobs under attack and and the world will be a better place\nIt's not about obstructing it's about standing up on behalf of working people I've also taken off of work at at times I could barely afford it to go to Madison to testify on behalf of these extreme anti worker who says the legislation I'll continue to stand for people that need need help 'em that's who I Am that's the way I was raised I'm proud of standing for people when they need help\nI I actually have a quick follow up on this question to both of you in your view\nHas Congress deferred too much to the executive branch have we seen that development over the decades first\nDay I saw over the decades absolutely Congress needs to pull back a lot of the power because who's who is most\nResponsive to the people as members of the house of representatives the United States Senate for particular members of the United States House of representatives\nIndividuals need to be able to go and talk to their member representative have that conversation they need to be held accountable every two years the more power that shift over to the executive branch an unelected bureaucrats the worse off we are I think we could actually see a shift in power back to a kind of surprised\nAbsolutely the executive branch has too much power and it's due to policies I look at Paul Ryan\nHe remove Barbour leaves amendment literally in the middle of the night that would've taken away Donald Trump's powers to write up the blank check powers to write to ... to wage war um we're not going to have a stronger Congress when the speaker of the houses is advocating policies that take power away from Congress [noise]\nWe have another question or and I believe Mr Bryce starts with this one\nHas to do with climate change the inter governmental panel on climate change is report on global warming was released released earlier this month\nAnd it describes what it views as the needs of the international community the whole global warming to one point five degrees and minimize the effects of climate change\nEssentially the nations of the world would be expected to work together to cut the global carbon emissions by forty five percent in just a decade\nIs this something that the u._s. should be participating in\nAbsolutely um I've been an advocate for for green energy we can be solved dependent on renewable fuels by the you're twenty thirty five I'm committed to doing that but I work as you did that I Belong to wrote a book on how to erect winter is because of fossil fuels and and their influence on the state you don't see them going up like they they wants to\nUm we can do we can get ourselves over to that but we have to wean ourselves off of um dependency on fossil fuels you know and I I also I called out ExxonMobil for things that they should be prosecuted for lying to the American pie\nI'm dependency on fossil fuels you know and I I also I called out ExxonMobil first things that they should be prosecuted for lying to the American public right after I did that they gave Fifteen hundred dollars to Bryan style [noise] so if you want to talk about how to how\nClean energy jobs I Know how to get a dog and we can do it if you want somebody more of the same more dependence on fossil fuel industry and oil independence on trying to get it from overseas\nThen you've got Bryan style style\nOutdoorsman I Need to protect our land air and water that's front and center of this discussion or climate change is real or we need to address it in particular we need to address the terrible environmental policy is going on in India and China and bring them to the table\nUnder the Paris accord China once I've had to come to the table effectively until twenty thirty\nThat's where that's that's the distinction here what we need to do is have policies in place that directly addressed the environmental degradation that's going on in India and China and to allow the United states to maintain affordable energy policies I think that's where we see the distinction Randy Bryce his policies would dramatically drive up the cost of energy\nWas that conversation or with an elderly couple and corn or just the other day and they were concerned about their heating costs the upcoming winter is under the policies advocated by Randy Bryce the cost of natural gas to dramatically increase that would put at risk this couple in El corner who's on it on a fixed income in retirement\nBut we need to do is stay focused on maintaining affordable energy policy at the same time address the environmental problems and you do that by staying focused on China and India to come to the table to address the environmental degradation going on in their countries\nI guess I'm going to look for some clarification here are the question was should the U.S participate in an international effort to cut the global carbon emissions by forty five percent in a decade is that something the U.S should participate in\nI think we should participate in a conversation as to how we address\nCarter yes I have a conversation as to what the number is I'd like to sit down and read your forty five percent analysis and a little more detail before I throw a forty five percent of the number off the cuff but I think we can have that global conversation what I'm saying is as compared to what occurred in the Paris accord\nWhere China and India weren't coming to the table or an adequate amount of time we need to stay focused in any record where we address the global impact of global warming by bringing in India in India and China to the table\n... well you indicated that um you believe that climate change Israel ... do you believe that um individual intact climate change yes\nI'm so you'll be going into a body where the majority should you be elected where the majority of your pockets does not believe that [noise] so how do you feel that you'll be able to work in that environment and perhaps move forward your goals in a party that doesn't necessarily agree with you\nI'm not worried about party labels I'm going there to represent the people at first congressional district to the best of my ability of given that opportunity\nSo I'm not worried about or any partisan view whether or not a shirt or don't I share the view is that I hold one of the views that I hold as the climate change is real and humans are a key factor in that\nSo I'm going to go an advocate for policies that advance people here in southeast Wisconsin I think the distinction is is that doesn't mean that we should dramatically drive up the cost of energy\nOn a loose idea that India and China will later followed his policies we need to bring India and China and set the table now to have that conversation as it addresses carbon emissions\nAnd maintain a low and affordable energy policy here in the United states\n... Mr Bryson I think you have thirty seconds\nBut I mean the policies Brian is going to be the whole ... Paul Ryan super Pakistani millions and millions of dollars on attack ads against me they're going to want something in return\nThat's why I'm Glad that I don't have the superPAC backing me up so that I can go and make sure that we use legislate responsibly to get a clean energy to be dependent on renewable energy sources not dependent and I don't know anybody anything exciting aside from the small dollar donors who are helping me raise the funds needed to run his parents\nAnd then Mr Frank to follow up for you um many people would assert that some of the policies in place I'm joining you know global effort to hurt the American economy so how would you respond to those concerns\nWell I think as far as hurting American kind of I mean this is from a security standpoint as well that we're not dependent on any outside country\nOnce we're fully dependent on renewable resources in our own country that's going to make us a lot safer it's going to have all the jobs the continued rights you're good to an American jobs clean energy our kids deserve it and our two kids deserve a clean plan it as well\nOkay thank you um I Believe this next question will be directed to their price okay um so this question has to do with um\nThe recent events in Pittsburgh that process that get people's attention in regard to issues of mass violence\nAnd so do you believe that there is a bipartisan approach that you could support that will make us safer in our houses of worship our schools and other public places safe from uh the violent attacks like we saw in Pittsburgh but I I\nAs far as bipartisan say the only thing I've heard from both sides that they want to do is banned bump stocks\nI've I've heard that that what they wanted to do it I haven't seen anything takes place on but otherwise I mean when you hear people say we want to take guns into places of worship is their their fault that they got shot or if we one foot guns into schools but we won't allow them at our own political rallies\nI think that's kind of messed up and and and uh a little bit more filled with apocryphal than I'd like to see\nOkay so let me ask you then um you've only heard about the stock being banned um do you see any wherever you could maybe move forward beyond that because that hadn't gained any traction either\nThink exactly I I Would love to see it it'd be a great thing to do so that people could see that Democrats or Republicans both agree on something let's go to song I mean with the Republicans have total control of of our government Washington DC right now my husband had taken place because there is no desire to because the ... and blah\nBlah and one of the candidate says looking forward to give them enough rating from the n._r._a. that I'm a gun owner um I'm also an expert shot with weapons so I Know how to use them I don't have a problem with the second amendment but when we have to stand up and I'm a father of a a twelve year old to I'm not going to buy him a bulletproof backpacks\nWe like\nTo thank the University of Wisconsin whitewater Iraq county for providing the venue for this evening [noise]\nI Would\nLike to thank our coal broadcast partners here tonight W FA W nine forty eight amount of Fort Atkinson between us we cover the east end of the first be rational district pretty well and you can count on complete coverage of the elections as we go forward next week to be sure\n[noise] finally I Would like to thank the audience that you\nThank you for attending thank you for your interest in politics and your interest in our nation's future or how many have already or the early vote it I'm just curious by Chauvin\nA third of the auditorium 'cause we are still alive that's about a third of the auditorium a pretty good response how many of you a plan to vote on election day that ought to be the rest of you I Would hope terrific [noise] ah we're going to\nStay alive here or until we get to our natural breaking point anti drug and said again from stuck in the middle of the anti drug and send the weekdays on W.

McCoy actually set up to the game I didn't have my best guess\nHow can you have your best game when everyone selling out you know to stop you it's like you know we it's like they're they're like they are very poor man's all this going to be an insult to Dallas but they are very poor man Dallas Cowboys armpits they dump dump dump down to feel everybody knows\nThat the running back is is the best player on the field you know what I'm saying and that's a big insult to Dallas because buffalo is that bad\nBut the you know what I'm saying like they they are a very poor Dallas Cowboys up at the kind of like the the bill okay let's go to a team who does not struggle whatsoever when it comes to object that'd be the Golden State warriors and this man set a record tonight around\nClass\n\nGradually\nYeah warriors down seven and one that's warriors radio what the call clay constant in twenty seven minutes and I had fifty\nTwo points knocking fourteen three pointers and the game and\nIt was obvious that you were watching the end of this game I turn it on the body it was obvious that the whole team was out basically trying to help him get that three point if they are just the warriors or during the regular season they just have fun\nThat's really what it is like it's all a joke like OK last year against the Phoenix Suns Steve Kerr hands the clip boards of the ... to the players and said okay you coach Phoenix took it as an insult but really I I mean they're just they're they're having fun but they're also just\nGetting comfortable with each other it's amazing how fake\nTo me they already I guess it's not made their last for game tonight they beat the bulls one forty nine one twenty four then they beat the Brooklyn that's one twenty to one fourteen a couple of days ago that was a game where Steph Curry and Kevin Duran combined to score sixty nine points before that the warriors beat the next one twenty eight to one hundred\nThat was over the weekend how about the show Duran put on at the garden in front of\nEvery single Nick thin cheering for Kevin directs the how\nHow odd it like if you're the New York Knicks have it you want Kevin rent to come to your team\nAnd they're they're already billboards outside of your next fans have already given up they don't give a lick about this season their full on recruitment process trying to get Kevin ... to come to the team next year\nSo they were cheering at the end of the game for Kevin random at forty one point nine ... that was three games to go and four games ago they demolish the Washington Wizards Steph Curry at fifty one points in the game and Duran had thirty those two combined for eighty one porch\nAnd we're ... we're hearing called doctors day it was easy was like a video game Kevin checking themselves out of the game saying literally he was you know do you can read his lips and this is too easy\nIt's just way too easy for the warriors butter record was that tonight and it was that over a guy who is currently on the roster\nHere's clay Thompson talking about what that Cory told him at\nThat happens he was approaching getting this record tonight\nThe first step smell booze go get that record grown I'm like okay you want me to go right through her got you and I just you know it was saying that just shows you know the ... or ... for each other when we get measles\nEveryone just wants to do so well and I'm so lucky to be able to like this\nThat's quite Thompson on as VP late at night ESPN television show a clay Tom since fifty two points tonight Steph Curry what twenty three these warriors are dominant All right let me come back we're going to talk about a team who is far from\nDominant dominant in fact I Would go as far as I said they're incompetent that's overnight SB Nation radio\nThis street he's\nHiring Donald joins the holy cow I'm super Rich Cohen\nThe rams posted on tutor a ... percent in interest it's pronounced just no time\nIn history it's not it's not peanut butter and okay it to get the creator of says concept said it was just I don't believe in its own\nI don't care because some of the movie was not peanut butter ... that sort of created this ...

up in the nation radio all the news media\nLeo Riley auto barge studios here's met here at the end of the magazine this isn't an SB Nation radio Matt here is that\nWhat you jumped into the NFL weekend that was what Howard goals are the sports exchange you can follow all of our work on Twitter at age Boulder seven to want to start how well it was a little bit of time but the New England patriots get their way with the Buffalo Bills tonight twenty five to six I'll tell you what they'll have one of my biggest takeaway is that these are the patriots I\nI don't know if I Would call it exposed but without sunny Michelle\nThem without this running games they're often certainly lacked and I don't know if this is concerning for Bill ... moving forward is sunny Michelle's injuries is is is lacking but you know with with him in there to play actually game is working the defense asked to respect the run out what was one of your biggest takeaway something I\n[noise] yeah I I think certainly there are better team with Michele though there's no question about it and with only two running backs active they end up using Patterson has a running back which we know he's not and he was able to make a few clays form but obviously you're not going to do that that consistently but I Do think we have to give a little credit\nFor the bills defense uh that's about the only good thing that you could probably talk about\nIn Buffalo that is a ... a pretty solid defense and they came in with a pretty good plan on a little chilly night there and uh you know the fans were into it and and all those things and so are they you know they they gave them a good battle game of the battle so I think that\nI Will see going forward or what you know what happens with that patriot to run again we'll we'll see if the singer he keeps Michelle out\nFor a little longer but the reality is in the lead there's not that many teams that you play or have you know have really good defense but they ran into you know a team that the like I said did a pretty good job against tonight for most of the game\nAnd I want to get into the big news of the day or the Cleveland Browns firing a huge accident and of course not Haley living now my concern to tell me if you think this is a legitimate concern or not\nI'm I'm kind of concern acre Mayfield is now going to go down the path that Jared ... went through\nHis first year wedding when it came to just you know it ain't insisted the head coach thing at the top that was not very good in terms of guiding him in the right direction is that a legitimate concern for Cleveland Brown fan that Baker Mayfield first year not gonna say waste but is not going to be as productive as it could be\nWell I think that the the one thing that's\nThat's a I think has to be looked at is is the fence is not going to check\nThat they're still going to play the same often and uh with you know I think one of the underrated guys there that ah that that is going to be very involved in it as al Saunders a who's a senior assist out it was official title is that and that guy's been around the league forever heck\nI can remember I'm based in St Louis I remember when he was the rams receivers coach\nHere in St Louis during the greatest show on tour and then he went to Kansas City ... meal when he came became the head coach and and he was the office of coordinator so he's pretty good sense of coach so I I think that\nYou know they are still going to stay with that off and uh they they have to improve the talent around Baker Mayfield I think that's been one of the issue certainly the last few weeks with with some of the injuries they've had for the receivers but they they definitely have to upgrade that receiving corps which obviously is not going to happen this season so I I still\nBelieve that it was eight games or whatever experienced Baker may feel is going to get is going to be a I think you know is going to be good for him to experience it the question is what happened to me is what happens next year and who are they going to get you know to run this off\nAnd that's going to be the most important higher than that they do but I think John door she is going to be smart about it I mean one of the questions with the bears\nI thought this year was after you know a decent ... ear last year and some pretty good growth uh I Wonder what would happen with Michel ... by with now year to learning a new outfits\nAnd it's taken some time and he's had his rough rough spots but\nHe's you know I think he's going to be fine in time and that happens with any young quarterback so I I think what what the browns have to concentrate on is getting that guy that they believe\nIs going to be there for the long haul offensively that can really with Baker may feel is development and so that's gonna make for a very interesting search by John Dorsey in terms of who that next coaches but one thing you wonder about is\nIs this the owners Jimmy has one of those he is he just too involved with that I mean when you have a situation where the head coach um reports to the owner instead of the general manager then I'm not so sure that that's the best\nThe best way to run a football team so ah so we'll ... we'll see how that all goes but you know it will also see the rest of the year whether whether they can you know show show some improvement and get some of these younger guys more involved especially in the past and getting\nOur goals are is our guest of the sports exchange you can follow Howard's work on Twitter ... or seven to one are you surprised by the timing of the blue vinyl that huge accident was not exactly\nYou know was not Dorsey sky but did he get enough time I mean they didn't win a game last year and there are two and six talks scheduled I think it could make the argument at the beginning of the season are you surprised at all but the timing of the moves and the fact that it was not only do Jackson but also taught Haley\n... that's the I think that was that that shows why this move was made that that and and I I I think you know he huge acts and basically I think cost himself\nAnd tied Haley this job mainly with what Jackson said after the game or last week and I'm not saying that's why he got fired but\nAnd the and I think it was blown out of proportion or by the media to a degree because they kind of twisted in ... more put words in the ... no matter how much he tried to explain it but\nBy ... by saying anything about getting more involved in the office and he shined a you know not a flashlight but uh you know but a searchlight on this offsets\nAnd some of the issues they were having you know inside of Haley's are strong personality do ... Jackson's their strong personality and I think that the dysfunction there that was apparently going on behind the scenes between those two guys was what caused this move so no I don't think there was enough time and I think that\nWho knows things might have been different if those guys had had\nYou know I kept reading quiet and just work to continue to get better I don't know that this would have happened and that you can make the case you missed field you know missed kicks in the first couple of games a horrible call against them against Oakland yeah they they ... they could be sitting here and I know every team loses says that\nBut he went to these games they lost all of a sudden there for three and one\nYeah they could they ... they could be sitting here and I know every team loses says that but he went to these games they lost all of a sudden there for three and one in four to five and one\nAnd the whole field a team is totally different and if it was that was the record you Jackson probably wouldn't have said what he said in frustration after the game or last you know last week so I I think all of those things led to this move to day\nAnd by doing it now you clear it out the ... you don't have all I think was having it that way probably would have hurt\nBaker may feel more for the rest of the year than what they'll be doing now and now he was John Dorsey a pretty good head start on not not so much putting together his list of head coach is not really a big getting up to speed on who he's interested in that can really move quickly once the season that\nSour balls or

Green Bay Packers they did it three three and on their third play Vikings are for three and want bears or foreign three okay\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are foreign for Washington Redskins are five and two there just a game and a half\nBack and then the Baltimore Ravens their foreign for Bengals are five and three and the Steelers are foreign to\nOur balls or said that the eagles have the best chance with the foreign for record I'm going to go with the Packers for what I saw with the Packers against the Los Angeles rams yesterday was a team defensively now granted they did it two weeks to prepare for the rams\nBut to stop they didn't stop the rams but they slowed down the ramp the rams twenty nine points it was a very quiet twenty not it really was I thought the medically they did a fantastic job in that first have\nThey have the best quarterback in the division by far and usually when you have the best quarterback you have a really good chance to win the division of saints are up in the end of the south they have the best quarterback rams that the best quarterback in their division I go out there it's either a golfer either rush out to be honest I think if we're looking individually\nRussell Wilson is probably a little bit better than ... but Jared got it all his work and right there um\nBullock I'll tell you what I think the Packers defense joke something do you think time dumber he survives the week to be honest I I I Can't he has got to be hated like despised in the locker room and we kinda got into a little a little bit yesterday but I I just I Can't see 'em like living until friday right\nI mean I read that he's already getting death threats or its whose family what does he really yeah they're riding on come\nOn sports get outta here you got to stop that that's ... ... this is in its fourth man yeah what are you saying that it's a ... what is it fair and care that much about one team that you're going to Ted I mean that's a criminal act yeah yeah that's ridiculous\nMan uh but I I I don't know I mean that is pretty bad what he did disobeying because I'm going to go with the Packers who are you going to go with three or five hundred team was the best chance of winning their division I'm going to go with the Packers I don't believe in the Vikings really biking seven feet really anybody Chicago Bears I don't believe in mental Trybulski the ravens\nI'm ...

just won the world series right like we can look back and we can question\nSome of these decisions when it comes to the Dodgers line up and Dave Robert tennis match St Louis wasn't supposed to be in here but the best team won the world series this year right\nYeah I tend to agree with the same on the world series or frankly\nYou know I wasn't certain they were as good as the one hunter went eight when during the regular season but they easily this past the ... he's the Astros and then the Dodgers and the post season to lead me to believe this is one of the most impressive games fan in recent

going anywhere there can be dangerous for years to come with the scary thing for the rest of the major\n... let me ask you a a a hypothetical question here because I was having this discussion with somebody before game five who was like if this series ended in four games like let's say it was asleep and the red Sox won all those games who do you think would have won MVP ... and my point is that\nThe whole team was the MPP like you can't point out until steered Steve Pearce had that breakout performance in game five I\nMean could you have this is just a testament to how good they were and how much of a team effort was could you pointed out a legitimate ... number one person said this guy was the most valuable\nAt the end for games I think it would have went to ... an evolving because of the performance in game three you know something that we're not gay and we're probably talking about he bought a winning the MVP period regardless of what the pure dead or regardless of

underscore ... do you think Dave Roberts uh is taking too much heat for what has gone on regarding the decision making with the line up\nA ... ... ... again I I don't really look at the situation is pinpointing blame on Los Angeles and losing I just put it as credit for Boston but look there there there's all this question marks when it comes to like okay he had bought into analytics and that was a major reason why are they\nThe lineup square foot ... how do you think David Roberts like I don't even want to say deserves get fired 'cause I don't think he does how much blame the saying goes to the manager in Los Angeles last four out of five\nI think we're getting much blame and I don't think they should be fired and you know the analytic buzz word that was prevail are all theories and all of his long and I think it\nGarbage straw man because I ... with the the best coach for last year he now right right literally just had a book about how LA climb they are and I know I follow a tweet that the first now for a hug after he was done with this post game press conference was the red Sox analytics guy\nYou know the red Sox are an analytic they literally employs Bill James who is like you know the\nCreator saver metrics or the idea that the red Sox earning the analytic you know at this nonsense there were there Robert\nYou know you can point of a line up and say you know that's analytic fault but the players play and the fact is that in turn or did not come up with demand for him but it is and I thought last night and you know the final game theory go tell you\nHow you know why not struggled and you know no analytics darn charming than me and my child has the Dallas area there were some of these ever Dodger players started well I think you know it's really unfortunate that we were having this discussion and this has become a topic\nUh you know as a base topic because if you look at the other side okay that the red Sox have lost the theory\nWould it be a ... or follow the analytic all them ... you know write well pretty quiet until the last game no of course not you know\n... and the need to fill air and you know the need the phone call they make the wild things and Twitter this enables that all the more you know I don't know it Robert can be fired and I don't think it's ... ball because every team uses analytics at this point\nAnalyst is a very good scapegoat out of that that's a pretty good point let me uh let me ask you let me ask you this though is it fair to criticize Dave robbers pronounce playing or what could potentially have been\nGood morning to let me uh let me ask you let me ask you this\nThough is it fair to criticize the\nRobbers pronounce playing or what could potentially have been his best lineups early on in the series\nLaw I guess it depends on what we're talking about because\nYou know that as opposed to and heavy theme and you can make the case that maybe they should have done this or that but keep in mind\nYou know these plumes nowadays have more data than we have publicly they're able to do things that frankly the public can do and you know Andrew Freedman ... body of it to a tough decision makers for the

night with Matt Harris on SB Nation radio and on top of the nation radio dot com\nLeo Riley auto parts studios here's Matt Harris and welcome back into the night SB Nation radio Matt Harris back with us jumped into the NFL weekend that was what Howard goals are the sports exchange you could follow all of our work\nOn Twitter at age balls or seven to one All right Howard well it took a little bit of time but the New England patriots got their way with the Buffalo Bills tonight twenty five to six I'll tell you what though how one of my biggest takeaway is that the the patriot I\nI I don't know if I Would call it exposed but without sunny Michelle them without this running games there are certainly lacked and I don't know if this is concerning for Bill Belichick moving forward is sunny Michelle's injuries this is wagging but you know with with him in there to play the game is working the defense asked to respect the run\nOr what what was one of your biggest takeaway something I\n[noise] yeah I I think certainly there are better team with Michele so there's no question about it and with only two running backs active they end up using Patterson as a running back which we know he's not he was able to make a few plays for but obviously you're not going to do that a consistently but I Do think we have to give a little credit\nFor the bills defense uh that's about the only good thing they could probably talk about\nIn Buffalo that is a ... a pretty solid defense and they came in with a pretty good plan on a little chilly night there and uh you know the fans were into it and and all those things and so are they you know they they gave them a battle game of the battle so I think that\nProbably will see going forward or what you know what happens with the patriots are running game we'll we'll see if this injury keys shell out\nFor a little longer but the reality is in the way there's not that many teams that you play or have you know have really good effect but they ran into you know a team that the the like I said did a pretty good job against an eye for most of the game\nBut I Want to get into the big news of the day or the Cleveland Browns firing a huge accident and of course taught Haley leaving now my concern to tell me if you think this is a legitimate concern or not\nI I kind of concerned a bigger Mayfield is now going to go down the path that Jared ... went through\nHis first year wedding when it came to just you know in ... the head coach at the top that was not very good in terms of guiding him in the right direction is that a legitimate concern for Cleveland Browns fans that Baker may feels first year like I say waste but it's not going to be as productive as it could be\n[laughter] well I think that the the one thing that [noise]\nThat's a I got to be looked at the fence is not going to share\nThat they're still going to play for the same offer and uh with you know I think one of the underrated guys there that ah that that is going to be very involved in it is our son who's a senior official title is good\nAnd that guy's been around the league forever I Can't remember I'm based in St Louis I remember when he was the rams receivers coach here in St Louis during the greatest show on tour and then he went to Kansas City or meal he became a coach and and he was the ... coordinator so he's pretty good up that the coach so I I think that\nYou know they are still going to stay with that off and uh they they have to improve the talent\nUntil coordinator so he's pretty good off sense of coach so I I think that\nYou know they are still going to stay with that off and\nUh they they have to improve the talent around Baker Mayfield I think that's been one of the issue certainly the last few weeks with with some of the injuries they've had for the receivers but they they definitely have to upgrade that receiving corps which obviously is not going to happen there this season so I I still believe that it was eight games\nOr whatever experienced Baker Mayfield is going to get is going to be you know I think you know is going to be good for him to experience it the question is what I have to me is what happens next year\nAnd who are they going to get you know to run this often and that's going to be the most important higher or that they do but I think John door she is going to be smart about it I mean one of the questions with the bears\nI thought this year was after you know a decent ... year last year and some pretty good growth\nUh I Wonder what would happen with Michel tribute escape with now year to learning a new law sense and it's taken some time and he's had his rough rough spots\nBut he's you know I think he's going to be fine in time and that happens with any young quarterback so I I think what what the browns have to concentrate on is getting that guy that they believe\nIs going to be there for the long haul offensively that can really with Baker may feel as development and so that's gonna make for a very interesting search by John Dorsey in terms of who that next head coach is the one thing you wonder about\nIs is that the owners Jimmy has on those he is he just too involved in that I mean when you have a situation where the heck coach um reports to the owner instead of the general manager and I'm not so sure that that's the best\nThe best way to run a football team so ah so we'll ... we'll see how that all goes but you know will it will also see the rest of the year whether whether they can you know show show some improvement and get some of these younger guys more involved especially in the past and getting\nOur goals are is our guest of the sports exchange you can follow our work on Twitter HBO's or seven to one are you surprised by the timing of the move I Know that you've Jackson was not exactly\nYou know it's not Dorsey guy but did he get enough time I mean they didn't win a game last year and there are two and six schedule I think you could make the argument at the beginning of the season are you surprised at all but the timing of the moon and the fact that it was not only you jak to but also not Haley\nWell the ... I think that was that that shows why this move was made that that that and and I I I think you know huge huge acts and basically I think cost himself\nAnd tied Haley this job mainly with what Jackson said after the game or last week and I'm not saying that's why he got fired but\nAnd the and I think it was blown out of proportion and by the media to a degree because they kind of twisted in ... more put words in the ... Jackson's mouth no matter how much he tried to explain it but by ... by saying anything about getting more involved than the ...\nHe shined a you know not a flashlight but uh you know but a searchlight on this offsets\nAnd some of the issues they were having you know Todd Haley's are strong personality you to Jackson's their strong personality and I think that the dysfunction there that was apparently going on behind the scenes between those two guys was what caused this move so no I don't think there was enough time and I think that\nWho knows things might have been different if those guys had had you know I kept everything quiet and just work to continue to get better I don't know that this would have happened and that you can make the case you missed field you missed kicks in the first couple of games a horrible call against them against Oakland\nYeah they they ... they could be sitting here\nAnd I know every team loses says that but he went to these games they lost all of a sudden there for three and one and send it to five and one and the whole field of the team is totally different and if it was that was the record\nYour Jackson probably wouldn't have said what he said in frustration after the game or last you know last week so I think all of those things led to this move to day\nAnd by doing it now you clear it out the ... you don't have a I think was having it that way probably would have hurt\nBaker may feel more for the rest of the year than what they will be doing now and now he was John Dorsey a pretty good head start on not not so much putting together his list of head coach is not really a big getting up to speed on who he's interested in that can really move quickly wants to see them\nSour balls or against or the sports exchange you can follow Howard work on winter each soldier seven to one so I sent a decent amount of time on my show on this football season talking about teams\nWho don't necessarily have their guy on the in terms of quarterback on the roster right now spent some time about the bills that jaguars or the New York giants should I start to put the Tampa Bay buccaneers on that list is Jane is Winston Tampa's guy moving forward\nI have until ten o'clock on Jefferson county's news and talk [noise]\n\nThis is over the knife with Matt Harris on SB Nation radio and on the radio talk on the O'Reilly auto parts studios fears mad hair of thinking of how our\nPolls are for joining the shell I Bobby ... traded yes or no no they're areas Thomas traded yes or no in where he said oh you're at that as a biased as there but that's OK Jamie college jaded yes or no [noise]\nNo ... junior jaded yes or no the lemon and traded yes or no fortunately no ...

Aaron Rodgers and it cuts to Tom Brady and the Packers they're going to play the patriots\nOn I think it's Sunday Night Football next week and it's the same thing number twelve versus number twelve number twenty three versus number twenty three who was the greatest of all time and I thought it was a great promo and then look Braun came out and said okay\nWell why don't we just do this Michael like let's just you know you you were joking about this one on one thing but let's just go out and actually do it and that got me thinking you know what I Would rather see that then Phil Mickelson versus Tiger Woods like there's this one on one that's\nAgain I I just I I think bill ...\nIs just I I Would be a little worried if I'm the patriots off it just it just how important it seems that Sony Michel is to this off as a sign defenses moving forward and a grand there's not a lot of here here's the advantage there's not a lot of defense being played at all and this week\nSo like if you do know what the patriots are going to be trying to do\nI I'm not sure there are many defenses out there who could even stop it you know the bills have a decent defence like I Would say the bills have a top ... would would you say that they're they have a top Fifteen ... are they in the top half in terms of the defenses in the NFL\nI mean the difference is not bad it's just they're often cannot school right now oh God there's I mean it was just such a struggle imagine there are those poor bills that spend like bills mafia I Love I Love how passionate they are they paid\nTheir face and everything they create noise it is one of the best home field advantage is they just have they are so completely incompetent when it comes to office of football how someone not getting fired like the office of coordinator I don't I Know they don't really have much personnel but you\nTalk like they can't do anything off that simply they have a one of the top Bernie ... healthy in the legal ... McCoy actually set up to the game I didn't I my best guess\nHow can you have your best game when everyone selling out you know to stop you it's like you know when they say they're like they are very poor man's all this going to be an insult to Dallas but they are very poor man Dallas Cowboys office they dump dump dump down to feel everybody knows\nThat the running back is is the best player on the field you know what I'm saying and that's a big insult to Dallas because buffalo is that bad\nBut the you know what I'm saying like they they are a very poor Dallas Cowboys up at the kind of that I see the bill okay let's go to a team who does not struggle whatsoever when it comes to offset that'd be the Golden State warriors and this man set a record tonight harassed\nA struggle whatsoever when it comes to opt that that'd be the Golden State warriors and this man set a record tonight Iraq\nSized play for\n\n\nYeah warriors down seven and one that's warriors radio what the call clay Thompson and twenty seven minutes and I had fifty two point knocking at fourteen\nThree pointers in the game and it was obvious that you were watching the end of this game I turned it on the body it was obvious that the whole team was out basically trying\nTo help him get that three point if they are just the warriors ... during the regular season they just have fun\nThat's really what it is like it's all legit like OK last year against the Phoenix Suns the current hand the clip forward to the ... to the players and said okay you coach Phoenix took it as an insult but really I mean they're just they're they're having fun but they're also just\nGetting comfortable with each other it's amazing how in sync\nTo me they already I guess it's not made their last for game\nTonight they beat the bulls one forty nine one twenty four then they beat the Brooklyn that's one twenty to one fourteen a couple of days ago that was a game where Steph Curry and Kevin direct combined discourse sixty nine points before that the warriors beat the next one twenty eight to one hundred that was over the weekend how about the show Duran put on at the garden in front of\nEvery single Knicks fan cheering for Kevin direct how odd it like if you're the New York Nick ... is Kevin Kevin rent to come to your team\nAnd they're they're already billboards outside of your next fans have already given up they don't give a lick about this season their full on recruitment process trying to get Kevin rent to come to the team next year\nSo they were cheering at the end of the game for Kevin random at forty one point nine ... that was three games ago four games ago they demolish the Washington Wizards Steph Curry at fifty one points in the game of Duran had thirty those two combined for eighty one point\nAnd we're ... we're hearing quote that they're saying it was easy was like a video game Kevin around checking himself out of the game saying literally he was you know do you can read as much they just it's too

parts studios here's Matt Arab and welcome back into the night SB Nation radio Matt Harris back\nWith us jumped into the NFL weekend that was what Howard goals are the sports exchange you could follow all of our work on Twitter at age falls or seven to want to start how well it took a little bit of time but the New England patriots gather way with the Buffalo Bills tonight twenty five to six I'll tell you what though our one of my biggest takeaway is that these are the patriots I\nI I don't know if I Would call it exposed but without Sony Michel one without this running games they're often certainly lacked\nAnd I don't know if this is concerning for Bill Bella check moving forward is sunny Michelle's injuries is is is wagging but you know with with him in there to play actually gave his work in the defense asked to respect the run or what what was one of your biggest takeaway from tonight\n[noise] yeah I I think her only there a better team with Michele so there's no question about it and with only two running backs active they end up using Patterson as a running back which we know he's not he was able to make a few place warm but obviously you're not going to do that but like I Do think we have to give a little credit\nFor the bills de France uh that's about the only good thing they could probably talk about in Buffalo that is a ... a pretty solid defense and they came in with a pretty good plan on a little chilly night there and you know the fans were into it and and all those things and so\nAre they you know they they gave him a good battle the battle so I think that I Will see going forward or what you know what happens with the patriots are running game will will see this injury keeps for shell out for a little longer\nWe'll see going forward or what you know what happens with that patriots are running game we'll we'll see if the singer he keeps Michelle out for a little longer\nBut the reality is in the league there's not that many teams that you play or have you know have really good defense but they ran into you know a team that the like I said did a pretty good job against tonight for most of the game\nAnd I want to get into the big news of the day of the Cleveland Browns firing a huge accident and of course not Haley living now my concern to tell me if you think this is a legitimate concern or not\nI'm I'm kind of concern that bigger Mayfield is now going to go down the path that Jared ... went through\nHis first year wedding when it came to just you know in consistency and head coach at the top that was not very good in terms of guiding him in the right direction is that a legitimate concern for Cleveland Brown fan that Baker may still first year and I just didn't waste but is not going to be as productive as it could be\nLaw I think that the one thing that's [laughter] that's a I think has to be looked at as we as the fence is not going to change that they're still going to play the same officer and\nUh with you know I think one of the underrated guys there that ah that that is going to be very involved in it as al ... a who's a senior assist out of his official title is that and that guy's going around the league forever heck I Can't remember Don base in St Louis I remember when he was the rams receivers coach\nHere in St Louis during the greatest show on tour and then he went to Kansas City\nThere were a meal when he came became the head coach and and he was the ... coordinator so he's pretty good offsets of coach so I I think that\nYou know they are still going to stay with that a fence\nOr they they have to improve the talent around Baker may feel that I think that's been one of the issue certainly the last few weeks with with some of the injuries they've had for the receivers but they they definitely have to upgrade that receiving corps which obviously is not going to happen\nThere this season so I I still believe that it was eight games or whatever experienced Baker make field is going to get is going to be a I think you know is going to be good for him to experience it the question is what happened to me is what happens next year\nAnd who are they going to get you know to run this off at ... and that's going to be the most important higher or that they do but I think John door she is going to be smart about it I mean one of the questions with the bears\nI saw this year was after you know a decent year last year and some pretty good growth uh I Wonder what would happen with Michel Trybulski by what now\nTo learning a new office and it's taken some time and he's had his rough rough spots but he's you know I think he's going to be fine in time and that happens with any young quarterback so I I think what what the browns have to concentrate on is getting that guy that they believe\nIs going to be there for the long haul offensively that can really with Baker may feel is development and so that's going to make for a very interesting search by John Dorsey in terms of who that next head coach is the one thing you wonder about is\nIs this the owners Jimmy has on his he is he just too involved in the\nI mean when you have a situation where the head coach um reports to the owner instead of the general manager then I'm not so sure that that's the best\nThe best way to run a football team so ah so we'll we'll we'll see how that all goes but it will it will also see the rest of the year whether whether they can you know show show some improvement and get some of these younger guys more involved especially in the past and getting\nOur goals are is our guest of the sports exchange you can follow Howard we're going to ... or seven to one\nAre you surprised by the timing of the move I Know that you Jackson was not exactly you know it's not doors these guy but did you get enough time I mean they didn't win a game last year and there are two and six talk schedule I think you could make the argument at the beginning of the season are you surprised at all by the timing of the moves and the fact that it was not only you Jackson but also it's not ...\nWell that that's the I think that was that that shows why this movie was made\nThat at that and and I say I I think you know huge huge acts and basically I think cost himself and tied Haley this job mainly with what Jackson said after the game or last week and I'm not saying that's why he got fired but\nAnd the and I think it was blown outta proportion or by the media to a degree because they kind of twisted in ... more put words in the ... Jackson's mouth no matter how much he tried to explain it but\nBy ... by saying anything about getting more involved in the sense he shined a you know not a flashlight but uh you know by the searchlight on this offsets\nAnd some of the issues they were having you know inside of Haley has a strong personality who ... Jackson's their strong personality and I think that the dysfunction there that was apparently going on behind the scenes between those two guys was what caused this move so no I don't think there was enough time and I think that\nWho knows things might have been different if those guys said that\nYou know I kept everything quiet and just work to continue to get better I don't know that this would have happened and that you can make the case you missed field you'll miss kicks in the first couple of games a horrible call against them against Oakland yeah they they ... they can be sitting here and I know every team loses says that but he went to these games they lost\nAll of a sudden there for three and one and send it to five and one and the whole field a team is totally different and if it was that was the record\nYour Jackson probably wouldn't have said what he said in frustration after the game or laps you know last week so I think all of those things led to this move to day\nAnd by doing it now you clear it out the ... you don't have all I think was having it that way probably would have hurt\nBaker may feel more for the rest of the year than what they'll be doing now and now he was John Dorsey a pretty good head start on not not so much putting together his list of head coach was not really a big getting up to speed on who he's interested in that can really move quickly once the season that\nSour balls or against or the sports exchange you can follow Howard work on Twitter each soldier Seventy one so I spent a decent amount of time on my show or this football season talking about teens\nWho don't necessarily have their guy on the terms of quarterback on the roster right now spent some time about the bills the jaguars or the New York giants should I start to put the Tampa Bay buccaneers on that list is Seamus Winston Tampa's guy moving forward\n[noise] this is where the night mad Harris SB Nation radio and on the radio that guy from the O'Reilly auto parts studios here's Matt Harris I\nThink it our goals for joining the show as always on the ... hour comes on or one of note for tonight uh college football playoff rankings are going to be coming out about a third of you here quickly there was no question I closed in Alabama is going to be there\nYou would be shocked if Notre Dame and LSU or not the other two teams that right I mean it's got to be those\nThere has to be so I Can't think of any are there are two things that solidified those spots\nYeah it's got to be those uh Alabama to touchdown favorite [noise]\nA little more than a touchdown favorite on the road again fellas you that is the opening line or coming up next hour we're going to do get sat wine as we always do on a Tuesday shows are going to look forward into the NFL season or the NFL schedule about yeah and if a Alabama\nOver to test has author wrote a death valley\nThat's how good they are over the night as spinach and radio [noise]\n\nNine forty W W for napkins and online at nine forty WMA W. dot com\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Richard cancer from\nThe federal magistrate in Miami ordered accused male bomber Caesar say are held without bail until it hearing on friday authorities say he may have had targets other than the prominent Democrats and other critics of President Trump who already received the apparent pipe bombs the FBI has compiled\nA list of names and addresses found in the possession of suspected male bombers Caesar sale the belief is these were people who was considering sending additional devices prior to his arrest FBI policy requires everyone on that list to be notified\nWe're told the list of names includes politicians media figures and celebrities ABC's Aaron ...\nPresident Trump will be taking on the duties of ... solar energy when he goes to Pittsburgh today in the wake up Saturday synagogue massacre but not everyone is happy about that trailers\nOne progressive Jewish group in Pittsburgh saying the president's not welcome it totally fully denounces white supremacy their response to that the White House and the president has repeatedly denounced bigotry and racism in all forms\nAnd Sarah Sanders said the president is going to Pittsburgh to show support for the Jewish community and she pointed out that the rabbi from the tree of life synagogue has said that he is welcome\nABC's Jonathan Karl ... one wait till mid term elections determine which political party will control Congress President Trump's going to be busy with\nPresident planning a nonstop campaign tour with just a week left to the midterms bill shore up Republican support in Florida, Missouri in West Virginia then over the weekend making stops in Montana Georgia Ohio and Indiana by election day the president will have held more than fifty rallies since he was sworn into office and even more fun ...

I have gone back and forth but this but the Steelers are still open I said I I think they're still open the trading levy on bill\nBut you know it's a tough one to me if you're Philly because once it's on the rookie deal they would have to be totally in when download if you want to sacrifice pets\nAnd probably defensive players down the road to acquire lazy and you cannot lay down it's going to be wanting an extension anyone of traits but have you on probably traits but have you on with the understanding that you're going to give way beyond the money so what\nTeam really is dying for running back I don't really know the answer to that question I don't think anybody is All right I Want to get to this other than that I stumbled upon with Howard\nWho which foreign fourteen has the best chance to win their division\nI think that all of these foreign four teams have really good shots to be honest ... excuse me not foreign forties five hundred teams Green Bay Packers they did it three three and one there in third place Vikings are for three and on bears or foreign three\nOkay the Philadelphia Eagles are foreign for Washington Redskins are five and two they are just a game and a half back and then the Baltimore Ravens therefore and for bangles or five and three and the Steelers are foreign to\nPower balls or said that the eagles have the best chance with the foreign for record I'm going to go with the Packers for what I saw what the Packers against the Los Angeles rams yesterday\nWas a team defensively now granted they did it two weeks to prepare for the rams but to stop they didn't stop the rams but they slowed down the ramp the rams twenty nine points it was a very quiet twenty nine it really was I thought the medically they did a fantastic job in that first have\nThey have the best quarterback in the division by far and usually when you have\nThe best quarterback you have a really good chance to win the division saints are up in the in the south they have the best quarterback ramps that the best quarterback in their division I go out there it's either a golfer either rush out to be honest I think if we're looking at a visually Russell Wilson is probably a little bit better than ... what's your adopt it all is working right there um\nWe'll look I'll tell you what I think the Packers defense showed something do you make time Montgomery survives the week to be honest I I I Can't he has got to be hated like despised in the locker room and we kinda got into a little a little bit yesterday but I I just I Can't see him like living until friday right\nNow may I read that he's already getting death threats to family what does he really yeah they're writing me on come on sports fans\nGet outta here and you got to stop that that's great [noise] this is in its porch then yeah what are you saying that it's a ... what is the fed and cared that much about one team that you're gonna set I mean that's a criminal act yeah yeah that's ridiculous\nMan ah but I I I don't know I mean that is pretty bad what he did disobeying a coach I'm going to go with the Packers who are you going to go with three or five hundred team was the best chance of winning the division I'm going to go with the Packers I don't believe in the Vikings really Vikings haven't really anybody Chicago Bears I don't believe in mental trip escape the ravens\nI'm ... I think the Steelers I thought I said this yesterday I think the Steelers are the best team in that division\nUm and and then uh who who's the other foreign for the the eagles I I like the red skins than I Do and the eagles to me are still have not prove that they're not going to be one dimensional all year long I wouldn't want the packets Packers eagles or raise that of those thirty three five hundred teams which is the best to win their division\nI'll go to the eagles I mean they've been there before they know what it takes to get to the playoffs and and when the super bowl\nI think they got what they tell you if they cross the winters back I made a run it by by committee that's what they're gonna have to do oh yeah yeah unless they go out there and get somebody that I get a ... court and are getting laid beyond bill\nI think they're going to work with and those will be the only two that I was working at it out yeah we're getting the White House I mean ... so I think they're good in the defense of solid against the jaguars in London but it is the day [laughter] but yeah I mean but I\nI think they they got what it takes I just I'm not a firm believer in the Redskins oh you're not\nJust yet neither neither really am I I I just at the end they played each other yet Redskins enables which is that it was going to be great games I mean 'cause the eagles here's the thing about the Redskins which I think is a it was a very underrated part about their team both of\nTheir lines are really really good offensive and defense if they win in the trenches talking about the giants how they don't win in the trenches in any game the Redskins when in the trenches like every single game they're not going to score a lot but they're not going to give up a lot of points so I think

you\n[noise] this is over the night with ... on in the nation radio made yeah back on\nThe ... years met Harrison and well the fact that you know but the night of the nation radio man here is that when you ... the major league baseball season with RJ Anderson we've had him on all season long you can follow our work on Twitter at ... or even more Jews work on what our heart or score Jay\nUnderscore Anderson by he works for CBS Sports major league baseball OK RJ or the red Sox the best teams just one of the world series right like we can look back and we can question some of these decisions when it comes to the Dodgers line up and Dave Roberts in a well matched and we're supposed to supposed to be here but the best team won the world series this year right\nYeah I tend to agree with the same on the world series\nAnd frankly you know I wasn't certain they were as good as the one hundred went eight wins during the regular season but they they easily this past the Yankees Astros and then the Dodgers and the post season and they believe this is one of the most impressive themes he's seen in recent memory and\nYou know it's a testament to that roster has no doubt score and the coaching staff and it's not meant to David and brown skin their front office just a really well stumbled theme and\nYou know they're not going anywhere there can be dangerous for years to come which is a scary thing for the rest of the major\n... let me ask you a a a hypothetical question here because I was having this discussion was somebody before game five ... like if this series ended in four games like let's say it was asleep and the red Sox won all those games who do you think would have won MVP ... and my point\nIs that the whole team was the MVP like you can't point out until tears see tears had that breakout performance in game five\nI mean could you have this is just a testament to how good they were and how much of a team effort was good you pointed out a legitimate and well number one person said this guy was the most valuable\nAt the end for games I think it would have went to ... an evil they because of his performance in game three you know assuming that we're not gay and we're probably talking about he bought a winning the envy the period\nRegardless of what the appearance dead or regardless of what David Price\nOf the historic because I mean even when they come out there because you know early ... games in a row and to give them you know they're strong ending the bullpen and not a thing and they ate the eighth inning of bear a that was a tremendous and it takes a lot about his\nYou know fell flip out as you know these companies are rewarded for this winter I mean this is a guy who decides to Tommy John surgery in the past and he's a free agent to be and you know he put his team above himself then hopefully you know teams don't punish them for that by being a little hesitant to offer him a multi year deal because of the injury concerns south\nOrange Anderson is our guest a staff writer for CBS Sports major league baseball you can follow our tastes work on Twitter at our underscore Jay underscore Anderson do you think Dave Roberts ah is taking too much heat for what has gone on regarding the decision making with the lineups\n... again I I don't really look at the situation is pinpointing blame on Los Angeles and losing I just put it as credit for Boston but look there's there there's all this question marks when it comes to like okay she bought into analytics and that was a major reason why are they the the lineups where ...\n... how do you think David Robertson like I don't even want to say just sort of get fired because I don't think he does how much blame the saying goes to the manager and Los Angeles so lost four out of five\nI think he is getting too much by him and I don't think they should be fired and you know the analytic buzz word that was prevail are all theories and all of these long and I think it's garbage straw man because I was or what was he the bench coach for last year\nHe is now right right literally just out of book wrote about how LA inclined they are and\nI Know I saw a tweet that the first part now of course hugged after he was done with this post game press conference was the red Sox analytics guy\nYou know the red Sox are and analytics they literally employed they'll James who is like you know the creator of slavery metrics but the idea that the red Sox aren't in the analytic you know it's just nonsense there were there Robert\nYou know you can point to line up and say you know that's analytics fault but the players play and the fact is dumping or did not come up with demand in foreign position until last night and you know the final game theory is that just goes to tell you\nHow you know why not struggled and you know knowing analytics or Germany than me and my child has a Dallas theories or that someone who's ever Dodger players struggled and I think you know it's really unfortunate that we were having this discussion you know this has become a topic\nUh ... you know that debate topic because if you look at the other side okay then the red Sox have lost the theory what are the\nAh our score follow the analytic fall them ... Martinez right we're pretty quiet until the last game now of course not you know\nBall sample sizes and the need to fill air and you know the so called face mix to save some wild things and Twitter this enables that all the more you know I don't get Robert should be fired and I don't think it's our fault because every team uses analytics to this point\nYeah ... is a very good scapegoat out of that that's a pretty good point let me let me ask you let me ask you this though is it fair to criticize save robbers for not playing what could potentially have been his best lineups early on in the series\nLaw I guess it depends on what we're talking about because\nYou know that as opposed to and have a team and you can make the case that maybe they should have done this or that but keep in mind\nYou know these teenagers nowadays have more data than we have publicly they're able to do things that frankly the public and to and you know Andrew Freedman ... to a top decision makers for the Dodgers and they come from Tampa Bay and open\nAnd you know who are the fifteenth whoever she is the most severe park and we have a ban Oakland and part of that because what they do analytically building their line of building the rosters so\nYou know we're literally talking about whether we know based on our limited information more than those guys do with her you know wealth of information beyond our public managers so you know you really get into the gray area when you start\nTrying to identify whether this is a good or bad and I'm not trying to take the buyout of it because obviously you know arguing about why not spend about ... and all is and should remain part of baseball but we have to remember you know\nRobert probably wasn't making these decisions based on the same data we have he was probably making these decisions based on more information that we can imagine and that doesn't necessarily mean that the citizens will work out it doesn't even necessarily mean that the citizens were the right call to go with\nYou know there can be all kinds of falls with algorithms and ... and what not but I'm just saying you know I don't think they Roberts was pointing out of the had the way Billie Mart needs to be I think a lot that went into these decisions and if I think we should respect that even if we disagree with the process and perhaps\nYou know where these decisions come from\n... to understand our guest staff writer for CBS Sports major league baseball you can follow our work on Twitter at ... ... you just hit on an important point them and and just made me think about something\nJust how much in terms of making the line up and you're around the game so how how much you're making a lot of it actually now a hundred percent the manager's decision like in other words do you think David Roberts had someone\nSo how how much you're making a lot of it actually now a hundred percent the manager's decision like in other words do you think David Roberts had someone in his ear from the analytics department saying you are going to do this in this game and David Roberts didn't have a choice how much time not just talking about what the Dodgers\nHow prevalent is that in baseball the analytics dice tallied the manager who to put into the line up on a day to day basis in baseball\nWell I think it varies by team I don't think any organization is necessarily going to tell their manager hey you must do that but I Do know that no managers\nReceive this information packet everyday and they're off my wind up sitting there and\nYou know if you're a manager you can obviously they have they uh okay I Know the guy that they want me to play today based on these numbers I Know he's under the weather so I Know that this production or you know this and now if this is not considering that so I'm not going to follow that you know some of these teams\nHave gotten to the point where they're actually trying to make the human element you know their health
