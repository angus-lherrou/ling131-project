roost Sunday night in full view of millions of American football fans no one can see cheaper linebacker ... speaks was afraid to tackle Tom Brady for fear of the NFL's whistle blowing vigilantes responding\nSpeech that pretty wrapped up in in his grass for sure that when he suddenly took his hands on a hands off policy here in the NFL's true anthem to me he's released me let me go and so he did\nHe thought the Brady at a mistake like that Brady hit throwing the ball and want to get flagged and find and everything else of course turned out to throw the ball Brady ran in for four yard touchdown\nIn a you know it was a pivotal playing a game that ended up forty three to forty and it was also something else it was focused on so many levels of boggles my mind\nThe absurdity of the length of the league is going to keep a a quarterbacks not only a price for pain free finding was exposed in my mind for the fire that has become an that play because all those efforts have now lead to players being afraid to tackle the quarter back\nYou know all those points all those passing yards all those records that are being supposedly set a there was phony is poor speaks his notion that Brady throwing the ball and and the reason a\nIt was just exposed when when one speaks reacted in the way he did he chose not to play football for fair for rest referee retribution\nAfter the game he said it was definitely on my mind and it sucks\nNow not everyone thinks delicate but to me that was the Gettysburg Address to football it sucks [laughter] you know speak says I'll finish to play next time but you know what you're not going to finish place next time because he knows this old men in business suits or law allowed Hawaiian goose if they're in Palm Beach\nWe're going to come up with these kinds of rules to punish the taxes now Davis once famously said quarterback must go down and he must go down hot\nToday Roger Goodell says the court must go on touch they must go on touch all game that's what we become\nThat it's focused on camera so why hasn't the NFL made it in the grass point of fishing emphasis in the grass gives speaks a sack you don't want him to go down low whistle while they're standing in the grass\nWell that's very easy to explain why they have done that 'cause it's a good idea [laughter]\nHey I anyway Ron I Love the pleaser leaves me let me go thank you ...

New York I'm thirty one carry her eighty five yard and found some for\nIt was a Nineteen sixty two NFL Championship in New York I'm\nThirty one carries for eighty five yards doesn't sound apart for those had to be\nThe hardest earned eighty five yards in the history of football I think um it was just a brutally cold day\nGuys who played in that game of told me they lose cold as they were in the ice ball or I can still remember watching the game and the swirling wind is blowing the hotdog wrappers around the turf of Yankee Stadium to feel it was about as hard as concrete\nThe giants after being beaten thirty seven nothing new here before and the championship game were sky high\nAnd they just didn't they had a great defense and flip through\nAn unbelievable amount of pain and\nOwning I'm Taylor and we just started easily could have been the MVP of that ... ... he was and interestingly built forest or was he was a four time pro bowl picky was captain of the ... census\nThat year as well several others but he told me that they want to because he recovered to foremost do forester told me he didn't recovery either from\nOr\nHe was the fall back on the pun coverage you went down and the first formal the guy didn't fumble he stole the ball from so he didn't want to blame for that to handle the ball for to niche que they were coming up from the ... under you know there are piling the demands of bodies\nAnd many later in the game the same thing happened before is Greg Nycz he grabbed the ball from him and said hey I Want to win the car so we use credit to follow\nThe guy was\nWell you know and we played in an era where he was overshadowed by another great players now the going back to the gym brown now which is easy to do because of course has overshadowed by Jim Brown but I've been somebody once said and I quote Jim Brown will give you that lady but then you can't get away from you\nIn jail or it will give it to you and then ran through your chest unquote\nThat was pretty I could just wasn't it\nYeah you ran on command possess a he was as tough as they come more than the biggest fall backwards fastest full back but uh he was tough to tackle great balance um just\nOutstanding determination and you're right that's part of his legacy he was overshadowed in many ways why Jim Brown when the rushing title eight or nine years and\nTaylor had those homes that run five straight years we've surpassed a thousand yards when there was something special and finished second to brown I'm\nOne eight hundred eight nine three three three two one

have no idea what they were just kinda gone ... thank you thank you very much\nYeah no I did see that it was funny you're right uh you know it's all those kind of instructional in a way you know out of context most football players even all the famous or just some big guys look like you know\nFairly ... truck drivers you know and I guess because the equipment makes them invisible you don't like boxing or basketball where you planning your underwear and everybody can see it even baseball as they can see your face but uh you know with the with a face mask and and all of that or\nI can understand where you you know you wouldn't now you would think at some point they might have had a little ... guys kind of pretty big be a\nGuy that the whole thing don't you think but uh but yeah it was funny and it was it's kind of a cool thing I guess I'd done it a couple\nOf times what's kind of like when we walked at all [laughter]\nYeah well they don't use I say what do you go to school so we were supposed to slap easier with Mr\nRiccardo will be signing autographs at five o'clock in the ... while my driver's going to be honest with you will shield out of uniform wandering off and can I I'm not sure I'd be able to recognize it sort of reminds me of that sort of like ... or\n... years ago when you're looking for training recorded that guy or maybe a wide receiver Patrick you're looking for the right here\nBy the guard a let me check to see if I've got 'em or where I have a lot on I ...\nI remember I Love than when he said but he says the guy but he's in the hall of fame the guy said I don't care what holiday would it be the guy he's in the\nDrama [laughter] when you're done\nThere are plenty of guard and tackled him up but I'm just about any off into Fifteen of them on this year is eliminate the ballot and we got those ballots in the mail I think it was about a week ago ten days ago anyway and it been asked to return them by I think it's October twenty second which is next week\nSo I'm just wondering has either of you sent your ballot and goes to the centers no\nPlan to send in on friday I'm Still working through a couple of positions in the sense of why\nI have already said mind in twenty five votes for title off actually buys loaded with\nThe defensive players and a and a bunch of new mates I think we got to get civilians\nAre ... that I I haven't set mine in a price and then Thursday or friday as well but I'm not going to ask you guys to reveal your choices but I Will ask you this how difficult is this process you I mean we're willing a list of a hundred and two names or I guess it's a hundred and three cents a nickel Lowry was left off of it and it certainly but now is on us\nYou know what will you know what are his chances that come on and it went to went to Dartmouth College five and a baby in any way we're willing that list down to twenty five semi finalist and\nThat's not easy [laughter]\nNo no no it's it's tough you write a but they're still I think a lot of guys on that a hundred and two men list that you know don't really pay more than three hundred sorry Lowery I've played a but but that's the you know don't really belong in the hall of fame you know they belong in any list of all the hundred and two good football players for sure so I I don't have that much I mean there's still\nMore guys in twenty five guys no question about that but for me it it it gets difficult after we do this one for twenty five to Fifteen is much harder than the fifteenth the final five or six is so painful it it's like having a kidney stone every super\nBowl you know like Ryan it's difficult because I'm always conscious more the players who have never been to the Romans finally how many times we sit on this show in our Web sites that\nJust kind of has been I was over twenty five thirty or forty years and he's never been a final yeah I don't just rubber stamp guys who were finals the previous year I look at some parents who have never been in the room and try to include healthy numbers those guys were twenty five\nWell I'm Glad you mentioned that because that leads me my next question you've been doing this [noise] excuse me for a long time and you are of course\nDr your data and we talked about ... nickname that's a good one does the data that it was great you came up with your data anyway do you have a philosophy or or game plan to adhere to when you're doing your annual cut downs for from Detroit limited less to the list of twenty five percent mythos\nSure I was started back developed since ... almost fifty seven percent of all players hall of fame for trying to their office only twenty eight percent ...\nIn the game the modern era forty nine percent of the Chinese put often thirty three per cent play defense or never been a strike any kind of balance if we start or shall we start looking harder at the war the defense of Ken ... I'll I'll always check off to war the number of players on the defensive side before I even look at the office aside\nMy belt will always be having a decent\nRod did you hear that he's from the back of the list starts with defense last time I checked tie law play defense\nSec or right and I'll bring that up probably thirty or forty four times between now in the valley spent the last page of the defense of players would it\nBe like well OK which position I'll start with Iraq what physician historically gives you the most trouble or is the most difficult to sore throat and we have a ton of offensive lineman spending Fifteen but we have a lot of them but which position gives you the most troubled typically when you're going from uh the pull in Maryland to the the semi ...\nWell I think the ones with no staff to take the most you know kind of outside research and that includes a off into the linemen and injure a defensive line before the most part expensive to Apple's nose tackle I'm ... and even Strunk side may strokes eighties uh\nBecause they are really into business with math in big numbers I'm now going forward though I think it's going to be a different problem I think the problem is the hardest problem could be a value in these quarterbacks and wide receivers in with these with these funny money\nInflated ... yeah I mean it's like every receivers degrees receive and history because look he got ten thousand balls you know it's it's it's it's it's\nIt's a it's a interesting fact I looked up when you place a value on four thousand ... in the season you would think you would then the fourteen game you're only one guy ever did it Joan Amos last year eight guys did that twenty five percent of the leak match shot has done it oh did it three times match\nUp three times more than Joe name for God Almighty and also that's ... that's going to be tough to say what gives you what did they give you know I I Would\nSay defensive back you know we're always in a rush to like ... Bronson in trying wide receivers but there's never a sense of urgency to try to the beach you know we've been trying twice as many wide receivers has we have corner max\nHas the competition on the field that out of whack over the years how come Eric Allen has never been to find out what Louis ... Bobby bought and why are we waiting to try and title off quarterbacks have never gotten a fair shake and everyone\nWho's raises a good point that last last point to be very good point why are we waiting who presented who's present well it was\nPart of the list\nUm okay well we have I think\nLeast a couple of guys you guys in their last year the eligibility on this list including\nFormer Atlanta star might can and he is also a friend of the show now he hasn't been a final before but a year ago neither had cornerback some walls\nAnd largely through this program and I think ... your efforts um he got the votes to make it to the final Fifteen now you guys think there's any chance of that happening but\nYour efforts um he got the votes to make it to the final Fifteen now you guys think there's any chance of that happening with my can or anyone else goes you've seen the left\nI Would hope can get to look I Would hope ... gets left I Would hope where it's from Web gets ... that would hope of course gets a look I was wrong it's all up\nEvery one of those guys were going to say on the twenty fourth here you know this was his last year he's never been to a room you know there's never a shortage of candidates that also have to tackle about because it is his last year my cat will be on my balance [noise]\n... okay well Ron we say this is your twenty four year you've always been in the room like what do you get into what are you going to do with it I mean is there anyone in that lets you see the Emmy Ken did you think he's got a shot\nI don't really uh which is not famous sayings that deserves a warm a what\nA in fact I Would tend to vote for a job before some of these guys that have already been in the room even though some people think it's all going to a coronation for all these but I think his problem is going to be you've got a a number of those off had said well I'm as of last year and a lot of guys automatically\nCarry them into I think they should just not star on the ballot guys who were there last year because you have these guys wouldn't remember [laughter]\nCoordinating care for fiction when it comes back and tells me that what we did for them has how they're feeling better probably in the ... part of our God we really people and know that what we're doing makes a difference to\nFind out more about Dr Jennifer winter\nFort healthcare dot com\nFor [noise]\nYou can get the latest news headlines every morning and your inbox by signing up more than double you every W morning news opting\nLog on to nine forty W.

I mean they look like Thirteen runners on base unbelievable yeah\nNo they they definitely did and look at a ... tough to do as a fan of a team that loses a playoff game is to give credit to the other team\nI think you've got to do that with Boston here because this is the ... and and they were saying on the broadcast throughout the entire Yankees theories and they were saying on the broadcast throughout the entire game it debt five thousand paper cuts then that's what the botnet right how do they just single after single hit after hit\nThat is what the Red Sox do there is a reason why they won over a hundred games this year and I'll tell you what Jackie Bradley junior for the second game and the series gets the big hit the gigantic home run\nAnd look the red Sox\nBut it's good ... they just find a way to win games probably we've been doing the around the baseball bit all regular season okay and I feel like this I feel like a broken record when I talk about the red Sox they find ways to win baseball games and I'll tell you what that was\nIt it's really not at this credit what happen tonight is not at this credit to the Astros it's just a great baseball game it was a great major league baseball playoff game and one team had to win one team had to lose\nAnd tonight it turned out the red Sox won the game okay when we come back we'll talk more baseball will get deeper into the theories and then of course we'll talk Dodgers quake Kirsch all getting the job done today just overnight SB Nation radio [noise]\nIs Ben Ben is he put balls don't care if you're asking me what's going on in Philadelphia I don't know I don't even think Doug Peterson noticed we thought gee a dry heat injury might be good to clear up the fantasy back deals but I don't think it does any good at all\nYou still got for include Mac you still got when Dale small word when does their role is going to become a factor because you know that Doug Peterson likes him and Josh Adams the rookie ought to Notre Dame is he going to get caught you we just don't know how this thing is going to shake out levy on bell is not going to be an option we heard that [noise]\nBut we're hearing rumblings that the eagles have reached out to the bills for was showing McCoy a thirty year old running back out into that just absolutely Oscar above ...

overnight SB Nation radio Matt Harris back with us jumping through your fantasy football weekend with sub zero roast beef that fantasy football so right here on SB Nation radio every single Tuesday nights we have 'em on every week you can follow Christmas work on work at the end of the art Chris\nYou're on SB Nation radio every single Tuesday nights we have 'em on every week you can follow Christmas work on Twitter at the end times aren't Chris\nAn interesting question here for you I think the start because these the London games I never really know how\nThe players are going to perform on the team they should look I'm looking at this game and I was first of all I thought the chargers that minus six and a half was really interesting because I think the charges are way better than Tennessee but as a friend explained to me the chargers are basically playing this game at five\nAM their body clock time like this is literally like that that's one of the game starts so\nMelvin Gordon here blasts off for three touchdowns last week I think the chargers off fences rolling on all cylinders\nBut these chargers are offensive players when it comes to playing in London this week Tennessee's a stout beef in it you know they've been out at times but can we expect Melvin Gordon and Tyrone Williams Keenan Allen all these guys who have been rolling well for the charges offensively do you think we can expect a similar performance against the Tennessee Titans team that it's lack a little bit recently\nI don't I don't think you can expect the same with the passing game that they saw because right now it seems like everybody's catching the browns have just the right time Melvin Gordon you mentioned the Eighteen Russia's one hundred and thirty two yards three touchdowns caught two out of four targets\nThey're going to rely on him quite a bit and as much as I was in a real big fan of Philip Rivers last week\nI'm not a real big fan of him this week because you've got bored and you got a clear\nHe only attempt to twenty passes against the brown it that's it and you know the titans for as many problems if they had often simply they only allow Seventeen Seventeen points per game show\nA filling rivers as a low ending starting option this week but Melvin Gordon you can fire up as a low an RV one but the rest of the passing game there's buyer beware\nWhen it comes to R B one's already too is I think what it's going to happen in New Orleans is very very interesting moving forward to mark and groom Alvin Kamara\nI think both of them take a little bit of a decline this week simply because they're on the road against the ravens but talk about this week if you have come are on your team in ... and talk a little bit about down the road how do you think the same for going to work in ... and ... and based on what you know obviously come are as more of a veiled all out of the past\nAnd gave us this week in moving forward should be worried if you own increments ... simply because of the splits Harry's\n[laughter] I don't think so we saw last year that the saints were able to work on both men and I understand there might have been a little bit of panic because of the the nine touches ... in the game against Washington\nIngram I think is a real threat to the high end R B one status but he still definitely a in the in the R B one conversation you might be looking at maybe a a sixty to forty times share when it's all said and done\nI think coming out of the coming out of the buying and you mentioned the game that they got against Baltimore Baltimore is an absolutely fantastic defense\nMark Ingram also catches the ball really well out of the backfield so these guys are are very much interchangeable I mean you know mark heroin had fifty six catches last year the Alvin ... you know obviously with the eighty one is more of a featured back but\nYour income and ... they're interchangeable you're looking at\nThe outcome era with a little bit more outside but maybe a ... year looking at our be one maybe not elite like he did before but anger is a very high RV too for the rest of the air\nChris ... is our guest host of that fantasy football so right here on this network every single Tuesday night you can follow all of Christmas work on Twitter at the end of\nThis is a great time of year obviously in terms of fantasy football because we now start to really understand consistency and so I'll ask you this you know when it comes to the San Francisco forty niners I have CJ ... and\nI have more peace good west and I actually think there's a from running on a network about that but look we expect both of those specifically mark he's the one I drafted Markey's good within my fantasy league that obviously\nNot because I thought that was going to be throwing so I thought it was the ... the government gets hurt it's beginning to your he comes back last week and a two touchdowns and we expect that consistency with\nGood when I tried that in the fourth round and I and I think a lot of listeners out there are probably in that same boat fourth or fifth round with good with but when it comes to good when a bastard or is that can actually do you think going to be they're moving forward\nI think it is I think the problem that we saw this year is he got hurt in game one and the second quarter against Minnesota with back on and didn't get any receptions but then you know slowly worked his way and three cats just to catch just for catches\nBut he's got the ability Matt to to get down the field and take top off defense when he's healthy he can run by almost anybody in the NFL so\nIf he was picked if he were dropped he needs to be picked up immediately because I think he's he's not nobody in that office right now\nA save Matt Brita is a consistent fantasy starter may be a great cattle a low in tight and one depending on the match up\nBut ed Markey's Goodwin is a he's a nice wide receiver three you you might not get the two touchdowns every week but you've got a chance that he shouldn't be a target monster and not often now that he's fully healthy\nWho do you think are going to be some of the bigger fantasy football players that come out of the patriots and the bears game honestly I'm not quite sure what to think of the bears in terms of their defense because they've been so good up to the point of last\nWeek when ... why would beat them so if I'm sitting there with let's say a Josh Gordon or one of these ah or I I think obviously a play out of an ... but\nBut the bears on the on that side of the ... you know you're busy took a step back last week\nIf I were to ask you to rank the top skilled players in that game not just the bears that have patriots who do you think there'll be\nWell I think obviously number one you're looking at Tom Brady that's that's kind of a no brainer number two I'm going to go Sony Michel because you look at the patriots and how they're using him you know\nGot twenty plus carries two out of the last three weeks and his lowest output Matt and has been Ninety eight yards that was last week against the Indianapolis he scored\n... scored and three consecutive weeks which I think or maybe not Brita and David Johnson might be the only other two you know Smith as well from the falcon and David Johnson I think of and the only other running backs just born three consecutive games so I Love Brady show\nA jury Cohen as well because Cohen's been getting a lot more he he's almost a planting Jordan Howard as the top off into an option in that are ... ... ...\nBut I think you've got that and then maybe Trey Burton but I really I really like I I see some holes right now and that Chicago defense\nUh and uh they got some injuries including a little Mac who I don't know if he's going to be completely healthy come\nYeah last I heard a is that they're they're monitoring the ankle so who knows what I mean at that point is it's questionable right now\nChris ... is our guest host of that fantasy football so every single Tuesday night right here on this network you can follow Christ is working on Twitter at the um tubs so as I was preparing for this Chris I saw a very interesting set up a couple of articles that I've been reading have people wanting to sit\nOr you can follow Christmas work on Twitter at the um tubs so as I was preparing for the scripts I saw a very interesting set up a couple of articles that I've been reading have people wanting to sit to marry is Thomas the number one wide receiver for the Denver Broncos because he's going up against the Arizona Cardinals doubt you'd say oh the Arizona Cardinals have won when\nBut hey they have Patrick Peterson who's a shutdown cornerback\nThe cardinals have allowed eighty plus your sitters three receivers through six games this season their defense isn't that bad but would you agree if you have let's say a a normal ... wide receivers three or borderline wide receiver to option on your bench\nMaybe with a good match up if you're sitting there with the various Thomas ... Patrick Peterson would you'd bench some areas Thomas could you do that [laughter] I Would\nHave a real hard time banking dumb areas Thomas ... and I think that's almost a byproduct of how bad a case keen um has been so far you know one thing and and one of those receivers to consider that um the on who is just on a ridiculous pays right now so far so if you throw that out\nI'm Still not completely sold on that Arizona secondary Emanuel Sanders really works more into what case Kim likes to do you know he had ten targets last week the standards that you know for a hundred fifty yards and touched down\nSlapped the gloves shut that was my interpretation of it however the rule letter of the law says that a ban has the right to do that\nApparently is move the bet the glove is passed a field of play which it look like according to the picture that I've seen it clearly was so I I don't\nI you know it was a judgment call up it was a very fifty fifty play they went out and reviewed it

Mac is showing the early signs of a Lawrence Taylor and taking nothing away from Lawrence Taylor Korea I'm simply saying I see similarities in terms of what they could do and where ... you can go and buy all the way also\n... Mac you have to take it to the fact the off the field president said he has as well I mean ... ... again he set a precedent when he came into bears camp\nAnd he put a football and men feel he started literally started a tradition and bears practice he put a football field and said okay defense\nFirst one of the football wins now what is it really mean first of all of the football wins what does it mean it means is starting a competition within practice so clear Mac is getting his bears defense you know a whole different mindset now I Know last week data and good luck good against Miami\nBut I I did the Chicago is event has drastically improve and it's again ... Mac is just one guy\nHe can only do certain things I'm Talking about the things that he does to affect the rest of the defense that is also going into this debate because Lawrence Taylor did things that affected the rest of the defense okay they had to double team hits here just his intensity got everybody going you know\nSo Bobby you could tell me while I'm Crazy now okay let me make one more point\nOkay if I can sit here I Do believe I could sit here and say okay Patrick bought homes is showing signs of Brett Farr and Aaron Rodgers I'm not saying that he is Brett Farr Moran Rogers that'd be dumped\nThose two guys have accomplished more in their careers because their careers have been longer again I go back this is very similar to the liberal Michael argument okay yeah Michael has more rights that brought us and finished his career yeah\nLet's see you up but to say that they are similar and they have similar trade and they affect their teams in similar ways I'd probably be now tell me why I'm wrong\nBecause I think that the reporter did not have a terrible question by saying youth coach guys like Lawrence Taylor that St Lawrence Taylor that that ... is better than want tailor all she's saying is I see the comparison the dots could connect if you were to try and make that argument which I just laid out yeah\nYeah I I see what the reporter was saying uh basically she's not saying that\n... that I didn't want to you know I mean ... you know as far as the past Russia goes that's who are these young guys put their game out yeah you know so I understand what she was saying they are I guess she could have waited a tad bit better 'cause you know bill but let's say he heard Lawrence Taylor here that might\nPlay one more time he's not because of course he coached Lawrence Taylor\nAre women some of us to\nDo some ... some\nSort of ...\nOr something that were lost so\nYeah so these are the respect you want me to show respect for Marshall fucking again it's got nothing to do with showing disrespect for Lawrence Taylor Marshall fog I just really look at it as a one way street all I'm doing is giving a compliment to Todd girly and college math to say hey I see some of these guys and you\nKnow I mean you know and you could see Baird Thomas the late great big Thomas Kansas City chiefs include them at the way he gets the parents rush so I I mean it's it's multiple players ... game for ... style and you know he got great hands he could pick out the balls we want it to so I mean I'm Glad I could see similarities to\nThat the reporter also asked that question because she knew that he coached Lawrence Taylor and so he episode yeah so she knew\nThat he that that that that he could really given accurate he should what you want it was an accurate and she was genuinely curious okay setting this ... this was a bill bell jak really being you know like angrier and they say this was all in good fun\nBut I just thought it was interesting his reaction like hitting these old especially these older coaches they are very very quick to say hey we I Know we have some good young players right now in this leak\nAnd will play some sound coming up later on the show where we're Roger Goodell talking about the good young players in the league will play that later\nBut uh you know when we're talking about these legends but ... off the gas a little bit hard when we come back we'll get back some of these major league baseball playoffs hey Clayton courage Shaw he gets the job done over the night\nThat they should have I don't know why I don't like the day he was so would you say this is like nails on a ...

to go play actually no excuse me I came as in Arizona isn't it that will be in Arizona Denver Broncos going on the road or the end that's the problem is I think\nI was like one and a half point favorites in the game and one of the reasons is because that Denver is there one in eight or one in nine or something like that I think on the road\nOn her head coach Vance Joseph that's disgraceful I I I'm very curious what do you have to say because Democrat I mean those are kind of too depressing teams right there that's not going to be a good football game although it's kind of an intriguing football game right I mean case here's a here's a question\nFor your body okay if the Broncos lose that game on the road we already know by the Vance Joseph meter in Denver is about to run out\nIf they lose this game in Arizona What are the chances you put at him get firing fire in the middle of the season middle of the season I don't talk about the I think that his chances are ... they're going to go stick content I might go five eleven oh yeah yeah I mean ... if they lose the Arizona was one in five middle of the season that can be the first middle of the season poaching firing of it\nYet but like I told Alex we talked about this earlier tonight and I was just saying I still think it will be later on in the season before\nThat saying right out right and you know he was there

Thursday Night Football Broncos on the road taking on the cardinals Tim Lynch is our guest is managing editor for mile high report which is the sb\nNation page for the Denver Broncos you can follow him to work on Twitter at him ledge Nineteen Seventy a night game last\nWeek against the rams however it wasn't really fight in the first half\nHow would you value wait a decade team's performance up to this point overall\nA pretty pretty disappointing but to be expected a yet a career here last year with the Vikings and you know if if you're being realistic a he's probably going to regret the mean\nHum and he did he has so uh is more interceptions in touch downs and is really struggling the red zone um so that's been been quite a disappointment for ...\nWhat were your thoughts when they got case Qena because obviously the Broncos could have gone in a number of different directions to quarterback situation last year was without a doubt disappointing there are thoughts of causes there are thoughts of maybe teddy Bridgewater there were a bunch of options when it was decided that the Broncos were going to go skiing what were your thoughts\nI mean underwhelming uh they just didn't have the money to compete for her cousins and it really seemed like he made up his mind any way hum and after two years of Trevor sent me and I mean\nYou could have taken any backup and the league and and ... probably would have been have\nYou know if you look at the the whole landscape I mean case keen them is is not the worst quarterback he's not the best thing there is just not a whole lot of options out there and anti Bridgewater is kind of coming off that injury yeah kind of an unknown I don't think the Broncos are ready to risk you know after two years of just\nUnsuccessful quarterback play with the are ready to kick that kind of risk\nYeah no doubt about it too much is our guest a managing editor for mile high report which is the Denver Broncos SB Nation page you could follow temp work on Twitter at ... Nineteen Seventy eight I'm always curious when it comes to like the fan bases of certain teams when it comes to your readers and just Denver Broncos fans in general\nIs there this sense that maybe we're I don't I Want to say wasting but we could be doing better with I mean honestly the Broncos up to the vet or wide receivers combinations in the league when it comes to Emanuel standards and\nDumb areas Thomas too pretty solid running back we'll get to but among the fan base is there the thought of oh we're wasting the prime possibly at the manual standards of dumb areas Thomas who are really really good wide receivers\n[laughter] yeah I think I think more ... more for the defense um you know Chris hairs junior a clown Miller are we wasting their prime I'm you know that championship defense of two dollars and Fifteen and says really tanked and\nYou know there's there's a window that's that's close to I mean we were we we we hope it's not close but I at this point\nWith with another quarterback situation that's disappointing um you just don't feel like they're going to turn things around there's going to be some big changes in Denver either in the middle of this year or come January\nWhat are you're predicting some of those big changes will be\nI think I think that shows was done um you know I don't obviously is still the head coach hum but he's not able to turn things around now we've got the the run defense which ranked first overall in the NFL last year\nGiving up the most jars and a two week period in NFL history so that's that's quite a collapse I'm In the in the rumor is is you know France Joseph has been um helping Joe would call the play is the last couple of weeks and so that's\nYou know that's that's pretty telling so um there's just there's going to be a lot of changes John Elway he's getting a lot of criticism and you know he's not known for his patients hum and his competitive drive to win games is obviously not being fulfilled so\nThose big changes are are coming into coaching staff and I'm pretty sure they're going to keep looking for that quarterback\nTim Lynch is our guest managing editor for mile high report you can follow Tim's work on Twitter at him lynched Nineteen Seventy eight can you remind me and my audience the background of Vance Joseph where did he come from what were his strengths why would the higher there because\nYou know I think you could make an argument that it you know ... there are certain coaches who has elevated quarterbacks careers obviously San ... they is this is a special one when it comes to elevating a guy like Jared golf but ... is a you know definitely elevated pace scheme them they're just different coaches around the league who have\nElevated the quarterback play rex Ryan for example is not one of those sides could work with a quarter back in New York to work I was a quarterback in Buffalo so when it comes to the ... della ... of quarterback for Denver over the past\nCouple of years I guess I'm asking is Vance Joseph the primary person to blame amongst Broncos fan\nI mean he was kind of given\nKnow a beat up old Chevy pickup instead of a a Ferrari a quarter back you know so I don't think there was much development to make out of either Paxton land short Trevor sent me an so it can't really blame him for [noise]\nFor that situation I think we're disappointed me the most was a case keen I'm coming in here they had a great training camp you he looks the part he looked like he could actually be a functional quarterback you know he's not gonna be elite but he's going to be\nThe kind of quarter back to this team has been desperate for since Peyton Manning left\nAnd weak one he came out he was aggressive pushing the ball down the field they they were scoring points you know buddy\nAnd he laughed and weak one he came out he was aggressive pushing the ball down the field there there were ... points you know but he had three interceptions and it just feels like the coaching staff are just\nSo worried about the interceptions that they they kind of coached case keen them into becoming Trevor simian in and it's just\nIt's mind boggling but it's it's frustrating and and I think the problem that I'm seeing with with Vance Joseph is that he's not I think he's worried about losing his job and and that's playing into the reactionary kind of coaching that that's going on here\nUm and it's frustrating for fans so you know that's that's all bad mixture of of of a of a situation that's that was not going in the right direction this team to win and then he multiple when and if they're going to rebound here and and I just don't feel like that's going to happen\nBefore we get to the game coming up tonight let's turn to positively I think the running game how may not last week against the rams\nBut Philip Lindsay and Roy screaming I think I've done a relatively decent job did you anticipate to split carries that were pretty much the same between Roy three minutes they'll Lindsay was announced the beginning of the year that boy screaming at one of the jobs bill of Lindsey pitching it did you anticipate this ratio in terms of carries between Wednesday and bring it\nUh yeah actually I expected Roy screaming to get more carries a which hasn't happened but\nYou know those those two guys came into camp and we're just electric the veterans like crosshairs junior talking about how how great you know ... he's going to be and\nYou know if those guys are seeing that it's it's legit you know there there are pros or they're all pro guys they know what they're looking at so um it's pretty exciting for those guys come in I think that the frustrating part is is the the Broncos are calling Seventy percent passes and thirty percent runs right now and\nJust not seeing enough of them um I think Roy screaming hasn't had more than ten touches but maybe two games so far so [noise]\nUm if ... to see more of them that'd be great because they're the Broncos rushing attack is one of the leaders in ... yards per Kerry and [noise] you know I think that's the success or the recipe for success in for this off into just to run the ball and and that's just not happening right now\nTotally agree they average five point three yards the Kerry and I'm looking at the SAT now Philip Lindsey sixty one yardstick or six years the three and a forty six yards fifty a hundred Seventy two years so let's say the average than\nYou would say look the Denver Broncos are a running team\nDo you think when it comes to the Broncos off and it just overall it\nDoes it come down to they just don't really have an identity they don't really know who they are or you know it's funny I was talking to an eagle reporter a couple of weeks ago when I was asking the same thing why is it still one dimensional why so many passes for Philadelphia and he told me look scoreboard the eagles have been behind and a lot of games\nDo you think that's more of it why do you think that that's the case that they'd be identity has not been quite found yet\nFrom ... who first of all had to get to the ball was unbelievable unbelievably fast getting to the ball down the line fired a strike in a second base and attack was tag was placed on Tony count\nAll three of those outfielders gigantic place for the red Sox and if they do in the world series those are the moments you always have your Astros had Bobby\nEvery whenever you want a World Series you have moments that you can look to over the course of that right and say wow wow on real way\nTo

I always thought it would be interesting when it came to Carmelo\nBecause Carmelo Anthony it told us after they lose to Utah the Oklahoma City thunder do last year he said look\nI'm not coming off the bench venture all that stuff for me so he talks to his good friend Chris Paul and Paul said hey man look where you are in your career come over here you can win a championship but you might have to ... office I'm not coming off the bench thing that will be something to watch us production moving forward\nMore that should not have been fan interference\nI don't think it should have been a fan interference and yeah I Believe that they should have been a home run I mean he didn't the fan then recharge your base that off of how the rules\nWere out of ... so yeah I feel like that they should have been over that natural owned by a car to anything I Know you're not well that's why I'm asking should have been All right I mean the fan then reach out and play and try to take it from ... John and apply and you know and they saying that\nHe closed ... gloves but when he went up his blues clues yo what was it kind of want to clone though no\nMilk Bobby Bobby go back and look at the replay I disagree with you there okay I remember the play as ... glove go back and watch them play okay as he is going\nUp and this is going to be very tough to convince them to do this on radio but as as I Am too because this is a very visible thing but as I recall\n... the glove was open as he was going to make the play as any competent outfielder would do the glove was open and then as he made contact with a fan\nThe glove began the calls and simultaneously the ball arrived\nThat's how I looked at that point but again I I you can make the argument that okay look the rule says that because he was the result was done out of play there is no fan interfered Stefan never came into play and interfered with the play\nThat's what the Astros fan would say are you watching the play right now\nYeah I'm watching the play okay so what do you see the movie is going to the glove open ended\nAnd then when does it ... does it take contact from the fan for it to cause I\nI don't think so I don't think so or is that I'm looking at are now\nSo you have a hand like closer glove like they're like I I don't see yeah\nSo you're you're so you're oh you're saying ... so you're saying\nI I Can't see so you're saying that move key ... early on like too early closest ... before the ...\nIs the so he missed timed either the jump or he missed time he didn't have good enough hand eye coordination which I'm not disagree I'm not like sarcastically playing along with us is that's truly what you see the maybe I'm wrong but as I recall I'm not I don't have time to go and look at this right now but as I remember looking at it to me I saw the contact and the argument against\nIt being fan interference would be that all this was that outside of the field of play\nIt was done in the fence but then again you're you're taking away the definition of award robbing a home run [noise] [noise]\nYeah yeah I I mean we're looking at her I said\nTo me he was not allowed to Rob a home run that's my base to point here he was not allowed to Rob a home run\nAnd and maybe you're saying that they're probably I don't know they went to review they they they they were reviewing the safe by the way this was a long review I I I just I think it's close enough to the point where you have to go with the call on the feel good about it\nAnd according to mark ... of Fox two and a six year yeah what does he have to say I got the a quote from ... ... ah he would've caught a he's a hundred percent positive he was going to catch that ... that's just it wasn't for the\nThat's what I saw it too and you look there's no way to guarantee he would've caught it obvious look obviously but the best is going to say that but I ...\nIt wasn't for the and that's what I saw it too and you look there's no way to guarantee he would've caught it obvious look obviously will be best is going to say that\nBut I Believe it\nBased off of what I saw the replay All right well let's get an ... that's a controversial play if you're just getting on the road right now that will be the main topic for tomorrow but in terms of this series Red Sox up three to one Boston is just the team set in the first hour say it again death by a thousand paper cuts they are just\nHit after hit timely hit at the time that's the key the key in this game okay the Astros fan can talk about that they can talk about that play but here's the stat twelve guys was it left on base today for the Astros twelve I Know it was double digit\nThe red Sox in the post season with runners on base or hitting three eighty six\nThree eighty six that's what you got to do to win in the play offs and the red Sox are doing it they came up with just the timely it meant that Jackie Bradley junior man I'm telling you either nine hitter he's nine hitter and it's just\nThis is what the they remind me the Boston Red Sox this year they remind me of what the Astros were\nLast year a role liable batting order in terms of deaths one through

way the team that won took advantage of more opportunities that were put in front of it and that's why they won the game eight to ... there's a reason that they want a hundred games this year there is

Nation radio Matt Harris back with you jump into your fantasy football weekend with Chris tub Z roast beef that fantasy football so right here on SB Nation radio every single Tuesday nights we have 'em on every week you can follow Christmas work on Twitter at the end\nTimes aren't Chris I\nI have an interesting question here for you I think this dark because the London games I never really know how the players are going to perform at the tea they should look I'm looking at this game and I was first of all I thought the chargers at minus six and a half\nWas just really interesting because I think the chargers are way better than Tennessee but as a friend explained to me the chargers are basically playing this game at\nFive AM their body clock time like it it literally like that that's one of the game starts so Melvin Gordon here blast off her three touchdowns last week I think the chargers often just rolling on all cylinders\nBut these chargers are offensive players when it comes to playing in London this week Senate seats this doubt defend it you know they've been out at times but can we expect Melvin Gordon in Cairo Williams keen and out all these guys who have been rolling wealth of the charges offensively you think we can expect a similar performance against the Tennessee Titans team that it's lack a little bit recently\nI I don't I don't think you can expect the same with the passing game that they saw because right now it seems like everybody catching the browns have just the right time you know Melvin Gordon you mentioned the Eighteen Russia's one hundred and thirty two yards and three touchdown got too hot for target\nThey're going to rely on him quite a bit and as much as I wasn't a real big fan of bill rivers last week I'm not\nA real big fan of him this way because you got bored and you got ... where\nHe only attempt at twenty passes against the brown that's it and you know the titans are as many problems if they had ... they only allow Seventeen Seventeen points per game show\nA show of rivers as a low ending starting option this week but Melvin Gordon you can fire up as a low an RV one but the rest of their pets and game there's buyer beware\nWhen it comes to RV ones RV too is I think what it's going to happen\nIn New Orleans is very very interesting moving forward mark and groom Alvin Kamara\nI think both of them take a little bit of a a decline this week simply because they're on the road against the ravens\nBut talk about this week if you have come are on your team and and go and talk a little bit about down the road how to use the state's going to work in grim and Kamara and based on what you do obviously come are as more of a bailout of the past and gay but this week and moving forward should should be worried if you own increment come are simply because of a split Carrie\n[laughter] I don't think so we saw last year that the saints were able to work on both fan and I understand there might have been a little bit of panic because of the the nine ... for ... in the game against Washington\nIngram I think is a real threat to the high end R B one status but he still definitely by in the in the R B one conversation you might be looking at maybe a a a sixty to forty times share when it's all said and done\nI think coming out of the coming out of the buying and you mentioned the game that they got against Baltimore Baltimore is an absolutely fantastic defense mark Ingram also catches the ball really well out of the backfield so\nThese guys are are very much interchangeable I mean your mark arrowhead fifty thick catches last year Alvin ... you know obviously with the eighty one is more of a featured back but\nYour income and ... they're interchangeable you're looking at your commensurate with a little bit more upside for maybe a\n... year looking or be one maybe not elite like he did or but in terms of very\nLooking at you know come out with a little bit more outside but maybe a ... year looking at our be one maybe not elite like he did before but in terms of very high or be too for the rest of the air\nChris ... is our guest host of that fantasy football so right here on this network every single Tuesday night you can follow all of Christmas work on Twitter at the un tubs this is a great time of year obviously in terms of fantasy football because we now start to really understand consistency and so I'll ask you this you know when it comes to the San Francisco forty niners I have CJ ... and\nI have more peace good west and I actually think there's a promo running on a network about that but look I can we expect both of those civically Markey's going I drafted Markey's good within my fantasy league obviously not because I thought CJ that there was going to be growing so I thought it was Jimmy ... the government gets hurt it's beginning to your he comes back last week and a two touchdowns\nAnd we expect that consistency with good when I tried that in the fourth round and I and I think a lot of listeners out there are probably in that same boat fourth or fifth round was good with but when it comes to good when a bastard or is that can actually do you think going to be they're moving forward\nI think it is I think the problem that we saw this year is he got hurt in game one and the second quarter against Minnesota with that quad\nAnd didn't get any receptions but then you know slowly worked his way and three cats just to catch just pour catches but he's got the ability ... to to get down the field and take top off defense when he's healthy he can run by almost anybody in the NFL so\nIf he was picked people were dropped he needs to be picked up immediately because I think he's he's not nobody in that office right now\nA save Matt Brita is a consistent fantasy starter maybe and Greg kennel a low in tight and windy pending on the match up\nBut ed Markey's Goodwin is a he's a nice wide receiver three you you might not get the two touchdowns every week but you've got to a chance that he shouldn't be a target monster and not often now that he's fully healthy\nWho do you think are going to be some of the bigger fantasy football players that come out of the patriots and the bears game honestly I'm not quite sure what to think of the bears in terms of their defense because they've been so good up to the point of last week when rock ... why would beat them\nSo if I'm sitting there with let's say a Josh Gordon or one of these ah or I I think obviously a play at all but ... but\nThe but the bears on the on that side of the ... you know service you took a step back last week\nIf I were to ask you to rank the top skilled players in that game not just the bears that have patriots who do you think there'll be\n... I think obviously number one you're looking at Tom Brady that's that's kind of a no brainer\nNumber two I'm going to go stoning the show because you look at the patriots and how they're using him you know he's got twenty plus carries two out of the last three weeks and his lowest output Matt and has been Ninety eight yards that was last week against Indianapolis he scored\n... scored and great consecutive weeks which I think maybe not Brita and David Johnson might be the only other too don't they know Smith as well from the ... and David Johnson I think given the only other running backs just born three consecutive games so I Love Brady show\nA jury going as well because Cohen's been getting a lot more he he's almost a planting Jordan Howard as the top are often said an option in that are ... ... ... but I think you've got that and then maybe Trey Burton but\nI really I really like I I I see some holes right now and that Chicago defense and uh they got some injuries including a little Mac who I don't know if he's going to be completely healthy come Sunday\nYeah last I heard a is that they're they're monitoring the ankle so who knows what I mean at that point it's it's questionable right now Chris ... is our guest host of that fantasy football so every single Tuesday night right here on this network you can follow Christ is work on Twitter at the um tubs\nSo as I was preparing for this because I saw a very interesting set up a couple of articles that I've been reading have people wanting to sit to marry is Thomas the number one wide receiver for the Denver Broncos because he's going up against the Arizona Cardinals now you could tell the Arizona Cardinals have won when but hey they have Patrick Peterson who's a shutdown cornerback\nThe cardinals have allowed eighty plus yardstick is three receivers through six games this season their defense isn't that bad\nBut would you agree if you have let's say a a normal ... wide receivers three or borderline wide receiver to option on your bench maybe with a good match up if you're sitting there with him areas Thomas Kunz Patrick Peterson would you'd bench to marry as Thomas could you do that\n[laughter] I Would have a real hard time venting dumb areas Thomas ... and I think that's almost a byproduct of how bad by case keen um has been so far you one thing and and one of them through the roof still considers at him the on who is just\nOn a ... page right now so far so if you throw that out\nI'm Still not completely sold on that Arizona secondary Emanuel Sanders really works more into what case Keenan likes to do\nI've already hunted Joyce it not necessarily you know it is and they don't score that much like that\nOh no I'm saying I I'm not going to get out of the fourth quarter I'll bet you on the score and at a later age or have let's say ESPN game day will be located in Pullman and Washington state and you know an Oregon Washington state game\nPlus three\nOregon Oregon's getting three

Chevy allowed when\nA field or reaches over the fence railing rope orange to the stand the catch a ball he he does so as his own risk however should a spectator reach out on the playing field side of such fence railing a rope and planning prevent the field or from catching the ball in the bathroom and shouldn't be called up for the spectators interfere\nAnd read the first sentence again the ripped apart this really relevant here one more time\nNo interference shall be allowed when the when they feel they're reaches over the fence railing row or into the ... no interference should\nBe called

you were watching the players that was his glove clearly lined up outside like you have\nTo have a speech as long as it's clearly clearly passed the law was okay see to me\n[noise] it is it's it's clearly clearly is Matt\n[noise] yeah\nThis is going to be one that is going to be talked about it without a doubt if it was a home run if it was called a home run on the field you don't overturned that but you understand why no yeah you understand why I mean I I I'm Glad to be on your hand or\nStay home right if it was called a home run on the field you don't overturned that but you understand why no yeah you understand why I mean I I I'm Glad to be on your\nHand or yeah Ben regardless of I Know you brought me to talk about you know regardless of whether or not that was a home or they had plenty of more oh I'm up to win the game\nI think the the the Houston Astros fan as all baseball fans do look I'm a Yankee fan so I'm looking for you whenever the Yankees was a proud guy I'm looking for excuses as to why it happened I'm just saying tomorrow the local chatter is going to be OK well what is\nThis what it's called a home run and so I think it's a fifty fifty of the players that get I really do I think you can't buy the letter of the law the letter of the rule it's it's up for interpretation that's a really good we do it's very hard to dispute that and I understand oh they're the Houston Astros and why you would be upset by this\nI mean it is what it is there a at this point it just doesn't feel the same doesn't have the ... that they had last season last season there was a sense of urgency with everything that they did and I think twice tonight they left the other bases loaded\nOh they left or at least ten or ... as well as they left like Thirteen runners on unbelievable yeah [noise] no they\nThey definitely did and a lot of ... ... ... talk to do as a fan of a team that loses a playoff game is to give credit to the other team\nI think you've got to do that with Boston here because this is the ... and and they were saying on the broadcast throughout the entire Yankees theories and they were saying on the broadcast throughout the entire game\nIt debt five thousand paper cuts then that's what the botnet right how do they just single after single hit after hit that is what the Red Sox 'cause there is a reason why they won over a hundred games this year and I'll tell you what Jackie Bradley junior for the second game and the series\nGets the big hit the gigantic home ride and look the red Sox\nBut it's good to they just find a way to win games probably we've been doing the around the baseball that all the regular season okay and I feel like this I feel like a broken record when I talk about the red Sox they find ways to win baseball games and I'll tell you what that was\nIt it's really not at this credit what happen tonight is not at this credit to the Astros it's just a great baseball game it was a great major league baseball playoff game in one team had to win one team had to lose\nAnd tonight it turned out the red Sox won the game okay when we come back we'll talk more baseball will get deeper into the theories and then of

right here on SB Nation radio every single Tuesday nights we have 'em on every week you can follow the course of work on Twitter at C. M. tubs aren't Chris\nHave an interesting question here for you I think the star because these London games I never really know how\nThe players are going to perform at the ... they should look I'm looking at this game and I was first of all I thought the chargers at minus six and a half was just really interesting because I think the chargers are way better than Tennessee but as a friend explained to me the chargers are basically playing this game at five AM\nTheir body clock time like the it literally like that that's one of the game starts so\nMelvin Gordon here blacks offer three touchdowns last week I think the chargers often says rolling on all cylinders\nBut these chargers are offensive players when it comes to playing in London this week tendencies a stout beef in it you know they've been out at times but can we expect Melvin Gordon and Tyrone Williams Keenan out all these guys who have been rolling well for the charges offensively do you think we can expect a similar performance against the Tennessee Titans team at a black a little bit recently\nI I don't I don't think you can expect the thing with the passing game that they saw because right now it seems like everybody's catching the brown to just the right time no Melvin Gordon you mentioned the Eighteen Russia's one hundred and thirty two yard touchdown\nGot too hot for target they're going to rely on him quite a bit and as much as I wasn't a real big fan of bill rivers last week\nI'm not a real big fan of him this way because you got Gore and you've got ... where\nHe only attempt at twenty path and against the browns that's it and the titans are as many problems that they had all that really only allow Seventeen Seventeen points per game show\nPhillip Rivers as a low ending starting option this week but Melvin Gordon you can fire up as a low an RV one but the rest of that again is buyer beware\nWhen it comes to RV one's already too is I think what it's going to happen in New Orleans is very very interesting moving forward to mark and groom Alvin Kamara\nWhen it comes to RV one's already too is I think what it's going to happen\nIn New Orleans is very very interested in moving forward to mark in ... Alvin Kamara\nI think both of them take a little bit of a decline this week simply because they're on the road against the ravens but talk about this week if you have come are on your team and ... and talk a little bit about down the road how do you think the states are going to work in ... and ... and based on what you know obviously come are as more of a veiled all out of the past\nAnd gave us this week in moving forward should should be worried if you own increment ... simply because of the split carries\n[laughter] I don't think so we saw last year that the saints were able to work on both men and I understand there might have been a little bit of panic because of the the nine touches for ... and ... in the game against Washington\nAnd grow my I think he's a real threat to the high end already one status but he still definitely a in the in the R B one conversation you might be looking at maybe a a a sixty to forty time share when it's all said and done\nI think coming out of the coming out of the buying and you mentioned the game that they got against Baltimore Baltimore is an absolutely fantastic defense\nMark Ingram also catches the ball really well out of the backfield so these guys are are very much interchangeable I mean you know mark ... fifty six catches last year yeah Alvin ... you know obviously with the eighty one is more of a featured back but\nYour income and ... they're interchangeable you're looking at you know ... with a little bit more upside maybe a\n... year looking or be one maybe not elite like he did before but and grooms a very high or be too for the rest of the air\nChris ... is our guest host of that fantasy football so right here on this network every single Tuesday night you can follow all of course his work on whether it's the um tubs this is a great time of year obviously in terms of fantasy football because we now start to really understand consistency and so I'll ask you this you know when it comes to the San Francisco forty niners I have\nCJ bet third and I have more peace good way and I actually think there's a promo running on a network about that but let's see we expect both of those cynically mark he's the one I drafted Markey's good within my fantasy league obviously not because I saw CJ that there was going to be throwing so I thought it was gonna be Jimmy ... still good when it gets hurt at the beginning of the year he comes back last week and his two touchdowns\nAnd we expect that consistency was good but I tried that in the fourth round and I and I think a lot of listeners out there are probably in that same boat fourth or fifth round was good with but when it comes to good when a bastard or is that connection do you think going to be they're moving forward\nI think it is I think the problem that we saw this year is he got hurt in game one in the second quarter against Minnesota with back on and didn't get any receptions but then you know slowly worked his way and three cats just to catch just for catches\nBut he's got the ability ... to to get down the field and take top off the fence when he's healthy he can run by almost anybody in the NFL so if he was picked if he was dropped\nHe needs to be picked up immediately because I think he's he's not nobody in that office right now a save ... Brita is a consistent fantasy starter may be a great cattle are low and tight and won depending on the match up\nBut ed Markey's Goodwin is a he's a nice wide receiver three you you might not get the two touchdowns every week but you've got a chance that he shouldn't be a target monster and not often now that he's fully healthy\nWho do you think they're going to be some of the bigger fantasy football players that come out of the patriots and the bears game honestly I'm not quite sure what to think of the bears in terms of their defense because they've been so good up to the point of last week when ... beat them\nSo if I'm sitting there with let's say a Josh Gordon or one of these ah or I I think obviously a play out of ... but\nBut the bears on the on that side of the ... you know it's a busy took a step back\nLast week if I were to ask you to rank the top skilled players in that game not just the bears that have patriots who do you think they'll be\n[noise] [noise] well I think obviously number one you're looking at Tom Brady that that kind of a no brainer number two I'm going to go running the show because you look at the patriots and how they're using him you know he's got twenty plus carries\nTwo out of the last three weeks and his lowest output ... has been Ninety eight yards that was last week against Indianapolis he scored\nAll tightening scored and break in six weeks which I think maybe ... Brita and David Johnson might be the only other two got the nose Smith as well from the falcon ... and David Johnson I think the only other running backs just scoring three consecutive game so I Love Brady show\nA jury going as well because Cohen's been getting a lot more he he's almost planting Jordan Howard as the top off into an option in that a ... a fence\nBut I think you've got that and then maybe Trey Burton but I really I really like I I I think the holes right now and that Chicago defense uh and uh they got them injuries including ... who I don't know if he's going to be completely healthy come Sunday\nYeah last I heard a is that they're they're monitoring the ankle so who knows what I mean at that point it's questionable right now Chris ... is our guest host of that fantasy football so every single Tuesday night right here on this network you can follow Christmas work on Twitter at the um tubs\nSo as I was preparing for this Chris I saw a very interesting set up a couple of articles that I've been reading have people wanting to sit to marry is Thomas the number one wide receiver for the Denver Broncos because he's going up against the Arizona Cardinals now you could say oh the Arizona Cardinals at one Lynn but hey they have Patrick Peter said it was a shutdown cornerback\nThe cardinals have allowed eighty plus yardstick is three receivers through six games this season their defense isn't that bad\nBut would you agree if you have let's say a a normal ... wide receivers three or borderline wide receiver to option on your bench maybe with a good match up if you're sitting there with the various Thomas Patrick Peterson would you'd bench some areas Thomas could you do that\nI Would have a real hard time banking dumb areas Thomas ... and I think that's almost a byproduct of how bad by case keen um has been so far you know one thing and and one of those receivers to consider is that um the on who is just\nOn a ridiculous pays right now so far\nSo if you throw that out I'm Still not completely sold on that Arizona secondary Emanuel Sanders really works more into what case keen um likes to do you know he had ten targets last week the standards that you know for a hundred fifty yards and a touchdown\nHe did not catch it is because the fan collapsed the gloves shut that was my interpretation of it however the rule letter of the law says that a fan has the right to do that\nApparently is move the bat the glove is passed the field of play which it look like according to the picture that I've seen it clearly was so I I don't I\nYou know it was a judgment call up it was a very fifty fifty play they went out and reviewed it now look I think the angry Astros fan would say this is why we have review for situations just like this you go to review and you quote unquote still get it wrong [noise]\nThis is a tough one cell phone on the ... flood as great as the world series when was the last year he's lost his are just as that and the other side of it [noise] [noise]\nI'm boarding WMA not what you were born Africans and online at nine forty zone dot com [noise]\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Richard ... less than three weeks\nUntil mid term elections new information about election meddling Twitter released data on more than ten million tweets by foreign operator dating back to twenty sixteen disinformation researcher ... says Russian anti Iranian players are most of the blame they were\nTrying to make people either angry or afraid and they were targeting lots of different communities but but the goal was always the same the more you make people angry or afraid the more you can control them\nSaudi Arabia says it's investigating the disappearance of suspected murder of dissident journalist ...

Mac you have to take it to the fact the off the field president he has his well I'm ... ... again she set a precedent when he came into bears cap\nAnd he put a football and midfield he started literally started a tradition at barest practice it put a football field and said okay defense\nFirst one of the football wins now what is it really mean first of all of the football wins what does it mean it means is starting a competition within practice so clear Mac is getting the bears defense you know a whole different mindset now I Know last week they didn't go look good against Miami\nBut I did the Chicago as deep as has drastically improve and it's again going back is just one guy\nHe can only do certain things I'm Talking about the things that he does to affect the rest of the deep and that is also going into this debate because Lawrence Taylor did things that affected the rest of the defense okay they had to double team he just his intensity got everybody going you know\nSo Bobby you could tell me while I'm Crazy now okay let me make one more point\nOkay if I can sit here I Do believe I could sit here and say okay Patrick my home is showing signs of Brett Farr and Aaron Rodgers I'm not saying that he is Brett Farr brown Rogers that'd be dumped\nThose two guys have accomplished more in their careers because their careers have been longer again I go back to this is very similar to the liberal Michael argument Okay Michael has more Rick abroad isn't finished his career yet\nBut still up but to say that they are similar and they have similar trade and they affect their teams in similar way I'd probably be now tell me ...\n'cause I think that the reporter did not have a terrible question by saying you coach guys like Lawrence Taylor that St Lawrence Taylor that that ... is better than watch tailor all she's saying is I see the comparison the dots could connect if he were to try and make that argument which I just laid out yeah\nYeah I I see what the reporter was saying uh basically she's not saying that\n... ... no I mean ... you know as far as the patch Russia goes that's who are these young guys put their game out yeah you know so I understand what she was saying they are I guess she could have is worthy of the time it better 'cause you know build better tricky heard Lawrence Taylor yeah now like\nPlay one more time he's not because of course he coached Lawrence Taylor\nSo am I allowed to\nCome up with a lot of service for us so [noise]\nWhatever ...\nWorse or good players but we're about loss or\nYeah so these are the respect you want me to show respect for Marshall fucking again it's got nothing to do with showing disrespect for Lawrence Taylor Marshall book I just really look at it as a one way street all I'm doing is giving a compliment to Todd girly and ... to say hey I see some of these guys and you\nKnow I mean you know and you could see Baird Thomas the late great big Thomas Kansas City chiefs and ... the way he gets off the patch rush so I I mean it's it's multiple political penny a game for a little guy like his style and you know you got great hands he could pick out the balls one or two so I mean ah the similarity out of\nBed the reporter also asked that question\nBecause she knew that he coached Lawrence Taylor yeah so he episode yet so she knew that he that ... that that she could really given accurate he sure what you want it was an accurate as she was genuinely curious okay this this was a bill bell check really being you know like angrier and they say this was all in good fun\nBut I just thought it was interesting his reaction like hitting these old especially these older coaches they are very very quick to say hey we I Know we have some good young players right now in this week and we'll play some sound coming up later on the show where we're Roger Goodell talking about the good young players in the league will play that later\nBut ah you know when we're talking about these

in Arizona isn't it that will be in Arizona Denver Broncos going on the road and that's the problem is I think I like one and a\nHalf point favorites in the game and one of the reasons is because that Denver is there one in eight or one in nine or something like that I think on the road on her head coach Vance Joseph that's disgraceful I I I'm very curious what he has to say because Denver that I mean those are kind of too depressing\nTeams right there that's not going to be a good football game although it's kind of an intriguing football game right I mean case here's a here's a question for your body okay if the Broncos lose that game on the road we already know like the Vance Joseph meter in Denver is about to run out\nIf they lose this game in Arizona What are the chances you put at him getting firing fire in the middle of the season middle of the season I'm not talking about the I think that his ... or ... if they're going to go six and ten a Michael five and eleven I Am a ...

point of the Arizona Cardinals this weekend there it gives me this weekend tonight Thursday Night Football Broncos on the road taking on the cardinals them lunches aren't as managing editor for mile high report which is the SB Nation page for the Denver Broncos you can follow him\nAnd it goes on the road taking on the cardinals lunches aren't managing editor for mile high report which is the SB Nation page for the Denver Broncos you can follow him work on winter at him like Nineteen Seventy a night game last week against the rams however it wasn't really fight in the first half\nHow would you sell you a nod performance up to this point overall\nA pretty pretty disappointing but to be expected a yet a career year last year with the Vikings and\nYou know if if you're being realistic a he's probably going to regret the mean hum and he did he has so uh is more interceptions in touchdowns a and there's really struggled in the red zone um so that's been been quite a disappointment for ...\nWhat were your thoughts when they got case Tina because obviously the Broncos that have gone in a number of different directions to quarterback situation last year was without a doubt disappointing there are thoughts of her cousins there were thoughts of baby teddy Bridgewater there were a bunch of options when it was decided that the Broncos were going to do with Tina what were your thoughts\n[laughter] I mean underwhelming or they just didn't have the money to compete for her cousins and it really seemed like he made up his mind anyway [noise] um and after two years of Trevor sent me an I mean you could have taken any backup and the league and and ... probably would have been happy so\nUm you know if you look at the the whole landscape I mean case Cain um is is not the worst quarterback he's not the best thing there's just not a whole lot of options out there and getting to the Bridgewater is kind of coming off that injury now kind of an unknown\nI don't think the Broncos were ready to risk you know after two years of just\nUnsuccessful quarterback play on the already picked that kind of risk\nYeah no doubt about it ... is our guest a managing editor for mile high report which is the Denver Broncos SB Nation page you can follow temp work on Twitter at him lynched Nineteen Seventy eight I'm always curious when it comes to like the fan bases of certain teams when it comes to your readers in Denver Broncos fans in general\nIs there this sense that maybe we're I don't I Want to say wasting but we could be doing better with I mean honestly the Broncos at two of the better wide receivers combinations in the league when it comes to Emanuel Sanders and\nDumb areas Thomas too pretty solid running back we'll get to ... among than they thought of oh we're wasting the prime possibly the manual standards a dumb areas Thomas who are really really good wide receivers [noise]\nYeah I think I think more ... more for the defense um you know Chris Harris junior a clown Miller are we wasting their prime [noise] um you know that championship defense of two dollars and Fifteen cents really tanked and\nYou know there's there's a window that's that's close to I mean we were we we we hope it's not close but I at this point\nWith with another quarterback situation that's disappointing um you just don't feel like they're going to turn things around there's going to be some big changes in Denver either in the middle of this year or come January\nWhat are you're predicting some of those big changes will be\nI think I think that shows was done um you know I don't obviously is still the head coach um but he's not able to turn things around now we've got to the ... science which ranked first overall fell last year\nGiving up the most jars and a two week period in NFL history [laughter] so that's that's quite a collapse I'm In the in the rumor is is you know fans Joseph has been um helping Joe would call the play is the last couple of weeks and so that's [noise]\nYou know that's that's pretty telling so [noise] um there's just there's going to be a lot of changes John Elway he's getting a lot of criticism and you know he's not a known for his patients hum and his competitive drive to win games is obviously not being fulfilled so\nThose big changes are are coming into coaching staff and I'm pretty sure they're going to keep looking for that quarterback\nDidn't Lynch is our guest managing editor for mile high report you can follow him on Twitter at him lynched Nineteen Seventy eight can you remind me and my audience the background of Vance Joseph where did he come from what were his strengths why would she hired there because\nYou know I think you could make an argument that you know ... there are certain coaches was elevated quarterbacks careers obviously sonic they is this is a special one when it comes to elevating a guy like Jared God Bless patched\nGerm or as a you know definitely elevated pace Keenan they're just different coaches around the league was elevated the quarterback play rex Ryan for example is not one of those dies could work with a quarter back in New York going to work at a quarterback in Buffalo so when it comes to the development of quarterback for Denver over the past couple of years\nI guess I'm asking is Vance Joseph the primary person to blame amongst Broncos fan [noise]\nI mean he was kind of given you know a beat up old Chevy pickup instead of a a Ferrari a quarter back you know so I don't think there was much development to make out of either Paxton Lynch or Trevor sent me an so it can't really blame him for [noise]\nFor that situation I think we're disappointed me the most was a case keen I'm coming in here they had a great training camp ... he looks the part he looked like he could actually be a functional quarterback you know he's not gonna be elite but he's going to be\nThe kind of quarter back to this team has been desperate for since Peyton Manning left and weak one he came out he was aggressive pushing the ball down the field there they were scoring points [laughter] you know but he had three interceptions and it just feels like the coaching staff are just\nSo worried about the interceptions that they they kind of coached case came them into becoming Trevor ... in and it's just\nIt's mind boggling but it's it's frustrating and and I think the problem that I'm seeing with with Vance Joseph is that he's not I think he's worried about losing his job and and that's playing into the reactionary kind of coaching that that's going on here [noise]\nUm and it's frustrating for fans so you know that's that's all bad mixture of of of a of a situation that's that was not\nGoing in the right direction this team to win and then he multiple when and if they're going to rebound here and and I just don't feel like that's going to happen\nBefore we get to the game coming up tonight let's turn this positively I think the running game how may not last week against the rams but Philip Lindsay and Roy screaming I think I've done a relatively decent job did you anticipate to split carries that were pretty much the same between Roy three minute Philippe Lindsey those in the beginning of the year that frame it in one of the job of Philip Lindsey pitching it\nDid you anticipate this ratio in terms of carries between Lindsey ...\nUh yeah actually I expected Roy screaming to get more carries a which hasn't happened but\nYou know those those two guys came into camp and we're just electric uh you had the veterans like crosshairs junior talking about how how great you know ... he's going to be and\nYou know those guys are seeing that it's it's legit you know they're they're ... they're all pro guys they know what they're looking at so [noise]\nUm it's pretty exciting for those guys come in I think that the frustrating part is is the the Broncos are calling Seventy percent passes and thirty percent runs right now and we're just not seeing enough of them um I think Roy screaming hasn't had more than ten touches but maybe two games so far so\nRight now and we're just not seeing enough of them um I think Roy streaming hasn't had more than ten touches but maybe two games so far so [noise]\nUm if ... to see more of them that'd be great because they're the Broncos rushing attack is one of the leaders and NPR's for Kerry and [noise] yeah I think the success or the recipe for success in for this off into the shift that run the ball and and that's just not happening right now\nTotally agree they average five point three

[noise]\n... joining us on the back to the Assad Tom in sideline covers the Lakers for as being Asian and silver screen and role is Christian or any of our Christmas going on [noise]\nUh how you doing I'm doing All right\nJohn and Robert so then you're you're Lakers making their season debut tonight as well take on the blazers and it'll be the first regular season game some guy named LeBron James plays as an LA Laker\nHow big is the reaction going to be [noise]\nUh who is that LeBron James that I've never heard of him is he supposed to be good at basketball\nHe's supposed to be decent you know not not too bad I I hear they're they're going to start him\nOkay well ah the the reaction I've heard so far has been nothing but great I mean obviously you're going to a guy is Alberta complained bird either one thirty five games on their record going through\nThe question with and then it'd be you know how he was a young guy [laughter] that's the big how bad a weird mix of veterans they put together is going to mess\nNow you've got a weird mix the veterans is the nicest way you could explain that raised on Rondo a lamp Stevenson Michael easily\nThen it's an interesting cast of characters to say the least that being said or how much time do you expect those guys to get you know Alonzo spin a bang up and coming back from the surgery Josh heart has been dealing with a hamstring brand that anger ...\nHow much do you expect the young kids to play and how much is the um the interesting veteran ensemble going to go [noise]\nWell I think you're going to get a really as much time as I got a if not more Bradley Ingram I think a lot of planning on you get is going to be dependent\nOn how he is on the court ... Rondo because wrong or sorry model played a little off ball at UCLA or he played more of like a guard at UCLA next to Aaron Holiday and if he can replicate that success with\nThe Lakers are withdrawn though he's going to be on the ... I mean he's not at a hundred percent help yet you still need to get a rhythm back\nBut in the limited and I'm Talking very limited sample size\nOr they played Rondo lawns them the brown on the court together but ball movement was phenomenal a it looked really good and it just depends on how he said if he can get his three point shot\nThe fall or even Rondo who's become a you know something that resembles a reliable the Martin Luther over the past few years [noise]\nAnd that's a big deal for Iran do because that's the guy whose career is built on not being able to issue\nBut you know ... with with him and I think he's always been a gifted pastor I think he's always been terrific at that he's a great rebound there for a guard he plays terrific defense is it you know is is the shot pretty much everything you know of his shot is fix that\nRebound there for a guard he plays to renting the sense is it you know is is the shock pretty much everything you know his shot is fix that he's going to roll a lot more and\nHow much patience do you think they gave him with being able to demonstrate that he can be a reliable shooter\n[noise] you know I think I think the the front office didn't go after our John Rondo because he's a shooter or I think what they're really looking for for Iran does one\nUh to be an extension of the coaching staff on the court because you hear from a player's coaching staff that have have worked with Ron do and he's he's always the icing on the court and then it's not just trash talking uh he's he's telling players where they need to be\nA reading these census that's for the even happen I mean he didn't really really high basketball player and that's why look brawn James loves playing with them and I think more than anything that the Lakers are looking for from Ronda in the shooting is just you know a sprinkled on the cake if you will I think ah if he can\nGet his shop the ball maybe thirty five percent on three to three attempts per game that's golden and I think that's all they're looking for\nA Christian a couple of weeks no land statements and it said that he never had a conversation with LeBron James about the whole blowing in his ear type of thing and he said you know I just did it because you know he's LeBron he's the best\nAnd I was trying absolutely anything I could think of to get 'em off his game he said they they never spoken about it to your knowledge has that changed and do you think at some point in the season\nThat relationship is going to get let's say funky\nThat to my knowledge no they they have they haven't spoken about it yet and a land I'm probably the wrong guy to ask about because I still don't get that finding especially for the\nThe money they get and I don't understand a delay in the ... and signing up I'm more concerned about the on the court that then the dynamic he brings off the court I mean we've already heard\nOr comments and Brandon Ingram saying that all the veteran that they take advice from land Stevenson the least likely one that they take advice from because and I quote\nHe's a little too crazy so I think that the locker room understands what land Stevenson is off the court or if were brawn James gave the okay from the front office before they they signed off on it um I think that's fine but I mean\nThat they know where they're getting off the ... and I'd be surprised if he's on the team past February with what he's shown in pre season\nA little more to the point you just made there about you know love Ron being okay with Lance none of these guys Rondo Stevenson easily none of these guys were assigned like everybody had the whole chain of LeBron James\nCorrect\nAbsolutely yeah and I think\nRondo ... won't Magic Johnson sold a LeBron James when he picked the Lakers was playing with a group of versatile players that he wasn't going to sit around with Brian James with special specialist because LeBron James had shooters in Cleveland and while they were successful in doing that I think uh\nYou know what magic went into the meeting was that LeBron James wanted something new something fresh so they went out and got a you know a defensive point guard which in my opinion is\nMore reputation that way than anything is wrong on Rondo but he's a really high basketball IQ guy a they got to craft the offensive player that can rebound pass the ball and Michael easily and Lance even in theory can do a little bit of everything but again I haven't seen and what really\nInterested me was the fact that a report came out today that\nAt last year's trade deadline LeBron James was so impressed with Michael easily that he actually requested the capital here's a trade for him at that that line so I mean that just that further advise and so the idea that that ... brown signed off on each and every single one of\nThese guys even the ones that don't make sense to you know the casual fan\nAnd we usually has one of those guys look really can score on anybody\nNow defense mass totally different story but Michael Beasley can can put it in the whole as good as anybody it's just he's had you know musicians\nTerrific score very efficient score as well now you mentioned about you know LeBron and and and the point guard situation ... used to bring the ball up almost all the time and Cleveland and he was their primary boy am", "year": "2018",
