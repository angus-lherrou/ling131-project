I Would not be surprised you that go into coming up next\nWe're going to get that one I Want to try and get that 'cause I Am I'm not sure what Vegas is thinking they're jak to build a bit of a mess right now by me what's her name on\nThe next one is Adam the land\nThe best wide receiver [noise]\nIs that an overreaction no none of overreaction duties got six straight one hundred yard game who's better name name a wide receiver who's better [noise]\nPhoto that Kim junior no no Holyoke Jones no clear Jones ... I don't I mean in terms of production no that's not an overreaction and see the most skilled wide receiver\nIf that's the question that he's still receiver yet that's an overreaction is either pass wide receiver no it's not over actually set an NFL record you've got six straight one hundred games I don't think that's an overreaction about\nThis I mean this is talk of I still [noise]\nI mean it's this is not about skill but as far as like the last guy out there in front of your team and I think it is an overreaction I I mean I still go to Antonio Brown still go hospitals do Julio like guys like that\nThat can give me those are the coolest moment what is how is the phrase guinea but I mean this is Adam ... is the best wide receiver an innocent this year I think yes [noise]\nWe will see in a in a hurry to do this and I like the guy I like I he finds ways to get over it I mean you got another guy that's on the on the other side of yeah and he still finds was given to the end zone yeah a lot of them don't know is the best of the rookie quarterback [noise]\nRight he's better than Josh salary is better than Lamar Jackson is better than just Rosa basically they're asking is it him or Baker Mayfield\n[noise]\nProbably I'll go to you first on this one I'm Still thinking he's\nI think as long as it's not a rookie though you know that's what I'm saying like how does that I Can't go there I Know that I I said\nWhen I started over as it's not over action because I think Sam ... from what we said from day one from the store across his chest across the body and that was in ...\nHe comes back in and lights out on the line there is a struggle to a couple of weeks just like a ... a comeback stronger gets the Broncos are cos he's he's delivering the ball into ...

Rogers runs runs for a big run where I thought there was\nTo be quite honest I thought there was multiple offensive holding on that plane the Packers were were doing a very good job of holding the forty niners quite a lot but we just do the color of holding a very often so that you got it done he got\nFrom his receivers and that's you know that's their that's quit the central Aaron Rodgers so you're never surprised or always expecting something like that that's very possible\nHey how and where are you just overall with the Green Bay Packers just as a team they give us thirty points tonight to a theme Lewis starting their backup quarterback their backup running back\nA ... the brand new nine or ... ran all over the Packers through the first three quarters of his games we know Green Bay off tentatively at that their struggles that year ... where are you right now with in terms of what they've been able to do it to this point [noise]\nOr you know I'll tell you I mean there are other Senate himself a quick interview after the game when it got it by coming up and and then he said and then then you look at\nLook at that schedule after that where they've got two games in a row against the rams and the patriots so we're going to find out a lot about this team then but you know like a lot of teams in the league their flaws or they have and Roger so you know that should that always makes them competitive and gives them a chance to win\nA lot of games but but the fence is an issue but I'll tell you something that when you look around as Lee\nThere's there's problems with the fence everywhere yeah and you know Tampa Bay fired defensive coordinator on Monday which I thought was an absolute joke I because I mean you give up twenty or thirty four points we Atlanta Falcons and that's one of the best off that Susan football yeah and the way the game is now\nYou know everyone screams about because all you got to be put you got to play better do you guys but how many teams really quite good he just consistently in this week it's hard to play good defense that'd be you know because like I said ... whole defensive you know defensive players can't talk to anybody\nAnd with the skilled players that there are up and so I mean look at look at all I mean here's another game on Monday Night for another game this season we're both teams coordinate the thirties I mean that's that's becoming the norm in the national football league\nHalf the game with about half the games or you know have one of the team scoring thirty points\n... or ... you know at least thirty points so that's the way it is now so I I think it's gotten to the point where almost every coach has to look at it and say anytime we stop the other team\nThat's a good thing that that's a good thing so it's almost like a RINO football that a lot of ways it's you know as who has the ball laugh I mean look at Kansas City in New England on you know on Sunday night\nUh you know eight eighty three points in the game and so that's that's just the way it is now people go crazy on the page or on the on the cheese the expense all my goodness what well who's playing defense now or Seventeen\nBut that's that's just the way it is now people go crazy on the page on the on the chief's defense all my goodness what a well who's playing defense now some of the teams play a very good defense on a consistent basis\nThrough our balls or is there is a sports exchange you can follow our work on winner at age balls or Seventy one I had the same take away that you did after the Sunday night or I didn't come up with okay the patriots are better with the jeeze I came up with the patriots had the ball laugh that's why they want games I mean if you're watching that game\nLike literally they could have played seven more minutes of football and I guarantee you those two teams would have traded touchdowns ... touchdowns all the way the rest of the way is this overall a good thing for the lead the fact that we're really not seeing deep and so I mean you compared it to a Rena football I think that's a good comparison arena football we seats tourist fifty to forty all the time\nIs this a good thing overall the league black a decent\nWon't consider this real quick arena football it's fifty to forty in Seventy six feet whatever it is and that sort of fifty yard field I think what this would be in the NFL if they're playing a ... you are you so when you're talking about a hundred yard field and these are the scores it's crazy but from the standpoint is good for the NFL\nBecause that's what people love to watch [laughter]\nAnd I'm convinced that\nNo one will ever admitted from the NFL level but all the stuff with the rules and all those things that protect the quarterback and all that\nAnd and they they love to say it's about player safety well a hundred and Ninety percent now I'm not saying that it's not part of it but Ninety percent of it is they know what's going to help out facts\nThat when you make rules that hurt the defense and so where do we see the ratings I mean I'm Still the ratings are probably be really great for this game this is the word for Sunday night and the ratings are up ... and especially on the national games the primetime games because\nThat's where the bleeding was occurring in the ratings a lot and a big part of that was because the games weren't very good uh they weren't interesting there weren't a lot of corn score well look at look at the games we've had on prime time over these for six weeks and and a lot of them have have been games that are going to hold interest\nFor people watch them in the east coast until close to midnight and and all that could hold interest when you have great quarterbacks that a lot of points so in that respect business wise for the league it's great\nIt's great for the league 'cause they're getting the ... ratings almost complaining about it the sponsors love it because people are watching and ... and as well as I said people love to watch games for there's a lot of points scored how many times a year old man that was a born again\nYou know Twenty one twenty the same thing in baseball some of the most exciting games and baseball are wanting to nothing but most they have they'll say oh man that was boring as a well nothing gave that weren't in Iraq and that that's just the way a lot of people look at this in terms of who's watching on TV and and and all those important things like I said for the business with ally\nAnd just to give you an example I talked about this on the show last week I said when are we normally interested in two teams that have one when last week we have the south into play the Steelers I said I'm going to be in front of my TV watching that game because that's going to be one of the more exciting football games of the week and even though they both have one when they don't look at defense one team that does pride themselves on deep and so\nIs the Jacksonville Jaguars didn't see it at all on Sunday cowboys being I'm forty seven what is the biggest problem right now defensively with Jacksonville\nThat that's a real good question because it's it wasn't just this week and that's you know after the first three weeks of the season they were being talked about as one of the best teams in the league and the the fence was claiming well and then all of a sudden the last few weeks it's gone the other way\nAnd so I think a certain part of it is the ... hasn't been very good\nAt Blake the late ... hasn't played well they haven't had a letter for net\nAnd they've also head injuries to the receivers and so when you're not doing any the one you're not doing anything on our fence\nThan your defenses out on the field even more than it normally is and if you don't have to leave I mean look at look at the the sex with the jaguars would have had a lot of games last year when they get a lead and they just come after people and that's when you get a lot of sex in the NFL\nWhen when you're when you're the team that's leading well they haven't been ahead a lot in the last few weeks the fence isn't doing much at all of a sudden they find themselves\nYou know in big trouble so they it it's like you said it that's a part of it and I think that's a big part of it because most of the personnel\nThat's still the same there are a little banged up jailing rounds he's

Rogers runs runs for a big Ron where I thought there was to be quite honest I thought there's multiple offers from holding\nThe dog that while the Packers were were doing a very good job of holding the forty niners quite a lot but we just do the carpet for holding a very often so\nYou gotta Donny got help from his receivers and bad you know that there that's quite the central air ... so you're never surprised or always expecting something like that it's very possible\nHey how where are you just overall with the Green Bay Packers just as a team they give up thirty points tonight to St Louis starting their backup quarterback their backup running back\nA and I mean the Brando niners ran all over the Packers through the first three quarters of the game we know Green Bay off ... have their struggles this year just where are you right now with in terms of what they've been able to do it to this point\nOr you know I'll tell you I mean there are other Senate himself a quick interview after the game when it got it by coming up and and then he said and then then you look at that look at that schedule after that where they've got two games in a row against the rams and the patriots so we're going to find out a lot about\nThis team then but you know like a lot of things in this week there was a they have air Rogers\nAnd the patriots so we're going to find out a lot about this team them but you know like a lot of teams and the leading their flaws or they have a riser so you know that should that always makes them competitive and gives them a chance to win a lot of games but defense is an issue but I'll tell you something that when you look around those league\nThere's there's problems with defense everywhere yeah and you know Tampa Bay fire just defensive coordinator on Monday which I thought was an absolute joke because I mean you give up twenty or thirty four points to the Atlanta Falcons and that's one of the best off that Susan football yeah and the way the game is now [laughter]\nYou know everyone screams about the kinds I got to be ... you gotta play better D. cents but how many teams really quite good he says is that like in this week it's hard to play good defense [laughter] that'd be you know because like I said I'll sense of line that whole defensive you know defensive players can't talk to anybody\nAnd with the skilled players that there are off and so I mean look at look at all I mean here's another game on Monday Night for another game this season\nWe're both teams scored in the thirties I mean that's that's becoming the norm in the national football league where half the game just about half the games or a you know have one of the team scoring thirty points [laughter]\n... or ... you know at least thirty points so that's the way it is now so I I think it's gotten to the point where almost every coach has to look at it and say\nAnytime we stop the other team that's a good thing that that's a good thing so it's almost like a RINO football has a lot of ways it says you know as who has the ball laugh I mean look at Kansas City in New England\nOn on Sunday night you know eight eighty three points in the game and so that's that's just the way it is now people go crazy on the page or on the on the chief's deep and sold my goodness what well\nWho's playing defense now there's so many teams play a very good defense on a consistent base\nHis true however balls are is our guest as the sports exchange you can follow our work on winter and HBO's or Seventy one I had the same take away that you did after the Sunday night or I didn't come up with okay the patriots are better with uh jeeze\nI came up with the patriots had the ball last that's why they want game I mean if you're watching that game like literally they sort of play seven more minutes of football and I guarantee you those two teams would have traded touched down not steel bowls touchdowns all the way the rest of the way is this overall a good thing for the lead the fact that we're really not seen deep in something you compare to arena football\nI think that's a good comparison arena football we see each tourists fifty to forty all the time\nIs this a good thing overall for the league black a decent\nOn consider this real quick arena football it's\nFifty to forty in Seventy to sixty or whatever it is and that's up to the yard field I think what this would be in the NFL airplane of ... you are you so when you're talking about a hundred yard field and these are the scores it's crazy but from the standpoint is good for the NFL because that's what people love to watch\nAnd I'm convinced that\nNo one will ever admitted from the NFL level\nAll this stuff with the rules and all those things that protect the quarterback and all that\nAnd and they they love to say it's about player safety well a hundred Ninety percent now I'm not saying that's not part of it but Ninety percent of it is they know what's going to help out facts that when you make rules that hurt the effects and so where do we see the ratings I mean I'm Still the ratings are probably be really great for this gang that's what they were for Sunday night\nAnd the ratings are up ... and especially on the national games the primetime games because that's where the bleeding was occurring in the ratings a lot and a big part of that was because the games weren't very good\nUh they weren't interesting there weren't a lot of points scored well look at look at the games we've had on prime time over these for six week\nAnd a lot of them have been games that are going to hold interest\nFor people watch them in the east coast until close to midnight and all that kind of hold interests when you have great quarterbacks that a lot of points so in that respect business wise for the league it's great it's great for the league because they're getting the ratings no one's complaining about it the sponsors love it because people are watching and ... and that as well as I said people love\nTo watch games for there's a lot of points scored how many times a year old man that was a born again\nYou know Twenty one twenty the same thing in baseball some of the most exciting games and baseball are wanting to nothing but most fans will say oh man that was boring as a well nothing gave there weren't any rocks and that that's just the way a lot of people look at this in terms of who's watching on TV and and and all those important things like I said for the business with ally\nAnd just to give you an example I talked about this on the show last week I said when are we normally interested in two teams that\nHave one when last week we had the south and plenty to steal as I said I'm going to be in front of my TV watching that game because that's going to be one of the more exciting football games a week and even though they both have one when they don't play a lick a defense team that does pride themselves on defense so it's the Jacksonville Jaguars didn't see it at all on Sunday cowboys being I'm forty seven what\nIs the biggest problem right now defensively with Jacksonville\nThat that's a real good question because it's it wasn't just this week and that's\nYou know after the first three weeks of the season they were being talked about as one of the best teams in the league and the defense was claiming well and then all of a sudden the last few weeks it's gone the other way and so I think a certain part of it is the fence hasn't been very good\nAt Blake ... late ... hasn't played well they haven't had a letter for net and they've also head injuries to the receivers and so when you're not\nDoing any the phone you're not doing anything on our fence then your defenses out on the field even more\nThan it normally is and if you don't have the leaves me looking at looking at the ... the jaguars would have been a lot of games last year when they get a lead and they just come after people and that's when you get a lot of sex in the NFL\nWhen when you're when you're the team that's leading well they haven't been ahead a lot in the last few weeks the fence isn't doing much at all the sudden they find themselves you know in big trouble so it it's like you said it that's a part of it and I think that's a big part of it because most of the personnel\nIt's still the same there are a little banged up jailing rounds he's been been playing a little bit hurt and and and some of those things but overall it's it's pretty much the same talent but offensively they're not playing as well and that that's a team that's still pretty much around the run\nAnd portals plays well there'll be in the game and play well but if he doesn't then they're going to have problems\nIs so true our goals are our guests of the sports exchange go to the sports the same website you can follow Howard work on Twitter HBO's seven to one\nPost pet but at the New York giants trading or you I met him but I I just don't see how you live

Irish ... still undefeated they got a victory over Pittsburgh on Saturday Night pain to fourteen Peter ... is our guest a beat writer covering Notre Dame for the athletic you can follow people work on Twitter at peace\nOn Saturday Nineteen fourteen Simpson is our guest beat writer covering Notre Dame for the athletic you can follow the work on winter happy stamped in the heat loss you know when you look at this schedule that Notre Dame had a following that win over Virginia Tech were merely that following the winner gets Stanford\nAnd to me I looked at in that OK relatively easy but this is college football any given week anything can happen or were you surprised that the struggle that Notre Dame had with it for this past weekend and why did they struggle so much [noise]\nI definitely will surprise I mean the the reasons that they've struggled I I think are multiple I mean one side of the midterm exam issue sort of preparations excuse\nEverywhere but I think one of the things that popped up was Ian Book baking is for start at the season has been so good and the previous three probably do me everybody else assume that it was just going to keep getting better and better and\nI think it was a reminder that when it comes to college quarterback who haven't played a whole lot that their progress is in a linear situation that there's going to be ups and downs and I think he had it down and the first pass on an up and the second I'm On top of that like during social teams were\nReally really bad and you give us a kickoff return for a touchdown and then have that all sides on all upon block situation that keeps Pittsburgh's other touchdown drive alive um I think those are really the two big issues that guy that game a lot closer than to shut us\nYou know I was reading the recap of this game and miles boy can was quoted as saying that in book is calm and he's poised and that's one of the reasons why he was able to keep mentally focused and eventually grow that game winning touchdown passes could you see that immediately what the book that he was as boy can close calm employees\nWell he wasn't the first half but he was in the second I I think you sort of got them like borderline ... sort of like on the cocky confidence ... probably or towards cocky a bunch of times then\nI think that the first half he was sort of the un goes a little bit Pittsburg blew them so much and he was seeing some look since the pressures for the first time that\nIt took some time to digest it and took off into quarter chip long some time to figure out okay what's our counter punch here and I think once you've started counter punching and the third quarter\nThat's when you saw during start to move up and down the field of Pittsburgh and big Pittsburgh ... kind of sort of look like what I thought it would look like from the beginning um so I gotta I gotta get fat and heart disease some credit there because he he sort of got Notre Dame ... offensively from the get go and I didn't think that what's going to have a\nDeep sense and our guest covers the Notre Dame fighting Irish pretty athletic you can follow the work on ... at a pizza camps in us oh Dexter Williams he was someone else three touchdown game against Virginia Tech just thirty one year it's on the ground against Pittsburgh why do you think that happens\nI think we all puts on line really struggled and\nThe ... century against Stanford I that was a huge concern when that happened there really very little has occurred since then to make me feel like Notre Dame is gonna be okay or better than okay on the offensive line I think that they've got a passable group up front\nWithout bars but to lose a fifth year senior captain a fellow guy for the rest of the season on the line that was already replacing might put lynching quit now so I think that um\nThat ultimately I think if memory and trips up in the next five games the offensive line injury and death is going to be what gets them so that's the biggest\nThing how as the office of wind been just over the course of the entire season all been met I haven't watched an every Notre Dame I watched all of a bunch of Notre Dame but not start to finish for every single day you have might look let's see in Clinton Nelson I mean those those had to be to the big losses obviously on that line has been really noticeable this year\nAbsolutely and I I think bars leaving has ... reduce some do about one and a half started was returning they have excellent center in San ... but it's really\nAll sorts of new guys filling out the other for positions that I they just have not really settled in I don't I don't think the quarterback changes help the tons because that's that's taken some getting used to sell it it's a position group with a new position coach on top of that um\nI really felt like the friends of mine at the beginning of the year if they could just be good or okay plus that normally would be fine but I really think they've been probably a couple clicks less Matt uh certainly they were last weekend I got the Pittsburgh\nSampson our gas Silvers or negative Notre Dame football for the athletic you can follow his work on Twitter at the same thing so I certainly there's still a positive note what are you most impressed with when it comes to ...\n[noise] I think his accuracy is off the charts or he's number one in the nation in completion percentage like it's about Seventy five percent\nUm I thought against the bullets against Pittsburgh he was very good about eighty percent they're so short game is really really good and that opens up so much for what he wants to do offensively with our titans receivers are running backs these guys don't have to work to make catches anymore he hits them in stride\nWhere they want the ball so that's\nThat's been really impressive he's he's so improve from what we saw in limited opportunities last season where he started at North Carolina came in and the ball game um it really has a command up whatever he wants to do offensively so that's that's impressed me the most with that accuracy\nDid you foresee this switch happening when it did when it comes to quarterback\nI thought it was going to happen at some point but\nI think even the coaches would tell you in a private moment that they had no idea how it was going to go they felt like this was a real role of the dice to go for ... but they knew there was a ceiling with what they're doing it could be with one Bush a quarterback and maybe it's a feeling would be the same with book maybe we'll be lower um maybe with a higher they didn't really know so\nTo roll the dice on it um I thought it was going to happen at some point I'm not ... I couldn't sit here and tell you that I knew what was going to happen against Wake Forest I definitely couldn't tell you that it would go the way that it's gone but I think at some point that we're going to have to play\nFor you know we we seen this in college football this year it seems that every team has gone to their quarterback who\nPotentially yeah I'd like to use the word you know potentially could give them more explosive authentic Alabama choosing to over ... wouldn't hurt slept with the quarterback changed with Trevor Lawrence Ohio State now that you're doing is obviously can throw the ball really act like you said just overall\n... in college football this year Notre Dame was influenced by let's just use Alabama as an example to what comes in and they basically when the national championship because he's the guy who can stretch the field and make the big play do you think the fact that other teams are doing that had something to do\nWith Notre Dame changing and saying hey look we can potentially have an explosive often says well\nNo I I really don't I ... in some ways I think the opposite of ... is true I think that's why they went with when Bush to begin with because he's ... he's the guy that can sample of fifty are drawn to throw the ball Seventy five yards no problem what he couldn't do is the short accurate\nSort of boring passes that everyone throws and nobody thinks about it but during that complete those passes that it really struck down what they could be offensive way so I I think in the way that\nSugar Lawrence is a scarier a you know pass or to Kelly Bryant or at Georgia with justice field just incredible athlete compared to ... really good certainly to a jail it hurts I think\nKelly Bryant or at Georgia with justice field this incredible athlete compared to shake crime was really good certainly to a jail it hurts I think Notre Dame went from an elite athlete they're just they're okay outweigh the quarterback rot because he's so accurate that is what was the most important thing and that's really what opened up their off\nFor the Sampson is our guest covers the Notre Dame fighting Irish for the athletic you can follow

you know there's this whole thing where you know typically want to be alone Glenn Taylor wants them gone a cagey saying on live TV that Glenn Taylor doesn't know belief about basketball\nIf how long is that dumpster fire going to rage before they finally make a deal or to send me butler pack and\nI think you're alluding to water the too big a factor and that is wonderful Glenn Taylor get tired of this being an embarrassment\nNow I think to some degree this is the course of this stuff that sometimes you have to go on top players and it's great that window the\nPlayers are disgruntled that they're as competitive as Jimmy ... where I have no doubt he's going to keep playing hard and keep doing things to help the team went as far as the players go it's not so bad I'm not here Glenn Taylor will be the same way there are a lot of negative headlines associated with his team I think about what is going to get ... pretty loudly\nAfter first home game that maybe that is the birth of him in the making of trade\nThe other factors water teams operate so far it doesn't seem like the offer it to have been that great there has not been any reports of anything that super tempting to me the

level of player where I'm going to move a star because of him pound this town boot younger then but we're not quite as good yet but it's only a matter of time because of the age difference\nCan't be too upset because he signed that contract extension knowing butler had been created yet if towers were really upset by it he could have waited\nMaybe even not signed the extended or at least try to move closer to yesterday's extension deadline and so that makes me believe yeah could be workable work chemistry was not good between those three last season but they're both still want a lot of games that made the playoffs [laughter]\nYeah I think Kevin ruby worth this year but it's not just the starting point with something positive or over the place [noise]\nDan Feldman pro basketball talk NBC
