{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WFAW", "content": "Issue that is frankly not being dealt with by either party and the legislature\nSo I look forward to talking more about that as this evening goes along [noise]\nMS Word or tell us why you were running and what would be your top priorities if you were to be elected\nThank you very much to the three chambers of commerce to Mr Gary Douglas to W. F. A. W. as well as the American association of university women I appreciate your time everyone else in the audience for being concerned about the issues and understanding the candidates [noise]\nMy name is Melissa wink er and I'm running for assembly districts thirty eight to be a voice for you in Madison I'm a first time candidate and nationally board certified public school teacher of Seventeen years small business owner a third generation district resident and a mama for my husband is a firefighter paramedic\nI Am running for Wisconsin families\nTo have access to affordable health care quality education clean water and the jobs they need to thrive under the Walker administration we're paying more for less when it comes to health care our public schools have been defunded to the point\nOf degradation wages for working people have stagnated poverty is increasing our rivers and lakes are polluted or in peril roads and bridges are crumbling this our picture goes against everything we value in Wisconsin\nWhere the common good has always been our guide\nMy opponent sees no problem with the situation would simply go along with whatever Walker administration wants\nOur community values collaboration balance response of government that respects all over the voices in our community we live in Wisconsin because of our families are forced some lakes\nAre historically great Wisconsin schools and neighbors to truly care for each other the protections we're fighting for our generational\nEducation that last far beyond what we see protected waters force in wildlife that wouldn't be here for our grandchildren families to standing wages that lifts people out of poverty to achieve the American dream\nI have talked to people across the district to listen to over seven open to the public meetings and strongly believe in a system that respects the voices of our communities once again we deserve representatives that show up\nListen understand and will work for us\nOur first question is for ms were more local\nGovernments have churned we'll taxes to fund street repairs rope constructions you support this trend or do you favor alternative revenue options and what would those be\nAre real quality right now links rings forty fourth in the nation\nThinks the lack of investment in the name of budget frugality\nThis is a blatant disregard for public safety and we the working families of Wisconsin are bearing the costs as we pay out of pocket increase car insurance premiums and repairs and risks to our\nFamily family's more than twenty four percent of every transportation dollar goes back to paying that interest\nAnd that has doubled in the last eight years we must be fiscally responsible and address this issue as it will cost us more in the long run this is one of my top priorities harboring and families know that we must address safety and transportation issues with smart\nFiscally sound policy not pass the debt on to our children\nGas tax used to have an automatic indexed with costs of living before the legislators all remove this after reviewing our ... current budget priorities I Would take this question back to our communities and listening sessions and review possibilities to make sure we care for our road and prioritize them in our budget\nWas different\nMore local governments of turn the wheel taxes to fund street repairs road construction you support this trend or do you favor alternative rebuttal options and what would those be\nActually I Am more in favor of returning to the indexing are um gas tax\nTo inflation um but I Will say what concerns me as our counties and our municipalities actually using the tax dollars that were intended to be for roads actually for roads\nRather than rolling them into their general fund this has been a problem in a few of our communities\nAnd I think that we can start to address that problem more aggressively if we start prioritizing our budgets just like we all have to in our own homes and use the money for which it was intended now the governor has said that his intention is to\nUm now that we've got the zoo interchange handled\nLook more towards the rural roads\nI'm being worked on um but again it's prioritizing and the state just like any of us have to do in our own personal budgets\nAre next question was did Britten given the demand for an educated and prepared workforce fewer educational policies in Wisconsin are serving the needs of students and employers what if anything needs to change\nI I don't think it's necessarily completely I'm addressing the needs of our um players I Will tell you at the door as I hear\nCitizens complaining that I'm workers Kennedy and come back change to them\nThat's to me reflects a failure in our educational system if our kids can't even do simple math in their heads are pound facts change we we've got a problem folks so we have to um really get back to basics with education and make sure\nOur kids have the basic skills they need to thrive and the job market\nI Would also encourage and I know we're having this movement now towards the trades more every child is not\nUm ... directed towards a college education job um we need more workers in the trades so I'm In favor of schools\nAre opening up those opportunities more to our students um as we kind of really work on um the the more ... of our worker needs\nThis week we're starting question given the demand for educated unprepared workforce do you feel educational policies in Wisconsin are serving the needs of students and employers what if anything needs to change\nUm I taught school for almost two decades from kindergarten to an adjunct lecturer at UW Madison I'm a national board educated\nA teacher and I do\nFrom kindergarten to an adjunct lecturer at and you know we Madison I'm a national board educated a teacher and I do see there's a gap between the skills we need and the workforce this is why our education agenda is so critical\nWe need to develop the right labor pipeline for jobs needed today and tomorrow we need to invest critically into our K. through twelve higher ed and trade school at necessary levels\n[noise]\n[noise] I see first hand the terrible effects of our budget cuts\nOver the last eight years class sizes in our district where I teach have already doubled in some areas districts have trouble retaining the best teachers programs have been eliminated and test scores are dropping in recent years in my district a library position was posted and no one applied\n\nPrivate voucher schools have scammed one million to one hundred and one four hundred and eighty nine dollars from our public schools and two the two ... two thousand Seventeen Eighteen general aid reduction in just our Senate district\nThirteen that are you that's your public tax dollars going to run private schools\nAt this time these same private voucher schools are not held accountable for the funds they receive they do not have the same rigorous testing they do not need to provide the services they are not allowed to keep safe funding they are allowed to keep seek funding even if a student has returned to the public school system this addresses a critical need in funding\nOur public education as a priority when we do not fully fund our public schools we had not adequately address our economy and our job and he's we need to seriously look at this issue as a state and it's a community and where funds are going\n\nOur next question excuse me are like ... and I'm Sorry about\nThat\nI Would say regarding um the funding for schools it concerns me that children on the lower end of the income level are stuck\nIn a school that may not be serving their names that is why I'm for the choice program I think that if our public schools are meeting all their needs there won't be a desire to go to a choice school\nIn my job and working with special needs families I've had many families who have been extremely frustrated with public schools\nAnd their only option was to choose\nThe choice schools to break the cycle that they were facing in their public school\nI Believe there is no such thing as nonpartisan if you went around this room every one in this room has a partisan slant\n[noise] what I Do believe is that perhaps bipartisan work on this needs to take place\nIf you have a non partisan committee appointed who gets to appoint says who is that a ... committee ... to ... I Believe in accountability and government\nAnd I also don't kid myself believing in nonpartisan because frankly it doesn't exist let's be realistic people if we want to solve this problem let's have a bipartisan committee to get it done\nAnd it's worth where would you support a nonpartisan redistricting process perhaps using population size as those Iowa\nI strongly support a nonpartisan independent organization to redraw or Wisconsin district map light the Iowa model\nOur communities deserves to be represented fairly at the state level this is just open and fair government this issue as a top concern in the endorsement process of the Wisconsin state journal\nLike many in our community they believe also in a non partisan fair and open government system they believe in transparency and open meeting lawn\nI was proud to earn their endorsement this is a critical issue of our communities we believed in open fair government\nBehalf of all of our sponsors we'd like to thank you very much for participating here the the big we'd like to give each of you for final opportunity to stay why to the people you represented the assembly district thirty should vote for you\nThe big we'd like to give each of you are final opportunity as to why to the people you represented the assembly district thirty should vote for you and I'm as Dietrich we'll start with you\nThank you once again I Want to close this evening by thinking the Fort Atkinson Jefferson in Watertown chamber of commerce\nThose of you who came out tonight those listening\nThe daily Jefferson County union W. F. A. W. and the American association of university women for facilitating this event\nI Hope after tonight's exchange you can see a clear contrast between myself and my opponent if you want to return to the days of oppressive tax burdens increasing income taxes\nProperty taxes gas taxes\nIf you want more regulatory burdens supporting by someone who really has no idea how to make a payroll or manage implies\nIf you want to have someone who has never experienced a three hundred thousand dollar a year prescription bill nor has experience in legislative advocacy for those with chronic illnesses deciding what's going to be done with your health care\nIf you want students painted into a corner in a school that's just not working\nFor them than ms wind currents your candidate folks [noise] however if you want to continue\nWith the progress we've made and lowering taxes reducing unemployment's under three percent for the eight straight month in a row returning our state's manufacturing jobs a variety of options\nFor educational quality in Wisconsin respecting life of every age stage inability lowering\nHealth insurance premiums and deductibles while continuing to ensure that are most vulnerable citizens are cared for\nAnd finally rolling up your sleeves and confronting the mental health care issues in the state\nThan I Am your candidate I asked for your vote in November sex to represent you and the thirty eighth assembly district thank you\nThis work what are your clothes and comments please this winter I'm sort of apologize okay [noise]\nMelissa Winter I'm running to be your voice in Madison I Will address the serious challenges faced by our families and\nCommunities today accessing health care and affordability of medications educating our children fair wages as opposed to stagnant wages clean air and water my opponent has not one mention protection for clean air and water\nThere is a reason that Wisconsin is having trouble attracting and retaining young people it wasn't always like this and it doesn't have to be this way we can pass legislation and the state budget that addresses our priorities the differences between me and I point my opponent or clear I've talked to thousands of people in our district\nMet with community groups attended forums is local farms attended neighborhood meetings held numerous open meet and greets I'm responsive will listen and ... voices every district residents and experts that people in our community want a leader who will use collaboration\nFairness and expertise quite policies that help us all prosper the people in our community repeatedly emphasize the need for affordable accessible health care our schools and our clean water and creation of jobs with supporting wages\nAre state over the last eight years has prioritized large businesses over our hardworking Wisconsin nice repeatedly our states allow the\nLarge donors to write laws that impact our daily life this is not the Wisconsin we aspire to be\nMy partner has asked to participate in a nonpartisan public education forums and she refused my opponent was asked to debate and the ... the largest voting community for district and she was not available for any of the dates offered if she's not available now for us why would she be available for you after November ...\nI Am and will always be an advocate for a great communities a strong voice to protect\nAnd preserve the best of who we are I sincerely impressed I appreciate your investment in understanding of the issues knowing your potential representative and I hope to have the honor of burning your vote in two weeks on November sex\nThank you for your time so if you very much ladies were participating in our program is either [noise]\n\nHere so I Will just say well\nThat I Apologize to a candidate ... of the copy the copy that I was given haired your name which are\nYes it was not printed correctly on my copy and I apologize for that I was the early apologized for that at this time we'd like to invite the candidates for the forty third assembly district to go to the table\nAnd again I Would like to ask all of you if you would have a conversation with the previous candidates to move out to the lobby area so we can continue on where you have a tough time scheduled to leave here tonight so I thank you very much [noise]\nThere's a debate is brought to you by the ... percent of Watertown chambers of commerce and sponsored by the American association of university women the daily Jefferson County union a nine forty W.

so we can continue on with these gentleman\n\nI Apologize gentleman were trying to move this round as quickly as we can years will back you for your patients a gentleman uh\nI Apologize gentleman trying to move this out as quickly as we can hear so thank you for your face\nA gentleman uh we're facing off for the or simply forty three districts seats and Mr ... and we'll begin with you this evening\nBelieving everybody and thank you for all who showed up and thank you to the radio stations in the house for inviting me to this form this evening I appreciate it out of the reason I Am not being in running is because I Do care very deeply about the forty third and the surrounding communities from militant itself\nI'm growing up in a small town atmosphere as well as the surrounding communities in small town I'm a huge advocate for that as well as a small town atmosphere and two thousand and Fifteen the fall twenty Fifteen my family had a dark hour when I was in college and working full time\nOne of my sisters passed away the age of thirty or as you can imagine during that dark time yes we've got the usual casserole from our friends and families are but the communities and everybody in the forty third came together for our family so I'm standing up to give back to them 'cause they gave so much not only to myself but to my family and that is near and dear to my heart and I will never\nThat they're doing a job they love when you do a job you love you're never going to work a day in your life you're just doing what you love hands down and that's why you know I've talked to many people in other fields like doctors and lawyers and everything and they say you know it's\nNot about the paycheck necessary it's about the fact that I'm doing what I Love and I'm taking care of people in my community\nRepresentative or wake the state's fence about one billion dollars in state tax dollars annually at the University of Wisconsin system\nDo you support or oppose an increase in state funding for the system budget and why [noise]\nUh I definitely support the increase in the state budget because for for our you W system because right now we're spending one point two billion on our prison system and one billion on our on our W system as a priority seemed like they might be twisted around\nAnd our state is losing qualified professors to other research universities or you know you'll be Madison has lost half researchers other universities because we don't pay them as well as other universities do my brother was a professor in Kansas for a number of years and he made a\n... a lot more money he never wanted to come back to Wisconsin because they paid them a lot better at Kansas State university than it would have paid him at University of Wisconsin\nAnd he was a research professor in in the business world and so I I Believe to keep our millenniums in the state and we need to create high quality educated jobs\nSearch out those research dollars because you W has been a major benefactor of those and continue to try to to get our other universities to get research grants as well\nAnd so I'm a supporter of increasing budget and taking money away from the prison system which I which I Will dress how we can do that later on\nOur next question for represented ... what is your stance on expanding Medicaid in Wisconsin versus the current model\nI'm I'm I'm a believer that we need to expand and insurance for all and that we need to get more people that we are I'm a believer in in everybody having health insurance and everybody should pay something for their health insurance\nAnd everybody should be covered and for the conditions that might exist for them now I'm we we I looked at some money that we have\nI'm not taken from the federal government which\nHas been in the millions of dollars that we could've used for health care system and and then taking money from er from our prison system that we could\nUse for healthcare system and and we could cover more people and so uh what what I see happening is that we can not\nCovered the people we need\nWe cannot find we have a shortage of nurses and when we talked about um health care we also have to talk about the rural hospitals are closing the rural under a nursing homes that are closing and so we need to expand so people can afford to live in the costs keeps going up and we can't supply the needs for rural areas that we need\n\nFor so long what is your stance on expanding Medicaid in Wisconsin versus the current model\nNeed to have direct primary care Madonna you need to have your healthcare between you and your doctor I Love going into my doctor's office right now he knows exactly who I Am as an individual first off\nBut he also knows me on how I've been healthy he doesn't have to look at a chart and read it for about the first five minutes to get an idea of your medical history itself so direct care is the way to go about it\nIt doesn't have to look at a chart and read it for about the first five minutes to get an idea of your medical history itself\nSo direct care is the way to go about it\nWe also need to start educating or the people that are in are you W systems that are going into health care as a profession itself whether you're being an ER doctor a neurosurgeon a nurse itself on the benefits of staying in Wisconsin\nNow I'm a young guy I'm the youngest guy running for state assembly in the entire state I understand firsthand what it's like going after a big paycheck right after you got to college\nYou better believe with my student loans I Want to get those paid off as fast as possible but there's other benefits to staying within Wisconsin other than a paycheck itself and that is knowing your patients knowing your community and being there for them and take care and take care of them itself\nAgain I go back to the love that my doctor knows me as an individual versus on a chart and a number and trying to prioritize what needs to be done in the next step for my health care itself\nOur next question given that our region's economic growth has been on an even since the two thousand eight recession and Mr serve on we'll start with you I'll start from the top again given that our region's economic growth has been even since the two thousand a recession\nWhat steps would you take to promote development in the communities that you represent\nThat as an excellent question itself a with\nBeing males in itself I have watched since two thousand eight my father being a small business owner or the strongest that we have gone through not only as a family itself the watching my other friends and their families go through struggles\nWith being a small business owners themselves and they are now starting to get their feet underneath them again since two thousand eight it's been ten years it takes some time to rebuild that business and to grow it again itself\nSo we need to start working with small businesses in the area to encourage that growth itself now the market will take effect offer wages and everything like that just like anything else Amazon announced that it's going to give up a pay increase and that was the market that wasn't any government stepping in and saying hey you need to raise the minimum wage itself market well taken effect\nFor that to increase that but we also again going back to education I'm a strong advocate for education we need to teach the benefits\nAre going through a K. through twelve system it doesn't matter if you want to be a doctor or a small business owner we all start out with that K. through twelve education and start basic knowledge is our foundation we need to talk to those kids growing up on what they want to do for a job or a career itself and the benefits of staying within certain communities or certain types of communities\nAre in order to grow the business itself or to go into that career or advancing into that a doctorate degree or whatever it may be in the benefits of staying in the state itself\nRepresentative or wing given that our region's economic growth has been an even since the two thousand eight recession which status would you take for both of development in the communities you represent\nYou have to look at where the growth in Wisconsin is growing and if you look at a growth chart in Wisconsin the growth is along a two lane or four lane highways\nAnd so through our district we have the interstate going through\nI'm already working with a developer and new though to develop a convention center in New bill which would help because we have nine campgrounds within five miles of the area\nI brought the DOT down and we need to make some adjustments changes and we're looking at that so I'm excited about working that next session we found out that we can super or I'm\nNot have to follow all federal regulations if we can get money out of the of the joint Finance Committee which I've got some people are already working on that area for us\nI just such a highway fourteen upgrade which is going to help uh Madison to Oregon Evansville area because that's going to be upgraded it's going to be some safety features put in which will ... help attract business because we look for businesses go it goes along those court orders\nWhere we have four lane highway so that's what's the trend that's been happening lately\nAnd this is why I'm a part of the greater whitewater community there advocating for a four lane highway to Utah to be white water the only university it doesn't have a four lane highway a big advocate of that I've I've been in speaker boss's office advocating for that the greater white white communities advocating Fort we've got some\nUm commitment from speaker boss and he was going to put this back into the ... budget plan next year because we know that white wire which happens to be the poorest city of its size in Wisconsin could benefit greatly from a four lane highway\nTo Foxconn box cutters reality forty five minutes from a white water to Foxconn with a four lane highway\nCertainly would provide temp potential workers on the connection from that city to to Foxconn in Foxconn B. R. Y. or to be in a business school would would be a good reality so I'm already taking those steps to try to help my district by looking where the growth is and promoting those areas\nAre next question representative ... would you support a ban on semi automatic weapons in Wisconsin\nUm [noise] you know I'm I'm not a gun owner I'm I I I'll\nBe honest I never shot again in my life even though I grew up in the farm and there was a reason for it is or when I was five years old when I'm quite a hunting accident where he shot\nHis cousin and it caused me great anxiety so guns and I don't get along\nBut I Am a supporter of sensible gun laws growing up on the farm we had ... you know we were hunters my family were hunters uh they are guns um\nYou know I I guess I support you know I don't want people to have guns that the police don't have I don't want the police officers to be all gun\nWhen they're going out on the call so I'm I'd have to see what the legislation says I Want it to be sensible I Would probably check with gun owners I'm gun owners in my district who\nAre you know or I'm\nSensible gun owners I usually I usually seek advice from them because they didn't give me good advice because I get I've got two sides of the stream I I I'm from ones and are a person one isn't it already person they both on guns abortion guns\nUm so if I see legislation I could give you a better answer and what you know what the particulars would be\nApple making good on its plans to go completely green one hundred percent of its offices retail locations and data center now run on

case for star loan\nI Believe that that was his first guy you have to uh introduced um [noise]\nHow are definitely a Mac [noise]\nBut yeah it was it was hard because you're talking about a guy that had the hall of fame numbers\nBut there were other issues that\nHad to be addressed and so it wasn't just a conversation about\nThe guy as a player it had to go beyond the field because I I don't know that anybody really questioned his credentials as far as what he did on the field but it got very difficult when you start factory man and trying to figure out how much to factor in\nThe off the field stop [noise]\nWhile the state's going to be a lot easier for you I can assure you of that and now she's got deal in the hall so what do you believe is the most deserving forty nine player who's not yet been in trouble [noise]\nIt's a tough call\nUm\nDo you look at a\nRecent history of the forty niners and the two names that come to mind are\nRoger Craig who was a finalist on year but never really got any traction and then a guy that I Would like to see it into the room which is Bryant Young guy who is you know kind of anti trio and a lot of ways where\nYou know he was a good performer but he would probably even a more solid individual\nBut the one guy that build walls to always talked about who he thought should be in the hall of fame is Billy well if he was a very good wide receiver or end in those days on a team that had the million dollar backfield\nOr but Wilson led the league in in receiving several times uh one thing that don't wash always said was that Wilson was that guy that when the when the Cold War was an actual competitive game for both teams are trying their heart is still in it he was the MVP of that game so\nI Know he's not gonna you know he's he's in the hands of the seniors to marry but I'd like to see the building wealth and who passed away a almost two decades ago now I'd like to see him get his\nYou know his turn to be in Canton\nAmerica has been great and forty nights war and in the eighties and nineties they seemed to have him on just a light attendants can he look in the seventies rated players and the Packers with a with a level of players and why do you think they ask why such a great team had so much weddings\nHe's white and they're all the recommendations\n[noise]\nYou know my thought is probably the star power was just so big he had no Walsh a I think a lot of people kind of\nThink of him as the guy that made it all possible and a guy that took players who maybe weren't hall of fame caliber and turn them into you know championship teams I'm a ... that would be my gas and then you know you have Joe Montana had Jerry Rice you have run a lot\nI mean those guys are considered these three of the best players not only their position the three of the best players period and the history of the NFL\nSo I think a lot of ways those guys kind of overshadowed everybody else and so that's why you know a guy like Roger Craig who was so instrumental and he was a guy that really unable to build walls to open up his playbook\nAnd use the the running back out of the backfield or you know Roger Craig is the first thousand thousand guy in NFL history\nAnd there's only been one other guy that do it ... so\nYou know the thing that kinda hurts Roger Craig who all those things I think it would be the next guy is that his rushing numbers you know aren't huge is receiving numbers aren't huge but it's that combination and I think a lot of people look at that and and don't see the eye popping numbers that from a skilled position\nPlayer you want to see it'd be the vote them into the hall of fame\nYou know you brought the name in in in Bryant Young who was a Ninety nine he's all decade player he went to pull a full bowl a pharmacy plan a bit of a tough spot defensive tackle the masses\nSuggesting that people would know this stuff but what about him or in your mind in the hall of famer because his name does come up with people who really kind of know that she has a blind position\nI honestly think he was a better players and worn down\nHis sack numbers are comparable but I think he was better against the ... the thing that he did he was just a tremendous leader good locker them guy\nUh everything I mean he's you know the players get the ... out of work to the player who chose courage and leadership and he won that thing like six times a day and that's what an honor that Romney lot never even the one in his career\nVoted on by the the players the name of Brian young was he was so quiet\nHe was such a just a team guy he never spoke up he never drew attention to himself he didn't have a ... dance he did it say flashy things in the media and so a lot of times I think with him he kinda faded away people really didn't recognize how great he was you know you mentioned as a defensive tackle\nYou know he's not getting you know twelve or Fifteen sacks every year he had some very good seasons are but he was just a stalwart on you know some some pretty good teams\nToward the end of his career that the forty are starting to fade a little bit but just that just solid professional and you know a guy that\nThirty one teams in the leg would want to have on their team as a as a focal point of the defense so\nI definitely think he's worthy and I you know I'm disappointed that he's never even made you know the top twenty five I don't believe a and I think he is certainly worthy of of getting in that room as a as a final Fifteen Percent and hearing the case for Brian young I say he's where they\nSaid I'm with you I'm going well here's a guy that thing quaint ten years one poll on reception of three times\nHe plays in the million dollar back ... ball families don't Perry numerical any John Henry Johnson white though he's the only skill and ... how difficult would it be to bring his case to the table for all we played it normally that we're looking at now in the modern era\nFor wide receivers well yeah\nI don't I ... that's the job of the senior committee to be able to\nWait a number yet we're looking at now in the modern era for wide receivers well\nI don't know that that's the job of the senior committee it'd be able to Wade through the numbers and look at it and and you had the contact of history I mean let's face it now with quarterbacks and with wide receivers when when you look at\nThe numbers of a decade ago [noise]\nYou know it's tough enough to where those numbers with those players now because of the the rules changes but when you go back you know thirty forty fifty years now it just becomes almost impossible you cannot buy a pair\nGuys in different eras than the number why do you have to look at the numbers of the era where the players were playing and so it was Billy will send you know it it's not going to be popping numbers based on what people know uh enter used to today but you got to look at it\nFrom how how dominant player was in his era how uh

get to run back in the top of the fourth day but then the red Sox just respond immediately in that fifth any they get right you out of the game\nAnd it was you know it was it was inaccurate the front of him or walk to start the at it\nAnd then the bullpen walked in the guy with the bases loaded and a JD Martinez you know another hit with two outs really every ... again I give you the number yesterday the Boston Red Sox this postseason came into this game with thirty two of their run being scored on two out\nIt's just absolutely incredible\nThen of course you got David Price to a dynamic David Price six innings three hits and to run a you know here's David we know about David Price just struggle they are well documented in October but its price told you before the game look this white came to Boston to pitch in the playoffs\nOr for a whole lot of a sober baseball is swung came to Boston or new we will be in this position you know you're in you're out so I'm happy that we have made it to this point\nYeah and they are at the point where they are probably going to take the series so look this thing goes back to Los Angeles I don't know the I don't see the Dodgers coming but they just this is the red socks dear\nLike when you just do this that there is just books already like scripts or being written they're just doing everything possible correctly so when this thing and I think that I said that they were going to win six games I'm Still I might be five games I think they did you use either the red Sox\n... how many games the Dodgers are going to get out in LA so friday the record cello is on the ... okay for Boston he just sick of all our this is the first World Series started his career Walker ... will go to Los Angeles okay where are you going to make an amendment to your prediction Bobby we both said Red Sox insects\nBoston has been so dominant I Do think a lot of it has to do with them being at home\nOkay but at the same time the Dodgers you seen the Dodgers like having a big old rockets crowd like Fenway Park does idle body would you like to make an amendment at all I don't I'm going to go Red Sox and five now\nSo so you go with the gentleman sweet or outside I'll take the gentleman sweep as well I'll go file about making a man and change my or pick because I say six at first as well Sagal with five I think to get it and the gentleman so doctors can pull up at least one game mail\nYeah so I think they get one game I think they'll get one day but the ...\nThe Dodgers just what's amazing to me again as their starting pitching a ... like ... was doing just fine he was doing exactly what you were supposed to do and then the red Sox just have this one big inning and even in that and that's it then it wasn't even like they were hitting all that well it was just walk after walking you ... you cannot do that against the Boston Red Sox oh\nLook I think the red Sox are going to easily take this World Series they went tonight over the Los Angeles

Seventy times in the second worst team had their quarterback it like forty nine dots when I see it sound like that I'm like how can that quarterback\nDisdain for the entire season do you think the Texans are going to do something I mean did it last week they had to go on a bus to Jacksonville you could take precautionary measures put in game do you see the Texans changing a game plan or ... or doing something\nTo help prevent the hits against Watson down the road\n[noise] yeah I think while 'cause it probably a pretty decent formula I mean he's still got hit a subject that all the time they're going to get home a little bit but they they only got one back I think uh you know the ... the box so I think\nHe got hit six times in the game which all things considered a pretty pretty decent day for that off the line um the way they did it was that they ... have you on the run\nA it was a whole lot of alarm our and offered the blue\nAnd then when they didn't do any kind of passing it was a lot of short passing and plant routes and out routes and um you know scream passes a lot of underneath stuff\nOr that kind of be a waste of when you have guys like you know\nOr the ... and and ... and well for your you really want to kind of pushed the ball down the field but if you're going to establish the wrong you can kind of slow down those past pressures so that's that's really what they've got to be more than anything I thought they'd get a ... a bad job of rolling a big role in\nThe short walk them into trouble a lot earlier in the years though if they can just kind of\nSituations were passer aren't paying their ears back that I think that's probably the best way to do it because you're not just you're just not going to magically start barking\nYeah no no exactly Adam ... is our guest covers the NFL for SB Nation you can follow Adam work on Twitter that Adam site so the favorite coming into this year and this division was obviously the Jacksonville Jaguars they sit here and three and four we know the record when it comes to ... he's just better in London and he just is\nA detail but having said that do grown did say that ... there's going to be on a short leash what do you think a short leash is defined as when it comes to ... this week\nI wouldn't be surprised if it's very short considering the way you can play it um when he came in they were pretty much immediately better ... they were moving the ball down the field and and they\nPay for all this imbalance off to jail than say I've been doing these the interception yup that there are about the score a second touchdown and make it out and make it a game so\nUh I don't think there's a whole lot of room for error for like ... are kind of a staff starting team they need a leader early so if they come out with for an hour we turn over or you know ... the first two or three possessions I I don't think he's going to be around the half time even\nYeah I Do I'll be very curious what that looks like a a let's suppose to the age of the north and the Steelers the bangles and the ravens they're all kinds of bunch together right now when you watch the bangles the chiefs okay obviously the cheese to it I mean the big score differential do you think that that was more about the chief skinny\nBetter defensively or the bangles starting to tumble often simply\nYeah that was that was pretty ... and and they followed a week where they didn't play very well off against the Steelers which is another team that has had a lot of defensive struggle so uh when it's back to back games like that you really have to kind of\nA pickle ... so what what what's going on and Cincinnati um\nYou know Andy Dalton is what he is you know if your item or a card game he seems to play a whole lot better than a ... or prime time but um he's probably going to continue to be a guy with a eighty to Ninety pass or anything and and good enough um\nSo I don't think they all of a sudden tank and they've they've started corn meal ten points a game like they did last week but ah yeah it's just kind of a middle of the pack team I think\n... you know we've always kind of say that went about it is like it's ... it's just a Marvin Lewis team but I'll be ... like Adam I remember watching that game against the ravens I Believe it was a Thursday Night Football game week to week three something like that\nAnd that was when I started to really believe in the bangles because they did it against Baltimore who's probably the best defense or at least the most consistent defense across football this this entire season is there anything you can point to the Cincinnati was doing early in the season and they just aren't doing right now because they look darn good against Baltimore\n[noise] yeah I I I Want to say maybe or that they they were stabbed wishing that run early on a lot better job makes it really had a great start to beer and and he hasn't been as effective lately ah you know against the chief he only had fifty rushing are\nYou're going to need to be able to establish the run that she's going to have a good run to the fans 'cause that that's a pretty pretty staggering lead bad number against them so\nIf you can establish the run it really does wonders for for everybody else and you know that that raven the fans like you said it's been consistently good\nSense than but I'm ... ... they did have some injuries early on and off the they're mostly earlier not game so uh I think that might have been a kind of a ... performance by the ravens\nBut ah yeah Jo mixing has really I think the key to that Bengals often\nYeah Adam ... is our guest covers the NFL for SB Nation you can fall out of work on Twitter at Adams sites so the two rookie quarterback\nIt's awesome yeah Adam scientist or gas covers the NFL for SB Nation you can fall out of work on Twitter at Adams sites so the two rookie quarterback for the most polarizing this year Baker Mayfield and Sam ... to me they both have tossed match up to the ... matchups this week\nA Steelers coming off the ... on the road played Pittsburgh and then us Sam ... New York jets going to play a bears scene that's lost to enroll the bears decent look great at the beginning of the year\nOr do you see both of those rookie struggling this week and who do you think has the better we\nTook the two\nUh I think probably Baker Mayfield um I I I think I like that match up and then facing Cleo Mac lab bears I'm\nSo I'm just playing pretty well as the way I think Sam Donaldson I had a pretty solid rookie year but he's a guy and he's always been a guy who is probably going to turn over the fall a little bit\nAnd the bears are team that kind of drives off of turnover so I wouldn't be surprised if he throws you know at least two interceptions maybe has a following their uh that's kind of been the standards outlined for him ah I I think Baker does a little bit better\nI mean ... Peterson is tomorrow we're going to grant Petersen on the show a Vegas podcaster does a lot of stuff I Want to hear him every week\nWhy is the Redskins giants game only a one point favorite for Washington I noticed is on the road where to get more to the giants yard sale coming up next our\nI cannot figure out why Washington is only at one point favorite against New York this week I guess I mean the the division rival\nUm you know and why should say really don't have any off as a weapon you know I'm an agent Peter saying but but the giants and want to yeah they were yeah yeah I mean they wanted to ... I'm a giants fan when if they lose the game yeah\nYeah I mean I don't know I don't know that's a weird way and that's a weird it's like there's always that one game every single week where I got to ask Greg about I've been tweeting Greg a lot recently like direct messaging him ... and into those DMZ Bobby because I Need to I I like I look at\nWind sometimes that I'm like why [noise] and I asked about the patriots game you know ... they are patriots are going to cover no problem I have some questions about that a starting Michelle's hurt but [noise]\nI got to ask about that what Redskins minus one and I would have thought I Would have been like at least a field goal records have everything to play for the giants are literally putting their players out on the front lawn and sang who wants to do overnight ... radio [noise]\nNine ... do you ever got what you were born outcomes and online at nine forty WMA use on the job\n[noise]\nABC News John jokes he was in the secret\nService FBI another federal law enforcers are investigating the seven package bombs delivered to President Trump's critics including Hillary Clinton President Obama congresswoman Maxine Waters of California and also to CNN ABC News chief justice correspondent Thomas latest in the investigation\nPages combing through the parts to determine where each item connected to the packages were purchased holding the trail will lead them to a suspect or suspects the package is also being examined for fingerprints or DNA\nSomething in common the bombs have they return address to Congress woman and former DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz law enforcers do not believe she was involved\nWith the White House says President Trump's rhetoric is not to blame for the package bombs Mr Trump tone down his comments city Wisconsin rally for Republican candidates Wednesday evening and even mentioned it to the crowd which cheered by the way\nYou see how nice somebody having to that but it's just like have you ever see in\nA very very well [noise] I Know we can keep it that way right\nBillions against opioid addiction\nPresident Trump at the White House signing a rare to party law would shelves recovering drug addict and ... from delivering drugs who mailed\nTogether we're going to end this gorge of drug addiction in America\nStop act providing billions to stay drug addiction recovery Centers for research and prevention and making it easier for the postal service to sub dealers using the male Andy field ABC News\nNo Powerball tickets sold matches old winning numbers draw on Wednesday nights say lottery officials show Saturday nights jak but they say will be at least seven hundred and fifty million dollars ... fallen moderately on Asian markets after the latest torrent of selling on Wall street the major\nSeven hundred and fifty million dollars\n... fallen moderately on Asian markets after the latest torrent of selling on Wall street\nThe major indexes on Wall street racing their gains so far this year you're listening to ABC News\nEver wonder why Europeans seem to speak so many languages maybe it's because they use battle the number one selling language learning habanero examples award winning technology gets he's peaking right away whether you're learning Spanish French or German and best of all I Do remember what you've learned\nI always thought I was battered languages but after using battle I can tell you I was just on the wrong way using battles ten to Fifteen minute lesson you can be speaking confidently in your new language within weeks I mean I can start having real nice conversation right away it was so sad and now I'm speaking Spanish\nNo wonder battle is the number one selling language learning happen Europe trying for yourself and see my battle is the quick way to get conversational in a new language like Spanish French for more you can try babble for free to go to battle dot com or download the app and try and for free\nThat battle B a B B.

Johnson had a hundred and fifty a yard so we know that the lions have a real hard time commuting to a particular running back I don't think that when Marvin Miller is going to be able to have the explosive runs the carry on Johnson did\nBut based on what we saw last week against Jacksonville on the road and will the vulnerability that we start with that Miami running game but Maher Miller is definitely a a an interesting plug and play and also\nTyler or even if you're looking for a deep deep waiver wire picked up and they got to put in the what was kicking today are now being ruled out he could be moved to the slot and gave him just you and just maybe four or five catches or you know forty to fifty yards that's very much in play for him\nWhat about Oakland ... I'll be honest with you I I have a duty on Louis on by this week in terms of my fantasy football league but the people who have a C kill Eliot on a by I looked at one of the most popular waiver wire pickups at least when it came to running back to this week\nWas Doug Martin it when it comes to projected points because marsh on Lynch's obviously on the entered reserves\nWhat kind of production out of that open office which now has lost ... Cooper we don't really know what it comes to David Carr the production he's going to get do you see Doug Martin being a good plug and play this week\nI Am so not on the muscle hamster bandwagon is ridiculous the over the past three years now and he's only average three and a half yards per Carrie he's going to be that in fact do back\nJust because that's what I find him to do but jailing richer if you're a PBR format and most planes are jailing Richter is the guy that I'm looking at what's going to have more value because the raiders more likely than not are going to be trailing at a majority of games so you have to throw the ball which\nMartin was good but jail on your shower right now he is the guy that gives them more more upside in terms of a PBR back in ... when self I'm choosing between the two I'm actually bypassing Doug Martin\nTo go with jail in return they interesting I might have to make an adjustment there Chris ... is our guest host of that fantasy football so right here on this network SB Nation radio every single Tuesday night you can hear Chris you could follow all of course his work on Twitter at C. M. tub I\nAm kind of forecasting a high scoring game and that colds raiders match up when it comes to colds wide receivers out tied up to see why hill or raiders wide receivers look\nLet's be honest when mark Cooper goes down that someone's going to step up so you mentioned Jew and richer when it comes to wide receivers do you see George ... Nelson a big game and anybody outside of a hill and for the Indianapolis Colts having a big game\nWell I I think when you're talking about journey Nelson somebody's got to absorb those targets and joining alpha naturally would be your your number one option that I Would have to caution though that you do end Jared cooking and Garrett car has that the military\nWhen Jerry Cook so I I think that for most of them are going to go right now you're now says got twenty to catch is thirty one target\nThree hundred twenty three yards and five touched the iron three touchdowns rather you know he averages five targets per game you can look and maybe two to three but I'm not working at a whole lot more other than that you are on the other side you're held and didn't have a great game last week but fantasy owners they were fortunate that\nIt was said by a couple of a bike up touchdown the guy that I Know light and he's a dark you know don't get me wrong and this is Brian Grant remains sideline that we\nCan get Roger or catches the forty cents for targets last week and the win over the bulls not mostly that came on a on a one catch twenty nine year old law where the dean than them down but all in all if you're looking at outside if Ryan Grant is out\nJust a Rogers is the only other guy on that Indianapolis something receiving corps that I Would trust with the oil potentially coming back\nYeah no question about Chris another matchup I see a lot of points in and that's what you gotta look at when you look at\nIndianapolis something receiving corps that I Would trust with Jack the oil potentially coming back\nYeah no question about Chris another matchup I see a lot of points and and that's what you got to look at when you look at these massive a lot of points which means a lot of sand and we want the Tampa Bay buccaneers in the Cincinnati Bengals bangles the fence was absolutely horrible against the Kansas City chiefs but who isn't horrible against the cheese\nAnd when it comes to the Tampa Bay ... there were too wide receivers but Chris that last year to ... last week\nTo me kind of under performed okay Tyler boy had just three catches for twenty seven yards against a miserable ... defense and just Sean Jackson on the other side but the Tampa Bay buccaneers he did not have a cat so I Believe it's a deep and the fourth quarter or maybe it was even overtime do you see just Sean Jackson and Tyler boy getting back on track\nTo me there Sean Jackson is way he admits he's one of those guys that's great in a basketball\nBecause he might get you to catch is for one hundred ten yards and she touched shout butt and other days Matt you're going to get exactly what you get from him and that's not a damn thing on the other side we have more confidence Tyler boy has a safer floor and I think he's also got a higher CLA\nAnd I mean look at Chris God when I I think is starting to get more get more attention uh Mike Evans obviously\nAnd we still don't know what's going on with the running game your fate and Barbara cable play but Ronald Jones out of touch down the boys are there are no question but I'm just I'm so hesitant to plug it into Sean Jackson I Do like Tyler boy to me I think it was just a byproduct of\nCincinnati just not being able to get their off and it's going I mean ha green ad\nBut seven catches a hundred and ten yards midway through the second quarter yeah and they got away from it they got away from them and for the ... I mean a martyr Louis\nSo I don't know what I'm saying hey you know I mean he's puzzle that since the Nineteen nineties it seems like\nA but I think Tyler Boyd overall is likely it's to hire a ceiling

do you see him ... consistently have a good week for the rest of the year and is there a guy or maybe to\nThat you look at it and you say okay maybe they've over achieved over the first half of the regular season and you see a decline for them moving forward so first Adrian Peterson and anybody can come up with who might be over achieving at this point and you could see possibly having a deep down the road\n[laughter] well I mean first of all when it comes to Adrian Peterson you look at what he did in Arizona last year after coming over from you know from New Orleans\n[noise] this is over

fifty one point Kevin Durant adding thirty and that is a total of eighty one point combined as the warriors beat the wizards tonight one forty four to one twenty two\nAnd Bobby all I keep thinking about and I like this is a good thing my dad lives on the east coast and he probably was asleep midway through this forty six points second\nIt's a good thing my dad lives on the east coast and he probably was asleep midway through this forty six points second or first quarter that the Golden State warriors had forty six points in the first quarter the warriors added\nA wizard scored thirty seven but my dad is one of these guys Bobbie who loves the regular season basketball like he's a you know we grew up outside of Washington DC\nUm [noise] and so we had tickets what me growing up you know in Jordan first arrived in DC split it sees a ticket package and it you know we went to a lot of wizards game\nAnd my dad will he used to well he's still does now he'll he'll like tax me\nAfter every wizards game called me after every one of the game they just you know give me the laundry list of things that went wrong the previous night never usually after when it's usually just after losses you wonder why I'm a glass half empty person you should me and my dad Bobby my dad is that way\nOkay so it's fun I Love the conversations that we have about the wizards\nI cannot imagine he has many positive things to say right now about this team wizards were playoffs and not that long ago there one in three they're only when the season coming into overtime on twenty five to one twenty four they have not played a whip the deep end this year\nIn a different way they're going to win it with money they're going to win at the old way okay there are two different ways to create great improv in music you could do it Bobby's way\nYou could have rap that's a good performance but it's one way or you know what my away the jam band music fish going up there but either way you have to just appreciate the greatness of the music\nBecause at the end of the day both ...\nAnd anybody Bobby listens to before the show they're successful and that's what it's about there's no one way to success there is no one way to the top\nThe Astros did a one way and the Boston Red Sox Yankees for years did it another way\nDavid Price was jade de Martinez\nThree hundred and Seventeen million dollars that is the total cost of the contracts for JD Martinez in David threats and you know David Price it was thought to be a bust of a contract to start okay JD Martinez was a free agent that nobody\nReally want it and I'm I don't even know if it's about one when it comes to this this last major league baseball season just confused me until we started having people on the show really started to explain that owners are kind of having a monopoly on the market\nAnd basically you know why it took so long for Jeannie Martinez to get side why it's Michael stock was there was only making a short amount of money is because\nThe baseball owners basically collaborate and said look we are we are sick of paying like Josh Hamilton contracts were sick of paying the Albert pools contracts and and I honestly you can't blame the owners because those are examples of guys who gave you great statistical years for other teams\nAnd then those players expect to be paid for what was done in the past on other teams and so that's why we kind of had this friction\nYou know we had this friction between owner employer\nAnd during this free agent period this off season and shady Martinez ended up winding up with the Boston Red Sox put three hundred and Seventeen million dollars that is the price the Boston Red\nSox paid for a night like tonight I don't want to get to another price that was paid the Lakers played the pay the LeBron James that guy a lotta money okay\nThe Lakers finally get there were first one of the season okay the brunt of the good night but how about ... they only gave me I was talking about the Washington Wizards earlier that guy was on the wizards at one point but now he hits three pointers\nAreas Stevens says Ruben\nLike three pointer that brings a Laker fan stewards freak\nI don't think it brought the broadcasters to their food that was a very boring ... Lewis a they'll look nice\nAnd it brought the Lakers bench to their feet should have done it in like the newscasters voice Lakers now one and three on the season yeah the Lakers paid Lubrano\nBrought the Lakers bench to their feet\nShould have done it in like the newscasters voice\nLakers now one and three other states and yeah the Lakers paid lip or on a pretty penny this off season LeBron James just Nineteen points tennis seven rebound the Lakers gave a really good team effort tonight and their first one and I know it's against the Phoenix Suns Stevenson at twenty three he led the team\nI Know it's against the Phoenix Suns on the road but at the Los Angeles Lakers would have gone oh and for\nThat would have been a complete disaster for that\nOK Now let's go to the other end of the spectrum the Toronto Raptors this team just keeps winning and their new guy Hawaii Leonard yeah he's pretty good weather\nFor ... along the water rose there\n... scene of twenty three shooting thirties or are you going to the soda\nRaptors radio [laughter]\nOh yeah he's laughing his way to five and all this rapid seem pretty darn good Bobby get thirty three ... radio network there ended with thirty five and the raptors are five and they beat Minnesota clock is ticking on when Jimmy Butler it's going to get ...\nI don't believe why what it looked this raptors team looks darned good Bobby beat ...\nThirteen points tennis ... uh and we had a Josh uh uh on the show yesterday I worked for and be Canada for ... magazine and a judge Everly and\nHe was talking about how ... regular ... doing right now the regular season to martyr Rosa did well but that's not keep but keep in mind divide Rosen took a basketball player but it was the play offs okay playoffs\nThat's what really matters right like raptors fans right now they're like All right so why this is great but they're not really going to care 'til they start seeing results of the playoffs Bobby well yeah of\nCourse especially it doesn't matter if they're the first or second team in the conference heading into the playoffs they got to win a series voter raptors to believe in a\nWell I ... I think maybe step one is to not get swept\nI think that would be step number one of the process are probably when we come back let's talk about the New York football giants that is the team that is taking right now the NFL's overnight\nAnd this is pushing the God the motive really right that was the Mickey Mouse cartoon with him going down [noise] that's the first thing that I'm Still getting going for\nSaying are going to want to throw a rock and rock on mine they\nCome from\nWhat was going to get a little dog [noise] 'cause I was stuck in like the rest or whatever those guys were cold ...

how the nation radio shack on\nFrom the auto parts studios here's Matt Harris and welcome back into his overnight SB Nation radio Matt Harris back with us jumped into the NFL with Adam sightsee covers the NFL for SB Nation you can follow all of Adam weren't going to winter and\nAdams sites All right Adam I Want to start first with Thursday Night Football to night the Houston, Texas and the Miami Dolphins ... is back I'm Still curious the reception that he's going to get in Houston I imagine if not going to be a positive one but do you see the Texans getting their fifth one of the\nRoad is just one team that I Can't figure out how they've got four straight wins their office of wine is absolutely horrible but they have do you see them beating Miami and their backup quarterback tonight\nUh I'd probably pick Houston by I don't think it's an easy win by any stretch and frankly ... plan a pretty decent football yeah\nProtects them able to bring a lot of pressure recently ... looks like he's back to ban good and and waiting for a while now and\nThey're generally on ... so a tank so uh you know why that might be in trouble trouble often but you know he he was playing the way he has a ... a couple of weeks that off a better\nShot if this is there anything that use the ... that the Texans can do to try and protect their Shon ... better we know he has an an injury history but\nGenerally when teams have bad off and civil rights what do they do deeper into the seeds because I honestly it showed was that there were some number I think maybe it was a week ago where he has he's been hit Seventy times in the second worst team it had their quarterback at like forty nine dots when I see is that like that I'm like how can that quarterback\nDisdain for the entire season do you think the Texans are going to do something I mean it last week they had to go on a bus to Jacksonville you could take precautionary measures\nBut in game do you see the Texans changing a game plan or ... or doing something to help prevent the hits against Watson down the road\nYou know I think wow 'cause it's a pretty decent formula I mean he's still got a subject though they are going to get a little bit but they they only got one back I think uh you know the steps the box but I think\nHe got hit six times in the game which is a pretty pretty decent day for that oh I'm I'm\nIn the way they did it was that they have the on the run\nA it was a whole lot of alarm our and offered the blue\nAnd then when they didn't do any kind of passing that with a lot of short passing and plant route than out routes and I'm a screen houses autumn underneath stuff\nUh that come out to be a waste of when you guys like you know or the ... and and can you could say well for your you really want to kind of pushed the\nBall down the field but if you're going to establish and you can kind of slow down those ... so that's that's really what they've got to be more than anything I thought they did a ... a bad job of bowling\nA growing there's\nWatson into trouble on early in the years though if they can just kind of situation ... years back that I think that's probably the best\nSo if they can just kind of situations where passers aren't paying their ears back that I think that's probably the best way to do it because you're not just you're just not going to magically start talking\nAbout yeah no no exactly Adam ... is our guest covers the NFL for SB Nation you can fall out of work on winter\nHat Adams sites so the favorite coming into this year in this division and was obviously the Jacksonville Jaguars they sit here and three and four we know the record when it comes to Blake mortals he's just men are in London he just is\nA deed but having said that Doug around did say that bleep ... who's going to be on a short leash what do you think a short leash is defined as when it comes to board all this week\nI wouldn't be surprised if it's very short considering the way ... played 'em when he came in they were pretty much immediately better than\nThey were moving the ball down the field and and they\nThey football doesn't bounce off to jail than than than doing these the interception young ... there about the score a second touchdown and make it a a and make it a game so\nUh I don't think there's a whole lot of room for error for like ... the jaguars are kind of a staff starting team they need a leader early so if they come out with ... or early turnover or you know ... the first two or three possessions I I don't think he's going to be around for half Siamese um\nYeah I Do I'll be very curious what that looks like a a let's most of the of the north\nAnd the Steelers the bangles and the ravens they're all kind of lunch together right now when you watch the bangles the chiefs okay obviously the chiefs I mean you have big score differential do you think that that was more about the chief skinny better defensively or the bangles starting to humble often simply\nYeah that was that was pretty odd ... and and they followed a week where they didn't play very well off sensibly against the Steelers which was another team that has has had a lot of defensive struggle so or when it's back to back games like that you really have to kind of a you know took a closer look at what what's going on and Cincinnati um\nYou know Andy Dalton is what he is you know if your item or all want a card game he seems to play a whole lot better than I Am prime time but\nUm he's probably going to continue to be a guy with a you know eighty to Ninety pass for aiding and I'm good enough um so I don't think they all of a sudden tank and they started going you know ten points a game like they did last week but ah yeah it's just kind of a middle of the pack team I think\n... you know we've always kind of say that about ... like it's ... it's just a Marvin Louis teams but I'll be like Adam I remember watching that game against the ravens I Believe it was a Thursday Night Football game week to week three something like that\nAnd that was when I started to really believe in the bangles because they did it against Baltimore who's probably the best defense or at least the most consistent defense across football there's this entire season is there anything you can point to the Cincinnati was doing early in the season that they just aren't doing right now because they look darn good against Baltimore\n[noise] yeah I I I Want to say maybe or that they they weren't establishing that run early on a lot better job make some really had a great start to the air and and he hasn't been as effective lately ah you know I think against the chiefs the only had fifty rushing are\nYou're going to need to be able to establish the run the cheese do not have a good run to the fans 'cause that's a pretty ... pretty staggering lead bad number against them so\nUh if you can establish the run it really does wonders for for everybody else and you know that that ravens the fans like you said it's been consistently good\nSense than but I'm ... ... they did have some injuries early on and off since ... mostly earlier not games so\nUh I think that might have been a kind of a ... performance by the ravens but ah yeah Jo mixing has really I think the key to that Bengals awesome\nYeah Adam ... is our guest covers the NFL for SB Nation you can fall out of work on Twitter at Adams sites so the two rookie quarterback for the most polarizing this year Baker Mayfield and Sam ... to me they both have must match up to the ...\nMatchups

look great at the beginning of the year or do you see both of those rookies struggling this week and who do you think has the better we can do\nUh I think probably Baker Mayfield um I I I think I like that match up and then facing the Mac lab bears I'm so\nI'm just playing pretty well as the way I think Sam Donaldson I had a pretty solid rookie year but he's a guy and he's always been a guy who is probably going to turn over the ball a little bit\nAnd the bears are team that kind of thrives off of turnover so I wouldn't be surprised but the both you know at least two interceptions maybe has a

I think\nUh you know the saps the box so I think he got hit six times in the game which all things considered that's a pretty pretty decent day for that office so I'm I'm In the way they did it was that they ... have you on the run a it was a whole lot of them are meller and offered the blue\nAnd then when I did do any kind of passing that was a lot of short passing having plant route than out routes and um they'll scream passes a lot of underneath stuff\nOr ... that kind of kind of be a waste of when you have guys like you know\nOr the auto hop Canada and and keeps you could pay for your you really want that kind of push the ball down the field but if you're going to establish throwing you can kind of slow down those top sweat shirts so that's that's what they've got to do more than anything I thought they did a ... a bad job of rolling a rolling\nThere's not want them into trouble a lot earlier so if they can just kind of\nSituation ... years back that I think that's probably the best way to do it because you're not just you're just not going to magically started talking\nAbout yeah no no exactly Adam sites are gas covers the NFL for SB Nation you can fall out of work on winter hat Adam site so the favorite coming into this year and this division and was obviously the Jacksonville Jaguars they sit here and three and four we know the record when it comes to ... just men are in London and he just is\nA deep into having said that do grown did say that bleak board ulcers going to be on a short leash what do you think a short leash is defined as when it comes to board all this week\nI wouldn't be surprised if it's very short considering the way coding Catholic play it um when he came in they were pretty much immediately better\n... they were moving the ball down the field and and they\nPay for all those and bounce off to jail than than I've been doing these sections that there are about the score a second touchdown and make it out and make it a game so\nUh I don't think there's a whole lot of room for error for ... bottles the worst are kind of a south starting team they need a leader early so if they come out with ... or early ... over or you know pounce on their first two or three possessions I I don't think he's going to be around to half primaries on\nYeah I Do I'll be very curious what that looks like a a let's most of the gang of the north and the Steelers the bangles end the ravens they're all kinds of bunch together right now when you watch the bangles the chiefs okay obviously the chief ... I mean you got a big score differential\nDo you think that that was more about the chief skinny battered defensively or the bangles starting to tumble offensively\nYeah that was that was pretty odd ... and and they followed a week where they didn't play very well off sensibly against the Steelers which was another team that has has had a lot of defensive struggle so uh when it's back to back games like that you really have to kind of\nA pickle close to what the what what's going on and Cincinnati um\nYou know Andy ... is what he is you know if he item or a one o'clock game he seems to play a whole lot better than a ... or prime time but um he's probably going to continue to be a guy with a you know eighty to Ninety pass parading and and good enough um\nSo I don't think they all of a sudden tank and they they start scorn you know ten points a game like they did last week but ah yeah it's just kind of a middle of the pack team I think\nThe way you know we've always kind of say that about ... like it's the ... system Marvin Louis teams but I'll be ... like Adam I remember watching that game against the ravens I Believe it was a Thursday Night Football game week to week three something like that\nAnd that was when I started to really believe in the bangles because they did it against Baltimore who's still probably the best defense or at least the most consistent defense across football this this entire season ... is there anything you can point to the Cincinnati was doing early in the season that they just aren't doing right now because they look darn good against Baltimore\n[noise] yeah I I I Want to say maybe or that they they were establishing that run early on a lot better job of makes it really had a great start there and and he hasn't been as effective lately ah you know I took against the chiefs he only had fifty rushing are\nYou're going to need to be able to establish the run the chiefs do not have a good ... that's a pretty\nPretty staggeringly bad number against them so uh if you can establish the run it really does wonders for for everybody else and you know that that ravens the fans like you said it's been consistently good sense than but I'm\n... ... they did have some injuries earlier on they lost they mostly early in that game so\nUh I think that might have been a kind of a ... performance by the ravens\nBut ah yeah Jo mixing it was really I think the key to that Bengals often\nYeah Adam ... is our guest covers the NFL for SB Nation you can fall out of work on Twitter at Adams sites so the two rookie quarterback for the most polarizing this year Baker Mayfield and Sam ... to me they both have must match up to the ... matchups this week\nA Steelers coming off the ... Baker may still has to go on the road to play Pittsburgh and then you understand Darnell New York jets going to play a bears team that's lost two in a row the bears even look great at the beginning of the year do\nYou see both of those rookies struggling this week and who do you think has the better we took the two\nUh I think probably Baker Mayfield um I I I think I like that match up and then facing Cleo Mac lab bears um\nSo uh they just play pretty well as the way I think Sam Donaldson I had a pretty solid rookie year but he's a guy and he's always been our guide is probably going to trial for the fall a little bit and the bears are team that kind of drives off of turn over so I wouldn't be surprised if he does you know at least two interceptions maybe has a formal and there\nAre that's kind of been the standards outline for him a I think Baker does a little bit better\nPeterson is tomorrow we're going to grad Peter sit on the show a Vegas podcaster does a lot of stuff wanted to hear him every week why is the Redskins giants game only a one point favorite for Washington\nI noticed is on the road and we're going to get more to the giants yard sale coming up next our I cannot figure out why Washington is only at one point favorite against New York this week\nI guess I mean the the division rival um you know and Washington really don't have any office a weapon you know\nI mean ... ... and I want to live on yeah they were that yeah I mean they weren't so I'm a giants fan when if they lose the game yeah\nYeah I mean I don't know I don't know that's a weird way and that's a weird it's like there's always that one game every single week where I got to ask Greg about I've been tweeting ... recently like direct messaging him ... and into those DMZ Bobby because I Need to I I like I look at wind sometimes that I'm like why\nAnd I asked about the patriots game he's an Oprah they pages are going to cover no problem I had some questions about that is sending Michelle's hurt but [noise]\nI got to ask about that what Redskins minus one [noise] I Would have thought it would have been like at least a field goal Redskins have everything to play for the giants are literally putting their players out on the front lawn and saying who wants to do the night I finished radio [noise]\nNine ...

Johnson had a hundred and fifty a yard so we know that the lions that were real hard time commuting to a particular running back\nI don't think that when Marvin Miller is going to be able to have the explosive runs the carry on Johnson did but\nBased on what we saw last week against Jacksonville on the road and will the vulnerability that we start with the Miami running game but Maher Miller is definitely a a an interesting plug and play and also\nTyler or even if you're looking for a deep deep waiver wire pick up and maybe you got to put in the ... with kick you could say are now being ruled out he could be moved to the slide and Neal gave him just you and just maybe four or five catches or you know forty to fifty yards that's very much in play for him\nWhat about Oakland on all the all the honest with you I I have a duty on Louis on by this week in terms of my fantasy football league but the people who have a detailed Eliot on a by\nI looked at one of the most popular waiver wire pickups at least when it came to running back this week\nWas Doug Martin it when it comes to project of points because marsh on Lynch's obviously on the injured reserves what kind of production out of that open office which now has lost ... Cooper we don't really know what it comes to David Carr the production he's going to get you see Doug Martin being a good plug in play this week\nI Am so not on the muscle hamster bandwagon is ridiculous the over the past three years now and he's only average three and a half yards per carry but he's going to be back to back\nJust because that's what they signed him to do but jailing richer\nIf you're a PBR format and most planes are jailing Richard is the guy that I'm looking at that it's going to have more value because\nThe raiders more likely than not are going to be trailing in the majority of games so they're going to have to throw the ball which Martin was good but jail under shower right now he is the guy that gives you more more upside in terms of a P P. R. back in open so if I'm choosing between the two I'm actually bypassing Doug Martin to go with jail in return\nThey interesting I might have to make an adjustment there Chris ... is our guest host of that fantasy football so right here on this network SB Nation radio every single Tuesday night you can hear Chris you could solve Christmas work on Twitter at C.

fence which may or may not have had some issues with rock while his play when he was and\nWhat he was in Houston that they might just do absolutely ham trying to kill him and I I\nDon't think that that was the question I mean I think that it's definitely a possibility um\nThe tackle ball from tackles a play pretty well this year they're not getting a lot of notice for it but where am I comfortable Andrew on dreams of actually doing really good\nUm the middle of the office of the line that's where your question marks are mostly because the dolphins have already lost two starter from opening day\n'cause there there are going to jail together as a group but there's no question works there you still have guys that they don't really want to be in their Travis wanting a dinner not exactly ideal\nSo if you go up a middle and given the fact that the Texans have ... billion options on alec Ross\nSo if you can go up the middle and given the fact that the Texans have about ... billion options on how they can rushed the passer you go up the middle you're going to probably find for the success and somebody's going to get a clean shot at ... at some point\nYou\nKnow when when we're talking about rock and I know it's hard to to to figure out you know broccoli as you well you see the size and you're like oh my God that he should he should be able to to just crank it up but\nShe does really sauce for a big do I know I've caught passions from him um you\nKnow I actually caught one will during a you know during camps or they were doing a red zone drill and he sailed it over everybody's head and I caught it now I haven't caught a football in ten years yet I had gone it so that just the idea of how hard is telling his boss\nIs is there did you talk about how people will just frustrated tannahill and you know maybe he doesn't have a big enough harm or maybe he's not consistent enough with this or that one with which tannahill at least you have a guy that's\nYou know one some games that he wasn't carried by a defense that didn't need him with us while or\nI mean I Can't imagine like going into the seasons people didn't look at ... hours the backup quarterback and go nights\nWhen the dolphins signed him it was assumed that they were signing him as a camera on them and the reports that the time were\nThat Adam gays who worked with us why we're in Denver had to be talked into signing off ...\nAnd it looked like it was David Sales was the backup quarterback and today everything through training camp looked like it was David Sales\nAnd then the preseason happened and it got weird because it's fails would go out there and you have one great drive and then he wouldn't do anything else and also why we're slowly through before pre season games got better and better until the fourth one where he went out there and he let it up and everybody went\nOh this is a problem\nBecause that's not the way to strip was supposed to do so now you got for it to the season the dolphins actually have four quarterbacks on the roster for a good chunk of time because they also claimed to crawl out of the waivers\nSo a faux now on our David Sales has spent much of the year inactive every week until handheld injury and somehow office where I always come in there and he looked like he looks like you're pro typical backup quarterback\nYou somebody that will do in their control what often\nAnd every now and then you just go ... were you looking at what were you thinking [laughter] so yeah he's definitely not the plan\nUm and you can see there's definitely some differences to Miami is often with him in there because\nTannahill has never been somebody that everybody says it has a great down field long ball\nFor years he got the oh you can't throw the long ball but he actually can throw it he can throw it pretty well and we have these receivers in Miami this year that are meant to use that speed album Wilson now for the year but it can grant Kenny stills these guys are used that feed\nAnd now it's ... and you're seeing them turn more and more to worry and go for that\nThree yards past unlike the receiver try to break it so yeah I I I Would agree that yes he's not throwing the strongest hardest for the call\nKevin noble covers the dolphins arrest me nations the insider Kevin who is also going to hold the ball to tonight with you mentioned out of the Wilson now hitting IRAs out for the year ... Kenny Stills and south of the game who who's who's on the balls\nTo seem grant should be the number one and Danny I'm a dollar and given that your team granted like five foot seven that's not exactly the number one guy you want\nDemocracy Parker is active and shouldn't be playing tonight it'll be the first time in three weeks I think\nAnd he's only played one game this year so there's some drama with the voluntary Parker and he's been frustrating inconsistent his entire career because he's the type of guy that\nHe's hurt he can't play whereas you expect guys that are hurting to play you expect guys that are injured to not play so Parker should be out there I kind of expect him to have a big game just because one there's nobody else and to because all this week we've had this discussion because", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "25"}
