John would start first with used executive said 'cause wired to marry as Thomas from the\nDenver Broncos and it's kind of surprised me John to hear you I I don't know I felt like people were being a little bit too critical of what the Marius homage to bill do how big of an acquisition as the Houston important just your overall thoughts on his capabilities as wide receiver [noise]\nI I think it's big obviously when you were real for ah that that hurts use them and and\nIn the building is there's wide receiver [noise] well\nI think it's big obviously when you lose will fall or uh that that hurts\nYou spin and they need to bring in a presence now I think the issue is you know will can run and there are few players and this lady that can pop the top like like he can and I don't think the mariners Thomas\nIs an exact replica it's kind of lost the staff but he's still a competent receiver so you just have to go about it is different way and obviously\nWhat the Andrea happens on the other side of the top five receiver and the game he's not going to be seeing a ton of double cover show from that standpoint\nUh he should be held a and I think it was a good uh acquisition by the Texans who let's face it they're trying\nTo kind of pulling away and the division but if you want to put them in the conversation when Kansas City and New England they needed a little help and maybe this is it\nFor the Houston Texans fan who was thinking oh dum areas Thomas like all these you know to marry Thomas was the number one wide receiver not that long ago when you look at his numbers this year a three catches against the he's got multiple games where he has like four catches you know four or five four three patches and no more than forty fifty yard\nIs Sarah me to say okay maybe because the quarterback play in Denver is not I think the ... D watching as the better quarter that that I think Casey them is it fair to say that maybe he's keen on limited dumb areas Thomas a little bit\n[noise] ah I don't know I I mean I think case keen on is is not a great quarterback by any stretch of the imagination but it's actually an upgrade of what has to pass that show\nA few years in Denver so from that standpoint I it look if you're talking about guys who can just flying in or around the yard I don't think keen them or the Sean Watson or in that conversation you're looking for big numbers you're talking about\nPeople like Aaron Rodgers and uh even her cousins what he's doing the Minnesota just the extraordinary numbers are guys who can just throw the football I I don't think either team is in that category\nUm but I Do think Houston's obviously at this stage a a better team it's a better situation for them just from the mere fact that\n... as a manual Sanders is again the only people in a conversation with the ... and start guys like Antonio Brown Julio Jones Adams feeling that's it yeah so when you're talking about a receiver like that it makes it easier for everybody else\nJohn McMillan is our guest is the national NFL columnist you can follow all done work on Twitter that Jay ethnic mowing the eagles go out and they get Golding tape pretty good for a disaster receivers\nUh he you know you just look it up and down his line for the year seven ... seven catches catch the disease that kind of a guy so you have a house on Jeopardy combo a possession wide receiver and a deep threat but I mean this is for Carson went to these eagles right\nThere says because I I think you look at the ... been season as he goes and that's been about situational football and all ... that means a third downs and they were off the charts in that in last year and twenty Seventeen twenty eight feet\nOn this says and it's it's been more of a struggle and part of the reason why is that now than I was taking a step back is that slot receiver or they don't really if they try to make him into that guy is being manufactured touched by\nA who can break attack ... yards after the cash\nOr hasn't been very good at it that the ... golden pay nobody is better and misleading ... yards after cats nobody's got more since the since twenty twelve\nUh there's not a more powerful receiver him to sleep remember all the way back the Notre Dame and he was actually on the back or shifted the receiver I he's got a tremendous strength in the lower body and they're not a a receiver in this league that it's more difficult tactical\nAre you surprised by the value that was returned to both the Detroit Lions in the Denver Broncos the Broncos getting a fourth round pick in the Houston Texans and bronco sloppy seven brothers and gold dictate apparently was worth a third round pick that was kind of like okay I I had to read that twice okay dumb areas Thomas\nOr the fourth round there and gold and take a third round or it it does any of that surprised you\nKnow that that's where a cap number comes into marriage has a huge kept number moving forward a golden tape is not quite as expensive uh although he is and he's going to be a free agent so\nFrom the eagles standpoint this is more uh of sort of a baseball like trade that you don't see very often in the NFL and that it's a rental uh and and know see how it works out if\nThey can make a run and get back into this\nUh you know obviously thinking about resigning I'm not a they'll let them walk free agency and they'll get it compensatory pecking twenty twenty so that's the way they're thinking about it\nBut it it seven and uh the de France has been in Philadelphia it's been about even to what it was during the super Super Bowl gone wrong the often is\nIt's been a a a chick ... factor and the reason why they don't have enough play makers so they needed to bring one end and this was the best they could do\nJohn ... is our guest is a national NFL Thomas you can follow all done work on ... ethnic bowling or are there any concerns for you regarding a duck tape Fowler I Know that the you know he's kind of under performed\nOr just overall in his career and their concerns off the field but to me I'm looking at this is just another pass Russia and its and valor is with some of these guys will get to another one of these guys in time I ... it might just be about a change of scenery I think the combination possibly\nOf Fowler a dummy could sue Aaron Donald that's a pretty lethal pass for the rams but if you're Los Angeles or are there any red flags for you in terms of his overall odder achievement on the field and the issues that off the field\nWell a little bit I I more often than when you talk about obviously the injury is send them back them and he just fell behind two really good players\nAre in Calais is can law in in ... so uh he I think that was the issue in Jacksonville in in Los Angeles Los ... great team it's hard to poke holes in eight no but if you're looking at one thing they desperately needed\nYou mentioned are involved in in comic can sue but their interior players they did not\nHave an edge Russia or who was proven\nOr really since Robert ... has been gone so this at least gives them the potential to have that and we just mentioned where the Andrea how it's going to make things easier for her to marry as Thomas same thing in Los Angeles maybe power has more difficult time but\nOne Aaron Donald's getting all the attention and if he's not in comic and sue is nobody's going to be paying attention\nDifficult time but one Aaron dollars getting all the attention and if he's not in Dominic can sue is nobody's going to be paying attention though if if he can't do it there then you might have to start thinking about a contract being bussed as a former high level draft but\nI'm you know it's funny I was just ... and he was just a the gold standard and he was telling me about that that scam are you guys talked about on the air which I I didn't hear that that exact same thing happened to me uh it was slightly\nDifferent situation he described it as he was driving down the the um the ... the tire scammed but just crazy if you didn't hear the story he was paid I'll just read the tech is it basically someone came up to him while he was driving a day roll down the window\nAnd told him that attire was flat or wobbling had to pull over and so our did nothing was wrong and the guy tried to act like he could fix it and wanted\nAlex To pay him and then of course house would pay him he would go off and announced would never see him again he'd be stuck on the side of the road waiting at the end and this guy would never come back apparently there's a five thousand dollar award for this guy same thing happened to me except\nI wasn't told to pull over on the side of the road I was like literally had gotten to a sub shop and the guy and guy came and said he had watched me come in like he came in right behind me didn't think anything of it and said my time and so I was walking around the corner I'm like this I don't really think anything was wrong just\nWear out they're not

was a I I'm gonna I wrote an article for who magazine we have Josh ... who runs that who magazine about that's coming out later in the week and one of the questions that I Am a I answered\nIn this article Bobby what what team are you like most surprised that the slow start of the Oklahoma City thunder or the rockets and I think I'm slightly biased since I live in Houston but I said the rockets just because the ... is a slow start you know that very disappointing obviously hard at that point but\n... they they just don't have a big win other than Michigan if they lose the game I think they're in big trouble because they're not in power five conference and all these teams would have won last I think with Trump Notre Dame\nYeah I mean that's how that's how it is for another day and so you have to run the table if you are fighting hours you have to know know much about it you have to run and say well because of what you want a one if you lose one game or to you yeah you're out yet other tough\nHaving said that you do control you know they think we're saying here on this you control your own\nDestiny now Michigan I Believe will control their own destiny because I think I and I were talking about will allow them lose this weekend I don't think I'll ever going to lose this weekend\nSo I think that means Ellis you will have to losses on their schedule which means you got a bump them down and if Michigan continues to win look Michigan does not have an easy road down to stretch okay they play Penn State this weekend as a big game or they could they could lose that game\nAnd then of course you have Ohio State at the end of the year so Bobby let me pose you this question\nIf you ever to last Michigan State team I guess if you have a two last Michigan State team\nUm and one of those losses is to Ohio states Ohio State do you think they still have a shot because if there are one last team and their one losses to Purdue but they beat Michigan and they win out\nThey would be that team that wins the big\nTen I'm In Ohio State is still on the outside looking at I just don't see them beat in Michigan this year man yeah I\nThat will be a toss up again for me because I I just want to see\nHow I mean they will prevent I mean they were run they will be Nebraska they can beat Michigan State at Michigan State and then they have Marilyn I they had all that drama going on so that that will be the last game of the season for her say that well I think they could still an from Michigan it's got a\nGreat man but there are guys so much on the line yeah\nI Hope just for the you know for\nThe sake of the college football fan both Michigan and Ohio State are undefeated up until that game\nYou know leaders we want that German I can see that kind of ... um but uh one last Michigan versus a are probably let let's just put these teams had if it comes down to four of us just okay let's just say Alabama at the table Clemson runs the table\nLSU if they lose this week in Alabama they're done right into their done so then or if you have Notre Dame run the table then we're going to let's just say that these undefeated teams these three teams that we have better undefeated right now are going to stay on their feet are okay let's just play this game here what you do why did you give me ball\nGown under the hypothetical hypothetical\nYeah well that's what I mean what are we doing here this whole thing is that I mean the thing and now they're out to al Shabaab there two hours of hypothetical after these were done I mean we can do two minutes aren't Alabama was eight no Clemson day no Notre Dame state [laughter] assume that all three of those days were may know alright\nMichigan runs the table George or on the table you're faced with Michigan one loss and uh and\nGeorgia one loss who would you put in as that four team in that situation\nI'll go and Michigan algorithm is and the\nQuestion is just to the audience so we're all in the same page would you put in a second as the C team or would you put in the Big Ten champion that would be the question that's going to be the fascinating thing I think at the end of the year if you do have three eight no teams\nOr is there a situation where you actually know that's not the case because Alabama Alabama ... if if Alabama continues to run the table and they will give George of their second loss so that wouldn't happen but then but then in Georgia beats up okay now I'm just getting way too confused okay let me make my final point go ahead by what you want to say something\nOh I mean that was just saying like yeah so Georgia has Kentucky are bringing a UMass and Georgia Tech to finish what about Michigan\nWhat if you have one last Oklahoma verse won last Michigan and you have to decide between those two teams the Big Ten champion or the big twelve champion\nYou will have Alabama and the hypothetical Alabama or is your SEC champion they run the table Clemson as your ACC champion they run the cradle to Notre Dame as your independent they run the table there in\nAnd what if you have a one last Michigan and I want this is the question if you have a one last Michigan at a one last Oklahoma and you have to pick between the big twelve champion and the Big Ten champion\nI Would put Michigan am just simply off the strength of schedule\nYeah and I'm looking at Oklahoma schedule okay as far as like ranked teams they lost the Texas in red rival so that's a big deal that will kill him that will kill to\nMichigan and and and here's why kills them because Michigan's loss there only loss is to do today great and they are undefeated in the hypothetical that we're talking I'm Still\nDone was hypothetical we talk about something real you don't want to be the fourth team this year Alabama to me is by far the dominant and superior we were talking about the\nTwo by the way when I was talking about a couple of days ago I got to make a correction I was talking I was talking about the coach's poll in the Associated Press pool I was going after writers so the Associated Press pull everybody voted for Alabama\nBut in the coach's poll there were two more on who voted for Clinton to be the number one team so I just I Want to make a correction from two shows or go\nOkay I I I have to me Alabama is head and shoulders and we're really going to find out this weekend to me Alabama is head and shoulders above every other team in college football right now\nAnd that's just how I see right from what I've seen out of Alabama two of the defense they're just well rounded you do that is very important\nOkay to not be the fourth seat\nObviously you want to get in the play offs but and and you know you choose to be the force you to set a knock it again but you want to be three if Clinton since two and Alabama's one you want to be three and so they're the debate also at the end of the year\nIs going to be oh should the four have been the three and should the three of been the for not only should the five and the four but how we're ranking up your body so that'll be interesting what he got\nToo much math ... or ... yeah I mean can we just have the Eighteen playoffs that's why why\nOur ranking up your body so that'll be interesting what are you got it\nToo much math law and order I don't yeah I mean\nCan we just have a team player that's why I Want to Eighteen playoff

Maryland a DJ ... will be returning a of course we all remember a Jordan McNair collapsing during a practice the eventually died and then ... was placed on administrative leave\nLaws that was it was announced yesterday that he will be returning as the University of Maryland head coach now we have three players walk out of a team meeting yesterday\nI did this the end of this like could you foresee a situation where almost like he's I don't want to say forced out because the decision was made but it is this the end of this situation\nYou know I I'm I'm really surprised that ... is back at Maryland\nYou know ... once the story broke in all off season I'm right leading right up into the seat and I didn't think there is any way that you can be brought back at Marilyn\nJust because you're you're asking a coach that it had some pretty serious allegations surrounding the way the program as try not to mention the the tragic passing of Jordan's back there\nAnd then asking him to go recruit at roster every year to go into players homes and be able to sell the vision of a building that he can keep him in championship\nThough and all that what's going on in the program so\nI I'm shocked and I I just I don't eat it it's a ration enough oil\nOr procedure dark and Marilyn you already have some players who are upset even before the decision was announced there were a parent of players who promise later on that there but they would have more to say a theater\nWas brought back so I I I'm really surprised I think at this point you know it's hard to see the dark and being able to build a winner at Barrow in\nWell I ... yeah sorry sorry to cut you off there but that's where I wanted to go with this because outside of you know whether he's innocent or guilty and I listen to the press conference deep\nAnd so basically what what I guess the board of regents got out of it was he was not completely guilty therefore he couldn't lose his job but I think the point you just said on\nIs is true how is he going to get any recruits to come to the school\nAnd not to mention you know he hasn't been involved with the day to day operations of the program or recruiting since he was placed on me you know ... you know August for the season started so now you're asking the coach who hasn't been involved in potential recruiting than\nYou know the start of the season to come in now it late October early November and be able to piece together a recruiting class not to mention ... with him could get worse over the next couple of days I mean clearly players league team how many players are going to decide the transfer so\nI just think this would have been a perfect opportunity for Maryland to clean house start over and get a head coach who can bring in and kind of reset the culture\nSo uh like I said I Am really shocked because to me it looks like a situation that is not going to end up well and I just don't see how the gate there can can build a winner and barely in what's going on yeah\nI'm totally with you I'm curious with the local talk as does the blessing as our gas college football editor at apple on sports you can follow sees work on Twitter at apple and Steven artsy let's get into these college football playoff ranking um number one does it surprised me it doesn't surprise you number two doesn't surprise me I don't think it surprises you was three and\nFour of the ... that was the one that I was kind of looking at a Notre Dame I thought was going to be free it turns out to tell us you are your thoughts on the top or\nYou know not to the price that I think the fact that LSU has played a ... schedule has good victory so far\nI think the committee looked at that and gave them the edge of the ranking does the games are coming up um you know especially Alabama ... who's going to change a lot but I think at this point\nThe fact that she has played a good schedule has two victories on it gave them the edge 'em over Notre Dame and the last before to Florida sitting there are number eleven if you want to lose that's a pretty good last to have on the resume right now\nOh yeah no question about it but when it comes to ... the Michigan is really interesting to me because as I was listening to announce it then it kinda made said do you have it in your head that Michigan control their own destiny almost because unless you should lose this weekend to Alabama and that would really help Michigan out obviously\nIt would I I think Michigan dies I think the caviar be what happens if Alabama loses on Saturday because then you get into a Alabama was number one they've been so dominant even if they have lost the L issue it's probably going to be close to ... Yuri\n... Alabama mail drop a spot or to the head of Michigan but\nI think you know I didn't want to tip away a picture anything because I you know I think LA she will probably this week in Michigan and the drivers even in the Michigan still has a ... game against Penn State is Saturday\nBased off the highest paid down the road but I think Michigan moved out I think it'll sort of stuff out and I think they'll find a way to the ... the college football playoff\nWhat are your thoughts on Georgia they have a tough match up this week against Kentucky first of all where do you think about Kentucky and that match up I don't believe that they are ten point favorites going into that game um but Georgia what what is their route to getting into the college football playoff there if it were seriously talking about them as a contender\nSaturday games interesting because he has been one of the biggest surprises the season the way they run the ball and the way they play defense but\nYou know I think it's tough to the Kentucky pulling off the ... just because they're passing game and it's just not it's just not going to be good enough to beat a team like Georgia I think we're we're trying to get in you know I think they're going to be chaos because they already had the Los Angeles\nIt's just not going to be good enough to beat a team like Georgia I think for torture to get in you know I think they're going to be chaos because they already have the la Salle issue they're probably going to need to beat our band I think maybe that maybe the only way in is to be the one last chance to the FCC with a victory over ... over Alabama so\nCertainly very difficult path but you know looking ahead we could have some chaos we could have Michigan lose to Ohio State opening the door with you know Alabama and she was still the place so there there are Saddam and those that I I think it is el hage if George or loses\nTo Alabama there's no way they get in they have to get in I think as the one who won last champion of the SEC with a victory over our than a setting that potentially to as easy teams getting the\nPlay Oh yes the blast them as our cats chaos as what I Love cc last arguments that college football editor for Apple exports policies work on what are ... seats Stephen okay so let's talk about the potential chaos let's say Notre Dame loses the game\nOkay somewhere within the these last regular season game and they finished their season with one loss\nOf the one last teams that are still around like let's say Ohio State Michigan and they win the big entitled if would Notre Dame beat out a one last Ohio State Oklahoma George Washington state Michigan wouldn't know it was like\n... wouldn't Notre Dame they'll be in this college football playoff conversation with a loss on their schedule because I think looking at their strength of schedule it's just not up to par\n[noise] it's a great question you know I think it may come down to something that we saw last week we saw that you know Ohio State had the the bad our Iowa and how they lost than we've seen Ohio State this year\nTo ... to ... again that they're completely dominated you know the data clearance for the last how does that last for a higher state\nIsn't bad enough to keep them out of the Notre Dame stare biased you go on the beauty contests at this point but I think you know if you're looking at Ohio State a one line champion of the big pen\nThat sets up the ten surely Renz over Michigan State Michigan and then even northwestern Iowa Wisconsin Purdue and that they can championship game\nAt the very beginning this is what sports do like as you know just repeat what I said do not gamble on a game that you're going to go see what the girl on a date with because the Campbell could just go so wrong and then you're just sitting there and you're like man I'm I should have won the bet\nHow or thirty five points scored then I'm In a bad mood and that's being reflected hurt team was like we just sat there and silence at the at\nYou know sorry turning my talk talk talk to me here like Lester okay ah yeah ... you're not supposed to sit inside and it's on the date no well I was wondering Bobby I

and it it kind of surprised me John\nTo hear that I I\nDon't know I felt like people were being a little bit too critical of what the Marius Thomas can still do how big of an acquisition is Houston in

bring in a president's now I think the issue is you know will Iran in their view players in this way that can pop the top like like he can and I don't think American Thomas\nIs an exact replica is kind of lost the staff but he's still a competent receiver so you just have to go about it a different way and obviously\nAndrea Hopkins on the other side of the top five receiver and the game or he's not going to be seeing a ton of double covered show from that standpoint\nUh he should be held a and I think it was a good uh acquisition by the pack them to let's face it they're trying to kind of pulling away and the division but if you want to put them in the conversation when Kansas City\nAnd New England they needed a little help and maybe this is there\nFor the Houston Texans fan who was thinking oh dum areas Thomas like all these you know to marry Thomas was the number one wide receiver not that long ago that when you look at his numbers this year a three catches it gets that he got multiple games where he has like four catch it you know four or five four three patches and no more than forty fifty yard\nIs it fair to say okay maybe because\nThe quarterback play in Denver is not I think I'd watch it as a better quarter back they Casey them is it fair to say that maybe case Keenan limited dumb areas Thomas a little bit\nI don't know I I mean I think ... is is not a great quarterback or any stretch of the imagination but it's actually an upgrade to watch that show a few years in Denver so from that standpoint I look if you're talking about guys who can just following it\nAround the yard I I don't think keen them or\n... or in that conversation you're looking for big numbers you're talking about\nPeople like Aaron Rodgers and uh even her cousins what he's doing the Minnesota just the extraordinary number a guy who can just throw the football I don't think either team is in that category\nUh but I Do think you used in the obviously at this stage a better team that's a better situation form just from the mere fact that as good as a manual ... again the only people in a conversation with the entree huh and start guys like\nAntonio Brown Julio Jones Adams feeling that's it yeah so when you're talking about a receiver like that it makes it easier for everybody else\nJon ... is our guest is a national NFL columnist you can follow all just work on Twitter at JFK ... for the eagles go out and they get golden tape pretty good for a possessive receiver\nOr he you know you just look it up and down his life for the year seven catches seven catches sketches that catches these kind of a guy but you have else on Jeopardy is a good combo a possession wide receiver and a deep threat but I mean this is for Carson went to these eagles right\nThere says because I I think you look at the on even see them as a year ago and it's been about situational hopeful and all that means third downs and they were off the charts in that in the last year and twenty Seventeen twenty eight feet\nOr this season it's it's been more of a struggle and part of the reason why\nAnd that in last year and twenty Seventeen twenty eight feet\nOr this season it's it's been more of a struggle and part of the reason why is that now than I was taking a step back is that slot receiver or they don't really they've tried to make him into that guy who can be manufactured touched by a who can break attack will get the yard after the cash\nOr hasn't been very good at it that defines golden pay nobody is better and misleading ... yards after attach nobody's got more since the since twenty twelve\nUh there's not a more powerful receiver and the slave remember all the way back the Notre Dame and he was actually a running back or shifted the receiver I he's got a tremendous strength and this lower body and they're not a a receiver in this league that's more difficult tactical\nAre you surprised by the value that was returned to both the Detroit Lions and the Denver Broncos the Broncos getting a fourth round pick in the Houston Texans and bronco sloppy seventh round was a golden Tate apparently was worth a third round pick that was my kind of like okay I I had to read that twice okay dumb areas Thomas worth a fourth around her\nAnd gold and take a third round or it it does any of that surprised you\nKnow that that's where the cap number comes into marriage has a huge cat number moving forward a golden tape is not quite as expensive uh although he is and he's going to be a free agent so\nFrom the eagles standpoint this is more uh of sort of a baseball like that you don't see very often in the NFL and that it's a rental uh and and know see how it works out if they can make a run and get back into this\nUm you know obviously thinking about resigning him it's not a they'll let them walk free agency and they'll get a compensatory picking twenty twenty so that's the way they're thinking about it\nUh but it it seven and uh the de France has been in Philadelphia it's been about even to what it was during the super Super Bowl won't run the often is\nIt's been a a a ... factor and the reason why they don't have enough play makers so they needed to bring one and then this is the best they could do\nJohn McMillan is our guest is a national NFL columnist you can follow all sounds work on Twitter at JFK ...\nAre are there any concerns for you regarding Dante Fowler I Know that the you know he's kind of under performed or just overall in his career and their concerns off the field but to me I'm looking at this is just another pass Russia and its and the\nSalary is with some of these guys will get to another one of these guys in time I read but it it might just be about a change of scenery I think the combination possibly a salary Demick could sue Aaron Donald that's a pretty lethal pass rush for the rams\nBut if you're Los Angeles or are there any red flags for you in terms of his overall odder achieving on the field and the issues that off the field\nWell a little bit I I more often than when you talk about obviously the injury is send them back and he just fell behind two really good players are in Calais is can law in in ... so\nUh he I think that was the issue in Jacksonville in in Los Angeles Los ... great team it's hard to poke holes in eight no but if you're looking at one thing they desperately needed\nYou mentioned there and Donald in comic consumed put their interior players they did not have an edge Russia\nOr who was proven or really since Robert ... has been gone so this at least gives them the potential to have that and we just mentioned\nWhere the Andre ... making things easier for some areas Thomas same thing in Los Angeles maybe Fowler has more difficult time but\nWhen ... dollars getting all the attention and if he's not endemic and sue is nobody's going to be paying your parents yeah though if if he can't do it there then you might have to start thinking about a contract being bussed as a former high levels drafted\nYour thoughts on them getting first place it's going to happen right a game's end of the season they're five and three\nAs we look at the divisions which division winners are most likely to maintain or division leaders I should say which division leaders are most likely to maintain\nWhere they are the Texans will probably I always ask me questions and never let us go ahead it is you know\nWe got to work on it [laughter] I go ahead accidents\nAre they good the red skins saint the Redskins got hold up in the east and so that's a question mark you yeah yeah yeah that's I think they can buy I'll just go through a real quickly right New England\nYes Pittsburgh yes Houston yes Kansas City to\nWashington [noise] na na na na ...

I'm so glad they didn't dragged us into when our body I sat down and I watch like you know it was only Fifteen twenty minutes of it I was really fearful that they were going to be like and team\nNumber six is this led to analyze for ten minutes team number five is is\nLess analyzed like if the NFL Draft you know not the number five college football playoff rankings you're on the clock\nAnd then you know ten minutes of analysis and then three\nFour two what those numbers were out of order but luckily it was only like a Fifteen minutes and we were able to figure it out\nI'm Bobby I'm very excited to start this show because we do have a\nBreaking news\nAnd we have a guy on the ground who is a scrappy\nYoung reporter uh that works for the network his name is Jasmine I'm going to give him credit and Bobby beach right there he's he can't talk because he is he going to be wondering Bobby beat this through the glass I can promise you that but Bobby beats as busy because we have audio\nAnd I'm very happy to say we're going to be the first radio station in Houston that is going to play exclusive audio of the Mary is Thomas talking about his welcome to the to the to the Houston exam being used in Texas\nUm and we there are ... their media greeted him I guess from what I'm hearing Bobby they tracked his plane\nUh in from Denver and he landed at eleven thirty central which is about forty minutes ago\nAnd a slew of media kind of surrounded him got some down and Bobby is cutting up right now to Mary in St Thomas is a member of the Houston Texans and coming up next we're going to have exclusive sound of and talking about the Texas so that's exciting\nRight after this went down and I was a little bit surprised of how critical they were of dumb areas Thomas I was expecting more praise I was expecting\nOkay this is a legitimate deep threat a second deep threatened now for just Sean watch it and um and\nI don't know I guess I haven't ... I paid attention to Denver closely enough my perception has been maybe it's a case keen on that has been blown down a little bit I don't know I think this is a fantastic blue for Houston and you know this is the this is a great day like you literally have you with here's why it's great that the Andre Hopkins\nIs now you can't like double team on every play you can't do it so\nI think there's a great move for the Texans but yeah this is a great move I think the Houston Texans are where the winners today and the NFL trade deadline I mean getting deep sea\nOr he will he will not take the top off the beef that's not his style any more maybe with Peyton Manning that was more of a style\nBut as more of the you know ... a position type ... you need to be clear out there down\nYou're going to go to deep deep yeah we don't have to worry about forcing the bar to be a hundred Hopkins anymore yeah you have somebody on the other side I think this is big for the taste and this was before the show watching is as well I mean he could keep an explosive in the pocket if that office of lack of play like they did against Miami Dolphins\nThat sanctions will be less scary team the lookout for no\nI think so too man and look they have a deep threaten the entree Hopkins the under ... can do everything we know that he's a possession receiver you can go out deep you can do you you can literally run whatever route you want him to run and then the merits Thomas the just the attention like those three guys and if a bar but again I I think the key for the Texans moving\nHere is the wind play as it is\nShe didn't like those three guys and if a bar but again I I think the key for the Texans moving forward here is the wind play\nAs it has been all year can you protect the Sean watching so he can stay in the pocket to deliver the football down to field can you allow the running game\nOr to come into fruition and and allow a play action pets look we talk about the merits Thomas and Andy Andre ... has been legitimate deep threats but look you got to have a good pet you got a good running game for people to you know respect that and then you can\nThrow the ball down the football field this is one of the reasons why it's so important for the New England patriots took have sunny Michele I'm there you know so that is huge um and a big trade for the taxes I think you know up in the Denver Broncos point of view it's a good deal you know you get a fourth round pick\nUm you're you're kind of in rebuilding mowed down here the Denver Broncos and that's what you gotta do okay I golden ... weren't gonna be able to sign him he goes to the Philadelphia Eagles so I look at this you know he's more of a possession receiver that dumb areas Thomas's\nI did find it interesting that the value for golden Tate was slightly higher than the value for dumb areas Thomas part of it has to do with contract stuff but golden Tate was given for a third round her and the merits talents was given for a fourth round of any swaps seventh round as to the eagles get better by getting golden tape a and then you talk about teams going all in\nI mean we talked about the rams the rams we know what they did in the offseason Los Angeles going out getting markets Peter's getting endemic to signing era Donald to the long term contracts signing ... for the long term contracts\nThis teams all it and getting foul or this is you know it's a it's a change of scenery for Fowler he's had troubles off the field so you hope that this could be a positive thing going to Los Angeles now talking about needing a change of scenery\nCan we get around about ... okay time on camera traded away from the Green Bay Packers\n[noise] after\n[noise]\nOn the kicker okay time Montgomery\nIs traded for a condition no not a conditional pick excuse me a two thousand and twenty seventh round pick\nHe goes to the Baltimore Ravens a the Packers clearly did not want him around uh this is a guy getting run out of town basically that is basically what it says um would not have been surprised at all if they are in Rogers said well we we if Roger is kind of initiated this and said look with this guy get yeah we we we did they were just when you have\nAnonymous people first of all in the locker room\nComing out and and saying look this guy was selfish that's not good so um and then you had threats on him and his family all that stuff that we are do down yesterday\nI'm happy for her time Montgomery and book I think honestly he goes first of all to the better team\nAnd second of all to a better situation the his role\nWas kind of diminishing he had lost his ... that's one of the reasons why he chose to come out of the end zone against the rams and ruined the Green Bay chances you know ... is because he uh he had messed up on a previous position they can't really played like sit down to six points I take against the Los Angeles rats\nSo you go to a better team for the Baltimore it the better team\nAnd I do think that he's going to have a role there and so it is this just needed to happen I'm happy for time of gum right and now the Packers don't have to have a walk or a cancer cell look really interesting stuff happening at the trade deadline today uh when we come back we're going to break down the college football playoff rankings we have our one through

I wrote an article for ... magazine we have Josh ... who runs that who magazine about that coming out later in the week and one of the questions that\nI Am a I answered in this article Bobby what what team are you like most surprised at the slow start of the Oklahoma City thunder as the rockets and I think I'm slightly biased since I live in Houston but I said the rockets just because the ... is a slow start you know it's very disappointing obviously heart adopt plan but\nAnd that's against Michigan where they play Virginia Tech I Believe that was against the backup quarterback and Virginia Tech had been faltering okay ... they they just don't have a big win other than Michigan if they lose the game I think they are in big trouble because they're not in the power five conference and all these teams who would have won last I think with Trump Notre Dame\nYeah I mean that's how that's how it is another day and so you have to run the table if you are fighting Irish you have to know know much about it you have to run and say well because of what one uh one if you lose one game or to you yeah you're out yet other tough\nHaving said that you do control you know they think we're saying here on this you control your own destiny now Michigan I Believe will control their own destiny\nBecause I think I and I were talking about will Alabama loses weekend I don't think I'll ever going to lose this weekend\nSo I think that means Ellis you will have to losses on their schedule which means you got a bump them down and at Michigan continues to win look Michigan does not have an easy road down the stretch okay they play Penn State this week and that's a big game or they could they could lose that game\nAnd then of course you have Ohio State at the end of the year so Bobby let me pose you this question\nIf you ever to last Michigan State team I guess if you have a two last Michigan State team\nUm and one of those losses is to Ohio State Ohio State do you think they still have a shot because if there are one last team and their one losses to Purdue but they beat Michigan and they win out\nThey would be that team that wins the Big Ten I'm In Ohio State is still on the outside looking at I just don't see them beat in Michigan this year man yeah I I\nNow will be a toss up again for me because I I just want to see how I mean they will prevail I mean they will run they will be Nebraska they can beat Michigan State at Michigan State and then they have Marilyn I they had all that drama going on so that that will be the last game of the season for her say that well I think they still after\nMichigan it's got a great Mayor Bloomberg has so much on the line yeah I Hope just for the you know for the sake of the college football fan both Michigan and Ohio State are undefeated up until that game you know we want that job I could see that I Will listen to 'em but one last Michigan\nVersus a are probably let let's just put these teams had if it comes down to four of us just okay let's just say Alabama at the table Clemson runs the table\nLSU if they lose this week in Alabama they're done right into their done so then uh if you have Notre Dame run the table then we're going to let's just say that these undefeated teams these three teams that we have better undefeated right now are going to stay and defeated okay let's just play this game here what you do why did you give me\n... I Do not the hypothetical hypothetical yeah well that's what I mean what are we doing here this whole thing is that [laughter] I mean I live in now there are two out there two hours of hypothetical activities\nWhere did I say we can do two minutes aren't Alabama was eight no Clemson day no Notre Dame Satan [laughter] assume that all three of those days were made no alright\nMichigan runs the table George or on the table you're faced with Michigan one loss and uh and Georgia one loss\nWho would you put in as that four team in that situation\nI'll go and Michigan algorithm is and the\nQuestion is just to the audience so we're all in the same page which you put in a second as the the team or would you put in the Big Ten champion that would be the question that's going to be the fascinating thing I think at the end of the year if you do have three eight no teams\nOr is there a situation where you actually know that's not the case because Alabama Alabama beats ... if if Alabama continues to run the table and they will give Georgia their second loss so that wouldn't happen\nYou know but then but then in Georgia okay now I'm just getting way too confused okay let me make my final point go ahead by what you want to say something\nOh I mean that was just saying like yeah so Georgia has Kentucky are wearing a mask and Georgia take to finish\nWhat about Michigan what if you have one last Oklahoma verse won last Michigan\nAnd you have to decide between those two teams the Big Ten champion or the big twelve champion\nYou will have Alabama in the hypothetical Alabama or is your SEC champion they run the table constant as your ACC champion may run the table to Notre Dame as your independent they run the table there in\nAnd what if you have a one last Michigan and I want this is the question if you have a one last Michigan at a one loss Oklahoma and you have to pick between the big twelve champion and the Big Ten champion\nI Would put Michigan am just simply off the strength of schedule\nYeah and I'm looking at Oklahoma schedule okay as far as like rank teams they lost to Texas in red rivals so I Would add that to be doing that will kill him that will kill\nMichigan and and and here's why kills them because Michigan's loss there only loss is to know today ... and they are undefeated in the hypothetical that we're talking I'm Still\nDone was hypothetical we talk about something real you don't want to be the fourth team this year\nAlabama to me is by far the dominant and superior we were talking about the two by the way when I was talking about a couple of days ago I got to make a correction\nI was talking I was talking about the coaches pool in the Associated Press pool I was going after writers so the Associated Press pull everybody voted for Alabama but in the coach's poll there were two more on who voted for Clinton said to be the number one team so I just I Want to make a correction from two shows ago okay\nI I I have to me Alabama is head and shoulders and we're really going to find out this weekend to me Alabama is head and shoulders above every other team in college football right now\nThat's just how I see All right from what I've seen out of Alabama two of the defense they're just well rounded you do now is very important\nOkay to not be the fourth seat obviously you want to get into play off but and and you know you choose to be the foresee it instead of not getting in but you want to be three questions to an album as one you want to be three and so they're the debate also at the end of the year\nIs going to be oh should the four have been the three and should the three of been the for not only should the five and the four but how we're ranking up your body so that'll be interesting what he got\nToo much math law and order I Know yeah I mean\nCan we just have the Eighteenth playoffs that's why I Wonder if a team playoff or I Want I talked about this last year body I Won at least the playing games because I I think every year in college football five and four\nAre going to be so close it's close enough where we're going to have this discussion of look at the rest of it oh Louis strikes a schedule oh look at the margin of victory put the two teams of dang field and see who's better we don't have to go through this madness\nSort of commercial break when we come back we're doing NFL power ballad Todd I'm done over\nThis over the knife with ...

Twitter at apple and even before we get into the college football\nPlayoff Tom I Want to start with what's going on at the University of Maryland a DJ dirtiest will be returning of course we all remember a tournament mayor collapsing during a practice the eventually died in the ... was placed on administrative leave laws that was it was announced yesterday that he will be returning as the university\nOf Maryland head coach now we have three players walk out of a team meeting yesterday or is this the end of this like could you foresee a situation where almost like he's I don't want to say forced out because the decision was made but it is this the end of this situation\nYou know I I'm I'm really surprised that DJ Derek ... is back at Maryland you\nKnow one one story broke in all off season I'm right leading right up into the seat and I didn't think there is any way that you can be brought back at Marilyn\nJust because you're you're asking the coach that has had some pretty serious allegation surrounding the way the program to try not to mention the the tragic passing of Jordan's big hair\nAnd then asking him to go on a cruise that roster every year to go into players homes and be able to sell the vision of a building that he kicked him for the championship\nKnowing all that what's going on in the program so\nI I'm shocked and I I just I don't see this is your ration enough oil\nWe were pretty Jay dark and Maryland you already have some players who are upset even before this decision was announced there were parents of players who promise later on that they are but they have more to say if the ... was was brought back so I I I'm really surprised I think at this point\nYou know it's hard to see the dark and being able to build a winner at Maryland well that I\n... yeah sorry sorry to cut you off there but that's where I wanted to go with this because outside of you know whether he's innocent or guilty and I listened to the press conference deep\nAnd so basically what what I guess the board of regents got out of it was he was not completely guilty therefore he couldn't lose his job but I think the point you just said on is is true how is he going to get any recruits to come to the school\nAnd not to mention you know he hasn't been involved with the day to day operations of the program or recruiting since he was placed on me you know ... you know August for the season started so now you're asking the coach who hasn't been involved in a kennel recruiting then\nYou know the start of the seasons to come in now in late October early November and be able to piece together a recruiting class not to mention ... with ... cricket worst over in a couple of days I mean clearly players legal team how many players are going to decide the transfer so\nI just think this would have been a perfect opportunity for Maryland to clean house\nStart over and give it a head coach who can bring any kind of reset the culture so like I said I Am really shocked me was it looks like a situation that is not going to end up oil and I just don't see how ... can build a winner and barely in what's going on yeah\nI'm totally with you I'm curious but the local talk as does the blast in as our guest house up all editor at apple on sports you can follow Steve's work on Twitter at apple and Steven artsy so let's get into these college football playoff rankings um number one does it surprised me it doesn't surprise you number two doesn't surprise me I don't think of surprises you\nWas three and four or ... that was the one that I was kind of looking at a Notre Dame I thought was going to be three it turns out to tell us you are your thoughts on the top for\nNot surprised that I think the fact that LSU has played a good schedule has good victory so far\nI think the committee looked at that and gave them the edge of the ranking there's the games are coming up um you know especially Alabama ... who's going to change a lot but I think at this point the fact that she has played a good schedule has good victories on it gave them the edge 'em over Notre Dame in the last the porta\n... sitting there and number eleven if you want to lose that's a pretty good last to have on the resume right now\nOh yeah no question about it but when it comes to ... you'd be the Michigan is really interesting to me because as I was listening to announce it then it kinda made said do you have it in your head that Michigan control their own destiny almost because Alice you should lose this weekend to Alabama and that would really help Michigan out obviously\nIt would I I think Michigan dies I think the caviar be what happens is Alabama loses on Saturday because then you get into a Alabama was number one they've been the dominant says even\nIf they have lost the L issue it's probably going to be close to Lake Erie Alabama mail drop a spider to release the head of Michigan but I think you\nKnow I didn't want to tip a way of pick your anything because I you know I think el issue this week in ... Michigan and the driver's seat in Michigan still has a ... game against Penn State is Saturday they stuff or play Ohio State down the road but I think Michigan without I think it'll sort of stuff out and I think they'll find a way to the big the college football playoff\nWhat are your thoughts on Georgia they have a tough match up this week against Kentucky first of all where do you think about Kentucky and that match up I Believe that they are ten point favorites going into that game um but Georgia ... what is their route to getting into the college football playoff ... if ... if we're seriously talking about them as a contender\nThis Saturday's game is interesting because he was hockey has been one of the biggest surprises he's in the way they run the ball and the way they play defense but\nYou know I think his house to the Kentucky pulling off the bat just because if they're passing game and it's just not it's just not going to be good enough to beat a teen like Georgia I think for torture to get in you know I think they're going to need for the chaos because they\nAlready had the last the LSU they're probably going to need to beat Alabama I think maybe that's maybe the only way in is to be the one last chance to the SEC with a victory over ... over Alabama so\nCertainly very difficult path but you know looking ahead we could have some chaos we could have Michigan whose to Ohio State opening the door was you know Alabama she's still the place so there\nThere are Saddam and his but I I think if if ... if Georgia rude to Alabama there's no way they get in and they have to get in I think as the one who won last champion of the SEC re victory over our family setting up potentially to as the the team's getting the play\nOh yes the blast them as dark as all chaos is what I Love these the lab and arguments that college football editor for Apple exports policies work on apple on steep Stephen okay so let's talk about the potential chaos let's\nNotre Dame loses the game okay somewhere within the these last regular season games and they finished their season with one loss of the one last teams that are still around like let's say Ohio State beats Michigan and they want to be entitled if would Notre Dame\nSo your season with one loss of the one last teams that are still around like let's say Ohio State beats Michigan and they win the big entitled if would Notre Dame beat out one last Ohio State Oklahoma George Washington said Michigan\nWouldn't know it was like wait a liquid Notre Dame they'll be in this college football playoff conversation with a loss on their schedule because I think looking at their strength of schedule is just not up to par\n[noise] a great question you know I think they come down to something that we saw last week we saw that you know high as they had the the bad on Iowa and how they live in the highest paid ...\nTo ... to ... again that ... they're completely dominated you know the batter clearance for the last how does it can look at that law score highest state it's bad enough to keep them out of the Notre Dame Syracuse biased you go to come up with the beauty contests at this point but I think\nYou know if you look at Ohio State it is one of them are shaping at the big Penn that's at the history render over Michigan State Michigan and Danny northwestern Iowa Wisconsin producer

the Austin them\nThat's what you know you don't break the world series trophy you don't have Alex Coren ahead with a beer\nWhat type of sabotage ... going on up in Boston where they don't even know how to handle themselves in a World Series celebration parade\nA big ask a light on the issues but specifically be ridiculous fault that at the University of Maryland and others of course because it's college football in college sports seems to me it's something that leads to this more often than not\nHow you can miss something like this how you can miss something is obvious like\nThis and shame on low shame on Maryland and shame on that board's recommendations to reinstate DJ dark and because it's all it took was returning to campus the following day and what you made the announcement about reinstating dark and enlisted again to all of the people that was met with\nAll of the different people that he's met with leadership of the student government association speaking on behalf of known student organizations that Senate executive committee they're deans department chairs campus leadership that student to instructor to administrators\nAll three areas of the University of Maryland have been covered\nHow could you miss something how could you lack so much self awareness how can you be such an idiot and this is an act that he would not because it tells me that all he did after all of this all he did was just take one boards recommendation\nThat says no no no no no you're probably going to get sued if he fired for cause of bringing back\nThey didn't do what they get today send them down and said listen you need to take a buyout and work things out that way it happens it happens a lot instead what low and the other idiots running was university did it you know nobody's going to know nobody's going to know\nWhat other conclusion to my left with other than he completely utterly ignored these complaints you honestly think ask yourself this question a sign she entering for Patrick ... to the Halloween edition of straight heat I Want you to ask yourself this question and honestly answer in your head\nWhat makes you think that he had any type of conversation or if he did it originated at all with any of the people that he mentioned that now changed his decision\nYou honestly think that the Senate executive committee do you honestly think that means you honestly think that campus leadership only expressed their frustration and only expressed their honor disdain for how you the University of Maryland handled darken ...\nYesterday and now into this morning that the first time somebody open their mouth on campus are you telling you want me to believe that\nThat yesterday last night and this morning truly the first time in which so many people clearly banded together and told low goad you can't do this they said it like I Know you want to save some base economically from a business standpoint bottom line but missing it\nHow many people how many times do you think low the board we're told is and what did they do they ignored it\nThey ignored it pay best case scenario is that low actually sat down with these groups is that low actually tried to get an crowdsource some information about how people would react to the reinstatement of DJ darken and ignored it that's the best case\nTo get and crowdsource some information about how people would react to the reinstatement of DJ darken and ignored it\nThat's the best case scenario right now when all of it for me is that low actually did do some due diligence and just flat out ignored it but it's not worth my time it's not worth our effort we're going to lose too much money if we don't reinstate DJ dark and that was the only option you add bringing back or let them go\nFind a way to cut ties could do as we see now I did not have to be just firing the guy\nIs absurd\nIs reprehensible that really bothers the low president university of Maryland in his statement that tried to do the best buddy failed\nTry to clear this thing up and put University in a positive light only made them look even more in common and I didn't think that was possible\nI didn't think it was possible from Maryland to look more incompetent and how they handle this whole situation\nAnd yet still you're looking at this scratching your head\nDo let them get off the hook because they finally made the right decision there is nothing that screams Maryland now be looked at his hero Marilyn should now be looked at as going in the right direction Marilyn should now be looked at as some sort of moral compass\nMarilyn should be looked at as the rest of them a bunch of hypocrites who only truly change their nature when they get caught\nWallace de low the University of Maryland's board of regents Bush a moron to suggested this\nThey don't care best case scenario if they don't care worst case scenario they didn't even reach out worst case scenario is they had this been turtle report Lowe said okay that's enough for me ... hey hey Wallace man you know he's got a hundred students out here with the big sign protesting\nNo but it it's not worth my time on late for lunch many Wallace don't leave I've got the dean of students on the line and tell them to call me back I'll get with them tomorrow\nWow there's much too low you've got every single department head out your office right now waiting for you to tape should probably get the backdoor\nHe did that while it's below should be ashamed of himself as a human being the board of regents in Maryland should be ashamed of themselves as human beings they took the back door they escaped and they're cowards ... radio\n[noise] so [noise]\nWell you also outlook event goes up to try to get your ball the interfered with the fans get called back in ...

Johnny ... who's your best player\nOh you're going to the NBA Finals so that I mean that's the other thing that I don't think they have ... ... what a debacle which makes\nIt really is and I think you bring up a great point that's under discussed which is internal turmoil and clearly Tom typical not thinking about the next guy helping the next regime down the line so there is some resistance there has to be because\nAs as right as you are that Jimmy Butler may not be the easiest\nSit on a team on any given king he's still a special talent in the NBA and I would think that if it was really wanted to move in ... they would have already moved in to that point knowing that Houston has become desperate Philadelphia has been grown in the mix a lot\nDangling guys like Daria ... pulse and other teams knowing that he'd be available at least throwing a bidding\nYeah or or the ads for a while\nIf you're Marcel faults and other teams knowing that he'd be available at least throwing a bidding\n[noise] yeah or or the as we heard a U.S when we were in order for craft extent where potentially being offered I mean that's the I I think that's the ultimate discrepancy is going to end it was looking at this day and then there's no way that this is going to work out so how do we work it out\nOr in the best future possible far or even the best way possible for the future of a franchise and like you say something that I was looking at this and say ... you got to try to run as many games can we we're assuming butler I talked to last game of the season you get into the play offs um and it hasn't\nI mean let's face it it hasn't worked out the way people thought it was when when I was hired there I mean this was a up and coming franchise with the cornerstone\nBeing caught at length of the county has any exactly panned out\nThey paid ... a ton of money he hasn't really been the guy I think they were hoping he would be you could understand playing with both of those guys wide Jimmy ... [noise]\nUm and then here we have ... ... is the law was supposed to be comedy is ... ... and bring his people to groom dash to the to the walls and that hasn't really panned out a ... ... the whole thing has been a debacle and I think we have a guy who's\nA start as kids as stubborn as Jimmy Butler and the owner and Glenn Taylor who does not have a great reputation ugly I was trying to salvage as much as she can't come all of that you might have the perfect storm of what we're watching\nESPN serious accidents Christmas all joining me time she and her explanation radio so we touched a little bit on Houston let's look at that squad right now the situation that they're dealing with how long until you hit the panic button with what's happening with the rockets\n[laughter] yeah it's a good question I you know you still have some time I mean first of all look at the obvious claimed without a without a garden who when you take that guy or without\nAll dominant he is and how much he's going to bowl and how much he gets to other guys and the other teams in trouble all on the bus when he got a like yet our poll\nYou're going to lose James Chris oh out because of the budget so they had it on a whole lot of ... to begin the year right or the trades I think our you know I don't think the older folks are certainly any impact um I think it's changed over the public by not having just put it that way\nBut was there you go to a guy who really have any ... we have in the NBA justice was kinda grew at all not by he's no longer\nThere I'm going to get to another caller with a minute trust me I got a beef with the drill out there out west but we'll we'll talk about\nThat in a minute or you had a lot of ... you know no no come on of course I'm not goes to the wisdom and knowledge you important to the audience not me they're tired of hearing me so I'm Sorry no no no please\nNo I was just the other thing that I don't think it's being taunted on enough it's this she wants to buy any last year and you know we we have to evaluate the regular season differently than we did maybe five six years ago okay wrestling is become a part of this I think things are pacing themselves more and put about I mean\nThey want to sixty five games which ... Andrew suddenly the Seventy three they didn't win it but you then the next year it was it was a huge tail up paying you have to think it was going to be some pacing early in the ... if you're out on paying I think it's an aggregate of of a lot of things\nChris I'm curious in the backdrop of what happened with Patrick Beverly and Russell Westbrook ... and I'm just a humongous and I'm not the only one I'm sure\nHumongous fan of Russell Westbrook Everytime I'm not here to argue with her and he goes to the championship but not just the entertainment the entertainment value so I asked this question in a positive light but is Patrick Beverly the biggest pain in the ass in the NBA\n[noise]\nYeah he he may be somehow that's the question of you who\nKnow better world peace was on that on that list for a while for good reason I mean and and and it's a lot of ways\nYou know before he became met a war of ... home run or not [laughter] you know when he was he he was in that that really category of the good way ... yeah well there are guys out there in the NBA\nWho are fighting and scrapping the best they can to make living they are not gifted with natural talent and it's an offensive Lee\nAnd so you don't have an officer bone in your body you have to find a way to have value and make an impact on on on the other side of the ball and I think actually take off your that really has done I think he's I think he or she can get Ross a little bit and um\nAnd I appreciate it like I think he I think he goes after bows and something like ... some people call it a pain in the ass with you I kind of deal", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "31"}
