good\nSo it was going to be things that are really good but you know our approach is the same way you know if we play our best game are breast ran a basketball we can play\nAnd so that's my focus on

Yankees you know what that coat on line up that they have you know not take anything away from the red Sox I just feel like\nI'm getting the right time and you know judge I think getting a shrine stand hitting home runs you know into the stratosphere it you know he's he's obviously ready to uh to prove that he's worth that contract and I think that now the time for him to shine and the rest of the Yankees\nI Hope to write Ron out the Yankees fan and I mean another factor here is the rents off the top of their orders fantastic but from my one through nine the Yankees I think to have the advantage and more importantly Red Sox deployed all to be\nTime left handed starters and the Yankees have eight very bright and happy to line up that ... ... and so that's something to look at let's talk some Indians an Astros\nThe other a LPs and ... not the rainy season but they don't usually made in the playoffs playing in a week AOL central division that teen is built from the postseason bow they afford the ... one of which can be used in the ... and in this series they have tremendous lined up and call all the Allen it get his\nHead on straight out after we leave leave him Baylor and ... and I think that's a winning combination for Cleveland on the other side though he's than they are the reigning world champion they can match\nThe Indian starter for starting a day of justice because of a line of if not better and I think they haven't even deeper both pendant that of the tribes Houston Aslam kill the managing the series but matter what the scores in the series do both teams are done not wind up catching even went to restrict\nYeah this is going to be a great series and you're exactly right would be the champs you got to beat the champs ... exactly what the Indians are up against you know I think that this could be their year we saw them just come up short you know I guess my cubbies a couple of years ago I think this is the time for them to shine I think that again\nThey got all the pieces in place you know cleaver you know he's a he's a monster out there is a guy that\nYou know it necessary you can pitch three games you know in a series we've seen him do that before and I I think the experience level you know the Astros have that too\nBut again you know how are these guys going to perform you know under the bright lights um can they do it again and it it's really tough to repeat don't care what sport is out there who you know I think this this is the biggest challenge they're going to have\nTo repeat repeat to get past the ... and so you know I'm not discounting the tribe it all\nAnd I don't really care too much about them home field advantage in my opinion I think the unions can go on the road it went on the road there ... and this is a team that made news you know you know one account and then they got some bass in that line up and so I think that again probably end up\nDead wrong they did that's all the awesome move was big and honestly in at the ... and they need to gain the red Sox only time will tell there but you're listening to sports overnight America was forced to ... percent lander sought the wrong with these about dogs ...\nWi Fi ... at any lines are coming your way right after\n\n... well for Cleveland want us to ah to run over and then\nAnd then have border too\nBy the sound of the ball\nGame right to run home run to his sports overnight America\nIs that fantasy football to come and get all the seeds in we were talking about the Japanese started running back to the NFL maybe we should get value between the fifty ninth browse but so far we've had a lot of very disappointing and frankly underwhelming performance\nNow part of this has been naturally getting away from the run when you get behind it again this is a pass happy week but we're just not getting the performance is how does he started running back to that we thought we were going to take a look at page Barbara Tampa Bay he got a chance of\nWhat the volume but he just hasn't been able to take advantage of it in fact working Ronald Jones was an active for the first three games of the season and when he was active gay forget Chicago barber still have three more\nJones had more guarded what does this mean well it means that coming out of Iraq does you know just going to be the new started running back for the Tampa Bay

slender\nSoft shell on side and a piece of adults have bath and we're here talking with you by NFL match up then ... we'll start with the\nGreen Bay Packers visiting there are divisions rival the Detroit Lions Enron the lightest and kind of already had their Super Bowl this year old versus the patriots and wait three they came out on top and the shocking when a likely be the best performance ... of them\nAll the the law now they have to host the Packers who are just the better team even with the increased stab at the wide receiver positions alliance will be able to put on points I think it gets an average ... is the fact that they take\nAll day and Jones are in for big base but I think Aaron Rodgers is going to make and not play in this game despite his injured weapons to\n'em come out on top of their I'll be shocked when they lose at this game on the ropes align\nWhen we were you just might be shocked out of your seat because uh I'm taking the winds in this game you're right you know they did play you know above ... any bones expectations and beating the patriots but\nI think this is kind of the same kind of game trip for them if they can approaches game of the same way keep erasures on the sideline you know the running game is kinda still murky you have all these injuries I think this kind of cast a cloud on the Green Bay Packers\nIn for me I think that the the winds can do what's necessary to accomplish this you know when in this heated robbery you know in the NFC northern they're going to have to get the job done and I think this is a weak carry an Johnson they give them the ball I don't care what the coaches say I don't care what anybody says if they want to when\nThey're given the ball to carry around Johnson a super star rookie twenty twenty five times in this game and I think that they don't come away with the when if they can do that and obviously they have the you know past catching noxious to complement that was you know slot often go unpaid you've got\nSecond year stand out in a gallon a day and don't forget about Margaret Jones because he's going to be there when the coverage you know goes away from him to make that big play and and or touchdown catch so I just think that the firepower for the wind is better in that defense for the Packers serious question marks flew\n[noise] there are certainly question marks and I mean in this wind comes in a one and a half or the protein the Packers I feel like if they were pullout that would be bigger to the fact that it's just one and a half it's hard for me not take the baby you make valid points there for the alliance the Jacksonville Jaguars visiting\nThe Kansas City chiefs ... at home and this will be yet again another big test for young ... homes last week he went into

S. O. S.

S. army\nDot com bubble cat and besides the shocking actually in the Steelers and stop it but every once in a beyond that weren't going to have to go a different route if you want to try a database tournament or a gp these what's on your mind games are you\nYeah I mean there's a feeling it's obviously you always have an obvious one but there's two other games that excites me this week one that seems I'm\nFairly obvious as well and one that is very under the radar which will be signing on the obvious one is the chargers\nHome taking on the the raiders and maybe it's because these two teams just haven't been allergic to playing defense to start the season\nBoth of them even though the characters are traditionally a pretty good defense for whatever reason no Joey Bolsa some some other I'm missing a peace has been very a porous\nDefensively and the raiders are coming off an incredible high scoring game with the browns and I think they're going to do it again here a in a shootout\nIn Los Angeles uh for some Southern California glory as they say that so that's one I think that's fairly obvious and my under the radar game and this is more exciting for me\nIs the Vikings asked the eagles now part of winning in daily fantasy sports in general isn't picking the the the the highest expected Cain\nTotal game and like to get all over that one we want to try to do is find games that will play to the over because the salary algorithms on the science already reflect a lot of the projections for these players it's very difficult to foreign players from Pittsburgh and Kansas City this week but\nUm or lines of this week but this falcons a this game with the eagles and the Vikings we saw the Vikings going the road at the rams and put up a massive massive numbers so\nThere's no reason why a less sort of this\nDefense like the eagles I should be able to slow the Vikings often down so I really love that game and the Vikings passing game in particular [noise]\nThat I can get behind you know I really like the charges raiders call I Know in my piece along right now I'm I'm actually starting Derek ... over a rough so we'll see what you know makes you think well Russell Wilson any last year he was so\nGreat for this area has it been like right in our looked really good last weekend I agree charters without both also defensively certainly are lacking\nThere so um what's actually get to these divisions here said the obviously that Ryan big bad if you walk out in the ... you can do with\nRivers are if you want the sharpest raiders well but also [laughter]\nYeah I mean I'm going back to those same games I Love her cousins here um price down on all decide not to ... you know ... some level pricing cousins just has\nDone nothing but looks spectacular all season long twenty points thirty five points thirty one points in three out of the poor games this year and the one game where he didn't do the scoring that was a crazy buffalo game that we all want to forget about\nSo rooted nor that one you mentioned the guy who I like a lot I'm Derek are again this is moving down the list I'm Derek are very exciting\nSuper cheap chargers no joy Bolsa raiders no clue Mac two teams together don't want to play defense\nI'll throw you one more than going to actually be very popular and I think a little scary and maybe somewhere I'm not willing to go because I think too many people are going to be on him Blake portals\nMore than going to actually be very popular and I think a little scary and maybe somewhere I'm not willing to go because I think too many people are going to be on him\nBlake ... is the sexy name right now I'm at the chief of the chiefs have been on the fence that just gives them gums of wings to opposing fantasy players whoever they are but whenever ... starts to be talked about is a guy that people want to use a all last\nJust across any sort of daily fantasy\nAround that time that gives me a little nervous so ... will be a popular pick this week you will be the chalk\nOr as as we said the ... meaning and high owns player across most of the size he's inexpensive but I'm going to cost a little bit on ... just just because as great as fantasies and it's always a little scary when a lot of people are piling on the board will country\nYeah I had to be fair I mean without will letter or that they are going to throw the ball or but I I've never been want to say yeah I went up all my body up late for all you know so I I Believe they have all the wide receiver position\nSo looking at the wide receivers and again we have the obvious to us to actually all a lot of this study looks spectacular this week but you have like the the the gravitational force pulling off to Antonio Brown and Julio Jones to get her to get a piece of that\nFalcons Steelers game right and neither one of them are great I Would favor brown over Jones but it wouldn't shock me if Jones put up more fantasy points than brown\nI'm moving down the list\nBecause all of the high priced players have\nPretty much a good argument for why should play them to have introduced\nAround me ask you this um yeah but you just bought a June June isn't crazy to pivot awfully own grabbing go with maybe read they enjoyed you\nKnow I mean because you can afford them it's not that it's a crazy thing it's just I Can't pay off for brown and this is not a week where we have a lot of salary relief there aren't any you know running backs that are replacing starters that are any\nGood or there aren't any ... super under priced players\nThat open up the player pool for us this week so it's actually gonna be really difficult to get our hands on some of these done so as much as I Want brown and who Jones in my line ups or even ... or ... Schuster\nWe're not going to really be able to afford them and also plug in the sun running backs that you really want this week so you mentioned one Kelvin Ridley little cheaper\nThe question is is is really a run around and see the new Ronnie White I don't know but when the wind was around he was awesome as the compliments Julio Jones in that falcons off and so we're probably going to see a little bit of that this week um some other names that I feel like\nI'm this week moving down the list to allow us to afford some of the started running backs you've got um\nTitle avoided with Cincinnati no real tight end to speak up on that team\nBoy has just looked at great he's basically Calvin Ridley two point oh but for a little less not as exciting of the game per se I like Cory Davison buffalo very good play Corey Davis the only guy that Mario seems to want to throw two\nThis shame is going to turn it on those two guys for Josh court and if he can stay clean\nWatch out of Edelman can staked claim to fame is the first game as seasons for drugs Joe\n... performance enhancing drugs by the way email us sports Fred at AOL dot com how many people in Las Vegas are going to spend five hundred and thirty one dollars for a family of four to see you soon to be\nRaiders play five hundred and thirty one dollars for a family of four\nAnd two years it's going to be six hundred dollars how often are you going to do that sports for added AOL dot com sports shredded AOL dot com ... world's worst handicap right back with us next week Scott thank you very much for the state to an all night just sports overnight America\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nI'm warning WMA not when you were born after and online at nine forty WMA W. dot com\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Todd asked on Saturday the confirmation vote complete followed by the swearing in is Brett Kavanaugh became to one hundred and fourteen Supreme Court justice in American history at a rally in Kansas President Trump was so pleased even fact the FBI\nI Want to thank the FBI I thought the FBI was incredible they worked hard they work really fast\nI hear the report was\nThat was really a details thorough professional record\nOne day before the vote Princeton University hosted she roars celebrating women at Princeton justices Elena Kagan Sonia Sotomayor both Princeton alumni spoke of the event Justice Sotomayor says the justices have a longstanding practice of keeping an open mind winter putting the law\nAnd the sense we have a phone\nCall and such a fast way has\nClaws his hands conversation I think\nHave all the Charles legitimacy\nJoke Justin Walker and assistant professor at the University of Louisville clerked for Kavanaugh speaking to ABC News radio Walker address was concerned about the ugly fight over Kavanaugh's nomination\nIt's a great results [noise] ah but the process that got us to this result of the past hundred days I have not reflected very well on the Senate\nJust as Kevin was confirmed by the Senate Saturday by a fifty to forty eight boat\nPolicing the Nevada athletic commissioner investigating opposed by brawl after the UFC title fight in Las Vegas Saturday chaos broke out after lightweight hobby but remember going to\nAttack members of Conor McGregor corner moments after defeating McGregor in the fourth round seconds later another identify man jumped into the ring and started plunging McGregor Europe's the president Dana wife\nIt's bad there's going to be an investigation by the Nevada salvage mission and uh\nAnd uh it was going to be big money fines and discussion with their trouble\nI'll be the person who's being held this was ABC News\nHave you ever thought about saying goodbye to your job just walking into your Boston saying I quit and how would you like to commute to work without ever leaving your home\nWill not long ago at thirty nine year old entrepreneur from a billionaire family spent twenty million dollars in three years to find the best home based business in North America he researched Seventy different companies and when he found the only one that had a real long term potential he bought it\nAnd right now he's looking for people to help him turn this company into his next billion dollar success story so if you're serious about making money from home without having to leave your home will grab a pen\nBecause I'm about to give you the address of a website where you can learn all about this unique in rare opportunity write this down W.

we watch ride the NFL were now for weeks in you know you're starting to get the five weeks in and things now have to start getting kicked into gear if you want to make a push towards the postseason\nYou can't you can't make the playoffs and Wi Fi but you can certainly start losing your opportunities if you start losing some games at this point\nYou're going to start seeing teams would wear and tear college football now you're going to start seeing really tough conference games the ... games are over you can start playing teams of your own conference now some teams that we see in the top twenty five will survive October\nWith more than two you know with with less than two losses some of these teams are going to be playing too good of competition in the month of October and baseball for what it is\nBaseball then it becomes a different sport in a way I mean by that is the nuances of baseball what makes you ... ... a credible chess strategic gain\nThat when you really know you really appreciate you don't get it during the regular season you don't get to see it as much in the regular season\nBecause baseball is such a casual observance throughout a hundred and sixty two games it's a dog day of summer type of sport it's a grab a beer and a hotdog and relax and watch a ballgame type of sport\nBut only in a game like last night or even if you want to go back to the game one the one sixty three games there on the schedule on Monday\nGame like last night we really started seeing strategy having to play an important role in who you were going to leave on the on the field and who you were going to have to pinch it with and who you were going to have to bring out in the bullpen all of those things gets magnified in the postseason\nAnd in the problem with baseball has is it's it's most exciting moment it really is something that draws fans in it's something that just gets everybody energize but\nRound the Superbowl maybe that's right really really fun to watch it let's get to bottom five this is where we have the most fun our number twenty eight on the list and we're going to go up to thirty two reminder can I just let me just say this do I think during the bottom five of the league [noise]\nNot really but I had this and putting them there because uh Pittsburgh Steelers [laughter] shut out at home and the second\nHalf of the game in which they had all the momentum in the world\nThis team doesn't know what it is they can't stop anybody on defense they are a miserable defensive team in the secondary they cannot stop to pass you carve them up like a Thanksgiving turkey they will they will throw flags on the Steelers all day every day\nThat robbers burger looked miserable in the second half like you didn't want to be there I'm so disappointed that home against the division rival they couldn't score and the second half of the game at home which in which again they came back in time the game\nThey did this against Kansas City they were down Twenty one do not think they came back in time the game still lost\nThey were down fourteen and nothing early came back in time the game and not only lost didn't store again then the second half I'm Sorry Pittsburgh your bottom five this week and next week but I'm I'm I'm I'm putting you on notice stop all this nonsense and started playing some gun football\nAgain please God America you have no idea how much that pain is here to Syria would go oh man I'm a [noise]\nA number twenty eight I have the jets um ever since that first game where Sam Donald rules like okay this is the next great quarterback he's he's he's the top of the class out of all the other if you go to the scene as really gone nowhere since that moment\nAnd they just seem to be limping along through the through the season I don't see I don't see where this team is getting better I Know it's a young team but I just don't see the seem improving at all so right now they're sitting on number twenty eight [noise] see I had the jets said uh twenty nine\nOr I don't know what they are I Know I like Sam Donaldson I think he's going to be a good quarterback down the road but this is this is where it gets tricky I'm not saying it's going to happen is I think I think Donald has tools that can work you can work with and making ... an NFL quarterback\nFoot sometimes you you get these guys and they they get into these bad situations on bad teams in bad habits and they're not doing the right things and they're getting ... they're making mistakes and the turnover turning the ball over\nNext thing you know we're promising career becomes a bad career\nI don't think that'll happen the same Donald but just be careful jets be careful here you're giving up a lot of points you ain't score and a lot of points they haven't scored over twenty points out since they're opening when when they scored some forty eight so that they've been telling to about Fifteen points again after that\nThis is not a good look be careful jets a there one in three day don't look anything like they did in week one\nJets in my number twenty nine teeth [noise] never twenty nine for me or the raiders I'm like yes they did get their first one of the season this past week but it was against some Brown's team that\nHas only one when the last year and a half\nAlthough I Do believe the browser are going to the super bowl and the raiders just took down the super bowl the potential Super Bowl champions [noise] um I just I don't believe in the same I I think John Gurdon was a huge air on a Mark Davis says yeah too much but it just\nI don't know it's just\nThe same the same as just no good and he got rid of his best play maker on defense and that's going to hurt them continue to haunt him all season long [noise]\nThey need as luck to get that when the against the browns and\nThem browse up in royalties screwed out of a sudden he'll land of the season and the writers would still be undefeated team so they're sitting on number twenty nine\nYou know well said I have them at thirty and ah and that's where everything you just said his exactly why the raiders are right there with me and the number thirty position I don't believe in them I think you're right the browns\nHad a had some mistakes on their own that led to their own demise [noise] uh but you know the raiders didn't put forty four forty five points on the board so the you know they obviously did their part but\nThe browse did get screwed on one call in or if they didn't they will be oh and foreign really looking destitute I still think the destitute to their thirty unless you're not calling them Super Bowl champion now now that I write a number thirty on my list\nIs Texans now I Know they also got their first one of the season but it was against the very pedestrian cults team a it was a quarterback who is um you still rehabbing I'm not saying Andrew Luck is all the way back he's still rehabbing and they needed overtime to do it again this this has more to do with the coats and the actual players on the field\nThey're starting to look like the players and the people are starting to look like they know what they're doing but the coaching is what's going to be their demise just as much of this with the raiders and John Gurdon below Brian is just going to lead the same you know further and further down hill but he's there for a long time and had a four year extension this past year so I don't see him going anywhere [noise]\nI understand like debated whether I should put them out of high they were they belong in my bottom five but I didn't know if they needed to be thirty one so putting a little if on here and that is the San Francisco forty niners\nOr they don't tackle very well they don't play very good defense or teaching that there wasn't terrible in ... in the game filling in for Jimmy ... all over the last to San Diego chargers\nUm they're not they're not statistically bad in any particular category thing to give up too many points they run the ball pretty well and they they still struggle with the passing but with grapple allowed that number is going to go down\nBy well now you're one in three and you have the home crowd behind you in Los Angeles are you still found a way to lose their losing closer games and then they're not but I just I probably should have put them lower I Would have taken Pittsburgh out of this thing and put them down in that area but there are thirty want to put San Francisco there\n... with you on the niners are but I Would have put niners are twenty seven [noise] only because they did a they did win a home game in road uniforms that's right they did when I was going to be my charger so that keeps them out of my top five this week [laughter]\nYou know or do they lost to my charges I should say that's where I'm my thirty one team is the bills by you know listen we we took him out of the top five last week 'cause I thought oh my God they got to win and things were click and they beat a good Minnesota Vikings seem [noise]\nMaybe those Minnesota Viking seems not that good Newark I'm going to kinda see maybe there's\nYou know a lot of flaws in that same but the bill showed up show well they didn't show up they showed who they are again and I just the same as it's going to be a bond ...\nHide hide traffic [noise] you know we because I was\nMaking the point with the Steelers the bills would have been in my bottom five and we'll be back to my bottom five when they lose the titans this weekend um but uh that's where I Would have put them whenever thirty two team I think is the Arizona Cardinals cars their own for they really steak boy they were not so much there's really nothing more you can say I mean\nAnd my number thirty two team I think is the Arizona Cardinals could their own for they really steak boy they were young nuts about Missouri that are ... there's really nothing more you can say I mean\nOne day Josh Rosen might get it and might it might help but come the steam when some games and boy they are an ugly ugly football team that they can't run they can score they can't stop anybody\nYeah it's not just the ... the defense as well and that's how you're feeling so horrible with a ...\nYou know the I mean this is probably his swan song season he came back to play in the season and you're just I just [noise] you know you just hope for so much more for a guy of his collar I mean first of all the hall of famer all the way and\nThen even if somebody you up you know go down the list of David Johnson and up and coming running back who had a season taken away from last year this is this is shaping up just to be a really awful season for the cardinals Syria averaging nine points a game [noise]\nTwenty five percent of the season here in the books averaging nine points a game and they haven't played anybody know that's the thing too is like they keep losing two teams that they should win on paper you look at it like oh that's a close match up\nShould have been able to take care of the ... should have been able to take care of the cowboys near the rams and the bears that definitely could last but you could he could have been the Redskins and the sea hawks\nDepth yeah blue blue sometimes they play the cow budget for the cowboys yet\nSo there you go that's our top five bottom five for a week for the national football

really moving to supernatural me [laughter] so freaked out I was really freaked out and I kept on I couldn't understand why my mother and father were freaked out by this right\nI'm like there's evidence on the television that goes thinks they're toys moving by itself\nAnd they're like no it isn't and I'm like no it is and my father of course it would be like well yeah well of course it is

fuller active as well\nKen attacks in show some life your input to wins together a lot of people last week said you know the cult kind of handed you that when after you gave up a big leap\nI I'm actually kind of surprised the wind knows where it is so you think the cowboy hours and\nI think this game should be closer to pick up on a neutral field I think I Would take Dallas for sure and\nThis game to me how I see it going I think uh you kind of saw to me how like okay you remember the cowboys giants game I think ... to ... and the cowboys didn't really do a lot of things that we what they did enough\nThey had a couple of big plays early on and then just kind of grinding the game out with his economic ... and a and the running game\nAnd they really they really came down to the giants were really couldn't block the cowboys and I think the same things that happened again improve cowboys the fence uh\nI I Know Sean leads in Iowa I've looked at as a big injury they'll know download the for the work the LA and they had already been go is the standard\n... exactly and that it it hasn't been the oh my gosh ... and playing the disaster in the past because of him and I think Dallas is going to do something similar here they were to see a low scoring game but I think that what is the live under I'm gonna pull out of I think Dallas is the ... going to be in the backfield all day and I think he left that giants so yeah and\nI I think you just look at the issues the Texans have had to protecting the shots and coupled with the strength is how is even just really good and they're going to be able to get pressure on the show was on the question is can the Texans defense jaywalking ... he was playing on the MVP type a defensive player to your type level last week and really the last two weeks as Jay Jay walking he get the whole defense vitamin\nA cowboys often that has not been good so I I agree with you that it's going to be low scoring although we also said some other games are gonna be high scoring we thought heading in so maybe maybe we're all in for a surprise when I put the over under for this game forty six\nI think it was something around there maybe a little bit lower but I like the ... well you know a twenty to Thirteen type there maybe maybe a little bit more but I think Dallas will be in control and uh you know kind of grind out a win here I just think it was going to have a hard time moving the ball consistently against them\nShould be a a good game in terms of atmosphere at you know as you said um you know a big deal of you know what if that's actually what a loss last week to the polls\nTickets for the game would have been a lot cheaper [laughter] I was looking on secondary markets are still pretty pricey to get into nights Sunday Night Football is ... tons a cowboy fans are going to be at this what's the split going to be like and I think\nThat's part of it I think even if these teams are you know not good and you know it's like how do you have a little hope now and yeah I mean these teams are probably the best ones average ones below average at this point and then the the NFL season I Do think\nThere is the reason those things are expensive though is that you know they always play once every four years is that on Houston versed Alan ... and you know how old is a lot of cowboys fans here and this is there one time and for years they can see the Texans or really ate ears because they you know when the next time they play there will be in Dallas\nRight and you're you're going to be like oh I was once an eight year type thing I'll show out money for it so that drives the market up I think\nAbsolutely let's say a quick break come back we'll update you on this late afternoon slave where it looks like the cardinals have
