I'm just imagine being a browns fan and just like it's it's it's clear at least to me but I was there any question to you as as because it will likely Danny and Thomas in literally saw his need go

Twitter at a ballgame played All right I Want to start with this really really good but I'm tired of controversial raiders ground game opened breeding Cleveland forty\nTo forty two ah obviously the point that everyone's going to be talking about tomorrow or today I guess I should say is uh the overturning of replacement of the ball on that first down or that was supposedly not a first down is there any excuse for what the referees did in terms of our local but one of us\nThe policemen of the ball on that first downloaded that was supposedly not a first down is there any excuse for what the referees did in terms of look that was one of the replay is great but one of the reasons that we have replays to overturn with ... and under suitable evidence is there any under suitable evidence that made you think that's closer to been overturned\nYou know it's interesting because you know a lot of times it comes down to\nThree plays on the football game but this one you know you had a a lot of things going on 'em and if you're the browser I'm pretty sure I Know the coaching staff was probably some of these guys say we shouldn't let it come down to a misplaced a spot on a on a play\nA Baker Mayfield can't have returned over or do you got to get some style and so they'll they'll try to justify all that that went on that ball game\nOr a rightfully so so I I look at it you know rough going to make let's say\nYou're right the supposed to go to replay and get the call right\nI'm going to have you know it it's weird because by and football is a judgment call is this is this still aware that it came down to that but again they had a big lead breaking my throat cancer and the ball over I'm and I'm Still trying to figure out why Nick Chubb only got four\nOr five calf raising the phone rang yeah I Know you look at the box scores crazy three for one oh five and two touchdowns Carlos Hyde and twenty to carry for eighty two yards and a score but yet subversive again in the Baltimore what\nAre your overall impression is a big there may still now we've seen him for a game and a half my impressions are and you can respond to this I think he looks like a rookie today there were ... they were definitely really good moments you know there are also the really bad moments at the end what are your thoughts on Baker may feel to a game and a half [laughter]\nWell I think he's the nail right on the head it's funny to watch brown spans than browns fan a list and brown or bloggers and browse writers and the writers\nJustify what the what they thought that they ... the polar for the guy they kill all last year as a work in the Sean Kaiser so when you watch the game you kind of saw some things that parents who are doing well your ... he'll have some place\nUm that would probably be a little bit more athletic and give you more to run again put forth in there they're doing the same things\nAnd still have those same turnover issues but Baker may bill was just you know ... or or was this receiver stuff ... son was in his eyes that is both a but I I agree with you you look like they're working this is what you expect the funny part is\nIs that the Sean ... is still one year the under intense Baker\nMaintenance though um I just fine I just think this whole situation is very interesting and and and a lot of times it does get frustrating just watching the the uh unfairness in coverage um you know with third quarter back then and it was these teams\nFor sure the Emery hunters are against the owner of football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter and ask

lights the world on fire like this on watching immediately but they did the Chicago has been preaching patients patients' patient\nIs is that Gore and what happened which of escape today and I'm not trying to take anything away from his use it more of a reflection of them who Tampa is like who they really are defensively or a more of a reflection on where's the Congo is actually going to go this year do you think\nYou know I think all things can be true in this situation Tampa came out like that for even plant some good the fence of football\nBut first couple of games with the the them um and there's like these last two games to solve them to and granted some of it was rife has passed this fall put them in a bad spot but their defense hasn't been as good as the last two games as opposed to the first to\nAn ... can be a clear a great game you've got to give them credit to I think would help them out and I've been preaching is for two years now\nIs that one the bears always have off the

they're really well so they always have talent it's always been the Bengals okay this game they sat themselves both penalties or this game these type of social support because\nSo and so blue and assigned or so and so it was injured but they're playing football and they're finding ways to win this game was an example that came back in the cold and with an example where they came back you know

I think their weapons and if you were just to look at it like the the you know skilled position players\nThey might have better skilled position players at the wide receiver position than teams like the rams teams like the Vikings I mean the Jones to no one really hard legitimately in my opinion the best three some in terms of wide receivers in football yet there are one and three so what happened\nIn the draft why didn't really drive so much I don't remember\nI think people looked at ...\nThe best three some in terms of wide receivers in football yet there are one and three so what

Texas coast to coast time here ... this through the glass family yes this is an\nNFL Sunday I but I did want to read this because it is kind of cool what is going on in baseball we're gonna have to tie breaker games on tap today\nOr for the first time in baseball history\nThere will be two two game number one hundred and sixty three tie breaker games or the brewers are going to play the cubs to the side of the central Rockies are going to play the Los Angeles Dodgers\nUm so what happened today the brewers the cubs the Dodgers the Rockies all of them what they wanted to add to lead to\nYou know the did you take notice it as Bobby like the combined scores of the brewers cubs Dodgers in Rockies game today those four teams out scored their opponent forty eight to\nFive today forty eight to five so award\nOh five eastern time the brewers are going to be in Chicago to play at Wrigley Field\nAnd the Iraqis are going to be in Los Angeles or to play the Dodgers I think this is pretty cool I was monitoring like kind of a golf thing that was going on today with the Ryder Cup I was monitoring obviously everything that was going on by the white college football is great this weekend as well we're not going to get to talk much about it but Bobby and I were talking about it during the break\nA constant struggling with fear accused on Saturday that you think they're kind of regretting or demoted Kelly Brian now I think maybe they might be because look if you don't demo Kelly Bryant you know that you're going to have to quarterback that you can most likely trust all the way through the end of the year\nAnd looking back this not make you think like\nLike when I where I think about Alabama like it's clear to me that too is better than J what\nDo you think they even had that thought and his head last year of look\nI might lose Jay Lynn hurt a really good option a quarterback\nAnd to a who's a freshman at the time loose cannon I might lose him if I play to up early on in the year\nAnd so maybe he was like All right let's see how much we how far we can go with Jay Lynn but I'm not I'm no I have the better quarterback into a\nUh it's just interesting what's going on when we come back top five NFL games of the day is over tonight on a finishing radio\nBy the office of the opposite side they will score and what the ... side they will struggle so they really well is basically like they'll score a lot of plans but they are stopping\nAnd it's not like they lost their guys on one level like they lost two big guys on the defensive line than the other levels can make up for it I think I Would rather have that happen to me as a team that what happened to Atlanta they lose piano Neal state the arguably their best to be and they lose their best linebacker Dionne just\nLike some times it happens like sometimes your season gets decimated by injury and we talked about why they were Green Bay in Houston because it happened at the quarterback position but those are those are really\nThere to best defensive players correct is that the stretch maybe three like do you ... it's hard [laughter] especially when you play it seemed like Cincinnati you know like who is clearly better like any Dalton is better this year that he was last year and he just did do\nTop law especially when you lose it in the last thirty seconds of the game the Bengals beat the falcons today thirty seven to thirty six number three okay Tennessee Titans this'll\nBe on our list tomorrow are they for real or not for real it took over time it took over time but Tennessee took care of Philadelphia today [noise]\n[noise]\nGo I like that you notice how the color analysts lay low play by play guy can do it All right uh Tennessee was my biggest takeaway from this game by twenty six twenty three tendency over Philadelphia Eagles just hit this game away man they did all that in overtime the eagles scored at first they got a field goal\nThey had ten is the fourth down and Fifteen\nAnd they were playing this this so I just don't\nYou know what you there's an old saying in football okay prevent defense says one thing it prevents you from winning the game and that's what happened\nTo like this that was you remember the play more than Fifteen and in Tennessee complete the past I mean they were laying off the receivers twenty yards so that was one thing that was stupid then there was a deep in the past interference in that over time\nAnd then there was a defensive holding all down what other ones are going down on that point that the team the other to deepen the penalties happen on third down\nVillage do see a wet Tennessee\nWhen this came obviously you've got to give credit where credit's due at the end there but do this to me it's more about Philadelphia than it is about ten of the I don't I tendencies when they're just like crazy to me like I don't know I don't know how it's happening but Tennessee over Philadelphia today twenty to twenty three\nNumber four author you send Jackson's probably be yours used in taxes and get the job done their first victory of the season is a game winning kick over the Indianapolis Colts\nIt's down Daniel with a whole ... kick\nGod jak says winning over time some thoughts are thirty seven thirty four [noise]\nTexans radio thirty seven thirty four is used in takes care of Indianapolis or how about this the Sean watching another good game statistically three hundred and Seventy five yards and two touchdowns along with an interception the Andre ... is a hundred and sixty nine yards\nReceiving and ate touch down there as well you didn't get their first one of the season after Frank Reich make though is talking about this earlier in the segment Frank right poorer than it for for his own forty four yard line and he decides to go for it instead of punch which basically would have meant a tie ballgame\nHe decides to go for it well you got a credit to come home they they are but it did that the Sean watching\nUp with an opportunity to throw the ball to the ... the Andre hopping that sets up the game when people do what you just heard so the taxes one is three and the coats one and three members die off the Chicago Bears it was missile tribute Tuesday\nYou don't like to echo the about it is too long ago and they didn't have the day that\nIt said the force yeah\nPretty force why do we think is so critical of the cause is not going to be critical about when it comes to the Chicago Bears today they beat Tampa forty eight to ten yes James Winston will be the starting quarterback wants to come up there by next week but how about your best team in Nineteen twenty six three hundred fifty four yard touchdown I mean I I\nI don't know like if he didn't he looked like a completely different quarterback than what he I mean the throws that he was making on the dime like type spirals he looked really really impressive today to re Cohen hundred Twenty one year as receiving a touchdown Taylor great real a hundred yards to touch the I mean all of the guys that they brought in it\nImpressive today to recall one hundred Twenty one you're receiving a touchdown Taylor great real a hundred yards to start to I mean all of the guys that they brought in and the off\nSeason this had Ryan Pace just his\nFingerprints all over like we were talking about how\nThe browns went on

over the edge of the nation radio Matt Harris with us jump back into the NFL specifically the Cincinnati Bengals three and one Cincinnati Bengals Jay Morse in as our gas he's a reporter who covers the bangles for the athletic you can follow Jay's work on Twitter right Jay Morse than ac H\nJ this was quite the ballgame Cincinnati edging out uh thirty seven thirty six when or what is it about this off and that is making it collects so well right now\nAh I just think they've got a lot of weapons and indeed go ... ... has really taken a big step their sheer one one of the things when we're\nBuilding over last year he couldn't change a lot in midstream and and he he changed everything terminology was in the off season for it\nBut he also talked a lot about trying to to make Andy uncomfortable what you would think a an officer coordinators job would you do the do the exact opposite but he said you can't\nYou have to make somewhat uncomfortable in order to make them grow so he's put a lot more on Andy Dalton this year and a Andy is just\nHe's one of those guys that he may not have\nThe skill set of Tom Brady and he's not he's not the kind of quarterback it's going to put a team on his shoulders and carry under the super bowl but he is really ... cerebral he he does a great job\nPre snap a of getting them in the right play and the ... they're just executing after the snappy he's making quick shark grows the receivers or couch and\nFor the most part everything he throws them wanting herself she had a day one of the titans than but they're just they're working to everybody's skill set in and kind of putting them in the best possible position and it it they were last in the league last year an author and connect it's been a complete turnaround this year\nYeah and it really is amazing and and what's amazing to me is I think a lot of people including myself out of that the office might see a little bit of a drop off with Joe mix and being gone for the last couple of games but they have not skip the beat at all uh Giovanni Bernard comes in it does a really good job scores\nTwo touchdowns should we see a split ... do you think are more of a slip back deal with those two guys mixing and Bernard when Joe is healthy\nI think that was the plan all along I they they were really disappointed in and how little they were able to use geo and and the first game I'm at Indianapolis I I I don't think we're we're not going to see a fifty fifty split\nAh I Do think it could be more of a sixty forty sixty five thirty five\nUm ... body Bernard as he's\nHe's really good don't get me wrong but but he's a smart guy and he's a runner between the tackles but ... you still have to wonder avoid a heavier workload would do for him over the\nCourse of the season I think that's why they're trying to limit him he can handle the load in a full game we saw that last week we saw that this week but we'll we'll when does it start adding up over the course of the season I think that's why they're trying to trying to keep them dial back I'm\nJoe mix and look terrific than his in his predicting work out today um and and he looked pretty good run it on the sideline to celebrate with age agreed after he got into a I\nThink we I think we see them back in action next week against Miami which would mean the most to games after knee surgery which is really pretty remarkable\nAbsolutely Jay more as soon as our guest covers the Cincinnati Bengals for the athletic you can follow Jay's work on winter Ajay more ... are you covered it seems very easy for a fan of just anybody to watch and just see how tough AJ green is to guard do you don't want to want to simply because of its lightening speed\nBut it it late and gave one of those things that I dealt with this one J specifically was there were so many people catching balls today I think maybe there were eight or nine guys who caught a pass\nOn ... is that one of the reasons why aged green can be successful link game 'cause this is not the first time we've seen AJ green of a game winning touchdown catch is just the fact that there are so many more weapons that the bangles have to throw to this year\nYeah I mean this this team has been looking for a replacement for mom it's a new when Marvin Joan since they left in two thousand Fifteen and that's why they got ... and the and the second round\nTwo years ago or three years ago I'm Sorry and while they got John Ross number nine overall last year and they both have their ups and downs Tyler had a great rookie year and then he really struggled last year he he was an act I use a healthy scratch where you gave us an injury\nUm but he is just taking a huge relief this year and when they said at point blank and the ... is a big reason why he's\n... H J has been having the success he's had this year because he's finally got somebody that can take the pressure off than they can't just roll coverage at age ... anymore and now John Ross is starting to emerge he\nHad a touchdown today his second year he also had a really nice catch on the sideline brutal game for him last week quit on a couple routes costs nearly adult in the couple interceptions talk all week was given the Bengals trust John Ross are they going to the gym a base stuck by him and he rewarded that today\nUm so if you've got John Ross than an entire board running around in that secondary along with a degree and it's kind of a poisoned thing for the defense\nAnd it really is more than our guest covers the Cincinnati Bengals pretty athletic you can follow his work on whether it's a more than eighty eight so obviously gruesome injury today for Tyler I for it when it comes to him off and simply how is this going to affect the up and moving forward\nYou know it's interesting because last year he only played two games\nAnd fiber Croft really kind of stuff he's he's not going to be a ... but he stepped up and had a really nice season last last year and CGI Usama is really starting to come on and and\nThrough the first four games this year we saw them doing a lot of retired and said they've been getting those guys in a giving them wraps giving them target um if they're they're never going to be that match up nightmare that Tyler I for it is but I don't think it changes the so often\nUm if they're they're never going to be that match up nightmare that Tyler I for it is but I don't think it changes the so often that much at all I think part of the crop is just going to step into that spot and then you know work out of the slot being into the line tide and\nUm he he's not going to be the red zone threat the Tyler I thought it was but\nI I don't think it changes things greatly the obviously they're going to miss Tyler I for it but\nUh that they've kind of grown accustomed to not having them this you know all assumptions or he's going to be done for the year that means at the end of his six year old who live there was a six year\nOld and so far right now he's he's played forty three of a possible eighty four games and and then by the end of the year that's gonna be forty three of us will Ninety six so they this team is used to not having Tyler I heard on the line with\nOne of those back to what you said about Andy dog because that's really interesting now that I think about the all the the fact that you think if you want to make them more uncomfortable and then you can grow from there\nCan you give a standing ton of specific that it is it more more responsibility free snap but maybe more freedom to audible what exactly do you mean when you say he's more uncomfortable and you know he's growing from that\nI think it's all of that but I think the main thing was bill laser the office of ordinary changed all the terminology I mean\nThey seemed to Andy Dalton came in and it was just the succession of object grew in to the huge accident ... you know ... everything just stayed the same every time they switch coordinators and bill so we're going to\nBlow this thing up and you're going to start from scratch or you're gonna have to learn all new terminology and then I Do think there's some more ... now responsibilities and and I think a big thing is in a lot of people kind of been waiting\nFor this for me and he is he's really challenged him to be more of a leader um ... you ain't never been that really super vocal guy but\nYou really do see him growing in that role it even in press conferences he's he's always been kind of a you know he's been friendly but he's been kind of a dry kind of a boring quote and you know he's been cracking jokes he's just he just seems so much looser so much more comfortable in his skin now which is ironic because the whole goal was to make them uncomfortable\nYeah no definitely I Jay Morse in our guest covers the Cincinnati Bengals the athletic you can follow Jay's work on Twitter and Jay Morse than HGH okay defensively I mean obviously Atlanta's a tough team they got multiple weapons\nBut this is now the second consecutive week where the defense has given up thirty points I if I wanted to ask you to identify a problem like what is the main problem with the Cincinnati Bengals events which has given up sixty eight points over the last couple of weeks what would that problem the\nUh can't tackle can't cover that means it's hard to pick a main on that it's been issues all across the\nThey they haven't been able to get to the quarterback that they came into this is and it was that was supposed to be the strength of this team was the defensive line but we we've seen teams just kinda go to that quick passing game gift to get the ball out immediately and this team forever has struggled in the middle of the field with with\nNight yeah so I I'm not a believer that same or I mean nice starts at a season or you know partial starts at the seasons are into but New England patriots are in town and they're coming back to take their current\nYes they are hey you did

Thomas going out with an injury today is a perfect example if you are against slavery on bell of why you should be for lay beyond bell\nBecause leaving on bell and Earl Thomas this case in fitting out this entire time was what if I get hurt on and what if it's a big injury like Pearl Thomas just suffered\nThen my long term value I'm never going to get the contract that I think I deserve I'm never going to get the ... you know I I bust my but for the first seven eight years of my career I\nHave I think really the unspent of the league a little bit less I Am a big part of the defense in Thomas's case I'm a big part of the fence just in terms of volume of carries an impact scoring big part\nBut okay maybe this team can't pay me maybe this the ... don't want to pay me because they're going in a different direction and Thomas I think couldn't grasp of that but that's why I was holding out living on bell is ... grasp that maybe it's not going to be the Steelers who gave me that contract\nBut this is why you hold out\nIs why you're holding out of your life you don't do a situation that happened today Earl Thomas absolutely horrible breaks his leg and\nI'm Thomas I'm full of rage because I kind of you know I went I did what I thought was the right thing to do I'm showing up for the games are showing up for practices but I'm showing up for the games\nSo if you're against slavery on bill still after seeing what happened Earl Thomas really dig deep and think about why these guys are holding out\nOkay and this is why it's happening but again when it comes to ...\nDig deep and think about why these guys are holding out\nOkay and this is why it's happening\nBut again when it comes to Pittsburgh specifically I Do still think that Ryan shades here\nIs the bigger injury because that defense looks horrible mad it really does they got gas and it every week like it's okay one or two weeks I Would say All right maybe you know that's a fluke thing their defenses ... that that that still the the ... ghost is still out there on the sideline for Pittsburgh\nBut dude it's happen every week it's happened all four weeks where the Steelers secondary looks exposed but typically in the middle of the field body and I think that's the bigger lot\nYeah I mean that the deepest isn't the same with Iraq say they are I mean he was the leader\nWas a you know to get those guys are ready for to play really ... with them a lemon devastating injury pretty much career ending injury for him and\nThis whole he'll never get that contract yeah yeah I don't know how I got it\nNever get it I mean but it's just hard for those guys to I mean we've seen it's a night or they couldn't tackle you know being they couldn't they couldn't a cover the wide receiver they couldn't ... cover when they need a Michael Crabtree\nThen again yeah I think if you were to watch tape blast fear may be the same thing was happening last year but shades ear could cover that you know ... if a cornerback method to tackle maybe ... there he's got those insects is he going to be able to play football get like next year I don't think so\nSo sad man he was so good you know and I'm not saying Libya built up you can make the argument when you look at what had happened with Pittsburgh this year they're one two and one that's the record\nYou can make the argument they lost their most impactful not going to say best Antonio Brown has you know probably the best ... athletically\nBest in the most impactful skilled position player offensively in most impactful skill position player to effectively and when that happens\nYou take a drop off like they are going to do and we were talking to one of the producers of the station before he's a he's a date that as I was coming in tonight and he was leaving he said don't be surprised if the Steelers end up going like six intend this year\nThat could be the team that falls off the cliff or when we come back\nThe biggest game of the day in terms of scoring nobody ... that's been itching right\nThis is just over the night with mad hair up probably play that one more time what we know mad we got a new voice guy entirely what we know that guy should be a movies I think he should be like doing trailers for movies like point why you know you don't think so and how he does is ... what does he do Jim ... man\nI don't know the guy said why do you think I Know the guys man for getting this is the second time in a row where us said that I should know something that I get why should I Know that why should you know we're promoting October fest why should I don't know why should I Know that this guys that are ... and one more time I want to hear that so they say the trailer for movies\nOn a cell phone while he was on her around the world and the name is Jay cutlery gentleman Jim ...

and on top of the nation radio dot com\nReally O'Reilly auto parts studios here's Matt Harris\nBack into overnight SB Nation radio Matt Harris\nWith you let's jump into the NFL day that was with Emory hunch owner and founder of football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter at ... ball game played All right I Want to start with this really really good but kind of controversial raiders Brown's game opening beatings Cleveland forty five to forty two\nUh obviously to play that everyone's going to be talking about tomorrow or today I guess I should say\nIs uh the overturning of the placement of the ball on that first downloaded that was supposedly not a first down is there any excuse for what the referees did in terms of our local one of the\nReplay is great but one of the reasons that we have re players to overturn with an unjust beautiful evidence that is there any under suitable evidence that made you think that calls would've been overturned\nNote and don't because you know a lot of time\nIt comes down to three plays on the football game but this one you know you had a a lot of things going on 'em and if you're the browser I'm pretty sure I Know the coaching staff has problems on these guys say we shouldn't let it come down to\nA misplaced a spot on a on a play a big cat have returned over a different kind of get some stuff and you know try to justify all that that we went on that ball game or a rightfully so so I look at it you know we're gonna make mistakes\nYou write the supposed to go to replay and get the call right\nUm but it is if you know it it's weird because ... football and the judgment call is this is just so where they came down to that but again they had a big lead ... who can't turn of all over um and I'm Still trying to figure out why\nMake shove only got four or five cameras and the thing\nYeah I Know you look at the box or it's crazy three for ... five and two touchdowns Carlos Hyde at twenty to Paris for eighty two yards and score but yet subversive again in the Baltimore what are your overall impression is a bigger Mayfield now we've seen him for a game and a half\nMy impressions are and you can respond to this I think he looked like a rookie today there were ... they were definitely really good moments you know there are also really bad moments at the end what are your thoughts on bigger may feel through a game and a half hour\nWell I think he's the nail right on the head it's funny to watch brown spans and brown span a list and brown a blogger and browse riders beat writer\nJustify what what they thought that they oppose the guy they kill all last year as a work in the Sean ... do you watch the game you kind of saw some things that has to have ... he'll have to go play\n'em they'll call you a little bit more but it can be more than one of the game for parts in there they're doing the same thing\nAnd having those same turnover issues but Baker my bills to pay into five or ... because this receivers the old son was in his eyes that is both a but I I agree with you even look like a working this is what you expect the funny part is is that the strong tie this bill why you're younger Baker\nMay fifth so um I just find I think this whole situation is very interesting and a lot of your birth rate and just watching the the uh unfairness and coverage um you know with third quarter back and and it will be paying\nFor the Emery ... is our guest zone or a football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter at ball game plan it covers the NFL missiles\nAre busy had himself the day today and a forty eight ten when Chicago over Tampa Bay a bears was the three and want to get six touchdown passes three hundred fifty four year old you know and we were always kind of told when it came to chip is key\nTo be patient and they say you know he's he's gonna he's not going to be one of those quarterbacks who comes in and like the world on fire like this on watching immediately but they did to Chicago's been preaching patients patients' patient is this the store and what half\nOf which are busy today and I'm not trying to take anything away from ... to use it more of a reflection on who Tampa is like who they really are defensively or a more of a reflection on\nAnd I'm not trying to take anything away from service you use it more of a reflection on who Tampa is like who they really are defensively or a more of a reflection on where's the Congo is actually going to go this year do you think\nYou know I think all things can be true in this situation pamper came out but if they've been playing some good the fence the football\nBut first couple of games that the fees and I'm In this play these last two games to solve them to and granted some of the world live this past this fall put them in a bad spot but there's different hasn't been as good as the last two games as close to the first to\nAn tribute can be a great game you've got to give them credit to I think would help them out and not been preaching this for two years now\nIs that one the bears are always have all sorts of play makers and the guys that can may play the problem is when they try to be the balls to Jordan power\nHe slows down the often they use them bomb they go through to recall one and the often blocked and everything just opened up three calls led to the theme of receiving he was leaving Russia or from from the running back position and\nSo that kept that deep end of the book the balance they didn't know what we're going to happen when he was in the game was then allow for you to find open guys down there was some guy who was running ... coverage is out there on behalf of power but\nHe was clear that usually predict you would have meant and now he found them so you hope that he can stockpile back to back performances just obviously you off those ... we can laugh at\nYour brawls but [laughter]\nThat's out there still great you know so um he need I think he needed a performance like this I'm happy for them because it was looking bad he was looking like the liability on that all said that he had a really good day\nYeah it's funny because I actually was talking last week on my show every about what if the bears draft I did like what is Patrick ... homes was drafted by the bears you know the u._s. do San ... go later in that drafts\nChicago's deepens is just on another planet compared to Kansas City defense but I'll do let's stick in the NFC South what is more surprising to you and the founders loose today the bangles thirty seven thirty six what is more surprised to use the south is there one in three or the bangles or three in one\nWho got one and three and Matt Ryan has placed some great falls the last two games in ... when you look at the tip this as\nA box or from Wasilla point of view you say many believe they blew these teams out but you look at school and they love you like wow yeah there are these with really is terrible so them being one and three is far more shocking to me the Bengals always have ... because I think over the last\nSeveral years they've drafter really well so they always have talent it's always been the Bengals okay the game they sat themselves both penalties or this ... foot because so\nAnd so blue and assigned or so and so's injured but they're playing football and they're finding ways to win this game was an example that came back in the ... stand with them examples where they came back and won so you got like the the mental toughness up this whole thing but I'm more shock to stop them or one and three\nScience to Emory Honda is our guest zone or a football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter at ... ball game plan and it's really disappointing and and I'm Glad you mentioned the draft because I got a question maybe you can go back to the drafts why did Calvin Ridley dropped so much I Love this guy coming out of out of Alabama\nAnd as soon as he was drafted by the south and so I said man that is such a great camps because they got so many offices of weapons I mean you could put them on par I think honestly at Emory I think their weapons if if you were just to look at it like the the you know the skill position players\nThey might have better skill position players that the wide receiver position than teams like the rams teams like the Vikings I mean the Jones ... our legitimately in my opinion the best three some in terms of wide receivers in football yet there are one and three so what happened\nIn the draft why didn't really drive so much I don't remember\nI think people looked at ... and they didn't think that he had help side of the town of ... stuff is\nPerformances to the fact okay he's twenty four years old he's certainly gets Eighteen Nineteen year old ... of course is going to do this or he didn't really progress and and that really extrapolate his performance up from the fact of the passing game was ineffective as a whole\nAt Alabama so I think people look at the wrong thing and see if they thought he didn't have particularly well but every time you saw him on film at Alabama he was he was there the threat but he was obviously doing something to get behind the fence and I think people were really over thought\nOr the ... we've taken and that's why you see him just going to exactly what he did in college\nThat you are an extra twenty five percent bonus that tell you one hundred twenty five percent bonus only using the promo quota when one twenty five so you can take your hundred on your first that make up to twenty five\nBy the beach I had something on that that the Cleveland Browns game today or the Oakland Raiders I really did I I thought Oakland was going to win that game by double digits I really thought so I think are Mayfield everyone was all up\nA bigger maybe I'll rookie I was like okay you're going out of the road hostile environment at Oakland Raiders are desperate throw in three they had been out there and been in the no the head of an out of any of the games that they lost really you know they may feel depressed me he really really did impressed me down the stretch\nA little bit of a tumble alright

most interesting division in football that's next overnight [noise]\nAnd that's exactly what happened with Earl Thomas so look levy on bell just understand what he's doing\nOkay I think I think it makes sense these two like these two forces the Pittsburgh Steelers and lay down bell they came to a head and still said look thank you for your service we appreciate everything you've dead but look you're running back your injury prone you've already had suspensions in the past I I don't know if we want to commit to you on to her\nI understand that from the Steelers point of view again I also understand it from way beyond bells point of view I've said there's a lot\nLately on bills point of view is look at what I've done I literally I carry the how to get cares if you get a year like literally like three hundred ... he gets like thirty carries a game he was like pay me Earl Thomas's pay me I get it but look that's ... what levy on bell and Earl Thomas's mindsets really are\nIs an old baseball mindset\nAs our pools gets a ten year contract when he's thirty first from the Los Angeles angels for the success that habit to St Louis cardinals Josh Hamilton same thing mark to share a thesis about the same thing\nAgain I didn't now again I'll just point to the Yankees team seats about the market share did they help the Yankees win a World Series in two thousand nine yes but did they play did they actually play up to the contract that they got no\nSo that's the ... the the teams in the NFL are trying to not make that mistake and I understand that\nReally really do there's a lot more upside to a guy like Todd girlie that's my ... Gurley can get his contract with the Los Angeles ramps his impact with that often is\nGoing to be felt for the next two three four or five years because that the team that's an egg right now in their budding out there are a little bit more than I got out of his craft we saw that on Thursday night\nFor the next two three four or five years is that the team that's an egg right now in their budding out there are a little bit more than I gotta crack we saw that on Thursday night but you know what I'm saying like there's a lot more of a few apparently dealt with Ben Roethlisberger talking about retirement\nAnd you know we got we got Antonio Brown and you know missing film sessions who knows how this is this a team that is ready to win right now but you don't give a guy a long term deals specifically a running back and four or five year deal\nIf they're ready to win right now and their window is not in the next three or four or five years look I was talking to a shame they are the producer and I think he made a really good but he's like well could you will just that there isn't right now\nThe Steelers very well could finish in last place the Steelers window is this year\nIt's looking like it's not even going to happen to this division to me as fascinating as a as the north\nAnd the bangles look we'll get into this next door the bank or do we believe in the bangles but this\nBrown's team okay I Know Bobbie you know ... I I said that looked at Brown playoffs playoffs playoffs watch out All right well maybe we got a cool with that Baker may feel to me look like a rookie today and I know browns fans are going to come at me and say well that play that play where oh they actually went\nTo the review okay and they said that it was not a first down and I have\nNo idea what the referees we're looking at on that plane that to me was absolutely a first down\nHow you you know turn how you do you have to have indisputable evidence to turn around a call to me there was no indisputable evidence that there wasn't a burst out you're going to keep the original call but the browns made a mistake after mistake after mistake late in that ball game look Baker may still looked like a rookie\nLate in that game he looked like a rookie turning the ball over at his own zone or the interstate now there he threw three interceptions one of them was not his fault two of them were his fault\nBut this division I'm telling you are the ravens the best team you only bringing it real quick if I were to ask you to power right that AFC North I mean obviously you would have to do bangles and ravens as like one a one be\nWho would you go it like if if the bank of what we I guess we ... we go with the the uh who won that game but Thursday night game that was the ... the ravens right the ... that was the ... yeah it's okay but that was in Cincinnati ...

D at ...\nDot com hotline coming up next we're going to have Emory hunt a football game plan covers the NFL or going to get into all of this stuff I'm going to ask about that Brown's play because I was\nTo the NFL Network and I think I saw ... might have said\nHis knee was down he actually agreed with the decision um which I did not think that was going to ... you know here that opinion because to me it was so evidence it's one thing if the call was you know if there was initially called short\nAnd they went to the reply to verify the fact that it was short\nBut the the problem that everybody has and should have on that one point which would have solidified the brown still get a victory today is that it was overturned\nAnd that is something that I think is a totally reasonable argument if you are ... I'm just imagine being a browns fan and just like it's it's it's clear at least to me but I was there any question to you as as because it will like with any and talents in literally saw his knee go down\nAnd like before and he said that that was the indisputable evidence that you needed I did not see it\nI'm often literally saw his need go down and like before and he said that that was the indisputable evidence that you needed I did not see it that way did you\nSay in his elbow bow down before I've seen as for me but it's not it's not about the elbow is all about the Bob ... and the ... when it was over the line for the first on\nYoung you know what I think now that I think about it I think it was his elbow they lock was elbow so but so you didn't see it that way you though I ... I'm going to browse and it has now\nBut I mean it's just bought a gay man I'm telling you I had a little bit of money on this game and I thought that it was over like literally started driving into work because I literally thought the game was over and then I got attacks from one of our coworkers hey you're still in it you're still in it\nAnd I'm like my goodness and they started giving me like play by play like as I was he was sitting there like on his couch watching the game and I'm driving into work and he's getting me play by play of the game because I'm like oh my goodness I Can't believe they actually that's what's so unbelievable about football but I stopped watching the giants game today\n... individual regional ... he went pretty town\nI'm buying a huge flat screen TV so I

[noise]\nYou're listening to them on SB Nation radio radio Don\n... auto parts studios here's Matt Harris\nIs over the night as the nation radio Matt Harris\nBack with you and let's jump into the NFL day that was with Emory hunt owner and founder of football game plan you can follow him or his foregone winter at asphalt game played All right I Want to start with this really really good but kind of controversial raiders Brown's game open beating as Cleveland forty five to forty two\nAh obviously the point that every once somebody talking about tomorrow or the day I guess I should say is uh the overturning of the placement of the ball on that\nFirst downloaded that was supposedly not a first down is there any excuse for what the referees did in terms of a little awkward but one of us replay is great but one of the reasons that we every players to overturn with ... and under suitable evidence is there any under suitable evidence that made you think that calls have been overturned\nNote and don't because you know a lot of um it comes down to\nThirty plays on the football game but you know you had a a lot of things going on 'em and if you're the father I'm pretty sure I Know the coaches that was probably on these guys hey we shouldn't let it come down to\nA myth please a spot on a on a play a big ... return or a people got to get them stop you for them to death by all the ... went on that ball game a ... though so I look at it you know we're going to make the think\nYou're right the oath of go to replay and get the call right\nI'm going to have you know wherever you find a judgment call is this where they came down to that but again they had a big leap into cancer on the ball over I'm and I'm Still trying to figure out why they only got\nFour or five every thing\nYeah I Know you look at the box or it's crazy three for one of five and two touchdowns Carlos Hyde at twenty to Paris for eighty two yards and score yet subversive again in the Baltimore what are your overall impression is a bigger Mayfield now we've seen them for a game and a half\nMy impressions are and you can respond to this I think he looked like a rookie today they were young they were definitely really good moments you know there are also the really bad moments at the end what are your thoughts on Baker Mayfield there were a game and I ...\nWell I think he's right on the head it's funny to watch browns fan than brown span of less than ...\nIt's the end what are your thoughts on bigger made filter game and a half [laughter]\nWell I think he's the nail right on the head it's funny to watch brown spans and browns fan a list and brown or bloggers and browse writers and beat writer\nJustify what what they thought that they set the poll guy they killed all last year as a work in the Sean Kaiser so when you watch the game you kind of saw some things like high school doing well you know he he'll have some place\nUm how are you a little bit more athletic and give you more to run again put forth in there's they're doing the same things\nAnd still have those same turnover issues so Baker my bill was just you know ... or or it was because this receiver ... son was in his eyes that is both\nA but I I agree with you eat looked like the work and this is what you expect the funny part is is that the Sean ... is still want to hear the under the base of racist so um I just find I just think this whole situation is very interesting and and and a lot of times it does get frustrating just watching the\nThe uh unfairness in coverage um you know with third quarter back then and it with these things\nFor sure the Emery hunters are dead zone or a football game plan you can follow him or his work on the winner Annette ball game plan it covers the NFL\nMissiles are busy had himself a day today and I'm forty eight ten when Chicago over Tampa Bay\nA bears was the three in one eight six touchdown passes three hundred and fifty four year old you know and we were always kind of told when it came to too busy to be patient and they say you know he's he's gonna he's not going to be one of those quarterbacks who comes in and slice the world on fire like this on watching immediately but they've been to Chicago has been preaching patients patients' patient\nIs is the store and what happened which you're busy today and I'm not trying to take anything away from service you use it more of a reflection on boot camp is like who they really are defensively or a more of a reflection of the worst in Congo is actually going to go this year do you think\nYou know I think all things can be true in this situation Tampa\nCame out because they've been playing some good defense of football\nBut first couple of games with the the them um and then play these last games we solve them just and granted some of the world's wife has passed this fall put them in a bad spot but there are different hasn't been as good as the last two games as close at first to\nAn tribute can be a great game you've got to give them credit to I think would help them out and not been preaching a for two years now\nIs that one the bear the always have off the plane makers and guys that can may play the problem is when they try to be the ball to Jordan power he slows down the off days you saw them\nBomb they go through to recall one and the office in Boston\nAnd everything just opened up three calls led to the theme of receiving he was leaving Russia or from from the running back position and\nSo that ... that the fence of the book the balance they didn't know what we're going to happen when he was in the game was then allow permits you to find open guys down there was some guy who was running free some companies out there on behalf of power but\nDo you live close that usually forbid you would have meant and now he found them so you hope that he can stockpile back to back performances by just obviously all those things ... sweeping laugh at your home\n[laughter] but [laughter]\nThe house that still great you know so um he need I think he needed a performance like this I'm happy for them because it was looking bad he was looking like the liability on that also has a he had a really good day\nYeah it's funny because I actually was talking last week on my show every about what if the bears a draft I did like what is Patrick ... homes was drafted by the bears you know the UN still watch it and moms go later in that drafts\nChicago's defenses just on another planet compared to Kansas City but I Will do let's stick in the NFC South what is more surprising to you that the founders loose today the bangles thirty seven thirty six what is more surprising to you the falcons or one in three or the bangles or three in one\nWho got one and three and Matt Ryan has placed I'm grateful for the last two games in ... when you look at it as\nA box or from Wasilla point of view he's saying man they believe they blew these teams out but you look at school and they love you like wow yeah there are these really is terrible so them being one and three of fall more shocking to me the bangles always have found because I think over the last\n... years they've drafter really well so they always have talent it's always been the Bengals okay this game they sat themselves as both penalties or this ... foot because\nSome of the blue and assignment or so and so it was injured but they're playing football and they're finding ways to win this game was an example that came back in the ... stand with examples where they came back and won so you got like the the mental toughness up this single thing but I'm more shocked at the top ... all one and three\nScience to Emory Honda is our guest sooner football game plan you can follow him or his work on Twitter at ... ball game plan and it's really disappointing and and I'm Glad you mentioned the draft because I got a question maybe you can go back to the draft\nWhy did Calvin Ridley dropped so much I Love this guy coming out of out of Alabama\nAnd as soon as he was drafted by the south and I said man that is such a great game because they got so many all kinds of weapons I mean you could put them on par I think honestly at Emory I think their weapons if if you were just to look at like the ... you know skilled position players\nThey might have better skilled position players that's a wide receiver position than teams like the rams teams like the Vikings I mean the Jones to no one ... our legitimately in my opinion the best three some in terms of wide receivers in football get their one and three so what happened\nIn the dress why didn't really drive so much I don't remember\nI think people looked at really and and they didn't think that he had help side of the kind of a toss up his performances for the fact okay he's twenty four years old he's certainly gets Eighteen Nineteen year old of course he's going to do this or\nHe didn't really progress and and not really extrapolate his performance up from the fact of the passing game was ineffective as a whole\nAt Alabama so I think people look at the wrong things he said he didn't have particularly well but every time you saw him on film at Alabama he was he was there the threat but he was obviously doing something to get behind the fence and I think people were really over thought\nOr the ... we've taken and that's why you see him just going to exactly what he did in college\nIf you think that you got all the football knowledge in the world like Bobby and I do ... he's got the knowledge I don't buy that screwed over a bother you didn't well this week right and that is that a bad idea\nPredicted ... day period the do\nYou watch that show yet no no no I have to give you the password right side as\nWell I bet the dot com they're

we're gonna have to tie breaker games on tap today\nOr for the first time in baseball history there will be two two game number one hundred and sixty three tie breaker games or the brewers are going to play the cubs set aside the central Rockies are going to play the Los Angeles Dodgers um so what happened today the brewers the cubs the Dodgers the Rockies all\nOf them want they want to add the

today\nForty eight to five do award all five eastern time the brewers are going to be\nIn Chicago to play at Wrigley Field\nAnd the Rockies are going to be in Los Angeles or to play the Dodgers I think this is pretty cool I was monitoring like kind of a golf thing that was going on today with the Ryder Cup I was monitoring obviously everything that was going on by the white college football is great this weekend as well we're not going to get to talk much about it but probably and I were talking about uh during the break\nA constant struggling with fear accused on Saturday that\nYou think they're kind of regretting or demoted Kelly Brian now I think maybe they might be because look if you don't demo Kelly Bryant you know that you're going to have two quarterbacks that you can most likely trucks all the way through the end of the year and looking back\nThis not make you think like like when I were I think about Alabama like it's clear to me that too is better than J what do you think they even had that thought and has had last year of look\nI might lose J what hurts a really good option a quarterback\nAnd two of who's a freshman at the time loose cannon I might lose them if I play to us early on in the year\nAnd so maybe he was like All right let's see how much we how far we can go with Jay Lynn but I'm not I'm no I have the better quarterback into us\nIt's just interesting what's going on when we come back top five NFL games of the day is over tonight on a finished reading [noise]\nUh guys who are out of the season\nAnd that shows I mean I learned a deep sense was okay with those guys begin to learn that that's all right how are those out they're missing a lot of good guys on the basis of the authors of the opposite side they will score and what the defensive side they will struggle so they really well is basically like they'll score a lot of places but they're stopping to\nBan it not like they lost their guys on one level like they lost two big guys on the defensive line than the other levels can make up for it I think I Would rather have that happen to me as a team that what happened to Atlanta they lose piano Neal upstate the arguably their best to be and they lose their best linebacker Dionne jokes\nLike some times it happens like sometimes you're sneezing getting decimated by injury and we talked about why aren't they were Green Bay and use it because it happened at the quarterback position but those are those are really\nThere to defend the players ... is that the stretch maybe three like you can't it's hard especially when he boy it seemed like Cincinnati you know like who is clearly better like any adult and his better this year that he was last year he just did so\nTough loss especially when you lose it in the last thirty seconds of the game but the Bengals beat the falcons today thirty seven thirty six members three okay the Tennessee Titans this'll be on our list some are where they for real or not for real it took over time\nIt took over time but Tennessee took care of Philadelphia today [noise]\n[noise]\nThat's a good call I like that he noticed how the collar analyst lay low play by play guy can do it\nAll right uh Tennessee look my biggest takeaway from the game probably twenty six twenty three tendency over Philadelphia Eagles just his this game away man they did I all in overtime the eagles court first they got a field goal\nThey had tennis team sports down in the team\nAnd they were playing this does so I just don't you know what you there's an old saying in football okay prevent defense says one thing it prevents you from winning the game and that's what happened\nTo like this that was you know play more than Fifteen and the Tennessee complete the past I mean they were laying off the receivers twenty yards so that was one thing that was stupid then there was a deep at the pass interference in that over time\nAnd then with the defense of holding all down what other ones are both down for the day and the other to see but the penalties have it on third down\nBelow what do the a wet Tennessee when this game obviously you've got to give credit where credit's due at the end there but [noise]\nDo this to me it's more about Philadelphia than it is about Tennessee I Tennessee's wins or just like crazy to me like I don't know I don't know how it's happening but [noise] Tennessee over Philadelphia today twenty to twenty three [noise]\nNumber or are they using tactics and Bobby beat your used in Texas in get the job done their first victory of the season is a game

hundred and\nFifty nine yards receiving and ate touched down there as well she used to get their first one of the season after Frank Reich make though is talking about this earlier in the segment Frank ripe for down at Fort from like his own forty four yard line and he decides to go forward instead of point which basically what it meant a tie ballgame\nHe decides to go for it look you've got credit the components there but it did that the Sean watching up with an opportunity to throw the ball to the ... uh the Andre hopping that sets up the game when\nPeople do which is just hurts other Texans want to three and the cold one and three members die off the Chicago there it was mental trip is Tuesday [noise]\nYou don't like that all day about it is too long ago and they didn't have that they did\nIt say the same force yeah\nPretty force why do we think she'll critical of the calls there's nothing\nTo be critical about when it comes to the Chicago Bears today they beat Tampa forty eight to ten yes James Winston will be the starting quarterback once the buck to come up there by next week of it how about your best demand Nineteen twenty six three hundred fifty four yardsticks touchdown I mean I I I don't know like she could he didn't he was going to a completely different quarter back\nThen what do you mean the throws that he was making on the dime\nLike tight spirals she looked really really impressive today to recall one hundred Twenty one year after receiving a touchdown Taylor great real hunter for us to talk to I mean all of the guys that they brought\nIn in the

gone into but then I\nMean this is pushing the God\nI think that there's one sick they last like seven I mean those are the games that could be in the middle where but I mean that the team in the ... there was I thought that that was when I came out right and they had some opportunities to storm back late late Dr I don't know what in the world Cam Newton was doing in the last two minutes that game\nThey had one time out there down by seven\nThey had no urgency\nNone they took their time their walk into the line of scrimmage I'm up there going guys if you need a field goal funny which I ... if they were going to kick if he'll go I was cool with that because that would have covered and I would have been on the radio today talking about the fact that the Carolina Panthers new to the point spread because they they were\nPlaying for a field goal and there was no point to get a feel go down by seven but they did it anyway that didn't happen but they had no urgency [noise]\nDo end up

Matt\nHarris back with us jump back into the NFL is typically the Cincinnati Bengals the free and on Cincinnati Bengals say more sin as our guest he's a reporter who covers the Bengals for the athletic you can follow D jays work on Twitter at Jay Morse today the H\nJ this was quite the ballgame Cincinnati as you got a thirty seven thirty six when it\nAh what is it about this off and that is making it clicks\nOr send aid the H J this was quite the ball games in ... thirty seven thirty six when it what is it about this off and said is making it clear so well right now\nI just think they've got a lot of weapons and Andy ... it has really taken a big step their sheer one one of the things when we're ... and her last year he\n... he couldn't change a lot in midstream and and he he changed everything terminology wise in the off season but\nBut he also talked a lot about trying to to make Andy uncomfortable which you would think a an officer coordinators job would be the do the exact opposite but he said you can't ... you have to make somewhat uncomfortable in order to make them grow so he put a lot more on Andy Dalton this year\nAnd a and he's just he's one of those guys that he may not have\nThe skill set of of a Tom Brady and he's not he's not the kind of quarterback it's going to put a team on the shoulders and cherry under the super bowl but he is\n... ... are cerebral he he does a great job pre snapple of getting them in the right play and the ... they're just executing after the snappy he's making quick shark throws the receivers are catching\nFor the most part everything he throws the one in herself she had a day went off of a tight end than but they're just they're working to everybody's skill set in and kind of putting them in the best possible position and it it they were laughing the league last year and often 'cause it's just a quick turnaround this year\nYeah and it really is amazing and and what's amazing to me is I think a lot of people including myself out of that the off it might be a little bit of a drop off with Joe mix and being gone to the last couple of games but they have not skip the beat at all uh Giovanni Bernard comes into the really good job scores to touchdown should we see\nA split back they'll do you think are more of a split backfield with those two guys mixing and Bernard when Joe is healthy\nI think that was the plan all along I they they were really disappointed in in our little they were able to use geo and and the first game I'm at Indianapolis I\nI I don't think we're we're not going to see a fifty fifty split but ah I Do think it could be more of a a sixty forty sixty five thirty five um unit Giovanni Bernard as he's\nHe's really good don't get me wrong but but he's a smaller guy and he's a cop runner between the tackles but you still have to wonder of what a heavier workload we're due for him\nOver the course of the season I think that's why they're trying to limit him he can handle the load in a full game we saw that last week we saw that this week but we'll we'll we'll when does it start adding up over the course of the season I think that's why they're trying to kind of keep them dial back I'm Joe mix\nThem look terrific in his in his previous work out today um and and he looked pretty good running down the ... time to celebrate with Asia green after you do I\nThink we I think we see them back in action next week again to Miami which would mean the most to gain after knee surgery which is really pretty remarkable\nAbsolutely Jay Morris is our guest covers the Cincinnati Bengals for the athletic you can follow day's work on winter Ajay more than ... are you cover the team it's very easy for her than them just anybody to watch and you just see how tough AJ green is to guard daily you don't want to want to simply because of this heightened it speed\n... it late in game one of the things that I thought what this one J specifically was there were so many people catching balls today I think maybe there were eight or nine guys just want to ask them any ... is that one of the reasons why AJ green can be successfully gained says this is not the first time we've seen AJ green of a game winning\nTouchdown catch it just the fact that there are so many more weapons that the Bengals have to throw to this year\nYeah I mean this this team has been looking for a replacement for mom it's a new one Marvin Joan since they left and she vows and Fifteen and that's why they got Tyler board and the and the second round two years ago or three years ago I'm Sorry and while they got John Ross number nine overall last year and\nThey both have their ups and downs Tyler had a great rookie year and then he really struggled last year he was in an ... to help you scratch for your games yeah it's an injury\nBut he is just taking a huge leap this year and when they said at point blank and I've got that Tyler boy there's a big reason why he's eight days than having the success he's had this year because he's finally got somebody that can take the pressure off and they can't just roll coverage at age ... anymore and\nNow John Ross is starting to emerge he had a touchdown today his second year he also had a really nice\nCatch on the sideline noodle game for him last week caught on a couple of routes costs nearly adult in the couple interceptions talk all week was getting the Bengals trust John Ross are they going to a gym or they stuck by them and he rewarded that today um so if you've got John Ross an entire board running around in that secondary along with\nAge agreed is kind of pick your poison things with a deep sense\nIt really is Jay Morris in our gas covers the Cincinnati Bengals pretty athletic you can follow his work on Twitter ... obviously there gruesome and injury today for Tyler I from what I mean when it comes to him up and how is this going to affect the up and moving forward\nYou know it's interesting because last year he only played two games and Tyler Croft really kind of stuff he's he's not going to be a ... but he stepped up and had a really nice season last last year and the ... is really starting to come on and then\nThrough the first four games this year we saw them doing a lot of three ... and said they've been eating those guys in\nA giving them wraps getting them target it they're they're never going to be that matchup nightmare that Tyler I for it is but I don't think it changes the so often it's not much at all I think Tyler crawfish just going to step into that spot and then you know\nWork out of the slide be an end of the line tide and um he he's not going to be the red zone directed Tyler I for it was but I I don't think it changes things greatly the obviously they're going to miss Tyler I for it but\nAh they've kind of grown accustomed to not having them this you know you all assumptions or he's going to be done for the year\nThat means that at the end of his six year ... this is a six year old and so far right now he's he's played forty three of a possible eighty four games and and then by the end of the year that's going to be forty three of us will Ninety six this team is used to not having Tyler I heard on the line I\nWant to go back to what you said about anti dog because that's really interesting now that I think about the you know the all the fact that you want to make them more uncomfortable and then you can grow from there\nCan you give us any kind of ... is it more more responsibility ... now but maybe the more freedom to audible what exactly do you mean when you say he's more uncomfortable and you know he's growing from that\nI think it's all of that but I I think the main thing was bill\nLaser the office of ordinary changed all the terminology I mean\nThey since Andy Dalton came in and it was just the succession the object grew and to to to Jackson ... you know ... everything just stayed the same every time they switch coordinators in and bill so we're going to\nBlow this thing up and you're going to start from scratch or\nYou're gonna have to learn all new terminology and then I Do think there is some more pre snap responsibilities and and I think a big thing is in a lot of people kind of been waiting for this for me and he is he's really challenged him to be more of a leader um ... ... and never been that really superb vocal guy but you really do\nAnd he was he was really challenged him to be more of a leader um ... ... and never been that really super vocal guy but\nYou really do see him growing in that role and even in press conferences he's he's always been kind of a you know he's been friendly but he's been kind of a dry I kind of boring quote and you know he's been cracking jokes he's just he just seems so much looser so much more comfortable in his skin now which is ironic because the whole goal was to make them uncomfortable\nYeah no definitely I Jay Morse in our guest covers the Cincinnati Bengals the athletic you can follow D jays work on Twitter at ... okay so defensively I mean obviously Atlanta's a tough team they got multiple weapons\nBut this is now the second consecutive week where the defense has given up thirty points I if I wanted to ask you to identify a problem like what is the main problem with the Cincinnati Bengals deepens which has given up sixty eight points to over the last couple of weeks what would that problem be\nOr can't tackle can't cover that means it's hard to pick a main one that it's been issues all across the\nThey they haven't been able to get with a quarterback that they came
