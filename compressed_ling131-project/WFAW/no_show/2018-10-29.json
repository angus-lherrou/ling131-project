Ninety board at all as British radio\nYeah that's what I was gonna say the shirt you're definitely wearing a pink shirt and you're on Twitter at the great and one ad part Jay Ninety four at aspiration radio so you were mentioning a these comments from tastes teen them ah regarding one going right [noise]\nRight and he has a a safe space book coming out that's called playing for more\nAnd he mentioned how below Brian and two dozen fourteen told them that he would never be more than a third string quarterback and of course the law Brian today are denied it and he said he said try to be funny at the end of the press conference he like I guess I'm going to have to go read that book or something like that but yeah that's the case a saying in his new book\nWould it surprise you if O'Brian told him he'd never be more than a third string quarterback not at all no do you think he said it to them like as being look let me give you some advice you're never going to be more than a third string quarterback or do you think it was one of those heated moments yeah he'll O'Brian angry as hell because Tina I'm just throw in practice or something\nThat wasn't hard Nike or was it\nFourteen\n[laughter] [laughter] well well you hope not obviously but um you know let me have today that that they only offered it to one person and and that was Craig Williams\nI think al ... would have been an interesting choice but you mentioned that he he's Seventy one years old kind of step back and you are I'm more of an advisors are well known silver calls them practice and still the coach how they're eight Seventy one that's running around on than anybody so\nAh he he still very involved in the organization but you know I I just wonder you know what let's say they get offered to him if he looked at it but you know what that's an awful lot to take on it at this stage in my career\nUm I I think the thing with Craig Williams was really a bad experience 'cause there's just not a lot now that they've they decided to fire tied Haley there's not really a guy that had coached before that it's been a head coach Freddie Kitchens as this guy they voted off the coordinator well you've never even been a coordinator before so you're not going to go with him\nOn the defensive side of the fall there aren't really guys outside a great that I have had coaching experience so\nYeah I don't think this is necessarily the ideal candidate for a lot of the reasons that you said\nBut I think they kind of painted themselves into a corner and they've got to go with Gregg Williams and that kind of hoping ... themselves because he's trying to prove that maybe it could be the guy for this job long term even if I don't think that's possible and he's trying to at least get a coordinator job next year if they move on\nYou know isn't that the weirdest parliament for since the day time he got hired I don't mean kind of looked at him is he's probably the next guy in line and now in in a game designer is is this a situation where John Dorsey at the end of this year\nJust pouring bleach on the whole thing starts over\nYou know I I I Do believe that book and a half and I do believe this is going to be an opportunity for my case that if you go out and\nFind with coach to pair with paper and that's what it's all about\nIt's about the quarterback you pick number one overall\nOr the guy who's not a cookie cutter type quarterback about six feet tall I they they pick them because of his leadership and in that chip on his shoulder and of course you know he's got the arm and at the actors but uh you know you've got to bring in a guy that can work with Baker ... you know happen to the sort of that ship and and that\nThat attitude that he has that leadership the burning them and build a nonsense around him and I think that's the way they're going to go with interesting is going to be how Jimmy have the owner handle because\nThe structure he has set up but it is the head coach reports to him and then general manager reports to him is he going to consider changing that I'm not John Dorsey run this coaching search which is what I think he should do I think that would be the right thing to do and let the head coach report that John ...\nI think the ... the need to do that I think Jimmy has always been a big root of the function here and get structure uh if if he doesn't do that\nNow we might be having a conversation like this and another couple of years\nAnd we haven't is is there and if that structure doesn't change is there a point where John door she says you know when you hire me to fix your team I'm trying to fix your team and you're in the way to get out of the way or I'm gone\nYou know I I don't know if it would come to that that that's obviously an extreme but look John Dorsey has been a football life or he's the guy that has a great resume saw what he dealt with anti reading Kansas city\nThink we have a little bit of all this structure he was working with in Kansas City and so he's kind of been through that and and seeing how that end\nWhat you do with any reading in the city you know he got a little bit of structure he was working with in Kansas City and so he's got um been through that and seeing how that end for him\nSo you know yeah there there could be a situation where I feel like you're getting undermined or feels like he doesn't have the proper power he needs to really build the team or you know I could see that getting frustrated but parading around\nYou you just say situation where because\nHaslam wouldn't let John Dorsey higher his own guys in the offseason basically now all that's happened is he's delayed the rebuild my year by not allowing his general manager to operate the way he wants offering\nThat I mean ideally you would have had the guy in place by now a ... in I think there's enough talent John ... is that an balance this roster I even think they were far enough away you know I don't necessarily agree ... with the market season\nAnd and I you know I hate to be have to keep going back to the ... because I Do think it's a little bit of a a lightning in a bottle that they stumble across John McVeigh and found him and he's been an absolute genius for them um I I don't know what the problem with that but you can see just how quickly if you do find that right pairing\nOr you can start to turn things quickly and that's going to be the key they need they need to bail this part\nOf the rings bill finding that code it's not ideal that\nThey wasted games on on the previous coaching staff but at this point it is what it is\nThen you you mentioned it was on the line because the browns from Cleveland dot com on the bed you assign our comments on line then you mentioned that\nYou know they wanted to get all the guys who were you know participating in the discord out of the room is the fact that they got rid of both guys an indication that keeping one of them would have resulted in a fractured lock\nYou know I I think there is a very clear that you get rid of all that that I think that could be part of it um that maybe you know you had guys taking side\nYou know I think on the coaching staff in general but I mean there are guys on the stuff that frankly are are kind of from that hot Haley built parts so treat your friends into one of them but if the guy who's going to be taking over as often coordinator\nI I think kind of watching everything out on of course you had some guy came in with your accent as well I I think just forcing those two guys out\nAnd making sure that that there were no remnants of the power struggle between um I I think it was the right thing to do and and like I said there are and I wonder what am I say that the goal is one of many game they can on the bus and it probably is\nBut I think the reality is is they want to get through this season as early as possible and try to bring in the right guy or come January\nDana how shocked or are you the Josh neurons in trouble with the patriots for feeling tired it's\nNo big surprise there are a lot of people raving about ... ... less than a\nWhite police though is potential there you know how good of you but we also know that never been the problem you can even when he was playing with the likes of gambling brand and putting up that so uh the Taliban never been the problem with Josh coordinate making sure that he showed up on time and make sure that he stays out of trouble\nAnd it just seems to be a little too hard for him yeah exactly and ... you know things\nThings might be going well and then he goes and does a photo students called the hamster ... ever know what's going to happen\nI Want to know how to do a photo ... I mean I could do\nThat I don't think\nThat's that's the next level I don't feel a practicing today that's next level [laughter] he's been lab because\nBrown's for Cleveland dot com you saw him on Twitter at Dan underscore lab E.

[noise] uh no question there historically oh a a hundred and eight wins during the year plus a lot more in the post season and the only game in modern era\nTo do that or the Nineteen Ninety eight New York Yankees and the Seattle Mariners in two thousand one those are only two teams at one four games\nAh than these Red Sox obviously the ... did not want a World Series title so they kind of fell flat but yeah I mean as far as dominant you put this team up with\nUm [noise] you know the Ninety Yankees\nThe big red machine [laughter] I mean they just dominated and they were best start to finish the best team um then you get to the post season and\nThey uh they they did something no teams ever done before and that is the two hundred wind teams\nAre along the way I mean the New York Yankees\nOr a hundred when team and the Houston Astros were a hundred when team I'm now granted you didn't have the rest of the stuff that they didn't have the play offs to get through that started in Nineteen Ninety five but still Ninety five you know we're talking twenty plus years of this poor man\nUh nobody's gone through two hundred and ... the the Astros or I mean the red Sox in winning\nThe ales yes and then game one of the world sorry\nThey just deliver lander and quite in car shop back to back you know they they beat that Astros ... recall on on a no question these Red Sox what they did is an accomplishment that that uh you know should be admired and should be placed a in a historical context\nYou know there was a lot made about Jackie Braley junior being me Ailsa TSN be pay you know who would be the the non main player who would be the the role player the the secondary player who would have the big impact in the series and turn it for his team\nWell maybe I'll see as soon as Jackie Braley junior in in the world series it was the peers\nI'm One of the things that seems to be going under the radar is how will David Price not only pitched in the world in the in the playoffs when he historically has struggled\nDark is how well David clients not only pitched in the world in the in the playoffs when he historically has struggled in the play offs but the number of times he went on short notice pitching in college and then starting again a couple of days later\nHow big was the impact on prices is he actually the guy who had the biggest swing impact on the red Sox\n[laughter] yeah I thought at the very least probably should have been cold MVP was Steve Pearce I'm full disclosure\nI have no idea who votes for the world series MVP ah nor do to a couple of other a long time writers of the press box but I we were talking about that going downstairs you really were like you know we haven't heard and do idea how that's decided so or whatever there\nBut I Do on Steve Pearce deserves MVP but I thought David Price should have had a share of it um you also could have voted for Dave Price but this guy\nHearted he started in one game to eat pitch in the relief in game three\nHe warmed up twice in the bullpen in game for although he wasn't used and then he came out and started one game five [laughter] price was like every day David Price it was unbelievable what you did\nAnd and that's it I mean he was in he was either on the bump or in the pan for games in a row yeah\nI mean and you know so all of those that that previous narrative about oh Dave Price jokes in October\nYou know that that gets a little old because in the modern digital age of social media you know and everything else everybody's got to you know it it's like a dog on a ball you know one\nThing happens and and people think their teeth and uh just like the managing in the world series I mean they Roberts were starting to get skewered after game on every time there's a World Series everybody thinks they're they they amateur\nAnd if one move doesn't work it's like oh this guy he's an idiot well David Price quake Kirsch obviously are the two pictures that have had the October narratives of they can't pitch in October ... had his moments there's no question of good moments\nHe's also adds up until now had I had more rough\nBut you know two things about that [noise] you know these things are true superstars type pictures\nThey get thirty thirty three starts a year you know post season when you're judging a guy on three or five or seven starts or appearances that's an awful lot past because it's not that many\nIn one or two things go wrong than the horses are out of the ... and ... and also on in the postseason by definition you're facing the very best line up in the game it's not an easy task\nUm you're not facing the line up of the Miami Marlins or the San Diego Padres you're facing the best\nThat person from that perspective yeah um you know if you have one or two bad outings you know and then you get crucified in and help the ... ... there's just let's just say this there's not much room for nuance in today's world a guy\nDoes well and all of a sudden you know he's greatest thing ever guy struggles in October player or a manager and he's an idiot he's with David Price I don't think we ever have to talk about October and David Price again this guy was bales\nAnd or any of the old narrative I think is completely obliterated\nKnow it's funny because Barry Bonds ones had the moniker of playoff joke right so much that's right you know about Greg Maddox and Tom gladman about how great the we're in the regular season and\nHow in less than a dozen against the Astros ... it didn't translate in the post season and now Clayton Kirk Shaw a guy who you know historically has one of the greatest ever you know regular season pitchers and because he's handsome struggles in the postseason\nAll that kind of um how how\nHow is it possible that people can honestly look at it in her son go that guy's not that good\n[laughter] yeah and and and I think it's because people just don't understand they don't have all the ... so you make that a jerk reactions I mean\nYou know park like incursions problem in the postseason as Dan I'm his bullpen is completely let him down on occasions um I don't have the numbers right in front of me but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "29"}
