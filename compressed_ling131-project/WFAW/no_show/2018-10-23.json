I I don't believe for a second that Rondo intentionally spit on him I really don't and maybe you did and maybe I'm wrong [noise] ah they were shocked the Lakers are shocked everybody I spoke to a shock that just the notion\nThat it had happened and it wasn't like a [laughter]\nUh you know a fake yeah maybe maybe it was an accent no it was legitimate act that I Would ever even when you get into these moments of heightened heightened emotion or one little thing can trigger it off and usually what triggers off the most wild things in life are these unintentional\nA random things that just sparks something crazy I don't know why branding room got so upset shove\nThings aren't in the first place I I understand I I look what I'm looking at it with the naked eye it was like why did Chris Paul try to gouge out Ron does I I thought it was totally Chris Paul but you know if he got spit on I I guess I can understand that and they have it\nWhere you get your reaction\nTo Ron does comments Chris polls really a bad guy and people don't realize is a bad guy he tried to lead a sneak attack into the clippers locker room last year I think Lincoln pellet go read the distraction in the front door a is does does he have a point\nI I I I reached out to a lot of friends that I have her on the lead to kind of get like a a general opinion and and the first\nThe most responses you know because Glenn Davis big baby chimed in and said yeah you know Chris Paul is bad teammate accent [laughter] a lot of people say you got to just check the source here I mean Rondo has beef or so to speak with Chris Paul dating back a long time they've been rivals for whatever reason even though they haven't been\nReally much in the same conference or you know other than a couple of small years long ago but went on to it was at its best with the Boston Celtics where they didn't like each other then they don't like each other now Rondo has had his moments as a player where he has been can maybe the best team made he was not good in Dallas um there were times where he and\nCoach doc rivers formerly with the Celtics got into it I I heard it's bad enough that they basically were coming to blows and they were about to come to blows poor got broken up so you have to look at the source I Do know that\nBlake Griffin they on the hundred and some of those clippers had really tired of the ... that was Chris Paul he's very demanding and only expects\nKind of an equal level of intensity and effort and if you don't bring it uh he he's here it's it's an insult to him and there's I I Would liken it a little bit Coby Coby and could Paul yeah he shares the Baltimore but there's a lot of similar similarities there\nAren't can you named ... who who shared the ball less than Kobe\nI look Chris Paul dribbles the ball yeah it gets a lot of us there but\nI talk to players who said he dribbles the ball out the air out of the ball at least see that with the clippers that that he's he's constantly pounding it you don't run an office with Chris Paul you run what Chris Paul wants to run the coast just you you just go for the ride with it and and try to coach the fence and\nOf course all basically in charge and that's kind of what Coby was to write but different positions different roles and no koby was\nYou know not exactly known for passing although as a shooting guard because if the numbers are very high\nAh but yeah you know we we we all know what Coby was and he was a great at what he was\nA but Chris Paul have higher system or his buddies you count what you'd call usage you know the amount of time he has the ball in his hand is it's a little bit better now in Houston because he's playing with James Harden but in those corporate days he definitely talented that ball way too much\nAir tankers basketball insiders NBA TV leaders ... bleach report dot com with us on the bed you sign up Tom in San line like I said it's it's three games into the season it certainly way too early to hit the the panic button as you mentioned the Lakers have a lot of new parts they've got to\nPut together and that being said uh all the teams in the western conference right now who are in the top half of the conference", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "23"}
