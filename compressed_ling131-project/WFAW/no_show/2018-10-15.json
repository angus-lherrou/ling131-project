Colorado was a one week wander yeah revert to me when and and gone to ... Colorado they've they played who usa all what I tell you at the at home in Colorado and\nGot a consultant who actually I was in the negative side of the time I got the organist and all that good when we come back there are now three a league teams in the NFL it's over the next [noise]\nComing into this week bombing I always do my power rankings on this show okay we always do that\nAnd every time for the for the entire state for like the last three weeks I've been saying okay you know college football there's one elite tear there's one team and they leave here that's Alabama and the NFL there have been to\nThe Los Angeles rants and the Kansas City chiefs sure they have great scheme makes sure they have great coaches sure they are very competent quarterbacks who may play\nBut guess what one of the things that you've got to love about the chiefs and the rams is that their balance it's one of the things the Green Bay Packers in until the eagles figure it out that the giants defense was the team that they can get a themselves going on in terms of balance the eagles ran for like a hundred and ten yards against the giants\nYou got to be balanced Bobby you got to have ... Jared golf goes the Denver okay and everybody says oh this is the day the rams lose because they don't know how to play in snow\nYou got it like they were showing the weather conditions and it was all being ... they they can't play and snow because they are you in Southern California it's part of the brilliant it's about the Los Angeles ramp things have turned around and ... and be a ground a pound team\nThey don't have to be a jerk off was the end it's the office of player of the week what was it last week on Thursday Night Football through for four hundred yards pot touchdown yeah the rats can beat you that way\nBut they are in a in a snow game when Jerry golf is not at his best fourteen twenty two hundred yards and an interception\nGuess what they turn around and the ... quarter to eight yards to touch that really had more your ... on the ground today than the Jacksonville Jaguars had total in their game against Dallas and the Tennessee Titans had total and their game against Baltimore how 'bout that\nThat's how good the rams are why they're balanced Kansas City has been balanced all year Karim ...\nI mean he's always been there the patriots are in that elite tear now that ... one along with the ... the Kansas City chiefs obviously they'd be Kansas City today in LA it's those three teen then we have a drop off and why is New England they're okay\nYeah they are pretty yeah the ballot checked\nBut somebody must show changes this off that he is the X factor and probably you can go to the tape two weeks ago I said he was going to average about Ninety yards the game for the rest of the season this will be ... tonight at a hundred yards to touch that\nHe is such an integral part of the market and then there's the different off that the patriots have been running for the last couple of years because they like to use their back out of the backfield that's what they're used for\nOkay and I are out of school talking I don't know when it was uh maybe it was last week he was saying 'cause he's the chief's fan and he was talking about how your James White is going to have a big day you've changed quite catch the ball back against what they did that too\nIf I catch is fifty three yards James wiped it\nOkay so this patriots off into now is a well run machine a Brady is boy Edelman is now totally back\nAnd and really I mean they're all their chemistry and relationship is fantastic but again who made the big playground because look what are you going to do like I look at these ... these officers be three fences with the elite tears okay I what are you gonna do\nWhat do you how do you game plan for the rent how do you gain planned for the chiefs how do you gain plan for the patriots you can game plan for the Packers\nVery curious what happens on Monday Night football I had the ... the spread is nine and a half I Want to see if they can come back because they're not ... they're not balanced and the eagles are now climbing up that way because they're getting a little bit more balance it takes a game against the giants to get your confidence together\nOkay but I'm telling you what I don't know what you do which is part of the fun and the anticipation of what this Sunday night game it's going to be because we knew the defense is working to stop anybody Bobby knew you were the over right you you were all over when I say yeah last week I said there's too many points boy I looked like an idiot\nEighty three points in this game tonight\nThere are three teams in the elite tier of the NFL Kansas City New England and Los Angeles then we have a drop off I think the eagles are up and coming\nBut why are they the best three teams until tall they are balanced and there's no question that that is the most important thing in football to be balanced by when we come back I Will tell you where I was today and we will move on to the AFC North it over the next\nRoom\nSweet Caroline I'm saying you know between the job of the AIDS and the

I Want to start we fix NFL um Jacksonville Jaguars go into Dallas now this was a game that I really thought if if I were to bet this game I Would have thought that point the point total would go under whatever the over under ...\nThat's still jaguars so into Dallas now this was a game that I really thought it would if I were to bet this game I went to the point at this point total would go under whatever the over under was I was picturing like uh Thirteen to ten ball games it ended up being forty seven in terms of the cowboys before we get to the cowboys point of view\nThis jaguars off and so I Know you have never been a high on Blake ... but\nThe Jacksonville fans if they weren't concerned earlier today really start to be concerned about ... in his office now\nAbsolutely this dates back to them drafting him third overall is that that was something that should have never been done that should've been teddy Brits bought his job and we probably would have seen a Super Bowl in Jacksonville\nHas that been the case but here we are and two thousand they ... the problem with the dolphins and we combine ... ineffectiveness was the fact that they're not healthy along the all kinds of lines\nThey don't have an opponent back there I I get the issue that they have elsewhere on office but it has to start with a Q. V. and he has to be able to supersede those losses\nBut he can and he's part of the problem that's why the bombs that was getting blown out that they find out\nOn the other side of this I don't know what's more surprising the fact that Dallas his office was as six stream Leah fish in Dallas often though we haven't seen so far this year or the facts of the Jacksonville Jaguars defense you know we'd I thought at least last week okay is Kansas City tactical homes you give up thirty points that's fine\nBut I mean should the jaguars deep I mean this was just a a blowout look what we learn more about the Dallas Cowboys op eds and how they're going to be for the rest of the season or the jaguars defense and how they're going to be for the rest of the season or is this just a fluke what happened\nI think we learned a little bit more about Dallas was all for two reasons why number one we saw that first got trust his legs and be able to get out there and be a little bit more assertive\nIn running the football and that open to everything go for him in the past the game and also a healthy colds easily so those who are wanting the same would be easily as healthy he's that favorite target got at the chain mover and went back because able to use his late ... case that the fence on it it makes me let me let me game and I'm pretty sure it will see the Twitter timeline\nQuiet this week with all the back is bad talking all the extra wants to pay it is it that game when they really never was the problem\nFor the cowboys office but it was funny that he went off the day and it's very quiet on foot or from the Dallas Cowboy analyst [laughter]\nEmory hunting is our guest the owner of a football game plan covers the NFL you can follow Murray's work on Twitter at ... ball game plan when I I thought this weekend was full of surprises I'm honestly Amory I did not see the result happening in the bears dolphins game ... backup quarterback\nThose are three hundred eighty yards three touchdowns relocated down here in Houston we know all about ... but he was fantastic against the bears defense the bears the pets which I was so high on just your thoughts on this game how has brought us while we're able to carve up the bears today\nYou know what this was a situation where they all help out the deepest because if we look at those numbers for brought up while he's still through two and a exceptions and at one point in time and again the bears up Twenty one tent\nAnd so when you look at this this game from let's say ten thousand foot level you see what the issue was this a week\nAll we heard was short and our was not satisfied with Israel and the officers didn't wasn't happy with the lack of carries despite the coming off their big office of explosions by going through to record\nThis week they go through Jordan power and look what happened often spotter often came with a ball it's recalling is still doing his thing\nI'm then I'm British show those last couple of carrot they would have given the Cohen is set up power it probably would have been ... now that they wouldn't have probably settle for that bill go so when you look at the ... golf and having the inability to really close up this game despite\nThose extra possesses due to the bears the spent despite having the ... point lead\nThey couldn't really close it out and you know whether it will power or service is inconsistent play at times throughout the game\nThat the real reason why the law I don't think it was because the defense gave up however many are there are touchdown passes from brought out while you're there was to blow coverage is uh the elbow Wilson but I think that game was really lost because their office could really close out and take advantage of the extra possessions the deepest gave\nEmery ... is our gas uh Emery I Want to stay in the NFC North\nIs it now it's time to put Adam stealing in that conversation in terms of the top tier wide receivers the Antonio Brown still Julio Jones is it fair to do that now after now he extends his record he's now got six consecutive one hundred yard games are loving receptions today along with a touchdown seasonally receiver right\nAbsolutely I I don't see why now you just got a cop call a spade a spade has got a lot they're balding and you've got to give them this process as much as you want to take away from what he had you know what he perceives to to lack or what he doesn't do or you may not have the flash of other receivers\nOr some sort of signature move because this guy's producing and when you're productive in years that\nProductive at at a position where you know it's hard to find your space 'cause the game as a passing game that when everyone seems to go off as far as he was all concerned but he has been near the top um for the most part of the latter part of what the last season and a half so you got to give a guy is probably the one of the lead for the reason the games\nEmory hunch or guess owner a football game plan a discovers the NFL you can follow his work on Twitter at ... ballgame blimps\nShe on taking care of the raiders today twenty seven to three so John ... and is now one in five\nNow we all know on the field about ... what to do but one of the things that was heavily criticized specifically about this this is what happened we went down with ... back in Oakland is people kept saying he's such a great fit for that locker room he literally brings that locker rooms together is a good chemistry guy\nAnd then I was watching uh ESPN or something last weekend and he was saying he literally created a drill in practice where before practice even starts you put the ball like a fifty yard line and then use sprint to the ball and and the first one who gets it you know get when that competition ... basically made something in practice a competition so\n... part of what's going on with old one is the fact that not only do they miss him on the field but they miss him off the field as well like this thing is just not working right now in Oakland\nYeah I think well you look at ... back in his time in Oakland when he got there there were slowly building in the right direction they got better every year and they have they break out these and one and two thousand things that when they made the playoffs\nAnd then they had the freak injury I'm going to the playoffs and then I kind of spearheaded the down downward trend and then two thousand and sentencing but\n... was a big part of the reason why they're able to build that in the right direction at the cornerstone feast on the fence\nAnd at one point in time they thought they had a cornerstone pizza on off medicine and car that was playing well and you find a lot like you say there first most states\nUm and I just think that when they lost Matt ... they lost a big piece of their team's not necessarily just from the sec production I beat this production but a guy that was one of those blue guys that you need that everything has to have everything has at least two one off it was on the thin\nAnd will you lose that guy is struggling trying to find a struggling on the fence is struggling to get to the quarterback\nEverything has at least to want to offer on the fence and when you lose that guy is threatened trying to find a struggling on the fence is struggling to get to the quarter back you know it's tough to really galvanized the truth when you when you look at the staff of the year the reason why we're you know the fishing in one area because you got rid of our best player\nYeah no I I just do you watch the same and they're just so discombobulated I Want to stay in the AFC West though a Broncos losing to the rams twenty three to twenty today I don't think this game was that close or the rams pretty much dominance tastes Tina how worried should Broncos fans be\nTo John John Elway be moving forward you know I Would stay at least twenty six teams twenty seven teams are like okay we have our quarterback for the future like the jets today Sam donor Baker made the even the the the teams who might not make the playoffs this year\nArizona at least can say okay I've got my quarter back to the future you say the Broncos could say they have their quarterback for the future\nYou know I I I I kind of want to stay away from the quarterback of the future um peg because we've seen that play out\nIt was twenty four nothing Dallas Cowboys and the jaguars I Wonder what the lives that would have been at that point because I probably would have taken the jaguars plus what ever points I was getting I did not see\nThat at all we're going to get into this more next hour the cowboys win over the jaguars 'cause I was wrong on a lot of cats yeah first of all I thought it would go under\nAnd Dallas has off at us\nWas that more about Dallas has often said to the jaguar defensive about say they're often as I say the cowboys office has hey it proves

Jones might or Calvin Johnson would have a couple of years ago he's not going to do that he's just solid\nHe runs routes so well\nHe catches everything he's fast with the ball he's shifty like honestly like as I was watching I edited by the way God I mentioned the Andre Hopkins in that elite receiver conversation no to no question about it I mean that touchdown catch said he had today\nI mean where they're just showing watched the first of all it was great throw the star wars that bought them put it perfectly and that but are there are only a handful of receivers that could make that catch the under happened is one of them\nI don't know if Adam Steven has that capability to go up and have the reached that the Andrea Hopkins has but if I'm telling you like here's a star he is like people came into this year if they can step on digs was going to be the number one receiver it is not is Adam ... and ... they could put them anywhere like one of the things about does Bryan\nThat I Believe is a reason why he is not on the on a team this year is because he is literally like they're different areas of wide receiver ... wide receiver one wide receiver to slot wide receiver there's like three different positions with in the wide receiver\nAnd one of the criticisms I think I've heard about that Brian I think that's true is he can only be a wide receiver one he can only see himself he visually does not see himself as a wide receiver too because if he doesn't get you know if he's running and he's not going to the ball he's going to start to complain\nSo like that's why he can't be wide receiver too busy can't envision himself as a guy who only gets for targets than a football game\nCan't play slot 'cause he's not physical on up okay as soon as some of the press or you're doing press coverage on debts Brian and he's in the slot just what he might not get off that coverage he he can literally only point wide receiver once I really think this is a big reason why does Brian is not being done\nIs because he can only play wide receiver one and he's not good enough to be a wide receiver one of his ...\nHis ego with only sees himself as that\nAdam ceiling can do everything Adam feeling you wind up on the outside and I'm feeling fine if it step on digs day Adam the one's fine if you put them in the swat he can come off press coverage and and and the one of course can play that wide receiver one\nI mean I'm telling you what this Minnesota Vikings team I put them AS number one team last week in terms of the we'd we'd power at the end of the north\nAnd I said the Vikings where my number one team but there were it's cause it's just like the I asked you know I think about the two north divisions right now\nOkay you they're they're the exact same ... you can correct me if I'm wrong okay we'll see Green Bay tonight that's why I'm so curious what happens on Monday Night football will they laying eggs at home against DJ Beth third but sorry whatever it is not Jimmy and you know I I mean I Do love Jimmy ... so he should there ... there should be no ... let me some Jimmy I Love is Jimmy body\nJimmy's not playing this game so Green Bay you know what I'm surprised I have got to cover that now that\nWe're going to see what they're going to have the night\nBut I'll tell you what the structures that have you know with an NFC North are very very similar because we don't know who the best team is yeah there are three teams who could legitimately be in first place at the end of the year at the Green Bay Packers you've got the Chicago Bears I mean I the the bears we'll see if their defense\nCan take the next step next week and a half Chicago well guess what gets it comes to town Brady and the boys oh Tom Brady and\nOn the road against the bears yeah that often says roller if the Miami Dolphins with ... Wyler scores thirty one points against that bears deep and what do you think Tom Brady is going to do\nA ... it's going to a somber leaving the spread of that game is going to be well I'm looking at a route that don't tell me because okay you know what we'll do one guest that line and I guess you're what you're looking at the early wind right now between the patriots and the bears on the road mhm [noise] okay by what do you have a\nI I'm curious\nI think this is a touchdown is it more than a touchdown spread I must say patriots minus seven oh\nActually according to um yeah it's a Chicago money's worth what yeah maybe Vegas\nHog those favored in their favor against ...\nI'm pretty sure it would change or the actually once everything is say you're\nKidding yeah are you sure you're looking like not like a game between the bears and the patriots two\nYears ago you know how am I off here I don't\nI don't know why I'm asking you you're not and I guess you know legacies a Chicago at home with the home field I mean I Know ...\nAway but the the bears have a by next week no they don't they don't look at this game is legitimately next week yeah how can Vegas who traditionally loves Brady\nLook at again the Brady just one like tonight ... pages of scores thirty eight point thirty points and then tonight forty three ... I mean so that adds up to like five hundred five hundred points over the last three weeks for the breeze boys\nHow can I I don't get that one are you positive you're looking at the correct information but I'm looking at the right information on I ... I don't know if we should believe what we saw out of Dallas as often as Dr ...\nThat the correct information yeah I'm looking at the right information on I trusted Bobby beats\nI don't know if we should believe what we saw out of Dallas as often is that going to continue I'll tell you what that is next so but then I\nDid this just over the night with ...

radio Matt Harris back with us jump back into the NFL specifically the New York jets how about the New York jets ... forty two points today is the security Indianapolis\nColts forty two thirty four on the line with us to talk about the jets Michael ... saw he writes for SB Nation New York jets page that has gained green nation Michael us\nYou know stamp Donald I thought was pretty good today pinpoint you know pretty good accuracy only a pretty good pinpoint accuracy is six incomplete passage twenty four thirty is this the best you've seen them all year\nYeah I think this is the best team ... has played and he was a fish and and the jets first when the air opening up active Troy and again Denver last week but\nIn those games he didn't throw only ugly Tony to pass as in each of those games\nAnd they they were able to operate on the strength of a really good run game they were\nGetting some really good field position in those games so yeah the ... and those two games but it was he didn't really have to carry the team too much but against the cold today Andrew Luck was really on his game bait the coke did not go away the ... defense had some problems then this is the one for a game and the fourth quarter so Sam Donald had to keep\nBouncing back answering back and putting points on the board to keep the jets and delete and prevent from getting back into into this game and we continue to do that the jet problem feel goals they did struggle in the red zone there\nThey were driving the ball every single time so than their own thing but he had to do he was ... he didn't really get the big plays any in Denver I think but wherever he's throwing the ball he is accurate and took care of football had only the one section so this is probably ... and so far I'd agree\nThat there were six games of the season the jets are three and three now or what is the most impressive thing that you've noticed about Sam Darnell\nI I think the most impressive thing is definitely his ability to bounce back off his mistakes and just keep going through them and it's something that\nYou were talking about in the ... process and you hear about every single week on the broadcast out he's an even keel guy who's going to bounce back and keep prying no matter what happens then you look at it I mean you know they're winning or losing and you see that there was I saw it in the very first game if Detroit laid back\nAbout back from a big thick then you saw it again today there are pretty bad reception ... field getting picked off by mostly poker and yes I went down early in this game in that aircraft and played a part of that but\nAgain he just bounce back and play the football the rights of the way and and you saw him again\nOr for two games this season again Cleveland against Jacksonville in Miami even have struggled during the ... time some pretty bad football what you expect for rookie but you come back from the games come home and then burn Indianapolis and\nReally good a couple of really good game so I think his ability to bounce back from those mistakes and knowledge and snowball and who wants to take after another after another yeah is building has been really impressive\nNo doubt about it Michael ... is our guest covers the New York jets New York taking care of the Indianapolis Colts today forty two to thirty four you can follow Michael's work on Twitter and Michael underscored ... or ... writes for SB Nation paid for the New York jets are so I I heard you say uh you know walking on to Rob interested that's exactly what happened\nDo look I think that we see there's a lot with rookie quarterback you know I think that that it said to you know when we see the progression of rookies throughout their career that's what we see at the very beginning them you know not being able to look up receivers advantage ... biggest weakness do you think sometimes he holds on\nTo in terms of eyesight to his target and he's only going to go one way with that but that biggest biggest weakness to you\nI think that if you look at the ... the has thrown things definitely had to be like that and I talked to the times already got the Detroit River came by one was like that yeah and one against Miami the crime of that nature and against\nJacksonville ironically the game if the jaguars and it's only game without America in the season but he had one called back and I came in to drop he had\nA few places like that and ... and obviously the Andrew come on this time so in terms of his risky thorough team will pay shop like that I look at one on one match up and saying that the ball and there but that is kind of player he is he's a guy who's going to take risk than they keep going to throw the he's talking he's not ready to take chances he's going to\nLook at this one on one match up some thing he can win those and I do think that it is our weekends but we've also seen some times where he's done a really good job scanning the field and looking off a season opening things up BP did a couple of times against them for last week so\nYes and no I think it's a week because\nWith his gunfire kind of mentality you're really and especially as a ... year the the really ugly place where he locks on the road but I also think there are times where he look\n... miracle disability scanned the deep end\nYou know I I Am fascinated by saying Donald it's one of the reasons I really wanted to have you on that like I ... as you look through the progress of one thing that I think that I saw early in the season and I did and ... and I'll be honest I was at the Texans game today so I was kind of watching the game kind of not\nUm it so I said well what I saw early and Sam Donald like the first couple of games he just seemed a little maybe uncomfortable like is the best way to put he was a little bit Jenner foot uh you know just a lot of steps\nIn just just didn't seem very comfortable do you get the sense that over the six games he's become more comfortable in the pocket is that a fair thing to say\nI think it definitely is and especially over the past couple of game the kinds of ... a lot better over the three day moving strength often flying out a lot of struggles clarifying your defensive from their playing Miami Cleveland jak things are really strong on the defensive linemen\nAre rushing off the edge so dark on the line to the struggles lacking in the gym is open the season kind of conservative with a play calling ... springs and I do still run a lot of green then\nAre rushing off the edge so dolphins in line to the struggles lacking and the jets did open the season kind of conservative with their probably calling ... springs and I do still run a lot of screens and they open this game against ah the colds pretty conservatively but yeah\nI definitely think it's probably in the pocket is getting a lot better that was one of the issue you kind of had over the for a couple of games that he wasn't really producing a lot down the field but over the past couple of games he's definitely got a lot better there and or the first couple of games you were kind of\nThing I'm a little over ... over lying on his ability to\nGet outside the pocket and make plays on the wrong kind of sometimes ditching the play a little bit too early but he definitely gotten a lot more comfortable and they're sending his feet and complain goes down the field really accurately and in this game he only have six and completion than he was there really weren't not that my experience has gained a lot of those but we on the first time author and I believe there's\nOnly one drop in the game but that was a shouldn't be touched down to ... and that was\nA really good though so yeah I definitely think his plate in and talk has gotten a lot better he's been more patient and with that has come better accuracy down the field\nMichael ... is our guest covers the New York jets for SB Nation page I gained green nation you can follow Michael's work on Twitter at Michael underscored ... so one of the things that I think could potentially you know down the road maybe not this year we saw today these explosive missed in terms of the office but\nThere really isn't a number one wide receiver I guess I should say like when you look at the jets receiving numbers for the year\nYou got three guys who over two hundred you got five guys with at least ten catches\nIt seems to be that the ball could go anywhere on any given play like there's nobody that stamp Donald is specifically say okay that's my number one guy to using all first of all do you think that's true and do you think that ultimately is helping Sam Donald that he's not pressured to throw the ball you know like for example in Dallas you know there there were reports coming up at\n... pressure to throw it does Brian I don't think stamp Donald has said do you think that's helping him\nYeah I think the progression of this position has been really interesting over the first three games cuisine knew I was\nI really among the top three in target chair and the entire league but one of the past couple of gaining he's really trying to I think it's probably better especially in the past couple of games really friends with a lot more and\nPart of that it's been clean the new laws and dealing with a bit of an injury or he struggled against Jacksonville he didn't have a catch and I am so part of it has been a new of time to climb in the past few games but\nMany Andersen really wasn't involved with the proceedings after having such a great season last year in\n... that we made a priority to get him the Baltimore especially looking\nOn the field actually to this point Anderson is that even more productive through this point of the season this year than it was last year so they're yeah they're always done a better job getting involved in ... and during her he had an injury is the start of the things and he had a great game today he's got more involved than Trump prior to his ...\nProduce quite a bit he he's had some ups and downs he had some to drop there are times where he was running the same kind of questionable but he's\n... this year with really productive perception failed out ... with a couple of really good pets even has touched down in the red zone so I think going into the season you knew this was a team that\nRolling right now it is amazing what getting a you're a star wide receiver who would have thought getting a star wide receiver back And Julian Edelman a getting a\nOne star and Josh Gordon that's his deal like when you like I don't know what we're just courted numbers tonight I don't even know if the top of my head I mean look this up real quick look this up okay\nJosh Gordon tonight five catches forty two yards\nHowever there was a big play where he was going down the field I told you that they were going to do is probably see what's going on a field pass interference call was about one yard line patriot jumping in front of you to punch it don't buy catches forty three yards but he really accounted for like five catches CD arts you know sell the patriots lost once again they hit on

jump into the NFL Emory hunt is our guest of foot ball a game plan you can follow every work on Twitter at a ball game plan\nAll right ... I I Want to start we'd six NFL um Jacksonville Jaguars go into Dallas now this was a game that I really thought if if I were to\nGet this game I Would have thought the points that point total would go under whatever the over under was I ... I was picturing like Thirteen to ten ballgame it ended up being forty seven in terms of the cowboys now before we get to the cowboys point of view this jaguars off as I Know you have never been a high on Blake portals but\nTo Jacksonville fans if they weren't concerned earlier today really start to be concerned about black holes in his office now\nAbsolutely this dates back to them drafting him third overall that that was something that should have never been done that should have been paid for the job and we probably would have seen a Super Bowl and Jacksonville\nAt that than the case but here we are and where they stand for the problem with develop and then we combine Bordeaux in effect the ... the fact that they're not help you along the off the line\nThey don't have an opponent back there I I get the issue that they have ... were on Oprah but it has to start with a Q. V. and he has to be able to stick with the those losses\nBut he can and he's part of the problem that's why the bombs though getting blown out that they found out\nOn the other side of this I don't know what's more surprising but the fact that Dallas has often was as sick stream Leah fish in Dallas often so we haven't seen so far this year or the fact of the Jacksonville Jaguars defense you know we'd I thought at least last week okay it's Kansas City Patrick go home to give up thirty points that's fine\nBut I mean should the jaguars deep I mean this was just a a blowout ... what did we learn more about the Dallas Cowboys office and how they're going to be for the rest of the season or the jaguars defense and how they're going to be for the rest of the season or is this just a fluke what happened\nI think we learned a little bit more about Dallas was all for two reasons why number one we saw back for a truck to lay can be able to get out there and be a little bit more of a third of\nAn running a football and that open everything go for him in the past the game and also a healthy Colby Italy so those two are one in the same would be healthy he's that favorite target guy that came over and would that they will use the way\nIt seems to be on it it makes me let me let me game and I'm pretty sure we'll see the timeline quiet this week with all of the back is bad luck and all the\nExtra they want it to the game would really never was the problem\nFor the cowboys office but it's funny that he went off today and it's very quiet on water from the Dallas Cowboy analyst [laughter]\nEmery ... is our guest the owner of football game plan covers the NFL you can follow Murray's work on Twitter at ... ball game plan or so and I I thought this weekend was full of surprises I'm honestly Amory I did not see the result happening in the bears dolphins game ... backup quarterback\nThose are three hundred eighty yards three touchdowns relocated down here in Houston we know all about ... but he was fantastic against the bears the fed the bears the fence which I was so high odds are just your thoughts on this game how is ... ... able to carve up the bears today\nYou know what this tuition where the all the help out the deep end because if we look at those numbers are brought up while you're doing this afternoon and at one point in time and again the only one thing\nAnd so when you look at the game from ... in thousand foot level you see what the issue was this week\nAll we're doing our was not satisfied with Israel and the officer didn't it wasn't happy with the latter carried this by coming off their big office of the boat and by going through to record\nThis week they go through joined our and ...\nThe laughter carries despite coming off their big office of explosions by going through to record\nThis week they go through Jordan power and look what happened often spotters officers came with a ball it's recalling is still doing his thing\nI'm then I'm pretty sure those last couple of ... they would have given the call when the power probably would have been tests now that they wouldn't have probably settle for that bill go so when you look at the bears off and having the inability to really close out this game despite\nThose extra possesses due to the bears the bears despite having the ... point lead they could really close it out and you know whether it was power or service give inconsistent play at times throughout the game that the real reason why the law I don't think it was because of their deepest gave up\nHowever many yards are touchdown pass this from ... to blow coverage is uh the algal Wilson but I think that game was really lost because their office could really close out and take advantage of the extra possessions that he gave us\nAmory hunt is our gas uh Emery I Want to stay in the NFC North\nIs it now time to put Adam\nCeiling in that conversation in terms of the top tier wide receivers the Antonio Brown who you're Jones is it fair to do that now after now he extends his record he's now that's sixteen secular one hundred yard games or eleven receptions today along with a touchdown seasonally receiver right\nAbsolutely I I don't see why now you just got a cop call a spade a spade has guys out there and fall and and you got to give them this process as much as you want to take away from what he has you know what he perceived to lack or what he doesn't do or you may not have the flash of other receivers\nOr some sort of which are move for this guy's producing and when you're productive and you're that\nProductive as at a position where you know it's hard to find your space 'cause the game is a a passing game that when everyone seems to go off as far as the it was all concerned but he has been near the top um for the most part of the latter part of what the last season in the house so you got to give a guy is probably the want to leave for the reason the gang\nEmory hunch or guess owner a football game plan or the summer's the NFL you can follow this work on Twitter at ... ball game blimps\nSeahawks taking care of the raiders today twenty seven to three so John ... and is now one in five snow\nWe all know on the field about ... what to do but one of the things that was heavily criticized specifically about this this is what happened we went down with ... back in Oakland is people kept saying he's such a great fit for that locker room he literally brings that locker rooms together as a good chemistry guy\nAnd then I was watching uh ESPN or something or ... last weekend and he was saying he literally created a drill in practice where before practice even starts you put the ball like a fifty yard line and then use sprint to the ball and and the first one who gets it you know get wins that competition Lee basically made something in practice a competition so\n... you say part of what's going on with old when is the fact that not only do they miss him on the field but they miss him off the field as well like this this thing is just not working right now in Oakland\nYeah I think we look at ... back in his time in Oakland when he got there there were slowly building in the right direction they got better every year and they had the breakout seasons one and two thousand say things that when they made the playoffs\nAnd then they had the freak injury I'm going into the playoffs and then that kind of spearheaded a the downs downward trend and then two thousand than Francine but\n... was a big part of the reason why they were able to build that in the right direction at the cornerstone feast on the fence\nAnd at one point down they stopped at a cornerstone pizza on all fenced in and car that was playing well and you find a lot like you say that first no state um and I just think that when they lost Matt income they lost a big piece of their team's\nNot necessarily just from the sec production a decent production but a guy that was one of those blue guys that you need that every team has to have everything has at least two one off it was on the fence\nAnd when you lose that guy is threatened trying to find a struggling on the fence is struggling to get to the quarter back\nYou know it's tough to really galvanized the troops when you when you look at the staff said you're the reason why we are you know the fishing in one area because you got rid of our best player\nYeah no I I just you you watch this team and they were just so discombobulated I Want to stay in the AFC West do a Broncos losing to the rams twenty three to twenty today I don't think this game was that close a the rams pretty much dominance taste of how worried should Broncos fan base to John John Elway be\nMoving forward you know I Would say at least twenty six teams\nTwenty seven teams are like okay we have our quarterback for the future like the jets today Sam don't Baker made the even the the the teams who might not make the playoffs this year\nArizona at least can say okay I've got my quarter back to the future do you think the Broncos can say they have their quarterback for the future\nYou know I I I kind of want to stay away from the quarterback of the future I'm tagged because we've seen that play out horribly and Tennessee\nIt took a conversation with an air conditioner which day he punched\nIn there and then she ever had an interesting conversation with a trash can we know these things but oh come on man over there and\nThey didn't get my pushback would be there and I really am games ...

Colorado was a one week wander yeah revert to me when and and gone to Colorado they've they play to us a call ... what I tell ya USC at home in Colorado and I got to consult me well actually I was in the negative but all the time I got the Oregon said All right when\nEnsues ... elite tear\nComing in and this week bombing I always do my power rankings on this show okay we always do that and every time for the for the entire state for like the last three weeks I've been saying okay you know college football there's one lead tear there's one team in the elite here that's Alabama\nIn the NFL there have been to the Los Angeles rams and the Kansas City chiefs sure they have great scheming sure they have great coaches sure they are very competent quarterbacks who may place\nBut guess what one of the things that you've got a lot about the chiefs and the rams is that their balance it's one of the things that Green Bay Packers and until the eagles figured out that the giants defense was the team that they can get a themselves going on in terms of balance the eagles ran for like a hundred and ten yards against the giant you've got to be balanced Bobby you got to\nHave ... Goff goes to Denver okay and everybody says oh this is the day the rams lose because they don't know how to play and snow\nThat it's like they were showing the weather conditions and it was all being but oh they they can't play in snow because they are you in Southern California\nIt's a part of the brilliance about the Los Angeles rats they just turn around and ... and ... and be a ground and pound team they don't have to be a jerk off was the NFC offensive player of the week what was it last week on Thursday Night Football through for four hundred yards five to ... yeah the rats can beat you that way\nBut they ended up in a snow game when Jerry golf is not as bad for ten or twenty two hundred and ... I\nGuess what they turn around and the ... yards to touch that girlie had more your it's on the ground today than the Jacksonville Jaguars had total in their game against Dallas and the Tennessee Titans had total in their game against Baltimore how 'bout that\nThat's how good the rams are why they're balanced Kansas City has been balanced all year Karim ... I mean he's always been there the patriots are in that elite here now segments\nKarim ... I mean he's always been there the patriots are in that elite here now that ... one along with the ... the Kansas City chiefs obviously they'd be Kansas City today and LA is those three team then we have a drop off and why is New England they're\nOkay yeah they are pretty yeah the bell a check\nBut somebody must show changes this off and he is the X factor and Bobby you can go to the tape two weeks ago I said he was going to average about Ninety or the game for the rest of the season visually tonight at a hundred yards to touch that\nHe is such an integral part of the market and then there's this is a different off the patriots have been running for the last couple of years because they like to use their back out of the backfield that's what they're used for\nOkay and I are ... talking I don't know when it was uh maybe it was last\nWeek he was saying 'cause he's the chief's fan and he was talking about how your James White is going to have a big day because James catch the ball back well guess what they did that too if I catch is fifty three yards James why did okay so this patriots\nOff into now is a well run machine Brady boy Edelman is now totally back and and really I mean they're all their chemistry and relationship is fantastic but get who made the big play cards like what are you going to do but I look at these ... these are parts of the three officers\nWith the elite tears okay I what are you going to do what do you how do you gain plans for the ... how do you gain planned for the chiefs how do you gain plan for the patriots your game plan for the Packers very curious what happens\nOn Monday Night football I had the ... the spread is nine and a half I Want to see if they can come back because they're not ... they're not balanced and the eagles are now climbing up that water because they're getting a little bit more about it takes a game against the giants to get your confidence gotta\nOkay but I'm telling you what I don't know what you do which is part of the fun and the anticipation of what this Sunday night game was going to because we knew the defenses weren't going to stop anybody Bobby knew you were the over right yep you were all over what did I say yet last week I said sixty through any toys boy I looked like an idiot\nEighty three points in this game tonight\nThere are three teams in the elite tier of the NFL Kansas City New England and Los Angeles then we have a drop off I think the eagles are up and coming\nBut why are they the best three teams until tall they are ballots and there's no question that that is the most important thing in football to be balanced I when we come back I Will tell you where I was today and we will move on to the AFC North itself it in a\nBrand\nSweet Caroline I'm just saying you know in between the top of the AIDS and the bottom of the a mental Marco though I Can't I don't know why they did it to Fenway Park so it really annoys me I don't like it whatsoever what they do it and everybody thinking me down like ... nine to one they'll put this crap on those things\nI still I I always provide the same there's always shocked the towers sweet Caroline this song is the red Sox picked a saying in between the inning the red Sox players but the red Sox organization is a song that goes on\nHere me like wired up\nAs much as ...

Nation radio Matt Harris with\nUs let's jump into the NFL Emory hon is our guest of football game plan you can follow every work on with her at a ball game last part Emory I Want to start\nWait six NFL um Jacksonville Jaguars go into Dallas now this was a game that I really thought if if I were to bet this game I Would have thought the points that point total would go under whatever the over under was I I was picturing like Thirteen\nTo ten ballgame mix it ended up being forty seven in terms of the cowboys that we forget the cowboys point of view this jaguars off as I Know you have never been high on boy for those but to Jacksonville fans if they weren't concerned earlier today really start to be concerned about ... and his office now\n... think back to them drafting him third overall that that was from that should have never been done that should have been one of the job and we probably would have seen a Super Bowl in Jacksonville\nAt that than the case but here we are and even though they stand for the problem with this off and then when you combine Bordeaux in effect the ... they're not help you along the line you know have a corner back there I I get the issue that they have ... were on earth but\nIt has the stove or to be in he has to be able to stick with the those offices\nBut he can and he's part of the problem that's why the bombs don't get involved they find out\nOn the other side of this I don't know what's more surprising but the fact that Dallas us off and was as extremely efficient Dallas often so we haven't seen so far this year or the fact of the Jacksonville Jaguars defense you know we've I thought at least last week okay it's Kansas City tactical homes you give up thirty points that's fine\nBut ... I mean should the jaguars the founding this was just a a blowout ... what did we learn more about the Dallas Cowboys office and how they're going to be for the rest of the season or the jaguars defense that how they're going to be for the rest of the season or is this just a fluke what happened\nI think we learned a little bit more about Dallas was all for two reasons number one we saw back for a\n... like can be able to get out there and be a little bit more assertive in running a football and that open everything go for him in the past the game and also a healthy Colby Italy so those two are one in the same would be the live healthy he's that favorite target gotta change ...\nAlso a healthy Colby easily so those two are one in the same would be something that's healthy he's that favorite target got at the chain mover and went back because able to use the leg they can use to be honest it makes me let me let me game and I'm pretty sure we'll see that's what the timeline\nQuiet this week with all the back is bad talking all the extra do on the pay is is it said that game when really never was the problem\nFor the cowboys office but it was fine it seemed that he went off the day and it's very\nQuiet on water from the Dallas Cowboy analyst [laughter]\nEmery ... is our guest the owner of a football game plan covers the NFL you can follow memories work on Twitter at ... ball game plan so when I I thought this weekend was full of surprises I'm honestly Emory I did not see the result happening in the bears dolphins game ... backup quarterback\nFor three hundred eighty yards three touchdowns relocated down here in Houston we know all about ... but he was fantastic against the bears defense the bears the fence which I was so high on your thoughts on this game how is ... able to carve up the bears today\nYou know what this was a situation where\nThey all help out the defense because if we look at those numbers for ... he's still flew to acceptance and at one point in time and again the bears up Twenty one cent and so when you look at this this game from let's say ten thousand foot level you see what the issue was this week\nAll we're Jordan our was\nNot satisfied with his role and the officers didn't wasn't happy with the laughter carries\nThe spike Lee coming off their big office of explosion by going through to record\nThis week they go through Jordan power and look what happened often spotters offers came with a ball it's recalling is still doing his thing I'm and I'm pretty sure those last couple of carried they would have given to Cohen instead of power\nProbably would have been tests now that they wouldn't have probably settle for that still go so when you look at the bears off and having the inability to really close off his game despite\nThose extra possesses due to the bears the eastern despite having the ... point lead they couldn't really close it out and you know whether it was our or service gave inconsistent play at times throughout the games that the real reason why the law I don't think it was because the defense gave up\nHowever many yards or touchdown pass this from ... to blow coverage is uh the album Wilson but I think that game was really lost because their office could really close out and take advantage of the extra possessions that they gave\nUs Amory hunt is our gas uh Emery I Want to stay in the NFC North\nIs now time to put Adam ceiling in that conversation in terms of the top tier wide receivers Antonio Brown still Julio Jones is it fair to do that now after now he extends his record he's now got six consecutive one hundred yard games a loving receptions today along with a touchdown seasonally receiver right\nAbsolutely I I don't see why now you just got a cop call a spade a spade his guys out there and fallen and you've got to give them this process as much as you want to take away from what he has you know what he perceived says to lack or what he doesn't do or you may not have the flash of other receivers\nOr some sort of which are move because this guy's producing and when you're productive and you're that\nProductive as head of position where you know it's hard to find your space 'cause the game as a path and game that when everyone seems to go off as far as we think it was all concerned but he has been near the top um for the most part of the latter part of what's the last season and a half so you got to get the guy is probably the one of the lead for the reason the games\nOn our guest zone or a football game plan a covers the NFL you can follow us work on Twitter at ... see are taking care of the raiders today twenty seven to three so John Gurdon is now one in five snow\nWe all know on the field about ... what he could do but one of the things that was heavily criticized specifically about this this is what happened we went down with ... is people kept saying he's such a great sit for that locker room he literally brings that locker rooms together is a good chemistry guy\nAnd then I was watching the ESPN or something last weekend and he was saying he literally created a drill in practice where before practice even start you put the ball like a fifty yard line and then you sprint to the ball and and the first one who gets it you know get\nWins that competition ... basically made something in practice a competition so ... part of what's going on with open is the fact that not only do they miss him on the field but they miss him off the field as well like this thing is just not working right now in Oakland\nYeah I think well you look at\n... back in his time in Oakland when he got there there were slowly building in the right direction they got better every year and they have this break out the somewhat into thousands of the things that when they made the playoffs\nAnd then they had the freak injury I'm going to the playoffs and then I kind of spearheaded a the down downward trend and then two thousand and Seventeen but\n... was a big part of the reason why they're able to build that in the right direction at the cornerstone piece on the fence\nAnd at one point in time they thought they had a cornerstone piece on all fenced in and car that was playing well and you find a lot like you say there first most states\nUm and I just think that when they lost Matt ... they lost a big piece of their team's not necessarily just from like you said a sec production of defense production but a guy that was one of those blue guys that you need that everyone seems to have everything has at least two one off it was on the fence\nAnd when you lose that guy is struggling trying to find a struggling on the fence is struggling to get to the quarter back\nYou know it's tough to really galvanized the troops when you when you look at the staff to say you're the reason why we are\nKnow the fish and in one area because you got rid of our best player\nYeah no I I just you you watch to see when they were just so discombobulated I Want to stay in the agency was still a Broncos losing to the rams twenty three to twenty today I don't think this game was that close a the rams pretty much done enough peace Tina how worried should Broncos fan speech to John John Elway be moving forward you know\nI Would say at least twenty six teams twenty seven teams are like okay we have our quarterback for the future like the jets today Sam Baker may feel like even the the the teams who might not make the playoffs this year Arizona at least can say okay I've got my quarter back to the future\nDo you think the Broncos can say they have their quarterback for the future\nKnow I I I kind of want to stay away from the quarterback colored future I'm tagged because we've seen that play out horribly in Tennessee I'm yeah you know park this married or you could make a case that Mary or maybe a a real problem in Tennessee I'm often simply but as far as I can listen stern\nBy the way you can get some extra bang for your

Jones might or Calvin Johnson would have a couple of years ago he's not going to do that\nHe's just solid he runs routes so well he catches everything he's fast with the ball he's shifty like honestly like I as I was watching I\nBy the way God I mentioned the entree Hopkins in that elite receiver conversation no to no question about it I mean I cut down kept idea today I mean we're we're just showing what the first of all it was great for all this on what the water and put it perfectly and that but are there are only a handful of receivers that could make that catch the under happened is one of them\nI don't know if Adam the one has that capability to go up and have the reached that the Andrea Hopkins has but if I'm telling you like he has a dog he is like people came into this year if they can step on digs is going to be the number one receiver it is not is Adam and Eve they could put them anywhere like one of the things or does Bryan that I Believe\nIs the reason why he is not on the on a team this year is because he is literally like there are different areas of wide receiver they're getting wide receiver one wide receiver to slot wide receiver there's like three different positions with in the wide receiver\nAnd one of the criticisms I think I've heard about that Brian I think it's true if he can only be a wide receiver one he can only see himself he visually does not see himself as a wide receiver too because if he doesn't get you know if he's running and he's not going to the ball he's going to start to ...\nSo that's why he can't be wide receiver to be the can't envision himself as a guy who only gets for targets in a football game\nCan't play because he's not physical enough\nOkay if someone's ... some of the press are you doing press coverage on death Brian and he's in the slot gets what he might not get off that coverage he he can literally only point wide receiver one I really think this is a big reason why does Brian is not being done is because he can only play wide receiver one and he's not good enough to be a wide receiver one of his like\nHis ego only sees himself as that Adam ceiling can do everything Adam feeling you wind up on the outside and I'm feeling fine if it step on digs day Adam ... find if you put them in a slide he\nCan come off press coverage and Adam feeling of courts can play that wide receiver one\nI mean I'm telling you what this Minnesota Vikings team I put them as my number one team last week in terms of how we keep our eyes at the end of the north\nAnd I said the Vikings where my number one team but there were it's cause it's just like the last you know I think about the two north divisions right now okay you they're they're the exact same ... you can correct me if I'm wrong okay we'll see Green Bay tonight that's why I'm so curious what happens on Monday Night football will they laying eggs\nAt home against each other that third but sorry whatever it is not Jimmy and you know I I mean I Do love Jimmy ... so he should there ... there should be no ... I Love me some Jimmy I Love his\nHiney body Jimmy's not playing this game so Green Bay you know as far as I have got to cover that now that we're going to see what they're going to have the night but I'll tell you what\nThe structures of the AFC North and then if you are very very similar because we don't know who the best team is yeah there are three teams who could legitimately be in first place at the end of the year with the Green Bay Packers you got the Chicago Bears I mean I did the bears we'll see if their defense can take the next step next week\nAnd a half Chicago well guess what he gets it comes to town Brady and the boys oh Tom Brady and on the road against the bears yeah that officers roller if the Miami Dolphins with ... Wyler scores thirty one points against ... what do you think Tom Brady is going to do\nA ... it's going to a somber way to the spread of that game is going to be well I'm looking at a route but don't tell me ... okay you know what we'll do one guest that like can I take a guess what you're looking at the early wind right now between the patriots and the bears\nOn the road mhm okay Bob would you have a\nI I'm curious\nI think this is a touchdown is it more than a touchdown spread I must say patriots minus seven oh\nActually according to um yeah it's a Chicago minus one what yeah may be Vegas\nHog those favored yeah that's a real against doing what\nI'm pretty sure it will change eventually once everything gets sick you're\nKidding yeah are you sure you're looking like not like a game between the bears and the patriots two years ago\nYou know how am I off here\nAnd I don't I don't know why I'm asking you your I mean I guess you know legacies a Chicago at home with the home field or ...\nAway but the the bears have a by next week no they don't they don't look at the same as legitimate as we know how can Vegas who traditionally loves Brady\nLook at a game that ... just one like tonight ... pages of course thirty eight points thirty points meant tonight forty three ... I mean so that adds up to like five hundred five hundred points over the last three weeks for the Braves boys\nHow can I I don't get that what are you positive you're looking at the correct information but I'm looking at the right information right I trusted Bobby ... I don't know if we should believe what we saw out of Dallas as often is that going to continue\nI'll tell you what that is next overnight\nThis over the nights that here I could listen to Bill Bill

here's Beth Arab walking back and this is over the night SB Nation radio Matt\nHarris back with us jump back into the NFL specifically the New York jets how about the New York jets off at forty two points today is the jets they care the Indianapolis Colts forty two to thirty four on the line with us to talk about the jets Michael ... he writes for SB Nation\nPoints today is to secure the Indianapolis Colts forty two thirty four on the line with us to talk about the jets Michael ... saw he writes for SB Nation New York jets page that has gained green nation Michael us\nYou know Sam Darnell I saw was pretty good today pinpoint you know pretty good accuracy you only have a pretty good pinpoint accuracy is sixteen complete ... twenty four thirty is this the best you've seen them all year\nYeah I think this is the best game ... has bite and he was a fish and and the jets pursuing the year opening up acts of Troy and against Denver last week but\nWho knows if he didn't throw only I Believe twenty two passes in each of those games\nAnd they they were able to operate on the strength of a really good run game they were\nGetting some really good field position on being sent in those games so he was a fishing and those two games but it was he didn't really have to carry the team too much pressure against the cold today Andrew Luck was really on his game bait the cold to knock away the just the fans have some problems then this is the one score game and the fourth quarter so Sam Donald had to keep\nBouncing back answering back in putting points on the board to keep the Jackson delete and prevent from getting back into the into the game and he continued to do that the jets ... field goals they did struggle in the red zone yeah\nThey were driving the ball every single time so tender on it but he had to ... he was a fish and he didn't really get the big plays any organ Denver last week but wherever he's throwing the ball he is accurate and he took care of football had only the one section so this is probably the best and so far I degree\nPass through six games this season the jets are three and three now or what is the most impressive thing that you've noticed about Sam Darnell\nI I think the most impressive things definitely his ability to bounce back off his mistakes and just keep going through them and it's something that\nYou were talking about a law and the ... process and you hear about every single week on the broadcast out he's an even keel guy who's going to bounce back and keep flying no matter what happens then you look at it I mean you know they're winning or losing and you see that there was I saw it in the very first game if Detroit laid back\nBounce back from a big sex and you saw it again today there are pretty bad reception rocking on for Rob Anderson down the field getting picked off by mostly poker and just went down early in this game and that aircraft and played a part of that but again he just bounce back and play the fish and football the rest of the way and and you saw him again\nA perfect games this season against Cleveland against Jacksonville in Miami even have some struggles throwing the ball ... times some pretty bad football what you expect for rookie but\nYou come back from the games come home in Denver and Indianapolis and played really good really good game so I think his ability to bounce back from those mistakes and knowledge and snowball and who wants to take after another after another yeah is building who has been really impressive\nNo doubt about it Michael ... is our guest covers the New York jets New York taking care of the Indianapolis Colts today forty two to three four you can follow Michael's work on Twitter and Michael underscored ... a a a right for as the nation's paid for the New York jets so I I heard you say ah you know walking on to Rob interested that's exactly\nWhat happened [laughter] so I think that we see there's a lot with rookie quarterbacks you know I think that is that it to you know when we see the progression of rookies throughout their career that's what we see at the very beginning them you know not being able to look out for the ... biggest weakness do think sometimes you hold on to\nTheir terms of eyesight to his target and he's only going to go one way but that biggest biggest weakness to you\nThat if you look at the ... the has thrown he's definitely had a few like that and I talked to the times already bound for Detroit Clipper game by one of those like that yeah and one\nAgain slamming this time of that nature and against Jacksonville ironically the game if the jaguar was his only gain without touching the same thing but he had one called back and I came in to drop he had\nA few places like that in fact came and obviously the ... come on this time so terms of his risking thorough team will pay shops like look at one on one match ups and same thing can fit the ball in there but that is a sign of higher he is he's a guy who's going to take risk than they can keep going to throw the he's not going to take chances he's going to\nLook at this one on one match ups the thing he can win those and I do think that it is our weekends but we've also seen some times where he's done a really good job scanning the field and looking I'll say season opening things up the if he did it a couple of times against them for last week so yes and no I think it's a week because\nWith his gunslinger time mentality or to see some really and especially as a rookie year these are really ugly place where he locks on receivers but I also think there are times where he looks ... on the theoretical disability the scanner defense\nYou know I I Am fascinated by Sam Donald it's one of the reasons I really wanted to have you on as you look through the progression one thing that I think that I saw early in the season and I did and to and I'll be honest I was at the Texas game today so I was kind of watching the game kind of not um it's so I\nHate it when I saw early in San ... like the first couple of games he just seemed a little maybe uncomfortable like is the best way to put it was a little bit dinner foot uh you know just a lot of steps in just just didn't seem very comfortable\nDo you get the sense that over the six games have become more comfortable in the pocket is that a fair thing to say\nI think it definitely is an especially over the past couple of games\nOn the line from playing a lot better over the three game losing streak dolphin flying that a lot of struggles they're playing in the defense of from the airplane Miami Cleveland Jacksonville things are really strong on the defensive linemen\nAre rushing off the edge so often to line their struggles magazine and the jets did open the the kind of conservative with their play calling ... springs and I do still run a lot of screens and they open this game against ah the colds pretty conservatively but yeah\nI definitely think it's probably in the pockets getting a lot better that was one of the issue you kind of had over the for a couple of games that he wasn't really producing a lot down the field but over the past couple of games he's definitely got a lot better there and wait for a couple of games they were kind of\nThing a little over ... over lying on his ability to\nGet outside the pocket and they place on the wrong time some time in pitching to play a little bit too early but he definitely done\nMore comfortable and they're sending a fee and complain throws down the field really accurately and in this game he only sixteen completion than he was there really weren't that many screen passes and gained a lot of those three on the first marker and I believe there's only one drop in the game but that was a shouldn't be touched down to ... and that was\nA really good though so yeah I definitely think his play in the top has gotten a lot better he's been more patient and with that it's come better accuracy down the field\nMichael ... is our guest covers the New York jets for SB Nation page I gained green nation you can follow Michael's work on Twitter at Michael underscored ... still one of the things that I think could potentially you know down the road maybe not this year we saw today these explosive missed in terms of the office but\nThere really isn't a number one wide receiver I guess I should say like when you look at the jets receiving numbers for the year\nYou got three guys who over two hundred years or five guys with at least ten catches\nIt seems to be that the ball could go anywhere on any given play like there's nobody that's Sam Donald is specifically say okay that's my number one guy who you save all first of all do you think that's true and do you think that ultimately it's helping Sam Donald that he's not pressured to throw the ball and you know like for example in Dallas you know there there were reports\nComing up at ... pressure to throw to desert bribes I don't say Sam Donald has that do you think that's helping him\nI think the progression of this position has been really interesting over the first three games cuisine noon while I was I right\nSee that's helping him\nYeah I think the progression of this position has been really interesting over the birth three games cuisine noon while I was\nI really among the top three in target chair and the entire league but when the past couple again he's really trying to ask is probably better especially in the past couple of games really spread the ball out a lot more and\nPart of that as an Clinton you are dealing with a bit of an injury or he struggled against Jacksonville he didn't have a catch ... so parliament has been a new kinds of climate in the past the games but\nMommy Andersen really wasn't involved for a few games after having such a great season last year in\n... definitely made a priority to get him to Baltimore especially looking\nDown on the field actually to this point Anderson is more productive through this point of the season this year then he was last year so there yeah dogs on a better job of getting all the ... and during her he had an injury is the start of the things and he had a great game today he's got more involved and Trump prior to is quietly\nProduce quite a bit he needs to have some ups and downs he had he got some key drops there are times where it's running thing kind of questionable but he's kind of um big spots this year with really productive reception filled out ... with a couple of really good pets as to even had a touchdown
