D. S. E. A. L. C. S. what'd you make the addition of ... Smith to the postseason roster and then we see mild Shaun will Harris get taken out there are you surprised at all\nIt's not really because miles straws kind of a luxury acres that is really kind of you can be your speed off off the bench as well but I Do similar similar defensive\nPosition as well in the outfield will Harris kind of struggle so just kind of thing if they try to change some of the options they happen to both and I I'm not really surprised I think that it's kind of a net neutral kind of move here just kind of speaking what you may may may the different options you want to have in the both and basically a really good wind up in Boston\nCarlos Korea that that story came out and he spoke yeah even about his back injury and just as really explaining\nHow nagging at spin and how painful it is when he's at the plane he started all three games to be a LDS you know he could get that home run is well I think everyone's serious you know if he can get going in general but when you see that story come out and you hear his comments saying how much pain is your is there any concern that\nIf the ashes do advance further that's something you have to take account or do you think no matter what the most part\nHey they're going to have this guy in the line up and he's going to be on the roster for the rest of the post season\nI think the most part this has been surprised that you're kind of pay attention to the eastern side of it just more confirmation of what it was ... Carlos are really struggling a lot at the end of the season here there hasn't really kind of an explanation of why that is coming up he's been on the deal for the Syrian Army are but to actually say hey it's about issue\nAnd it really has an effect and it's\nIt's good to know there's something going on but you really ... the main thing you're staying impact on the bad he hasn't been a really a liability in the field to affect the team you know so I expect them to keep her all within that short stuff and just hoping that that long rest but she was getting the sweet they're against Indians will really help Carlos out in this series against Boston and hopefully the world series and the thing is ...\nSo that's a good point because with the layoffs if they had from the end of the regular season to build a season with the ... and they make quick work of Cleveland certainly has allowed them some time not only to to get some guys healthy but to set up\nThis starting rotation as we're talking with Ryan Dunn for sports editor for the fourth in Harold he covers the Houston Astros ahead of the A. L. C. S. on Saturday Night against Boston what did you make of what you saw from the Astros against the Indians anything\nFrom that that you take away certainly we we just talked about Korea and maybe that's something that can get him going but what you saw from your starting pitching and animal that maybe there were still some concern about against a pretty good line up to the Indians and they shut them down\nI think there's anything to things you got to be here is that the one the Astros have the best weapons when it comes to starting pitching the fourteen but I think that's not really in question at this point here and then to go into the only and said can I can get and I'll and I'll see us\nTeams are fourteen and to engage toward\nRuns first the two times it seems last where the Indians so the Astros are going to be able to tour runs even if they fall behind her early that's not going to change against the red Sox here they have the wind or if they can hang with anybody they just rely on your starting pitching hopefully they can get through six six anything and it off the bullpen and that's just an easy for him to produce right now\nFor both of these teams ... been a conversation certainly the red Sox are\nNow that final ... came up big for him but that that's been an issue for the red Sox throughout the entire season when you look at both the team and each area how do you feel about each team's only bullpen but even if we go through the rotation bullpen in line up and we're kind of the edge maybe is in favor of red the red Sox where it's favor of the Astros [noise]\nI think really you've got the the Red Sox have got some good candidates on the line up there and look you bat shady Martinez\nAre really just where last year they had the Astros that Jose held to a\nGuy that are peaking at the right time offense can make a difference here I think you see the big difference on the uh for the bans for the Astros and starting pitching I think that it's kind of a toss up with the bullpen here you've got to question they asked her as both and has been\nSome guys haven't been as strong here I think personally that are really good at issue here have been set up in a ... has been locked out as the team was acquired um I I don't think there's many questions on outside of that\nFor both teams in the bullpen here but it's I I think it also gives the defense of edge made it to the Astros here as well but outside of outside of maybe ... or I couldn't get a storm McCain out there a catcher you really have no disadvantages a defense for Houston so I think in general\nWhen you're just looking at magic to these are two really easily matched up teams here in general but I think the biggest said you're going to get a starting pitcher for the I suppose\nWe know that in game one is going to be Justin ... used and we'd also in game two for Boston it's going to be David pricing and everything that comes with him starting in the postseason it's well documented everybody right now knows the issues that he's had\nEven tonight here in the you know see as everybody continues to bring up claimed her shot who yet again struggling in the postseason but then you have Berlin and I believe correct me if I'm wrong he\nWas asked about it today I even media availability why he is so good in the postseason versus Kennedy these other guys that have struggled what what do you make of Justin Vernon lander and what he's done in his his first started the postseason then also on the other side with David Price in white guy like him he just continues to struggle in the post season\nI think of Berliners side when it came to the Astros ... you could argue Justin Berliners to Korea was complete before even gods Houston there's no question his status of being a hall of famer up in the upper echelon of pictures\nAnd I mean there has to be some level of calm when it comes to just say I'm done at all what what what moral do except when it all and he joined came that then arguably is one of the best when you were fired last season where and that brings you some level conference here so it's just kind of\nI think that the general with the Astros this kind of rainy Berliner is this team does how good it is it's not that comes out at the level of talking to us with that like state Alex pregnant or something to mostly outsiders here but this this she knows how good it is when it kinda it kinda just\nPersonified itself with how much confidence pitching staff on the opposite side of the data price really the biggest thing that that within I think just kind of get to that don't tend to be such a talented pitcher master craftsman of of of this position just I think sometimes you just over things\nBut then I think that don't be such an intelligent pitcher is not master craftsman on a position just I think sometimes you just over things a little bit with each pitch\nTight with Ryan Dunn mores the sports editor for the fourth in Harold he covers the Houston Astros and you can follow him on Twitter at Johns under score and more what about the managers here in this series and certainly I think you would give the edge stage a ... for a couple of different reasons but Cora\nThere and the connection that he has the ashes organization I thought something was kind of overblown I've seen a couple national publications as we talk about\nAll right well our score he knows a little bit of extra about these guys and that can be an advantage and I just I I don't buy into that year and especially in two thousand Eighteen and certainly at this point in time of the season where everybody knows everything on every hitter on every picture to me there's no secrets\nAbsolutely agree I think I think what is the age of ... and I think at this point there's not going to be in it and like you were saying earlier there's not a big advance for manager in this world a baseball now what the job of manager is to convey the message what the front office once for a particular change\n... whatever's wrong I don't know if something happened with the girlfriend before the game or whatever they just pull the guy\nAnd we were

I just my back story with Kathy Kathy at\nFoxwoods let me ask you another question that I've often wondered as a player who maybe we can talk about this a little bit I've noticed that sometimes especially in small rooms that you're not ... not the word God and not foxwoods but in smaller rooms\nThe viewers tend to be friendly with and I need really chatty and show me with players\nAnd I find that if I'm not from the room if I'm young the game that can be off putting and I'm Wondering if you train people to be friendly up to a point or if in fact the friendlier they are the better it if somebody feels like an outsider well that's too bad we're catering to locals how do you handle that\nWell I I Am probably [laughter] I haven't done it yet on and I know that there's there's issues in the room with regard to such theater as you described um\nAm very much in favor of minimal discussions at the table with players um you know if you're asked a question or if you can initiate ed and I've told this to many many dealers are low and put out formal training on it\nI'm a dangerous job is to initiate conversations\nBetween players not between them and players do you suppose you came to the table and and the dealer didn't know you and and they said you know are you from here or\nYou know and you say well no I'm actually from back east and and you know ... and then it can dealer said we don't have to end the player entirely you were originally from back east right\nAnd yeah yeah well why don't you why don't you you know see if if you guys you know from the same area where they get those of you are getting right and then back out on the conversation\nOn because as you said you know at at a table that is conversing you know the players conversing with one another that table last a lot longer do that is a good job of the dealer as to initiate conversations between players right [noise] um and then step out of it um\nTo constantly keep the conversation going with a local\nUm you know asking you know saying no you know my kid got her yesterday I I'm Sorry but I don't feel that the rest of their table really wants to hear that [laughter] um I you know as well most players come to a poker room to socialize amongst themselves\nTo get it possibly away from their world and come into our age as you know a refuge on and the last thing they want to do is is here about somebody's problem right um or even in their ear about their good times they don't want to hear it unless they are converging\nOn all terribly with another player correct tell 'em there there's a lot of training to be done with that it's going to be breaking habit um which you know that it's tough to break them and I will give dealers a lot of leeway I'm In order to do that\nAnd and as I say it's only just a select few that really have problems with that most of\nThe dealers in this in the green valley ranch poker him are\nThey're they're pretty embarrassed and what to do 'em at Washington out there they're they're relatively quiet they deal a good game they do is ask game accurate um but yet they're still you know\nThey can still respond to a player's question you know where the friendliness and their voice and then just you know anything that you need 'em young without being intrusive that there's that line so that's what I Want to do for all my dealers here to read is just going to need a little bit a little bit of training\nI got two more quick questions and then we're gonna have to show up of first of all do you see any trends with regard to the games that are going to be spread and poke room I mean you and I started in an era when stored was it's not king at least a rivaling limit hold them\nAnd then we saw the rise of no limit\nI'm Wondering if you see women hold them evaporating completely if you see below becoming more popular any trends with regard to that and then I Want to just ask you quickly about cheating some questions about cheating [laughter] okay\nUm I I Would have in in local so gross here in Las Vegas on the debt limit games um are still alive and well\nI'm you know to for for a a tipping on and I think that they'll they'll remain as part of an awkward culture for for quite a while I'm\nWith regard to study um or or even Omaha I'm studying actually that is so hard to keep it alive I mean it's you know it's got its last breath um when people like the game I mean at the second second and third week I was here [laughter]\nYeah I I Want to get get get going and I put my name up on the board and you know like I Can't pronounce in it and you know come on guys you know how to play start cannot let go\nI I Want to get a ... game going and so I put my name up on the board and you know like I Can't pronounce in it and you know come on guys you know how to play start come on let's go and we started it like for hand it I guess five handed it was just a foray you know stood height\nAnd um before I Know it um you know I I have to leave the game\nBecause it's all you know and there's a player wanting to come in so they do like it you know they enjoy it it just it's hard to spread ya um people just I don't know I don't know why I'm I I enjoyed it immensely\nDone a lot of young people that are coming into the game I don't even know how to play it because all they only I'm exactly the same deck\nWith that but I mean we have it here we had a and a ... and older crowd um you know I Do is listen I'm\nI'm right in there with a like um\nWe do have an older crowd that that they grew up\nUh initially without an cards right or even five card you know five guards that I mean they go way back so I Know that they know how to play it um and it's just a matter of getting them to the table um but you know it's it's a I think no limit or when it\nUm and the Knicks games are having a comeback I'm ah I've talked to many players that you know say you don't if if if you're going to start makes gave the green valley ranch you know we'll be over there just give it to call\n'em 'til I bet it just rained ideal is make sure that they know what they're doing and then that's what I'm going to do it initiate next James and a grab throw in a horse tournament and their summer\nThere you go um but yeah so anyway um\nBefore we close I I just wanted you to comment a little bit on people's perception people not in the casino poker world not in the public\nPoker room world they play in home games and they\nAre concerned I think a phrase is probably not exactly the right word but they're anxious or at least concerned about playing in a public room with strangers because of fear and anxiety about being cheated you've been around poker for a long time Jaffe\nA machine any\nEvidence of play you're eating and how do you deal with it and how do you ensure the new person that that's not going to happen\nYes I have to I I've I've come across a cheating in in a number of different different ways\nUm and over the course of you know the Twenty years or twenty five years that I've been in the business um [noise] you know whether it be marking cards um nail encourage ah\nBack everybody you're listening to house of cards I'm actually out of

that no this high school football game um\nThis kid who was like a back up to be for the\nTeam um he\nOn a kickoff he's you know 'cause it's a smaller school on a kickoff news rundown feel to make a tackle or whatever and one of the defenders or so I I guess we should say one of the returning team guys\nLike tackles this guy okay searched choking him and like punching him in the helmet like punching and punching him and they come over and they just like kinda like\nEscorted the kid not out just to the sideline and then like one more times it kind of happens in the game where this kid is clearly getting like singled out and like\n... it's a nobody does anything about it and do\nThat so the district didn't suspend anybody ... like the kid that did all this it played the next week is really really violent looking like I'm not trying to be I'm not laughing that at the situation it's an incredible I'm laughing at\nThe ... and uh you know did the coach of the team that had that

Roswell Gilmore Rick\nLet's say let me to this thing in the year there your laptop to Rick calling from Ross will go more than Rick\nHi Hi Neal how are you good um so I have four quick things I wanted to talk with you about okay first of all I ordered the double pacifier raid and got the cap that you're right that cap is really nice cat\nLast year for a long time\nYeah it looks nice to it it it fits me while I I like it a lot but the question I have is a there's the fiery have a shelf life to it\nA minimum is five years okay and we had last longer than that but that they they allow it for five years\nOkay now the other the other three things although I'm not a hunter I listen to your program on a regular basis and I'm not a hundred but I'm a calculus in physics a tutor for high school students okay and what I wanted to mention to you is are you aware that in calculus we do a\nUm a fishing problem and in physics we do a hunting problem I'm a novelist that we do\nI did not I love this I'd love to to be able to see the substance of those problems\nSo I'll give you the scenario for the calculus problem okay so you're sitting in a boat\nOr you cook the fish\nAnd uh you know how high above the water the tip into your fishing rod is and you know how fast you're really in the fish\nUm we can figure out using differential calculus in some ... tree or the ... we can figure out how fast the angle is changing between your line and the water and we can also figure out how fast the fish is coming toward the boat I\nUh using calculus and either I'm ... I'm a tree and or the and the ...\nOr ... ... ... I Can't even say it and I tutor\nFactory unfair um is so that is an aerial sit out the ... the some of the squares of the two opposite side equals the some of the square of\nThe ... yeah or something like that is\nSo it it applies to uh write triangle and it's a it's as you said there's some of the squares of the two legs has the equal the square the pot and write\nBetter you are and so hey listen Rick it's been a long long time [laughter]\nSo so anyway you got to write try and go with the tip of Iraq a fishing rod coming down to the water and then going out to the fish and then your line foreign ... news and you can do all kinds of a mathematical calculations based on that right triangle [noise]\nUm so that's the scenario with calculus for physics to it's a hunting scenario\nSuppose at your target is like\nOh I don't know three hundred yards away although Isaac's we used as a metric we say three hundred meters away right and I'm supposed to ... your firing your weapon on a level level with the ground\nAnd um suppose that um [noise]\nHow how do you have to aim above your target if you know your muscle velocity of the a rifle how far above your target do you have to aims so that when the bullet arrives it hits where you want it to hit okay that's a ... and you use Newton's\nI'm a\nTraditional um equations of a motion to solve that it's a fairly simple problem to do\nOr let me ask you a question of question Rick [noise] if you fired a bullet and perfectly level\nAnd you fired a bullet and it weighed a hundred grams alright okay and you\nWin that bullet exited the barrel and the the ground in front of us perfectly flat when that bullet exits the barrel if you drop the boom it\nFrom that position it exactly the same time both bullets will hit the ground at the same time\nHe's had some physics\nHow 'bout that\nYou've had some physics training because that's one of the things that they teach you in physics is that exactly what you said\nWell I'm impressed with\nThat's one of the things that they teach you in physics has said exactly what you said\nWell I'm impressed with myself\nYeah I'm impressed with you too that I I'm not a lot of people know that\nYou have velocity does it change gravity\nRight gravity that that that\nThe two are forced vectors if you will\nAre independent of each other you've got the the vector of\nOf its horizontal lost city and you have the vector\nOf is a vertical velocity which initially as zero coming out of the barrel but thing gravity starts acting on it as soon as that exits the barrel ... and it starts coming down and gravity doesn't care whether the bullets moving or not it's you know it's going to act on the bullet a regardless and so it's just as you said\n... ... here's the question that got though around\nThat physics question does that was pondering this I wanted to ask you a question do you happen to know what the muzzle velocity ...\nAgainst what did they get your paycheck\nCraziest\nListen

to\nOne another right it's the evil Republicans who are just mean right everybody right\nOh oh wow\nWell this sure will be fun oh looking forward to that um you know hello ended up too far off every year conversation comes up sooner or later when should you stop trick or treating\n... is there a specific age some places there is a specific age you see this story down in Virginia will find kids up to a hundred bucks or jail them for six months if they go trick or treating enter above the age of twelve\nI'm against this and I believe in freedom [laughter] there are ...\nAre they really going to throw a Thirteen year old in jail for going trick or treating\nIt starts with discipline ... if we're going to make America great again discipline starts at a young age that's what we're talking about uh-huh no I Know it's it's a bit\nDavid if we're going to make America great again discipline starts at a young age that's what we're talking about\nUh-huh no I Know it's it's a bit much but all of a sudden\nFor a guy like me who is kind of looked at as the evil ogre in my neighborhood because you know you know all my friends around in my neighborhood they all have kids\nAnd we talked before and I'm like yeah I really think the cut off surround sixth grade and you know right around twelve and so those kids that might be later in middle school or even early at high school you know like hey I still have this outfit\nI really like getting the free candy ... why do you have fun Mr ... it's not I'm just thinking about my own childhood yeah you know once you were out of fifth or sixth grade you were done\nYeah I kinda think the ruled generally was when you're old enough to walk down to the corner store\nAnd buy your own candy you can't you're not going trick or treating anymore right\nAnd that would be right around twelve for most people\n... million man this is the law according to the city's ordinance if any person over the age of twelve ... should engage in activity commonly known as\nTrick or treat\nOr any other activity of similar character or nature under any name whatsoever he or\nShe shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and she'll be punished by a fine of not less than twenty five dollars or more than a hundred or\nBike confinement in jail for not more than six months or both\nObviously a story like this gets picked up by ... yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] do you think it's a little too harsh though to throw kids in jail for this talk of course but anything to stories funny\nYeah do they have the time limit for trick or treating activities to all of that stuff I mean I I yeah do you do you mind the time limit um\nYeah because if you're trying to keep it under the age of twelve and you're saying hey come at you you have to be in by eight o'clock yeah generally I think it's probably a good idea for an eight year old to be inside by eight o'clock yeah depending on the town you live and depending on where you are or what neighborhood you're in but\nYeah it's probably not great to have an eight year old wandering around the streets looking for candy from strangers until ten o'clock at night well I\nWasn't even thinking about the kids' safety I was thinking about eight o'clock whites out no or a ring the doorbell yeah we've got a three hour window your daddy\nThat's a good thing about living in an apartment complex for me personally is I've never been bothered by trick or treaters\nThere right in times like every year my wife wants to go by Halloween candy just in case although it's really just a clever ploy to make sure that we have plenty of candy in the house and we wind up eating all of it and there you go there and the Christmas fat season begins yet\nTo be honest I don't really mind but yeah there should be a time limit on it and yeah you got to stop some time in the ...\nThe other story of the government killing an old lady\n[noise] yeah well [laughter] I haven't read the headlines and that's the click bait

still alive\nSo the capitals reporting visiting crofton Marilyn the capital was reporting that Ellen bearing got home on September twentieth\nAnd she found out she went on line to check your bank

...\nProgressive way you know she was getting more and more annoyed Angie good luck to be the the error though\nLuckily could have had worse ramifications if you were a mobile or still out of town 'cause she came back from traveling to find out but she died\nBut what if I mean you're talking about missing some time with your medication yeah pain and suffering you a little something back\nI don't I don't think so usually don't I mean you and luckily I mean it seems like he's been able\nTo clear this up relatively quickly 'cause you hear about people who are dealing with the ramifications of this for years\nThat's paying them and if the government messes up and it happens every year you hear these stories where you know somebody hits the wrong key and the government says you're dead
