at\nNFL Charlie Charlie one of the morning dissipated games for the weekend I think coming up in the Chicago Bears taking on the New England patriots blitz of bears had a tough weekend in terms of defense last week against backup quarterback rock off Wyler who by the way I didn't realize he had beaten the bears separately with three different teams\nTerms of defense last week against backup quarterback rock Wyler who by the way I didn't realize he had\nBeaten the bears separately with three different teams over three starts in his career that was a pretty interesting statistics do you think that there's going to get\nBack on track defensively over arguably one of the hottest offices and all football this week\nI really don't uh you know I think the bears are a little bit expose last week and I mean you can't expect them to have more success against Tom Brady than they did against ... flower\nUm you know it didn't seem that brought out other with three different teams it was first start there really is that we're doing that you know the vaccine in quite some time you\nKnow I mean I think the um I think the parents are going to struggle I'm off tentatively in that game against away England and they're going to need to put up close to thirty points to have any chance of beating the crap\nHey Charlie would what would you watch the New England patriots office right now obviously we could say OK Julian Edelman is back they got ... and now he's a deep but\nSunny Michelle I've been saying this for awhile sunny Michelle as the X factor to me the ability to be able to run the ball in between the Chappelle's Show is different I think that every other New England patriots running back that we've seen over the past couple of years you know they still have genes white who could catch it on the back bill\nBut what is the sunny Michelle element really brings the patriots off and has allowed the scores many points that they have recently\nOr allows them to have a lot of balance that often I mean the patch right now could beat you in a number of different ways and we've kind of seen around ... his career with New England [noise] you know it was you know\nWe're on between the tackles with Cory doing for a while [noise] and they found a way to win Super Bowls with it then it was you know\nFive wide and you know Chuck it around and ... and Tom Brady broke every single season passing record there was almost won the super bowl and then they went to the too tight end yeah what's wrong and the um you know the late Aaron Hernandez yeah\nThey found a way to win with that and you know it just now they they find different ways to win with their personnel [noise] which you know of course the mark of a great football team and now they could you know they could ... between the tackles southern Michelle arguably the best running back they've had including Corey do and\nYou know maybe ever you know in New England and you know they still have ... over the middle who has to be accounted for an adult and makes a huge difference and they are just wait till Josh bored and you know it starts getting up to speed with that play book there can be pretty tough team to stop it and they they're kind of around again to to the forum that\nI think most of us thought we would see you know for the New England patriots here\nNo question about it Charlie Bernstein is our guest covers the NFL you can follow Charlie's work on splinter NFL Charlie stop to one game that I think is interesting this weekend is the one to ... across the pond in in in between the charges and the titans these teams are going into different directions off sensibly or do you see like\nI was thinking about this Los Angeles I think if I calculated it correctly it's like five AM body clock time or something like that for them do you think that's been a little bit because when I looked at the spread Charlie and I saw that the charges Raleigh paper by six and a half\nI immediately wanted to hop on that because I'm like Tennessee does I think I Want them a hundred and fifty total yards last week granted there was a you know it's a really good deepest what do you see the chargers with the time change how big a factor do you think that's going to be into UCLA dominating this one\nL A much better football team and you would like that match up but you know especially against the you know tightened off on the line I just eat a little luck in fact the Baltimore [noise] um\nYou know it's hard to give any team or a particular advantage in those London games or you know teams don't really do outside of Jacksonville teams don't really know how to prepare for that I gained ... you know properly\nAnd you know they they talk to I mean they they certainly call up you know Jacksonville and the you know hey how ... how do you guys do it with you know stuff like ... and everything else but you know it it's definitely you know different\nYou know and I don't think anybody has particular advantage so with that you would think the better team would have an advantage and that certainly is the the chargers [laughter] yeah it could go on to say San\nDiego and I don't know how many years they're going to have to be in LA for me to actually get that in my system\nBut um you know ... I think it will be closer than than you know or I don't think it'll be a blowout and take a baby a one score game penalty defense is still pretty darn good\nUm but but the chargers are really coming into their own right now you know I take them to win the super bowl this year for the season started and their outlook in like the team right now by Melvin Gordon really under rated running back and\nThey pretty much you can do everything in the past the game wherever it's having a a low key great she's and another one\nI'm like I said ... great teasing because that's really true and and when it comes to the chargers are doing at the opposite that they're they're hot at the beginning of the year who knows if they can sustain it yeah I actually teach that down to just to pick up it was six and a half Charlie joining us on the bench CSI dot com hotline let's go to the saints raise been\nGreat deep sense versus great often look we don't see consistently great defense in the league except for really one team and that's the Baltimore Ravens the top usually are dynamic often what kids who do you think went this game\n[noise]\nNo I I like Baltimore in this game um [noise]\nYou know I think right now you're Flaco is playing really good football as he mentioned that the defense to claim well right now and ... it it doesn't even matter the personnel that\nBaltimore throws out there they're ... they're really solid on defense every single year and it really in the last few years when they've you know had the kind of poor win loss record this thing because the offenses putting that defense to embed positions right now they're playing a little bit better\nOff as they finally have guys like a catch ... polar paths which you know certainly help when Joe wacko out I I liked them over the over the state than that one um I\nI just I don't quite believe in the same ... you know it was bright out against the good that you can't I don't believe in um outside of the don't\nYeah I look at the historically have been great at home but struggle on the road sometime Charlie Bernstein is our guest\nCovers the NFL you can follow Charlie's work on Twitter at NFL Charlie so we're located down here in Houston huge game coming up\nTo three ... again these aren't like we were talking about the the charge to tell you this is really a game of two teams to supposed see seemed to be going in opposite directions down to ... have not looked good\nI was at the Texas game last week I I mean there are parts of wind is still examples I think I saw that on Twitter ... this week they let the Sean walk to get hit Seventy times this year\nAnd the second highest in terms of the team that gives us the most to their quarterback\nI think it was like forty nine like there's a Twenty one discrepancy between the two jobs they'll play the jaguars do you see what is wrong with the Jacksonville Jaguars deepest you see them being able to get to Washington this week\n\nBetween the two jobs they'll play the jaguars do you see what is wrong with the Jacksonville Jaguars deepest you see that being able to get to Washington this week\nBut if they can't get to watch someone that often to live there who's sitting there they're never going to you know I I mean that stuck with that and also the ... and he's been there's there isn't a league or they should get to them but\nYou know when you when you look at the match up you know I don't want to see similar team to Dallas last week that just crashed on but you have a better quarterback I think it means Houston that you do in Dallas and better weapons on the outside the jaguars struggle with mobile quarterback and they struggle the last\nTwo weeks of mobile quarterback I don't know if that changes I mean we're going to have to see you know a lotta you know boots\nAnd [noise] you know moving the pocket\nWhich I think bill O'Brian is capable of of drawing up but that's what the taxes are going to do in that game but what I tell you what a another surprise or line that really really surprises me in Jacksonville favor by five an hour\nThat's bad DSM dot com and use the code wind up one twenty five ... beats what'd you make a player or the cowboys Redskins game this week I Believe to pick them I think it's Dallas minus one if my memory serves me correctly\nBut that would be honestly man I don't trust the cowboys I don't uh you got one week and you got cold\nFeet nine catches a hundred yards to touch that I Am totally what Charlie I Need to see two weeks not just the three weeks before I go to bed at the site dot com and put some of that money down or you with me\nI just I just the money ... oh you're ... you're\nTotally off the cowboys but yeah they are good at home that day I go to Alex Smith Alex Smith ...

F. L. we talked fantasy football yesterday suit gambling tonight with Greg Peterson in a high five super contest time cats\nAnd that's gold with Steve heightened air you can follow all of grapes work on Twitter edgy unit under sport eighty one All right Greg let's start with uh\nThe question that I tweeted you earlier this week because I was genuinely interested in this game and I am still I I Want an explanation because I don't understand why the Kansas City chiefs Cincinnati Bengals line is set adjust to it was six and a half\nAnd divine I'm looking at now has moved down to six I think Kansas City should be favored by more in this game I put this is my luck of the week simply because I\nCan just sit in arrowhead I don't trust Andy Dalton ... Louis that combination just yet why is this point only six Cincinnati in Kansas City\nHonestly I think this was a very fair line because if you take a look at it with the book bankers are saying is Kansas City is three points better\nThan the Cincinnati Bengals on a neutral field you typically get Breezy Point to a home game diet gives Kansas City is right now ... about three points it's better if you play that something like North Pole laugh or whatever but I mean I think that that's actually quite a good blind because you take a look at the Kansas City cheap\nThey had been very very good that fear is that playing the game obviously they had that a lot to get at the New England patriots patriots are playing for standing football they're that close call against the Denver Broncos is well now they do have some just absolute scheming let's hear that a little on the chargers\nThey absolutely are dismantle the Jacksonville Jaguars a couple of weeks ago but with that said the Bengals are also play football for heartbreak her last week and before that the single seem had been rolling so I think that a six points is a very fair line\nIt's a fair point to make because they did beat the Broncos by four points to the only loss of the patriots by three beats the Steelers by five points they have them in close game this is what you after I consulted you Greg I did tease it down along with another game here the Tennessee Titans now this one I'm really interested as well Tennessee Titans in London\nGoing to take on the Los Angeles chargers both off fences here trending in opposite directions I Love everything about the chargers right now\nStill a perverse on a roll these wide receivers aren't sick\nBut what do you make of the line because this game is being played overseas I I tried to do the calculation I could have been wrong great but I had it as the chargers playing this game like five AM body clocks time so how much of a factor does that play and the fact that this game is in London\nBut this is actually going to be six thirty AM Pacific time which is what the chargers are\nBut you know something you need to take into account year each charge or a blast we play their game in Cleveland and they did not believe the eastern time go oh no it's actually got three hours right there will be a little bit lots of body game the Tennessee Titans are coming in from Nashville actually going to be an hour behind\nThe Los Angeles chargers which is crazy when you put it on the surface but I mean I ... that said I still think that stick to that point is too many points spot\nBecause they ... they were absolutely awful last week against both more raven Marquez Mario to got sacked eleven times before that point he had been sacked nine times and the team for five game I think that this is actually good buffet pop the pain we've seen that change do a great work as an underdog\nThere were a home underdog a few weeks ago and they fight against Philadelphia Eagles won that came out right in overtime\nAnd we've seen in these London games that it's all over the top of the teams to pass just because the field is just\nOh yucky F completely breaks down you know I you take a look at team that run the ball a little bit more and I actually think that that's a little bit more of a stalemate because they've gotten Henry and company for the ... the ... meeting for the Los Angeles chargers obviously Melvin Gordon the third that'll be carrying the mail for that team do\nI look for a little bit of a lower scoring sloppy or game but if the result\nInteresting grant Petersen is our guest host of a high five super contest podcast in that school but Steve heightened our he joins us on the vet the assigned dot com hotline you can follow Greg's work on Twitter edgy unit underscore eighty one\nBy still last week I got burned I chose to go with a couple of under the under and the ... one of the game and once it was found out that brought us while there was going to be starting I was feeling very confident about that than all of a sudden a whole bunch of ... point started to be going\nSo long this is an offensive leap one game that I really like in terms of the over at the Cleveland Browns and the Tampa Bay buccaneers what are your thoughts on that and what are you so much as some ah some of your favorite over is when you look at the landscape of games this weekend\nRight now I'm seeing a trouble uh fifty and a half of that game and this is my favorite over because\nI Love the buccaneers have a pretty good often no matter friends Seamus Winston or if it's All right but it's Patrick in there they've been moving the ball they think going forward\nI mean a makeup and the ... the CGI these Sean jak there really have a little bit of a a career resurgence here after you add a little bit without your last year which get reception and the the buccaneers can't\nStop a nose bleed I mean I've been carried out against their pockets last\nWeek they gave up a whole bunch of point in that game against the uh Chicago Bears they allowed Michel ... throw for five touchdowns in one house\nSomething that happened on by a quarterback of the Chicago Bears in a bowl game and like Thirty years it was absolutely insane so and this is talk of the defense is awful and then with the Cleveland Browns they've been hit or miss\nBaseball game and like Thirty years it was absolutely insane so and the ... the defense is awful and that was the Cleveland Browns David hit or miss because keep in mind are two weeks ago against the Baltimore Ravens they did not give up a single touchdown and overtime game\nThen they got completely a house by the Los Angeles chargers and the week before that they gave up on the whole Bush show a point to yo putting writers who look completely and up to in London last week so\nI mean it's very hard to make the brown so I Would cite with you on the over and the spots\nSpeaking of ... that is the Jacksonville Jaguars right now why are they five point favorites against the Texans\nIt's because it's ... it's because you just don't know what to expect out of the Houston Texans at this point now they didn't get a nice went against the Indianapolis Colts a couple of weeks ago\nBut that's because the Colts substantially throw away a tie and one for and you know for the for situation right around the field they didn't converted and that gave the taxes are sexually but we're not in silver platter they're looking at the field do their\nBad and I swear it against the Dallas Cowboys as well on Sunday Night Football\nBut this team despite the fact that they got the job done against the bills it's because they take Peter meant third too\nAwful interceptions late night game I Am the terrible well bill's nearly knock them off last week\nI still don't know what to make out the Texas and keep in mind the Jacksonville Jaguars or just a couple of weeks ago looked like the last of the AFC after they completely pounded the patriots they follow that up with a knife went over the odd jagged I feel like we're getting into a little bit too much of a recent she biased because\nI mean why it's two law says that the that the J ... against the Dallas Cowboys and which I got just completely Spanish\nAnd then we get to the Kansas City chiefs and once they just had no chance stopping that run gave yeah I mean they were bad losses but with that said as long as the Jacksonville Jaguars don't get into a situation where they need to put it all boils down to have him come back provide\nThis day is a good jaguars keep\nGrant Petersen is our guest a hosted a high five super contests contests in that school was the flight nurse talking gambling for the Senate weaken

super doubt\nThat this line was nine and a half I chose the forty niners nine that point yeah\nBobby Greg does not like the Los Angeles chargers that\nI I ah I've already placed a bet so there's nothing I can do about it I guess ... did you know the ... stadium had what why look at me like that oh you should have stayed away from the game the chargers why\nYou don't know how Tennessee is

F. L. we become with Charlie Bird he covers the NFL you can follow Charlie's work on winter at\nNFL Charlie Charlie one of the more anticipated games of the weekend I think it's coming up as the Chicago Bears taking on the New England patriots won the bears that a top weekend in terms of the best last week\nAgainst backup quarterback brought ... by the way I didn't realize he had beaten the bears separately with three different teams over three starts in his career that was a pretty interesting statistics do you think the bears are going to get back on track defensively over arguably one of the hottest off that does it all football this week\nI really don't want a you know there are a little bit expose last week and I mean you can't expect them to have more success against Tom Brady than they did against ... flower\nI'm seeing that brought out other people with different teams it's first started and it really is that we're doing that they've seen in quite some time that I\nKnow I mean I think the parents are going to struggle 'em off at the voice in that game against England and they're going to need to put up close to thirty points to have any chance of being in the past\nSay Charlie what what what you watch the New England patriots office right now obviously we could say OK Julian Edelman is back they got ... and now he's a deep threat but\nSunny but shell and I've been saying this for awhile Sunday shows the X factor to me the ability to be able to run the ball in between the tackles shell is different I think that every other New England patriots running back that we've seen over the past couple of years you know they still have James White who could get it out of the back bill\nBut what is the sunny Michelle elemental really brings the patriots often has allowed that the score as many points that they have recently\nOr I mean that allows them to have a lot of ballot that often in the path right now could be you and number of different ways and we've kind of seen around Tom Brady is clear what New England you know when you\nWere on between the tackles the Korea deal in for a while and they found a way to winning Super Bowls with it then it was five wide and Chuck it around and ... and Tom Brady broke every single thing that happened where there was\nAlmost won the super bowl and then they went to the too tight end yeah what's wrong and\nYou know the way Aaron Hernandez yeah\nFound a way to win with that and you know it is it now they they find different ways when with their personnel which of course the mark of a great football team and now they could they could ... between the tackles show arguably the best friend got they've had including Corey do and\nYou know maybe ever you know in New England and they still have grown over the middle who has to be accounted for an adult and makes a huge difference in the air just wait till Josh for any you know it starts getting up with that book they're going to be pretty tough to stop it and they're kind of around again to the forum that\nI think most of us so we see from the New England patriots here\nNo question about it Charlie Bernstein is our guest covers the NFL you can follow Charlie's work on Twitter at NFL Charlie so I'll tell you one game that I think is interesting this weekend is the one to ... across the pond and in between the charges tightened these teams are going into different directions op ed simply a do you see like\nI was thinking about this Los Angeles I think if I calculated it correctly it's like a five AM body clock time or something like that for them do you think that's going to slow that because when I looked at the spread Charlie and I saw that the charges were only favorite by six and a half\nImmediately wanted to hop on that because I'm like Tennessee does I think I'd like less than a hundred and fifty total yards last week granted there was a a you know it's a really good defense but do you see the chargers with the time change how big a factor do think that's going to be at the UCLA\nLittle yard last week granted there was a guy you know it's a really good what do you see the chargers with the time change how big a factor do you think that's going to be into UCLA dominating this one\nL A much better football team and you would like that match up putting especially against the you know titans off on the line I just eat a little ah lack in fact the Baltimore [noise] um you know it's hard to give any team or a particular advantage in those London games\nOr you know teams don't really know outside of Jacksonville teams don't really\nKnow how to prepare for that I gained ... you know properly\nAnd you know they if they talk to I mean they they certainly call up you know Jacksonville and you know hey how ... how do you guys do it with you know stuff like equipment and everything else but you know ... it's a definitely you know the different you know and I don't think anybody has particular vantage do with that\nYou would think the better team and you have an advantage and that certainly is the chargers those [laughter] yeah it could go on to say\nSan Diego and I don't know how many years they're going to have to be an ally for me to actually get\nThat in my system [noise] but um\nYou know I think it will be closer than than you know uh I don't think it'll be a blow out I think maybe one score game a tendency to still pretty darn good\nUm but but the chargers are really coming into their own right now [noise] you know I I picked him to win the super bowl this year before the season started and they're kind of looking like that team right now I'm Melvin Gordon do really under rated running back and\nThey pretty much you can do everything in the path of game where every seven to a low key grape seeds and another one\nI'm like I said low key great season 'cause it's really true and and when it comes to the chargers they are doing just the opposite the hot at the beginning of the year who knows if they can sustain it yeah I actually teach back down to just to pick them it was just an app\nCharlie joining us on the dot com hotline let's go to the states at raising great deep sense versus green often look we don't see consistently great deep into the league except really one team and that's the Baltimore Ravens states obviously are dynamic often what kids who do you think winter skiing [noise]\nNo I I like Baltimore in this game um [noise]\nYou know I think right now you Flaco is playing really good football\nThey are as you mentioned that that the sun to\nClean well right now and ... it it doesn't even seem to matter the personnel that Baltimore throws out there they're ... they're really solid on defense every single year and really in the last few years when they've you know had the kind of poor win loss record this thing because we all fences\nPutting that defense in bad positions right now they're playing a little bit better\nOff as they finally have guys like a catch look forward paths which you know certainly help on joke wacko out I I like them all over the over the states and that one um I\nI just I don't quite believe in the same out you know it was bright out against the good defense I don't believe that um outside of the don't\nYeah I look at it they ... Greene at home but struggle on the roads sometime Charlie Bernstein is our guest\nCovers the NFL you can follow Charlie's work on Twitter an NFL Charlie so we're located down here in Houston huge game coming up\nTo three ... again these are like\nWe were talking about the the ... going to tell you this is really a game of two teams due to the seemed to be going in opposite directions down the taxes are have not looked good I was at the Texas game last week I mean they're off into the wind is still one sample I think I saw that on Twitter ... this week they went to Sean wants to get hit Seventy times this year\nAnd the second highest in terms of the team that gives us the most to their quarterback\nI think it's like forty nine like Twenty one discrepancy between to do now they'll play the jak why do you see what is wrong with the Jacksonville Jaguars steep and you see that being able to get to Washington this week\nI mean why if they can't get to watch someone that off on the line there because they're never going to you know I I mean that's the bad of an off on the line and he's been there isn't a league or they should get to them but\nYou know when you when you look at the match up you know I don't want to say similar team to Dallas last week that just thrashing them\nBut you have a better quarterback I think it and choose to do in Dallas\nAnd the better weapons on the outside the jaguar struggle with mobile quarterback and they struggle the last two weeks so global quarterbacks I don't know if that changes I mean we're gonna have to see you know a lotta you know boots and [noise] you know moving the pocket\nWhich I think below Brian is capable of of drawing up but that's what the Texans are going to do in that game but what I tell you what a another surprise or lie and that really really surprises me in Jacksonville favor by five an hour\nYeah no that is surprising I Don asleep didn't even know that was the one what is the wrong way what do you think he's going to ... in terms of Jacksonville\nImage wide receivers like Kurt Warner has the greatest show on tour he had Isaac Bruce and he had tore ... obviously got Marshall fault and then with the Arizona Cardinals to get Larry Fitzgerald unethical and build it\nI mean I don't know ... ... you really think now is there a quarterback that you can think of who has had the benefit of having a hair of wide receivers when our heart is in the NFL it just got what Jerry Jones says he hasn't had one of my\nFive year am I right can you think of one current only yes Kurt May be paying maybe that's a good when he came to Denver to get one last year\nThat's a good one to Marius who was the other one ah oh Eric Decker decker yeah\nThat's a good what I put that back by side yeah\nBobby beats you are smart I

fan but look I can do a non biased sports talk show let's give credit to the Boston Red Sox because let's face it\nThey are the best team in the American league they have been all year and they are moving on to the world series where we began on over the [noise]\nToo big things happen tonight David Price\nDavid Price got back on track\nThat was absolutely huge price today in his final game or before the world series six innings three hits no runs and nine strike out on the road\nYou've got to commend David Price and this was a perfect situation for him to be and not much pressure I Know you're on the road but you're up three to one it it was so important for the red Sox to win that game for because they could bring out to people who they honestly do not trust right now\nIn games and get them work so they are better in the world series that's the goal one of them being David Price and the other one being correct kimbrell\nIt was the most subtle roller coaster if you're a Boston Red Sox fan going out and seeing correct kimbrell we were getting into\nBobby I already forgot his name who is who is the cause of last year for the Astros were getting into Ken Giles territory when it comes to correct kimbrell seriously like Astros fan you were paying your pants last year when Giles was on about it was just a fact\nRed Sox fans were on that level when it came to correct Kimble and it shouldn't be like that 'cause timber was a fantastic closer\nBut look Boston needed to get to work with those two guys in and both of them got it done for the Astros though let me talk about it from your point of view didn't you just get the feeling watching this game that they were spent\nThat game for took everything out of them okay if you're a Houston fan do not think that that one call in game for was your demise absolutely I've thought about this yesterday we went on the air literally immediately after the game and I didn't really have\nWhat is your demise absolutely I've thought about this yesterday we went on the air literally immediately after the game and I didn't really have time to think about it I didn't have time to process it Bobby today I literally woke up I watch the video a couple of times it was\nThe wrong call it definitely was the wrong call\nBut it was not your demise I told you and Bobby the chatter was I listen to a little bit of local radio today and what I predicted yesterday on the show right after the game happened it happened\nOh we lost by two road like again when you lose a playoff game I noticed as a Yankees fan 'cause we lost a bunch this year that I Know this is the ... when you lose a playoff team what you do as a fan is you try and justify\nYou try and go back and figure out okay why did this happen\nAnd that is such an easy I'm telling you probably as soon as my roommate came home today can big Astros bands they want to talk sports with me obviously you know ... and he comes in and he's like ...\nThat was that was be yes yeah that should have been a ... I knew that was going to happen I knew what was going to happen\nFor teen runners on base though the Astros have their chance it\nIt was a great ... did you get screwed absolutely\nBut that was it was attorney ... ... at that\nPoint they get you know they they kind of dissolved a little bit like you can look back at that moment and gained four but ... it kind of became a little bit meaningless can we say like it was going back and forth I understand the end result was a two run victory for the red Sox but the Astros had their ... look this was just one team was better than the other\nFor if you if you lose four out of five games guess what you tip your cap\nTo the other team and you say good series you guys deserved it the red Sox deserted they've been the best team in the American league all year long it pains me to say this as a Yankees fan but it's just true and I want to say one more thing here before we hit the brake\nI I read an article today that's just ridiculous they're apparently their death threats do and against this guy this poor guy\nOr a repeat what I said on the air yesterday who who was involved in the interference\nThis is not Steve Bartman okay by way I'm not saying that the barber desserts death threats either it's just to get just a game okay but he did nothing wrong this guy he did not lean over Defense Department at least we'd open to fetch again not just to find that he deserved the death threats either but\nIt can we just leave this guy well he's a fan he did nothing wrong I Do think the rule needs to be amended do and I was going back and

radio\nThe other videos mad hair of\nBack over the night after the initial radio\nEra back with us jumped into the NFL weeks ago with early bird he covers the NFL you can follow Charlie's work on winter at NFL Charlie Charlie one of the more games for the weekend I think\nComing off the Chicago Bears taking on the New England patriots won the bears out of talks weekend in terms of defense last week\nAgainst backup quarterback brought us while or the by the way I didn't realize he had beaten the bears separately with three different teams over three starts in his career that was a pretty interesting statistics do you think that there's going to get back on track defensively over arguably one of the hottest officers at all football this week [noise]\nI really you know I'm you know I think there are a little bit of both last week and I mean you can't expect them to have more success against Tom Brady and then they did against flower\nUm you know in saying that broke off other different teams first start earlier than where they were seen in quite some time\nMom and dad I think the parents are going to struggle 'em off at the boy in that game against England and they're going to need to put up close early on any chance of being the\nCharlie would what would you watch the New England patriots office right now obviously we could say OK Julian Edelman is back\nThat got ... and now he's a deep threat but sunny must shell and I've been saying this for awhile sunny but shows the X factor to me the ability to be able to run the ball in between the tackles like Sony Michel is different I think that every other New England patriots running back that we've seen over the past couple of years you know they still have James White who could catch it out of the back bill\nBut what is the sunny Michelle element really bring to the patriots off but then has allowed the scores many points that they've had recently\nOr I mean that allows them to have a lot of balance that often in after right now in the number of different ways and we've got a theme around town brain is clear what New England you know when you\nWere on between the goals of Korea doing for a while and they found a way to wake superbowl's with it and it was five wide and Chuck it around and Tom Brady broke every single thing than path or are there was almost won the super\nBowl and then they went to the guy then [laughter] yeah well ... ... and um\nSee them passing record there was almost won the Superbowl [laughter] but then they went to the too tight end yeah what's wrong and the um you know the late Aaron Hernandez they've found a way to win with that\nAnd you know it just it now they they find different ways to weigh in with their personnel [noise] which you know of course the mark of a great football team and now they could you know they could planet between the tackles Michelle arguably the best running back they've had including Corey do and\nYou know maybe ever you know in New England and they still have ... over the middle who has to be accounted for an adult and makes a huge difference and they are just wait till Josh bored and you know it starts getting up to speed with that play book\nThey're going to be pretty tough team to stop it and they they're kinda round again to the forum that I think most of us thought we would see you know from the New England patriots here\nNo question about a Charlie Bernstein is our guest covers the NFL you can follow Charlie's work on winter at NFL Charlie so I'll tell you one game that I think is interesting this weekend is the one to ... across the pond in in in between the charges tightened these teams are going into different directions obsessively\nOr do you see like I was thinking about this Los Angeles I think it's calculated it correctly it's like a five AM body clock time or something like that for them do you think that's going to do that because when I looked at the spread Charlie and I saw that the charges were only favorite by six and a half\nI immediately wanted to hop on that because I'm like Tennessee does I think I'd like less than a hundred and fifty total yards last week granted there was a a you know just a really good what do you see the chargers with the time change how big of a factor do you think that's going to be into UCLA dominating this one\nLA's much better football team and you would like that matchup plenty especially against the you know titans off on the line I just eat a little uh eleven fact the Baltimore [noise] um you know it's hard to give any team\nOr a particular advantage in those London [noise] ah you know teams don't really know outside of Jacksonville teams don't really know how to prepare for that I gained ... you know properly\nAnd you know they they talk to I mean they they certainly call up you know Jacksonville and [noise] you know hey how ... how do you guys do it with you know stuff like ... and everything else but you know it it's definitely you know the different\nYou know and I don't think anybody has particular advantage so with that you would think the better team would have an advantage and that certainly is the chargers those [laughter] yeah I keep wanting to say San Diego\nAnd I don't know how many years they're going to have to be an ally for me to actually get out of my system but um\nYou know I think it will be closer than you know or I don't think it'll be a blow out I think it may be a one scored game tendency decent is still pretty darn good\nI'm Glad I did but the chargers are really coming into their own right now [noise] you know I I picked him to win the super bowl this year ... before the season started and their outlook in like the team right now by Melvin Gordon are really under rated running back and\nThey pretty much you can do everything in the past the game wherever it's having a a low key grape seeds and another one\nI'm like I said low key great because it's really true and and when it comes to the chargers they are doing the opposite that they're they're hot at the beginning of the year who knows if they can sustain it yeah I actually sat down to just to pick up it was just an app Charlie joining us on the dot com hotline let's go to the St at raising\nGreat defense versus green often look we don't see consistently Greek deep into the league\nExcept for really one team and that's the Baltimore Ravens things obviously aren't dynamic often what kids who do you think wins this game [noise]\nYou know I I like Baltimore in this game um [noise]\nYou know they get it right now you're Flaco is playing really good football\nAs he mentioned that that these on the plane well right now and ... it it doesn't even matter the personnel that Baltimore throws out there they're they're really solid on defense every single year and it really in the last few years when they've you know had the kind of poor wouldn't last strike or this thing could be off\nPutting that defense in bad positions right now they're playing a little bit better off as they finally have guys like a catch ... polar paths which\nYou know certainly help on joke wacko out I like about ... over the over the states and that one [laughter] um I\nI just I don't quite believe in the same house you know it was bright out against the good defense I don't believe in them outside of the don't\nYeah I'd look they ... been great at home but struggle on the road sometime Charlie Bernstein is our guest\nCovers the NFL you can follow Charlie's work on the winter and NFL Charlie so we're located down here in Houston huge game coming up\nTo three ... again these are like we were talking about the the charge to tell you this is really a game of two teams to suppose that they seem to be going in opposite directions down the tax it's often siblings have not looked good I was at the Texas game last weekend I mean they're off into the wind is still example I think I saw I sat on Twitter so this week\nThey let the Sean walk to get hit Seventy times this year and the second highest in terms of the team that gives us the most to their quarterback I think it's like forty nine Twenty one discrepancy between the two now they'll play the jaguars do you see what is wrong with the Jacksonville Jaguars steep and you see that being able to get to watch in this week\nBut if they can't get to watch some of that off on the line who they're never going to you know I I mean that was that and also I could lie to Houston as there isn't a league or they should get to them but\nYou know when you when you look at the match up you know I don't want to see similar team to Dallas last week there just crashed on them\nBut you have a better quarterback I think it and she was putting that you do in Dallas\nAnd better weapons on the outside the jaguars struggle with mobile quarterback and they struggle the last two weeks of mobile quarterbacks I don't know if that changes I mean we're gonna have to see you know a lot of you know boots and [noise] you know moving the pocket\nWhich I think below Brian is capable of of drawing up but that's what the Texans are going to do in that game but I tell you what a another surprise or line that really really surprises me between Jacksonville favor by five and that one\nOr the cowboys Redskins game this week I Believe the pick them I think it's Dallas minus one if my memory serves me correctly\nBut that would be honestly man I don't trust the cowboys I don't\nUh you got one week and you got cold Beasley nine\nCatches a hundred yards as soon as I said I Am totally with Charlie I Need to see two weeks nine and to see three weeks before I go to vet the dot com and put some of that money down [noise] are you with me\nAs as as the money ... ... oh

be focusing them two thousand ah yeah that's true but he likes\nThose older played by let's talk about the game\nNew England patriots\nTend to bears bounce back defensively\nThey last ... last week Bobby\nOver the\n... the the bears with three different teams up\nYou didn't do this okay well I Know well you know everything here I don't know I'm not no encyclopedias\nYou are that the exact court I was going to use ... look I just sit here I Try\nAnd entertained you're the brains behind the operation okay I knew ... would do that yeah ...\nBeaten the bears with three different that I don't know what that says Bora the bears can't game plan for ... or ... can't stay on one team I I like honestly I don't know what that means okay let's get patriots will the bears big able to get a pass rush for me it's that simple okay the patriots like it's so difficult for teams to get\nPass Russia's on them because the balls outta ... his hands and like one and a half a second but here's the thing Sony Michel again something that show the X factor well they'll be able to run the boss will the bears have to press in the box to be forced to respect the ... that's what has made the patriots so good over the last three games in my opinion about it\nThey are forcing teams to respect the run in between the tackled not the backs catching the ball out of the back bill I Can't go against what they did this last year started off the wall and then they ripped off like eight in a row do until they lose I'm rolling patriots every single week\nYeah I Will roll with the patriots but I'll take the under I I just think it will be a an old school defensive type game I make a little mad mates make stem bears beef is a lot better\nAgain though don't you feel like Bella chat will game plan to get the ball out to to neutralize ...\nLost to\nCome up with anybody wants to us so [noise]\nWhatever ... or ... or something but what about what\nThe ... game plan for ... that I'm pretty sure he doesn't really make a little bit I mean I say there are a threat but\nIt's just it would be a situation where other players on the bed because we'll have to because ... will probably be double seemed a lot yeah\nSo I mean it's it's a it's going to be a good defense of game I think it will be a great difference to get hired so Bobby's taken the under\nI when we come back we'll get into a college football weekend become big time matchup specifically in the state of Michigan do denied on expedition radio\nIs sports right this is what\nI'm saying with the Aaron Rodgers for leave that no I just think that when you look at\nThe defense cause is CJ Beth and then I understand I Can't count Shanahan is one of the best young off into minds in the NFL today but if you look at Aaron Rodgers defense each each it didn't him not being a hundred percent and he's not\nGoing to be a hundred percent the rest of the year that I really think the difference is probably going to come back to bite them in the ass and I don't know what I mean even if you look at the division that they plan you look at the Chicago Bears I'm looking at the minutes\nWe're gonna come back to bite them and ask and I don't know what I mean even if you look at the division that they plan you look at the Chicago Bears\nI'm looking at the Minnesota I'm Still going to think I Would like to see and give Minnesota the benefit

L. we've talked fantasy football yesterday suit gambling tonight with Greg Peter sort of a high five super contest podcast\nAnd that's gold with Steve heightened air you can follow all of Greg's work on Twitter at ... unit underscore eighty one All right Greg let's start with\nQuestion that I tweeted you earlier this week because I was genuinely\nYou can follow all of grants work on Twitter edgy unit underscore eighty one All right Greg let's start with a\nQuestion that I tweeted you earlier this week because I was genuinely interested in this game and I am still I I Want an explanation because I don't understand why the Kansas City chiefs Cincinnati Bengals blind\nInstead of just said it was six and a half into line I'm looking at now has moved down to six I think Kansas City should be favored by more in this game I put this is my luck of the week simply because I I can just sit in arrowhead\nI don't trust Andy Dalton than Marvin Louis that combination just yet why is this point only six Cincinnati in Kansas City\nHonestly I think this is a very fair line because if you take a look at it with the book bankers are saying is Kansas City is three points better than the Cincinnati Bengals on a neutral field you typically get Breezy Point to a home team that gives Kansas City is right now ...\nAbout three points better if you play that something like North Pole last or whatever but I mean I think that that's actually quite a good wind because you take a look at the Kansas City chiefs\nThey had been very very good that fear that played the game obviously they had that a lot to get into New England patriots hatred start playing to ending football they're that close call against the Denver Broncos as well now they do have some just absolute scheming this fear that flew on the chargers they absolutely\nAre dismantled the Jacksonville Jaguars a couple of weeks ago but with that said the Bengals are also playing some good football a lot of heartbreak or last week and before that this Spring Hill seem had been role and so I think that a six points is a very fair line\nIt's a fair point to make because they did beat the Broncos by four points are the only lost to the patriots by three beat the Steelers by five points they have them in close game this is ... after I consulted you Greg I did teasing down along with another game here the Tennessee Titans now this one I'm really interested as well Tennessee change in London\nGoing to take on the Los Angeles chargers both off fences here trending in opposite directions I Love everything about the chargers right now\nPhilip Rivers on a roll these wide receivers orange sake\nBut what do you make of the line because this game is being played overseas I I tried to do the calculation I could have been wrong great but I had it as the chargers playing this game like five AM\nBody clock time so how much of a factor does that play and the fact that this game is in London\nOr this is actually going to be six thirty AM specific time which is what the chargers are\nBut they're not something you need to take into account year he charger of last week play their game in Cleveland and they did not believe the eastern time though oh no they censoring got three hours right there so this will be a little bit less ... game the Tennessee Titans are coming in from Nashville to actually be an hour behind\nThe Los Angeles chargers which is crazy when you put it on the surface but I mean I Would that said I still think that stick to that point is too many points in that spot because they take a look battalions\nThey were absolutely awful last week against Wal Mart raven\nMarquez Mario to got sacked eleven times before that point he had been sacked nine times in the team for five game I think that this is actually good bounce back pain we've seen the Chinese do a great work as an underdog\nThere were a whole underdog a few weeks ago and they played against Philadelphia Eagles won that came out right in overtime and we've seen in the London games that it's all over the top of the teams the patch just because the field is just\nAll yucky if completely breaks down so I you take a look at teams that run the ball a little bit more and I actually think that that's a little bit more of a stalemate because they've gotten Henry and company for the ah Tennessee Kay\nMeeting for the Los Angeles chargers obviously smells and Gore the third that'll be carrying the mail for that team do I actually look for a little bit of a lower scoring sloppy or game but it's a result\nInteresting ...

I I Want to see on during the ... one of the game and once it was found out that bronchitis while there was going to be starting I was feeling very confident about that than all of a sudden a whole bunch of ... points started to be going\nSo well this is an often simply one game that I really like in terms of the over as the Cleveland Browns and the Tampa Bay buccaneers what are your thoughts on that and what are you so much as some uh some of your favorite overseas when you look at the landscape of games this weekend\nRight now I'm seeing a total of fifty and a half in that game and this is my favorite over because I Love rates that they have a baby buccaneers have a pretty good often no matter of fact Seamus Winston or if it's alright fitzpatrick in there they moving the ball they've been preparing for I\nMean a makeup and ... we've seen gee the Sean jak there really have a little bit of a a career resurgence this year after you add a little bit off your last year which yet section and the the buccaneers can't stop\nAnd does I mean I speak our if I get to talk of\nLast week they gave up a whole bunch of ... in a game against the uh Chicago Bears they allowed Mitchell Trybulski to throw for five touchdowns in one house\nSomething that they often done by a quarterback of the Chicago Bears in a bowl game and like Thirty years\nIt was absolutely insane so and the ... the defense is awful and that was the Cleveland Browns they've hit or miss because keep in mind are two weeks ago against the Baltimore Ravens they did not give up a single touchdown and overtime game\nThen they got completely house by the Los Angeles chargers and the week before that they gave up a whole Bush will point to the old putting writers who look completely in up to in London last week so I mean it's very hard to make anything else and brown\nSo I Would side with you on the over in the spots\nSpeaking of ineptness that is the Jacksonville Jaguars right now why are they five points favorites against the Texans\nIt seems\nTo me it's because you just don't know what to expect out of the Houston Texans at this point now they didn't get a nice way to get the Indianapolis Colts a couple of weeks ago\nBut that's because the colds substantially throwaway Taiwan borrow and you know for them for situation right around mid deal they didn't converted and that gave the taxes are sexually but we're not a silver platter they're looking at the field oh they're\nBad and I swear it against the Dallas Cowboys as well on Sunday Night Football\nBut this team despite the fact that they got the job done against the bill is because they take ... third too\nAwful interceptions late night game I in the terrible well bill nearly knock them off last week I still don't know or to make out the Texans and keep in mind the Jacksonville Jaguars or just a couple of weeks ago looked like the last of the AFC after they completely pounded the patriots\nThey follow that up with a nice went over the object I feel like we're getting into a little bit too much of a recent she biased because\nI mean why it's two law says that the that the J ... against the Dallas Cowboys and which I got just completely Spanish\nAnd then we get to the Kansas City chiefs and once you they just had no chance stopping that run game yeah I mean they were bad losses but with that said as long as the Jacksonville Jaguars don't get into a situation where they need to put it all boils down to have him come back provide it\nWhat was that said as long as the Jacksonville Jaguars do get into a
