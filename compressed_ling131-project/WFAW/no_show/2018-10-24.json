not going to get the right answer the right answer is thirty two thirty two\nWe just started game one of the world series the red Sox have played two series so far and thirty two of their runs have

is over the night with men here I'm On SB Nation radio on the radio downtown\nRio Riley auto parts studios here's Matt hair of pan welcome back into this over the night as the nation radio Matt Harris back with us jumped in to see and be a with Josh ... of the magazine you can follow Josh is working on Twitter\nJosh Josh everyone's freaking out of the Los Angeles Lakers specifically Lakers fans and the and the brawn James ... free throws their own three\nI think they've had a pretty good source of the season considering that this is a brand new team the brawn James coming in and they're just young and they don't have that many three point shooters how would you evaluate the Lakers\nStarts of the season\nYeah I'm I'm gonna just hold off from jumping in either direction and I think ... people should do that but this was to be expected when you think about\nThe Miami Heat or with Chris Chris Bosh and Wade LeBron James that team had a bumpy start and they were a lot more talented and there were a week in a weaker conference this was always going to happen\nOr the Lakers were always going to have a rough patch maybe they didn't expect to come out oh and three\nThey probably didn't expect the whole kerfuffle but they had this week but it was going to be part of the deal they're young they're new to come together\nBut wait LeBron plays basketball kind of force everybody to adjust to a very different from what they've had I don't think any Richard panic but the fact that they are oh and three um it is a little worrisome just because you don't get the same slap you that you do you mean\nNo doubt about it do do you think John Hart is going to be able to keep up the play that he's had so far and it's so windy as we can we expect to do to be inserted into the starting line up I Would think it'd be pretty soon\nI Would think soon as well ... ... ... ... ... like LeBron wants to do well and and we heard that LeBron is going to play off Baltimore and we heard that he was going to be more of the false score shooter but\nYou know here we are and Roger and Rhonda suspended Brennan Ingram suspended lungs are balls were was way back into line up and heart is the tree and the guy on that team and and I just think he is the most natural fit on that team was the prime James and I think we're seeing her in the starting lineup sooner rather than later\nJohn ... is our guest covers the NBA for who magazine you can follow justice work on Twitter at ... so what did you make of this suspension did you think that that way each guy got the proper amount of games and that granted named ... honestly got a little bit more than he did but it was just what were your thoughts in terms of the punishments after that Scrabble\nUm [noise] you know what it felt a little like um\nIf that had been shall Mickey\nLand Steven ... and James ... and that's I think we're looking at\nFifteen twelve and twelve or Fifteen twelve and ten\nI think the fact that Chris paused president that he's a star that Russia Iran does a starting point guard on leave us talk Thirteen um I think that was why was it was it was and it's pretty crazy that you can you know throw punches and today's NBA ...\n... cause that kind of a mess and only get two or three games I think the league when white and I think they might regret not sending a message here yeah later in the season\nNo I'm totally with you what are your thoughts on the Utah Jazz I Know it's so early in the season that it's very hard to you know look at one or two games and just jump all over him but\nI was watching this warriors jazz game on friday night Josh and I was just so incredibly impressed with Utah ability to hang in there I liked the roster but then they turn around and they lose to the grizzly what are you ... what can we expect from the jazz this year and what do you think they're stealing is do you think they could get as high as it three or four seats this year in the west\nYeah I I think four or five I Can't remember where I had them one of those two\nThis team is going to be so good the ... I mean they're going to be so good defensively like everyone else they're working out the kinks\nBut when they had eighty something points eighty one\nHalf in school and they just blown away if they if they are often can produce like that\nOr you know occasionally not even on a nightly basis they're going to be a scary the and I think a guy like Joe ... who can bring the ball or who's just a refill sniper pretty under rated Donovan Mitchell adds another layer to his game and they finally get something done to eggs and\nI see no reason why they don't finish four or five\nJohn ... is our guest is who magazine you can follow his work once winter Josh Everly a Josh ... you're on the dot com hotline CSI dot com came out with some odd to the very beginning of the season\nIn terms of who would be traded or is the guy he they they listed a couple of guys and then they said would they be traded yes or no Anthony Davis was on that list Jimmy bought Lewis on that list ... Leonard was on that list\nOf those three people write their Anthony Davis coy Leonard and Jimmy Butler who is the least likely chance of being treated this year do you think\nI think Anthony Davis I think the pelicans um are are committed to um they've got no real reason to feel um they've come out of the gates absolutely firing a you know for as much as people like to speculate and think he's unhappy then we got we haven't really heard anything concrete like that from his camp I think David the safest bet those\nGroups and whatnot so why Leonard I Know you know your um your contributor for MBA Canada's well\nYou know it looks like I Can't see him being treated really either and I know it's early therefore no and I know that ... has indicated that he wants to be out in Los Angeles not that the Lakers this nearly but the clippers possibly\nBut I mean it did work like it looks like it's working right now in Toronto first let me ask you this how surprised that it took so quickly for this team to match dot fence of lead the way that they have\nDo you see ... Leonard\n... I mean if it continues like this towards the trade deadline they're not going to get rid of them right\nNo I mean there there was a scenario where this\nDidn't work out ... bunk beds and it got out into the tabloids and that then that tension group or the raptors had a really bad structure games that deadline and you know they panic in the ... I think there are scenarios where it could have happened but it just it always seemed unlikely you know the raptors knew\nIt was what it was there and try to be competitive they were so among the city they were going to give them this year to try and sell themselves to him and and part of that thing we can be a competitive team they were fifty nine when team or the Marta rose and you know ... is there any green\nThey're very good team they could talk about this year they legitimately could be in the NBA Finals were quiet Leonard possibly winning and MVP I mean they have a package to sell them and and and just simply like the plug and play of of droves now quite Leonard and has been seamless so far so I I don't really think it's likely\nThrough four games do you say that the plug and play it's been seamless who overall do you think and I know it's tough there was only four games while entered but who overall do you think it's going to be the more productive play or do you think the rafters absolutely without hesitation\nThey won this trade in terms of bringing Hawaiian and leaving demar\nYeah you know I I Do I mean I I don't even think it's like remotely close guy\nIn Hawaii and and leaving demar\nYeah you know I I Do I mean I I don't even think it's like remotely close okay I\nHere's the thing with the Marta rose in the other night he obviously has a theory to aid for change that line Los Angeles is a very good game he's a very\nTalented basketball player and and I'm a very stats driven individual I think of it on your show a few times when you see my tweets yeah a ... like honestly I I I Try very hard not to let feelings that emotion and I just believe in but I have never seen the player\nPlayed down like the martyr Rosen has in the playoffs last year's key is unbelievable is just an unbelievable drop of production when it really matters and I think Toronto was done with a you're not even quite walks we're out from his deal and we're not relying on him when accounts and I and I honestly think that's a win is on its own\nJosh several years our gas who magazine also then be Canada you can follow all of Josh his work on Twitter\nAt Josh Emily how's Boston right now they did it three you know I think the honest under the Google was a legitimate and VP candidate this year I just in terms of ways value to the blocks in just a I think you can put up monsters numbers consistently throughout the season\nThat's really dumb you go to bed at the outset of comedy and get a one hundred twenty five percent bonus by using the ... when one twenty bucks Bobby\nI was looking at his son's roster and you know I'm an NBA or like just a sports nerd as you are this is fun team like if you just look at a roster Devin Booker or as you heard Josh say there could definitely be the leading score you know he could at the in terms of points per game that I can do it all\n... ... as I've gotten up to a nice start\nAnd then he got like a college all star team kind of with like Josh jacket and Mike help bridges in their Kansas Daria Villanova star Michael British did he went player of the year last year the Villanova he might it was up there to either him or somebody else obviously in the field\nAnd then you have like these greedy veteran you have Ryan ...\nOkay I'm not going to say right edited Trevor ...

Gurley three more touchdowns last week okay Jared Gadhafi not a system quarterback and you're still saying that go watch the game [noise] okay so this rams team rolling on all cylinders [noise] I don't I mean who are they going to lose two\nHow do you game plan for that I don't\nBut the rams to me are clearly my top teams\nAre so Bobby let's have a discussion about this now uh I think you know we ... I did I say ... clearly my top team you know in college football there is a clear number one we've talked about this a lot it's Alabama\nAre you willing to put either the cheese to the patriots in here number one with the Los Angeles ran I Am not I'm going to stay the rams like Alabama or in a here by themselves when we're hearing the NFL\nBut I Do think the difference between tear one end here too\nIs a lot closer in the NFL than it is college football I think Alabama is miles above Clemson not miles about okay they're like one mile to the I don't know who really knows okay we'll see against LSU but there is significant difference between Alabama and clubs in and then I think there's a lot of difference between Clinton\nAnd the Notre Dame LSU things will come in first and college football\nBut are you with me the LA's in a class by themselves but it's not really that big of a difference between them and the chief of the Patriot\nAct that are most complete to him and then as soon as we say last week even though they're playing the forty niners you got the sea air Donald get out there and get through section ... really it was a victim in just being his presence I mean he had like fifty yards and touchdown and perceptions but I\nYeah LA's then that's their by themselves and I mean a cheese or their their defense has come a long way don't season yeah long well\nOkay let's pull the one that they played one pretty good game\nTo who was the star wars jaguars the first here with the jaguars and the second one of those men go I'm not willing to put\nThe jaguars as a real game in terms of we're proving were good have you seen the jaguars often play portals as pathetic they have no run again their office of line is in shambles so I I get the chiefs play well I'm not disagreeing with you but I'm not going to point to that\nAs evidence that the chiefs are now a defense on the rise again one game to me could be classified as a fluke two games a trend I'm not quite with you there who said she said this week do we know\nAre not exactly how\nTo okay I'll go to the Brooklyn okay so that she used to have the Broncos is a team that they played tight with okay in the first game All right so what I I'm I think that she said they they definitely made strides in Cincinnati I Want to see too good consecutive games okay but but if it's O L a class by themselves\nTo your number two for me is patriots and the ... and then I'll work the same to tear number three or I Will put the Vikings interior number three in the chargers into your number three\nAnd I'm going to then I have a drop off from there I have the ravens the Panthers here number for the Steelers to me are interesting this is the team that is kind of looming in here for threatening to get to tear three or tier two and the reason\nIs because ... week is it that way of you know bell is probably going to come back if he wants to make any kind of money this year I think it's like we had\nOur way beyond bell to me will be back at some point keeping my lady on bells going to be fresh okay I don't know you know people talk about oh is he in football state okay guys you know he's he's working out okay he's gonna be the people were banked up you know by we nine weeks\nOh is he in football state of the guys you know he's he's working out okay he's gonna be the people banked up you know by we nine we can we start seeing injury leave me on bills going to come to edit it might not be for Pittsburgh\nBut you know there's Toxie might be traded the Philadelphia I think you know the longer he hold down the west of a chance he's actually going to get ...

nation radio\nLeo ... studios here's Matt Harris and welcome back over the night SB Nation radio Matt Harris back with you let's jump into college football was Jerry Thomas ... football for CBS Sports you can follow all of Jerry worked on Twitter\nThat Jacey Paul CBS sorry Jerry I Know you're a producer boiler makers fan so let's start with that game last weekend that was obviously exciting as a boiler makers fan but\nVery alarming I think if you are an Ohio State fan what do you think is the most alarming thing to be thinking about right now if you are an Ohio State than moving forward with the C\n... give you two things uh one does it produce moved up and down the field on you and you know Ohio the the friends of mine I thought played well and what they call for the most\nPart to get him in a pretty backfield into Trump's someplace but when that did happen are pretty they will make a lot of play to get for bankers enough back in the area especially the passing game but even then later in the second half of the game then and I think that that's a problem and then the second one that you can't run the football\nYou know produce the fence is not bad for run not the best they're going to the this year against Iran but couldn't stop them and they have to ask you throw the ball sent them three times yeah which blew away at school record\nIn fact I think they announced it early the third quarter the you'd already passed will record in nearly doubled and there was a that is not good it's a situation for Ohio State can be worked there that should be one or the passes for now\nDo you think the next those the injury is going to do you how much how much of an effect on the defensive line I I mean I I think was just awful especially in the second half unable to stop there I mean those runs were just basically untouched from from long way away for Perdue able to get those those cuts down do you think Ohio State defensive line has worries moving so far without boso\nNo I think that's the only functional unit on that side of the fall I thought there to play with that problem in the game was that when they did get brutal wine linebackers couldn't do anything about it it was secondary could do anything about it than I can you know each doctor cash them for forty hour and forty two yard\nWork worry right behind the line I mean that's kind of all the linebacker it and stuff those plays and nobody was there to do it and it gets um you know I think those are the jury obviously you know he's a great player\nBut I think the line you know the three units align linebacker secondary on the line is playing by far the best\nJerry ... is our guest covers the college football for CBS Sports you can follow Jerry's work on Twitter regime CBS so Michigan now number five in the country they force Michigan state's quarterback five twenty five or sixty six yards now if you forecast this Michigan Ohio State game\nObviously doing Haskins in Ohio State they like to throw the football they have struggles running the boss who would you favor in that game right now\nOh the Michigan right now I mean we'll see what happens in a month but if they were having a play this week even Columbus which is where they will play a Thanksgiving week it's a it's an issue that the ministry turn right now\nAnd by how far is it like how like Michigan yeah go ahead\nYeah I mean I don't I don't know who number two is I mean from Wisconsin they Ronald them uh it doesn't really look like a little higher than probably still affected their team I just think that Michigan at least touch down paper against them right now even the Columbus\nIf we go to the SEC we got a big match up coming up with Florida and Georgia obviously number nine versus number seven but what are you looking for early with that match up\n[noise] [noise] well I think that the uh the huge game obviously propose then you know you're pretty much out of the the the eighth grade or if you lose the game and and and pretty much a limited also from a playoff as well so\nYou know it's a it's a big in Georgia got bounced back really from the ... I'm Sorry oh let's see your game I don't know why they don't roll 'em\nBut ah the LSU game you know or they really got to hand it to them and you know this is another chance against the good opponent big rival and I've been a big environment and uh yeah it's a it's it's a bounce back gate for Georgia they really need to win because a lot of people think\nThis is between the court to challenge Alabama they're not even going to get a chance to begin with this is\nNo question about it when you look at Alabama how far do you think they are from the rest of the crop because Alabama I think you could make the argument that they have not really played anybody that that you know ... that well get um do you see LSU realistically down the road giving them any kind of a game\nYeah sure I mean it was only will at some point I mean they're not at a healthy so you know somebody somebody can give them again if you get the next shot at him they get to play them at home and he was played as well as anybody against the toughest canceled anybody white so far in college football so\nYeah I I think ah until Alabama runs about a death valley that but it's you know that's the theme of\nBest chance the ghetto Jerry calling us our gas ...\nYeah I I think a until Alabama runs about a death valley that's the that's you know that's the theme of the best chance to get him\nJerry calling us our gas ... football for CBS Sports you can follow the series work on ... people on CBS still Alabama obviously has gotten off the tremendously fast starts they seized and\nIf you want to say Alabama and I know it's tough because they aren't that good they want to act like they have a weakness that could be exposed is there a weakness on Alabama that you could see\nI don't think we have a pretty good enough to try and exploit from I mean I'm not the in it but it they're not being tested\nSo it's it's hard to spot a weakness when you know there's just something I mean can you hear the barricades were funny and weak different practice when the ... the cop units go against each other and it's hard to see what's going on with the competition and white spots\nWhen it comes to the rest of the day the top twenty five specifically let's look at this number three two in the country Notre Dame I've been really high on a Notre Dame but I I you know that that went against Pittsburgh obviously was not very convincing at all where are you with Notre Dame in terms of them being legitimate top three team their number three in the country right now\nWell I think that they're losing their top type team and it's certainly until somebody beat them you know there are a playoff team and I don't know who's left on their schedule that can't beat them up he gave him a good run\nAre made of work for a book deal with the change to quarterback or the ... in the quarterback is really made that often it's much more dynamic it wasn't so much a against Pittsburgh and now they get they do this week was always kind of a lot in quite\nA bit Notre Dame and get to see it on the town last year by their standard though you know they should have a pretty easy going things you would think against maybe this week it and maybe they can get that often you know going again effort kinds of different performance gets there first\nSo on the road for navy northwestern at home than Florida State Syracuse USC is it fair to me to say that if I'm going to put a loss on Notre Dame schedule that it would be USC at the end of the year would that be the most profitable seemed to be Notre Dame do you think\nYeah this isn't a road game this late by the way it's neutral gonna go um yes I Would say that the best chance for Notre Dame to take off their rivalry game at the end of the the the\nEr at us the three times on road game I I it's a and did you see pretty good and obviously they he be healthy quarterback if they had the chance to compete with Notre Dame and they're kind of see it that position at least for this week\nBased off what we've seen from Notre Dame and these unconvincing when specifically against Pittsburgh how Michigan has played ... if you want to put Notre Dame and Michigan on a neutral feel I Know what happened we want to Notre Dame but if we were to put Notre Dame and Michigan on a neutral field right now who do you think would win that game and why\nUh I think that they should get in probably would because of all the momentum may have right now I think they're\nThey're better off than ... than they were when they played on a daily il week one kind of half you're still working things out both teams were and obviously Notre Dame of James quarterback since that uh but I Would I Would get Michigan a slight edge in that game or it if for no other reason they don't have to play that Notre Dame\nTeam that I really do look college football this weekend that we don't have that many great matchups Washington state at Stanford I never fourteen at number twenty four there but I'm\nA I'll ask you I asked Jerry palm surprise team of the year so far in college football he went with Kentucky and I I think it's hard to go against that Kentucky at number twelve in the country right now I think it's hard to top that bought me this goes back to my point that I was making yesterday\nThe general field of college football teams is down this year in turn like when the NFL okay we have\nPatriots chiefs rams St chargers\nAll really good team really good teams are not so sure that Notre Dame\nNow is a really good team there the number three team of the country\nAre not so sure that LSU is a really good team at\nNumber four icy college football as it down here just in terms of the overall pool of how many good teams are there couldn't talk he's number twelve ... safer for

seventh inning Joe Buck on Fox Sports television at the time of that home run the score was five for Boston and granted in the top of the ... the Dodgers had the bases loaded for the guy that they want the bases loaded for\nMany Machado one out bases loaded score a five to three Alex Cora takes the risks and the guy who loaded the bases the relief pitcher I think his name as ... here I probably pronouncing that relief pitchers name wrong for Boston he was left on them out and many Machado\nWas only able to have a ball hit off the very interior of the ... close to the handle sacrifice fly only one runs scored on the bases loaded one out opportunity but the Dodgers in the top of the seventh day\nSo the score is five to four going under the bottom of the seventh and then that happened by the way again I've just been pressing as point on I I just think it's just so it it just championship teams do this\nThirty two runs now thirty two runs in the playoffs have been scored\nWith two outs that is absolutely incredible and the red Sox just continue to do it\nBut I Will say this could have gotten out to a lot bigger lead early\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers were down to nothing early on the ball game uh Chris Sale calms down and Chris sales kind of well I should say this Clinton Kirsch always hit a little bit in that first inning to runs given up you got to run or on second base score already won nothing nobody out\nThere that could've been a disastrous first inning for the Los Angeles Dodgers so\nThey only give up the two runs credit for coming back and I think we're going to get

chance to sit down and watch great\nWe're going to do that I'm like a friday night you and me okay but in the second movie okay there's a scene where this guy's in jail and Kumar goes in jail or heroin goes in jail one of them goes in jail and the guy says the universe tend to unfold as it should\nAnd that ultimately what has happened I think in baseball this year the red Sox should it be in the ass does because Boston was the better team Milwaukee was trying to piece together wins with relief pitchers and the Dodgers should've beat them as Harold Kumar says\nThe universe tends to unfold as it should so I think we're going to have a great world series Bobby I really really do Red Sox and Dodgers game to coming off tonight David Price on the mound for Boston engine room on the mountain Los Angeles what are we going to see how to David Price tonight okay we've seen bad David Price\nHinge unreal on about the Los Angeles\nWhat are we going to see how to David Price tonight okay we've seen bad David Price against the New York Yankees earlier this year the play offs okay so the point where when he got back to New York that game was pitch their boss and he got booed off the amount of Boston when he only lasted three at it and then when he came back to New York they were chanting they\nPay they pay in New York\nOkay they were giving David Price a standing ovation and chanting of BP then in game five against the Houston Astros it comes down and it was absolutely dynamic so what are we going to say\nWhat are we going to the Dodgers have a great one okay but if the red socks look if the red Sox go but I'm not convinced Bobby that the Dodgers can't rip off all three of their games at home\nOkay the ... just because the debts of Boston pitching\nIt when it comes to the starting pitching I don't really trust a poor cell oh\nOkay I I just I just I could see the Dodgers ripping off three in this game too is a very important that they're all important okay it's cliche to say that\nBut it's it's David ... what are you going to get out of David ... very curious to see it but the red Sox win game number one night and we all get free tacos and I put catch up on by All right when we come back\n... well that would be does joellen bead things after the game again today it's over than it\nIs three to eat just so bad the Yankees game wildcard game some idiot posted a video that\nIs of a person deliberately throwing a beer at a span right after the Yankees won the world right now you have a\nVery big on the wildcard oh it was a ... have you on the while they were acting like the one of the world series I don't want to say all Yankee fans far ski\nBag slowly Lenny Bruce beer for the workers from the beginnings and we do apparently work with some ... Yankee fans but who we wouldn't ... Gore is when the world series filming told me about all your rings and\nThen we go swimming even within Patrick you know and then yeah wild\nStores baby yeah he seemed to have to act like you've been here before\nThat's the thing the Yankee fans my age do celebrate\nWild scars extreme heat with Patrick graces we'd be after news it five eastern on SB Nation radio\nYou know the latest news actually break down your favorite is filled with has to do with ... three coverage of the south from\nAll dollars from the jungle the forty niners from ... also says fighters and drive five yesterday was\nBothered by this or wherever you listen to your body relations\nIs a force bride\nWhen I'll say with Aaron Rodgers before I leave that no [laughter] I just think that when you look at\nThe defense because you've seen the best and then I'm just saying I keep seeing couch and he and his one of the best young officers in mind in the NFL today [laughter]\nBut if you look at Aaron Rodgers defense each each it's in him not being a hundred percent and he's not going to be a hundred percent the rest of the year that I really think the difference was probably going to come back to bite them and ask and I don't know what I mean even if you look at the division that they plan you look at the Chicago Bears\nI'm looking at the Minnesota Vikings I'm Still going to think I Would like to see you Minnesota the benefit of the doubt because they won the division team last year the Minnesota is still the better team the best team in that division talent wise on both sides of the bomb Chicago is right there on them\nTune into the sports right now we have from three to buy me sir and not only on as a nation radio\nMadness my year ...

was a there there was a there there's a number that was you know kind of put up there on the screen that I watch it in front of me that the Packers next\nTo opponents are next three opponents to have a combined twenty wins right now okay I I don't believe in the dolphins okay the the Packers they're going to be playing the dolphins I'm coming up on November eleventh but here in the Packers next to games good luck on the road for the rams on the road for the patriots\nTough tough places to play those are my top two teams in the NFL power records but having said that I\nKind of disagree with the ...\nBecause they were talking about how the Green Bay Packers defense could be a liability well statistically the Packers deep and says not been a liability this year\nThey're eight in total defence when it comes to yards per game they only give up three hundred and twenty yards again back to eighth of a leak and their fifth against the past the Green Bay Packers are\nOkay and you know who really cares against the run by the way do you know who the number one team against the run is this year\nAnd this is going to shock you this is going to blow you away who is giving up the least amount of yards against the run this year\nI'm just take a stab take a step up let's go no they're they're good team but traditionally bad defense that's your hand smoker oh good to embody the cheese no no the

Harris adolescent\nBack in the states over the night as the nation radio Matt Harris back with us jumps in to see and be a with Josh ... magazine you can follow Josh his work on Twitter ...\nAll right Josh everyone's freaking out over the Los Angeles Lakers specifically Lakers fan and and the brawn James is free throws their own three I think they've had a pretty good start to the season considering that this is a brand new team the brawn James coming in\nAnd they're just young and they don't have that many three point shooters how would you evaluate the Lakers starts of the season [noise] yeah I'm\nI'm going to hold off from jumping in either direction and I think more people should do that that this will be bringing things about the Miami Heat or a Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade LeBron James that team had a bump start and they were a lot more talented than ever are we in a weaker conference that was always going to happen\nOr the Lakers were always going to have a rough patch maybe they didn't expect to come out oh and three they probably didn't expect the whole kerfuffle but they had this week but it was going to be part of the deal they're young they're new to come together going abroad and play basketball kind of forces everybody to adjust to a very different from what they've had I don't think anyone should panic\nBut the fact that they are oh and three um is a little worrisome just because you don't get the same slap you that you do you mean\nNo doubt about it do do you think Josh heart is going to be able to keep up the play that he's had so far and it's so windy as we can we expect them to be inserted into the starting line up I Would think it'd be pretty soon\nI Would think feeling as well ... ... ... ... like ... wants to be a while and we heard that ... going to play a far more and we heard that he was going to be more of the score shooter or\nYou know here we are and Roger in Rhonda spend it burning room suspended longer all's work who's way back into line up and heart is the three and the guy on the team and and I just think he is the most natural fit on that seemed like the ... and I think we're seeing in the starting lineup sooner rather than later\nJohn ... is our guest covers the NBA for who magazine you can follow justice work on Twitter at ... so what did you make of this suspension did you think that that way each guy got the proper amount of games and I printed named ... honestly got a little bit more than he did it but it was just what were your thoughts in terms of the punishments after that Scrabble\nUm [noise] you know what it felt a little like\nUm if there had been ... e\nLance even in ... and that's I think we're looking at Fifteen twelve and twelve or Fifteen twelve and ten I think the fact that Chris Paul president the star there are drawn to the starting point guard on at least for Thirteen [noise] um I think that was why ... why is it was\nAnd it's pretty crazy that you can you know throw punches in today's NBA size up or a car cause that kind of a mess and only get two or three games I think the leak when white and I think they might regret not sending a message here yeah later in the you\nI'm totally with you what are your thoughts on the Utah Jazz I Know it's so early in the season that it's very hard to you\nCorrect not sending a message here yeah um later in the season\nNo I'm totally with you what are your thoughts on the Utah Jazz I Know it's so early in the season that it's very hard to you know look at one or two games in just jump all over him but I was watching this warriors jazz game on friday night Josh and I was just so incredibly impressed with Utah ability to hang in there I liked the roster but then they turn around and they lose\nTo the grizzly what do you what can we expect from the jazz this year and what do you think they're stealing is do you think they could get as high as it three or four seats this year in a way\nYeah I I think four or five I Can't remember where I had them one of those two\nThis team is going to be so good to ... I mean they're going to be so good defensively like everyone else they're working out the kinks but when they had eighty something points eighty one\nHalf working in school and they just blown away if they if they're often can produce like that\nOr you know occasionally not even on a nightly basis they're going to be a scary I mean I think a guy like Joe ... who can bring the ball up who's just the ... you still sniper pretty under rated Donovan Mitchell as another ... game and they finally get something done to them I see no reason why they don't finish four or five\nJohn ... is our guest is who magazine you can follow his work on Twitter and Josh Everly a\nJosh ... you're on the dot com hotline CSI dot com came out with some odd to the very beginning of the season in terms of who would be traded or as a guy ... they they listed a couple of guys and then they said would they be traded yes or no Anthony Davis was on that list Jimmy bought Lewis on that list ... Leonard was on that list of\nThose three people write their Anthony Davis ... and Jimmy Butler who was the least likely chance of being treated this year do you think\nI think Anthony Davis I think the pelicans um are are committed to um they've got no real reason to feel um they've come out of the gates absolutely firing a you know for as much as people like to speculate and think he's unhappy then we got we haven't really heard anything concrete like that from his camp I think David the safe stuff those\nGroups and whatnot so why Leonard I Know you know your um your contributor to offer NBA Canada's well\nYou know it looks like I see him being treated really either and I know it's early therefore no and I know that Cohen Leonard has indicated that he wants to be out in Los Angeles not that the Lakers this nearly the clippers possibly but I mean it\nDid work like it looks like it's working right now in Toronto first let me ask you this how surprised were you that it took so quickly for this team to mess up and to lead the way that they have\nDo you see ... Leonard\n... I mean if it continues like this towards the trade deadline they're not going to get rid of them right\nNo I mean there there was a scenario where this\nDidn't a war I'm ... I'm Ted's and it got out into the tabloids and that then that tension grew or the raptors had a really bad structure games that deadline and you know they panic in the ... I think there are scenarios where it could have happened but I guess it always seemed to unlikely you know the raptors new\nUh it was what it was they were going to be competitive they were going to sell them on the city they were going to give them this year to try and sell themselves to him and and part of that thing we can be a competitive team they were fifty nine when team where the Marta rose and you know ...\nThey're very good team they could talk about this year they legitimately could be in the NBA Finals was quiet Leonard possibly winning and MVP I mean they have a package to sell them and and and just simply like the plug and play of of throws now quite Leonard and has been seamless so far so I I don't really think it's likely\nThrough board games do you say that the plug and play it been seamless overall do you think and I know it's tough it was only four games local Y. Leonard's who overall do you think is going to be more productive play or do you think the raptors absolutely without hesitation they won this trade in terms of bringing ... and leaving demar\nYeah you know I\nI Do I mean I I don't even think it's like remotely close okay\nHere's the thing with the Marta rose in the other night he obviously as a thirty to aid for change that line Los Angeles is a very good game he's a very talented basketball player\nAnd and I'm a very stats driven individual I think of it on your show a few times and she she might treats yeah a ... like honestly I I Try very hard not to let feelings and emotions and I says well you didn't but I have never seen the player played down like the Marta rose and has in the playoffs last year's he is\nUnbelievable unbelievable drop of production when it really matters and I think Toronto was done with a yard even if Corey walks or from the deal and we're not relying on him when it counts and I and I honestly think that's a win is on its own\nJosh several years our gas to who magazine also then be Canada you can follow all of Josh his work on Twitter\nAt Josh Everly housing blocks right now they sit at three and I think you ought to some of the coup was a legitimate MVP candidate this year I just in terms of what his values to the bucks in just a I think he can put a monster sad numbers consistently throughout the season they tend to boss do you think realistically hold onto that Tuesday that they have\nSports book does you're going to win guy with all the best sports available NFL NC double a football major league baseball us the NBA much much more or any of these other sports books guess what you're getting a hundred percent bought us but a bet yes that outcome you can get a one hundred twenty five percent bonus\nOkay I got to do\nIs use the perma could win one twenty five I thought that was an interesting point just brought up regarding the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers\nHe kind of absurd and he's a staff got\nBig stack I follow him on Twitter he's always like ... you know interesting tidbits when it comes to statistics and at Boston does seem to have their number and and they you they they force it's true what he said there about four seat Benson image to shoot\nLike they make they they they play off of them this is what pop which does by the way to pop but it it just I don't know it's amazing to me how something as simple as playing off the fence image enforce any office to\nRun through and be why they can master I guess they have the player personnel but in theory shouldn't ... doing that\nI mean it's still like I tell you the guy like John wallet Derrick Rose was you know was it was you know they they worked on their jump shot that's what team did point guard with like in the paper as they get they were up at the top of the game we were all over the [noise]\n\nNine morning WMA W for napkins\nAnd online at nine forty W.

back with us jumped in to the end it be a with Josh Everly a coup a magazine you can follow Josh just work on Twitter sat Josh ever really All right Josh everyone's freaking out over the Los Angeles Lakers specifically Lakers beds\nAnd and LeBron James ... free throws their own three I think they've had a pretty good source of the season considering that this is a brand new team LeBron James coming in and they're just young and they don't have that many three point shooters how would you evaluate the Lakers start to the theater\nYeah I'm I'm gonna just hold on I'm jumping in either direction and I think the more people should do that it will be ... or do you think about the Miami Heat or record Chris Bosh and Wade in LeBron James that team had a bumpy start and there were a lot more talented than they were in a weaker conference\nThis was always going to happen uh the Lakers were always going to ever that maybe they didn't expect to come out oh and three\nThey probably didn't expect the whole kerfuffle but they have this week but it was going to be part of the deal they're young they're new to come together the way the Broncos are kind of horses everybody to adjust to bury her heart they've had I don't think anyone should panic\nBut that they are oh and three I'm a little worrisome just because of no way you don't get the same slap you that you do you mean\nNo doubt about it do do you think John Hart is going to be able to keep up the play that he's had so far and it's so windy as we can we expect them to be inserted into the starting lineup I Would think it'd be pretty soon\nI Would soon as well ... ... ... ... ... ... wants to do well and ...\nIt into the starting lineup I Would think it'd be pretty soon\nHe I I Would think soon as well Josh Josh ... ... ... ... like LeBron wants to do well and we heard that ... going to play off all more and we heard that he was going to be more of the ... falls score shooter but\nYou know here we are and Roger and Rhonda suspended burning room suspended longer balls were who's way back into line up and heart is the three in the guy on that team and and I just think he is the most natural fit on that team with the prime James and I think we'll see him and the starting lineup sooner rather than later\nJohn ... is our guest covers the NBA for who magazine you can follow justice work on Twitter at Josh ... so what did you make of this dissension did you think that way each guy got the proper amount of games Brennan ... honestly got a little bit more than he did but it was just what were your thoughts in terms of the punishments after that Scrabble\nUm [noise] you know what it felt a little like\nUm if that had been shall Mickey land Steven ... and ... and that's I think we're looking at\nFifteen twelve and twelve or Fifteen twelve and ten\nI think the fact that Chris paused president that he's a star that Roger on does a starting point guard on at least talk their team um I think that was why was it was it was and it's pretty crazy that you can you know throw punches in today's NBA side zipper F\n... cause that kind of a mess and only get two or three games I think the league when light and I think they might regret not sending a message here yeah I'm way during the season\nNo I'm totally with you what are your thoughts on the Utah Jazz I Know it's so early in the season that it's very hard to you know look at one or two games and just jump all over but\nI was watching this warriors jazz game on friday night Josh and I was just so incredibly impressed with Utah ability to hang in there I liked the roster but then they turn around and they lose to the grizzlies what do you ... what can we expect from the jazz this year and what do you think they're stealing is do you think they could get as high as it three or four seats this year in the west\n[noise] yeah I I think four or five I Can't remember where I had them one of those two\nThis team is going to be so good sense of ... I mean they're going to be so good defensively like everyone else they're working out the kinks\nBut when they had eighty something points eighty one half hug in school and say I was just blown away if they if they're often can produce place that\nUh you know occasionally not even on a nightly basis they're going to be a scary the and I think a guy like Joe ... who can bring the ball a who's just the belief still sniper pretty under rated Donovan Mitchell adds another layer to his game and they finally get something done to eggs and\nI see no reason why they don't finish four or five\nJohn ... is our guest is who magazine you can follow his work once winter at Josh Everly a Josh so you're on the dot com hotline CSI dot com came out with some odd to the very beginning of the season\nIn terms of who would be traded or is this guy ... they they listed a couple of guys and then they would they be traded yes or no Anthony Davis was on that list Jimmy bought Lewis on that list ... Leonard was on that list\nOf those three people write their Anthony David Cohen Leonard and Jimmy Butler who is the least likely chance of being treated this year do you think\nI think Anthony Davis I think the pelicans um are are committed to um they've got no real reason to deal um they've come out of the gate absolutely firing a you know for as much as people like to speculate and think he's unhappy and we don't we haven't really heard anything concrete like that from his camp I think Davis the safest bet those streets\nAnd wonder why Leonard I Know you know your um your contributor to upper MBA Canada's well you know it looks like I see him being traded really either and I know it's early therefore no\nAnd I know that ... has indicated that he wants to be out in Los Angeles not for the Lakers clippers possibly but I mean if this works like it looks like it's working right now in Toronto first let me ask you this how surprised that it took so quickly for this team to mess up and to lead the way that they have do you see why Leonard\n... I mean if it continues like towards the trade deadline they're not going to get rid of them right\nNo I mean there there was a scenario where this\nDidn't work a Maori inquire Leonard ... heads then it got out into the tabloids and that then that tension and grew or the raptors had a really bad structure games that deadline and you know they panic in the ... I think there are scenarios where it could have happened but it just it always seemed unlikely you know the rafters knew\nIt was what it was there and try to be competitive they were going to sell them on the city they were going to give them this year to try and sell themselves to him and and part of that thing we can be a competitive team they were fifty nine when team or the Marta rose and you know quiet lenders there Danny green\nThey're very good team they could talk about this year they legitimately could be in the NBA was quiet Leonard possibly winning and MVP I mean they have a package to sell them and and and just simply that the plug and play of of throws now quite Leonard and has been seamless so far so I I don't really think it's likely\nThrough board games do you say that the plug and play it's been seamless overall do you think and and I know it's tough it was only four games while entered political overall do you think is going to be the more productive play or do you think the raptors absolutely without hesitation they one dish trade in terms of bringing ... and leaving demar\nYeah you know I I Do I mean I I don't even think it's like remotely close guy\nI here's the thing with the Marta rose and the other night he obviously has a thirty to aid for change that line Los Angeles is a very good game he's a very\nTalented basketball player and and I'm a very stats driven individual I think of it on your show a few times she she might treat yeah a ... like honestly I I I Try very hard not to let feelings that emotion I test will you didn't but I have never seen a player\nPlayed down like the martyr Rosen has in the playoffs last year's key is\nUnbelievable isn't unbelievable drop of production when it really matters and I think Toronto is done with a yard even if Corey walks out from his deal and we're not relying on him when it counts and I and I honestly think that's a win is on its own\nJosh several years our gas magazine also then be Canada you can follow all of justice work on Twitter\nAt Josh ... how the blocks right now they did it three and I think you ought to some of the coup was a legitimate MVP candidate this year I\nThat's really dumb you go to bed at the U.S at a comedy and get a one hundred twenty five percent bonus by using the promo code went on twenty five ...\nI was looking at his son's roster and you know I'm an NBA or like just a sports nerd as you are this is fun pain like if you just look at a roster Devon Booker or as you heard Josh say there could definitely be the leading score you know he could be in terms of points per game that guy can do it all\nDevin Booker T Andre ... as I've gotten up to and I start and then he got like a college all star team kind of with like Josh Jackson and Mike how bridges in their Kansas star and Villanova star Michael purchased did he went player of the year last year Villanova he might it was up there it was either him or somebody else obviously the field\nAnd then you have like these greedy veterans us Ryan\n... okay I'm not going to say right after\n...

Gurley three more touchdowns last week okay Jared Gadhafi not a system quarterback and you're still saying that go watch the game [noise] okay so this ramp steam rolling on all cylinders I don't I mean we're not going to lose two\nHow do you gain plant for that [noise] I don't\nBut the rams to me are clearly my top teams\nAre so Bobby let's have a discussion about this now uh I think you know we ... I did I say ... clearly my top team\nYou know in college football there is a clear number one we talked about this a lot it's Alabama\nAre you willing to put either the cheese to the patriots in here number one with the Los Angeles ramps I Am not I'm going to say the rams like Alabama or in a here by themselves when we're hearing the NFL\nBut I Do think the difference between tier one and tear too\nIs a lot closer in the NFL than it is college football I think\nAlabama is miles above Clemson not miles about I'll get there like one mile to the adult who really knows okay we'll see against LSU but there is significant difference between Alabama and collected and then I think there's a lot of difference between ... and the Notre Dame LSU things will come and first on college football\nBut are you with me that LA is in a class by themselves but it's not really that big of a difference between them and the chief of the Patriot\nWell yeah they're the most complete seeming NFL as we've seen last week even though they are planning the forty niners you got to see and Donald get out there and get through sag sent tie very really it was the act of been just being his presence I mean he had like fifty yards and such downer or substance but er\nYeah LA is managed by themselves and I mean a cheese or their their defense has come a long wait on season yeah long\nLow Ellen okay let's pull the breaks that they played one pretty good game to who\nWas the star wars jaguars the first year with the jaguars and the second one of those men go I'm not\nWilling to put the jaguars as a real game in terms of we're proving were good have you seen the jaguars ... played portals as pathetic they have no run again there are offensive line is in shambles so I I get the chiefs play well I'm not disagreeing with you\nBut I'm not going to point to that as evidence that the chiefs are now a defense on the rise again one game to me could be classified as a fluke two games that trend\nI'm not quite with you there who do that she said this week that we know are not exactly out to okay I'll go to the Brooklyn okay so that she used to have the Broncos is a team that they played tight with okay in the first game\nAll right so look I think that she said they they definitely made strides in Cincinnati I Want to see too good consecutive games okay but but so LA class find themselves\nTear number two for me it's patriots and the cheese and then I'll work this thing just tear number three\nOr I Will put the Vikings into your number three in the chargers into your number three and I'm going to then have a drop off from there I have the ravens the Panthers tear number for the Steelers to me are interesting this is the team that is kind of looming and tear for threatening to get to tear three or tier two and the reason\nIs because ... week is it that way beyond bell is probably going to come back if he wants to make any kind of money this year I think it's like we had\nOur way beyond belt to me will be back at some point\n... gonna be fresh okay I don't know if you know people you talk about oh is he in football sick all the guys you know he's he's working out okay he's going to be the people banged up you know by we nine we can we start seeing injuries away my Belt's gonna come in and and it it might not be from Pittsburgh\nBut you know there's talk she might be traded to Philadelphia I think you know the longer he holds out the less of a chance he's actually going to treat treat them as we said okay so I I just\nI just have Pittsburgh on the outside looking in but body would you like to\nHear this any differently here too from east patriots case here three for me as states Vikings chargers tear forest Panthers ravens and then I'll just stop there those are the best teams in the NFL\nYeah yeah I mean that's that's that's pretty much like I ... yeah I mean I mean I I really\nReally elaborate because that's what we see every week like beef teams is dominating a routine but yeah for the Web pages struggle with the bears ...\nLet me ask you how are you willing to put the saints adhere to yeah I uh okay even with a sneaky victory

mean did the defensive line\nI I mean I I think was just awful especially in the second half unable to stop there I mean those runs were just basically untouched from from long way away for Perdue able to get those those ducked down do you think Ohio State defensive line has worries moving so far without boso\nNo I think that's the only functional unit on that side of the fall I mean I thought there was that the probably the game was that when they did get brutal line the line backers couldn't do anything about it in a secondary could do anything about it than I can you know each doctor cash them for forty forty two yard\nWork worry behind the line I mean that's kind of the old the linebacker stuff those plays and nobody was there to do it and I think it's um you know I think most of the injury obviously you know he's a great player but I think the line\nKnow the three units align linebacker secondary that's the line is playing by far the best\nJerry problem is our guest covers the college football for CBS Sports you can follow Jerry's work on Twitter regime CBS do Michigan now number five in the country they force Michigan state's quarterback five twenty five\nOr sixty six yard now it's used for cash to this Michigan Ohio State game obviously doing Haskins in Ohio State they like to throw the football and they have struggles running the boss who would you favor in that game right now\nOh easily Michigan right now I mean we'll see what happens in a month but if they were having a play this week even Columbus which is where they will play a Thanksgiving week it's a it's ... the American right now\nAnd how far is it like how like Michigan are mild yeah go ahead\nYeah I mean I don't I don't know who number two is I mean it's not Wisconsin they Ronald them or is it doesn't really looked like Ohio State probably still a second team I just think that Michigan at least touch down paper against him right now even in Columbus\nIf we go to the SEC we got a big match up coming up with Florida and Georgia obviously number nine versus number seven but what are you looking for early with that match up\n[noise] well I think that's a huge game obviously proposed in the sense that you know you're pretty much out of the the the phrase but if you lose the game and [noise] and they're pretty much a limited also from a playoff as well so\nYou know it's a it's a big game Georgia got bounced back\nReally from the ... I'm Sorry oh let's see your game I don't know why they get a little um\nBut uh LSU game you know or they really got to hand it to them and you know this is another chance against that good opponent big rival than a than a big environment and uh yeah it's a it's it's a bounce back came for George if they really need to win because a lot of people think\nThis is the teen the best equipped to challenge Alabama they're not even going to get a chance to begin with this is\nNo question about it when you look at Alabama how far do you think they are from the rest of the crop because Alabama I think you could make the argument that they have not really played anybody that that you know that that well get um do you see LSU realistically down the road giving them any kind of a game\nYeah sure I mean it was only will at some point I mean they're not an NFL team so you know somebody somebody can give them a game eh let's see we get the next shot at them they get to play 'em at home but he was played as well as anybody against the toughest canceled anybody white so far cows put all so\nYeah I I think a until Alabama runs about a death valley that the ... you know that's the theme of the best chance the Adam\nJerry calling us our guest covers college football for CBS Sports you can follow Jerry's work on Twitter at the people on CBS still Alabama obviously has gotten off the tremendously fast dark this season\nIf you want to say Alabama and I know it's tough because they are that good they've looked at good they have a weakness that could be exposed is there a weakness on Alabama that you could see\nI don't think we have a pretty good enough to try and exploit from I mean I'm not be in it but if they're not being tested so it\nIt's hard to spot a week is when you know they're just saying I mean do you have a better chance of finding a week different practice when the ... the coffee and it's still a gift each other but it's hard to see what's going on with the competition they break spot\nWhen it comes to the rest of the day the top twenty five specifically let's look at this number three two in the country Notre Dame I've been really high on a Notre Dame but I I ... you know it would that that went against Pittsburgh obviously was not very convincing at all where are you with Notre Dame in terms of them being legitimate top three team their number three in the country right now\nWell I think to limit top type team and certainly until somebody beat them you know there are a playoff team die and I don't know what's on their scheduled it can't be on it real good run\nOr made it work for a banned book deal with the change to quarterback or to put him in quarterback really made that often it's much more dynamic that wasn't so much against Pittsburgh to get a T this week was always kind of a lot in quite\nA bit Notre Dame and get to see and I'm not a beach town last year by their standards so you know they should have a pretty easy going things you would think against navy this week it and maybe they can get that off and you know going again effort kind of it in different performance against Pittsburgh\nSo on the road for ... northwestern at home than Florida State Syracuse USC is it fair to me to say that if I'm going to\nPut a loss on Notre Dame schedule that it would be us see at the end of the year would that be the most probable seemed to be Notre Dame do you think\nThis is ...\nFor me to say that if I'm going to put a loss of Notre Dame schedule that it would be USC at the end of the year would that be the most probable seemed to be Notre Dame do you think\nThis has been around gated sleep by the way it's neutral go um\nYes I Would say that the best chance for Notre Dame but they go off that rivalry game at the end of the the the U.S the three times on a road game I did\nAnd did you see pretty good in Italy they need to be healthy quarterback if they had the chance to compete with Notre Dame and they're kind of that but this year at least for this week\nBased on what we've seen from Notre Dame and these unconvincing when specifically against Pittsburgh it how Michigan has played ... if you want to put Notre Dame and Michigan on the neutrophils I Know what happened a week warning Notre Dame but if we were to put Notre Dame admitted it on a neutral field right now who do you think would win that game and why\nUh I think that their skin probably would because of all the momentum half right now I think they're\nThey're better off than ... than they were when they play on a daily il week one kind of half you're still working things out oh theme for five and obviously Notre Dame of James quarterbacks and said ah but I Would I Would get Michigan a slight edge in that game it if for no other reason they don't have to play the game\nDid you know that fifty six percent of homeowners are over paying for their insurance and one in three drivers is doing the same thing that means there is a

to be staffing Foxconn and Foxconn related jobs supplemental companies that do other work and partnerships with them so it's having a real impact all across the thirty third\nOur next question a representative or locker given the number of educational referenda on the ballot this November what is your stance on the current general aid system for K. through twelve schools\nYeah absolutely this is something that we need to take a look at is one of the reasons why I asked to be on and was appointed to the blue ribbon commission where we've gone all across the state talking to not only school officials educators school board members concern parents and in some cases even students\nAbout what they see a as issues with the funding formula from day one when I stepped into this role\nIn January of twenty Fifteen I sat down with every school administrator all the principles\nTo talk about the funding formula and what's wrong with it what needs to be changed and what we can do to make sure that this is a real when for all of us by just by just deconstructing the funding formula you're not getting into the heart of the issue and you're picking winners and losers we can't have that folks\nThe economy of the future depends on an educated workforce we got to have that and it's not going to be done by picking the winners and losers that deconstructing the current funding formula and building it back up would be\nWe do have to work or in a bipartisan fashion in order to make any headway on that I'm committed to it I've been committed to it\nThe issue with a referendum or something that I've had disagreements with my own party on as far as the prohibition on the uh time limits that you are able to go to a referendum I firmly believe that\nReferendum should be held on general elections whether it's the spring or the fall you get the most\nVoter turnout during those but I don't think that you should be able to just hold a random selection for school a referendum or outside of those times I don't think you should be prohibited from going to referendum\nOr every two years or whatever the bill as we are debated last year or two years ago now a state and uh but I Do think that it is the will of the locals\nAnd we are seeing that more and more a local communities are deciding that yeah it's it's worth the investment thank you\nMr White given the number of educational referenda on the ballot this November what is your stance on the current general aid system for K. through twelve schools um\nI I agree with representative or like are there is a serious problem with how um we're finding education in here and I'm Glad that he is at least going and listening to what people have to say about the issue bought\nTheir doesn't really seem to be any solutions come out of it and quite frankly I Do believe a current funding formula the way we have it is one of the huge heart of the problem here you have a lot of these rural schools um were you don't have the same property tax base out there that perhaps a wealthier area um\nHas at it and you just have an educational disparity then\nNot have any fault of the kids going to school there is just where they live where they were born but unfortunately under the current system they're not getting the same opportunity because the area isn't as rich as some other areas are\nI think if you keep the funding for them as it is you're going to see that same problem an even worse if you might see some of these rural school districts\nThat are really I'm trying to tighten their belts here to stay open they have to shut their doors and then you've got some of these kids get bus to a district perhaps an hour away\nAnd one of these more rural areas of the states so\nI think that is first and foremost what we shouldn't be looking at for solving this issue we have a public education is the funding formula and make it fair so regardless of where you go to school small town rich suburb you have the same opportunities available\nThank you Mr White Wisconsin relies heavily on gas taxes and registration fees to fund transportation were revenues were both sources growing slowly what changes if any would you support to meet the state's transportation needs [noise]\nI think we do need to be um more open minded with how we're going to be raising revenue there I Know\n[noise] well I think we do need to be um more open minded with how we're going to be raising revenue there I Know there's a lot of pushback I'm from the current leadership and the state capital of all potentially raising the gas hats the covered that difference there\nI really would not like to see us half to go the way of Illinois where you have a toll booth every ten miles to cover your transportation budget but\nThe fact of the matter is we're not getting the funding that we need to keep these roads in good shape than as a member of the county board I can see that we're really being asked to especially now its budget season for the county board were being asked to do quite um quite a lot with not very much help at all\nAnd it's really an issue of making our area more attractive for employers having good roads it's it's tough to a show of this is why they should come here when almost every highway an area has potholes ...\nIntellect and getting worse and worse so I think we need to really be given our infrastructure a lot more attention than we have been in this past half a decade or so thank you\nRepresentative or locker Wisconsin relies heavily on gas taxes in registration fees to fund transportation with revenue from both sources growing slowly what changes if any would you support to meet the state's transportation needs\nSo I've been pretty open particularly am I sit down just Michael on a morning magazine that I Am completely against toll roads because it's going to disproportionately hurt us here in southeastern Wisconsin and the increase of government\nUh structures across the state or now within a by general uh operations\nUm that said uh I've also said you know like if there's a proposal that's worth taking a look at\nI I Will review it um but\nTo your point of registration fee increases you can do all the registration fee increase for every citizen in the state and it still is not going to get to the heart of the matter\nAnd that's only impacting folks that live here that does not take into account the people from Illinois from Iowa from Minnesota who travel our roads every day to get back and forth either to work or to recreate\nI'm so from that standpoint I don't favor putting the burden just on a individuals within the state again\nThere's a lot of things that go into particularly transportation proposals during the budget season\nAnd joins finance has there say on the matter so by the time it trickles down to a those of us uh uh for for a vote proposals look a whole lot different than when they started out so before I Would say\nYes to this or yes to that I Would have to see it like you\nRepresentative or locker Wisconsin is ranked last month twenty eight states with renewable energy standards should the legislature changed the state's stance towards climate change and enforcement of pollution laws so\nI think that the renewable energies is something that is starting to become cost effective for individuals particularly say when I Know I just touring gear boxing or Guam ago last week and had a good conversation was first a new Miller [noise]\nDown there and they're actually looking to expand over in Europe right um and one of my good friends from college who now works in the renewable energy sector or was on the tour with us and is showing how it's more cost effective than ever before we do have a proposed\nA solar field going and just outside of town here that um you know if it's cost effective and it's not being supplemented by the government absolutely let's say go again maybe we can actually save some money for all the tax payers\nBut to just wholesale say we're we've got to throw money into renewables because it's the thing to do I don't favor that\nUh you have to take a look at what actually makes sense when you go to outweigh a tax dollars and I don't think that here in our tax dollars should be going to supplement\nThat are not say that I Am not a fan of a\nSolar panels or or wind turbines or anything like that again if it makes sense as financially a stable that's grace and I think that year boxes a perfect example of something that with\nUm", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show",
