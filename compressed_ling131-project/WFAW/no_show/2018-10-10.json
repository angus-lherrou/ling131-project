he told me he's like look we had the Yankees are great bullpen you got to play this what he told me Bobby is like the Yankees have to play the third inning like it's the seventh inning because it's do or die\nAnd I didn't really understand that mindset because what happens if you're on a five five game let's say they bring in Robert ... and the third and fourth and then they bring in Chapman in the fifth on the ... and they're protecting and they're doing all this and then they tied the game and then you're five five in the uh here I go forecasting I got ... five five in the eighth and then you have to bring in a terrible pitcher in the ...\nI I just didn't believe that\nThe New York Yankees should've played this game and I did not believe the Yankees should've played game three like the Oakland Athletics played the playing game we saw how that worked out for Oakland it failed\nI don't believe you can play this bullpen game starting in any number three specifically tonight when the the the ... had\nTo run on second and there was two outs and\nUh at that point I was wondering nothing and my dad said at that point you should take D.C says about the out of the game and I'm thinking to myself you know what\nIt is so easy and and Arthur Andersen is going to join the show forty pass the our our ... in a covers major league baseball for CBS Sports and all asking this question\nTo a certain point you have to trust your players and I do think that there is too much of a spotlight\nNegative and positive that is shined on the managers during post season play in other words we give too much positive credit and too much negative credit to manage oriole decisions that happen in the postseason\nI mean ... they're like seriously ... cubs fans are thinking of themselves there was a story that came out after the cubs wants to play on gay or the cubs should do is Joe ... is he safe OK Joanna manage a brilliant game I thought against the Colorado Rockies it just didn't turn out your way\nOkay players make place managers make decisions obviously I just think too much credit and too much discredit overall in the course of major league baseball playoff games too much of that goes on the manager\nAnd so basically what happened tonight is and it happened over the last two nights but the Yankees is real simple to think okay so you can hammer boon if you want\nBut two things happen\nYou know one one series coming back to the Bronx where you would want\nThe last seven games you're a Yankee fan you're looking at that and you're saying they've won their last seven games\nOkay yeah there is to pose a flu used to have a RINO on them out and game number three one playing game you gotta have trust in them you've got to have trust in it\nYou ride and die sometimes with the guys that you trust and unfortunate for the Yankees they they died but I I Do believe that it was the right decision that Aaron Boone made in both of these games\nTo at least ... out and keep him in for the third inning you at a runner on again one nothing two outs runner on second you're telling me you want to go to the bullpen in that sense you're telling me that you don't want to see is the CSA ...\nWho's been pretty good all year can pull that out\nYou have the trust of your players at a certain point and the bottom line is seven Reno and see the ... did not execute and sometimes that happens Jose Ramirez an ad went on corn on the owners were old for over in the series but the Cleveland Indians against the Houston Astros are you taking those guys out\nIn ... number Seventeen combined in the game number three no you have to ride and die with your guys somehow\nSo from a pitching point of view beer Yankee fan tonight and you're listening\nI kind of support boom\nNow here's the other thing the Yankees scored four runs total at home again let's look at this from a thousand feet above the Yankees scored four runs total total at home against the red Sox number three pitcher and the red Sox number four pitcher\nSo excluding the boon decision making for one second I Know it's hard to do excluding that decision making for just one second you cannot ... if I told you that at the beginning of the series that that was going to happen to score Fort once total in the two games at home when you come back time one to one\nYou don't deserve to win the series and the ... against a one hundred and ... soccer team you don't deserve to win the theories you cannot expect a different result the at bat that John Carlos Stanton had\nIn the ninth inning first and second I Believe it was maybe it was ... was bases loaded first and second nobody out one out whatever John Carlos standing you bring him in from Miami and this is supposed to be your guy\nHe failed in a gigantic moment in a miserable way that was the worst step back I've seen in a year\nOf any baseball player maybe I'm drastically overreacting cause I'm hot in the moment now but my goodness Bobby how bad was that you're swinging on a one one pitch on a slider that hit the left batter's box\nHorrible and then you strike out on a pitch that didn't quite hit the left batter's box but was so off the plate\nYou\nPlayers after many plays players have to execute and the ... and then you add against an says that one pop up that\nThat John Carlos stand about was how they are Gary Sanchez behind the plate who I think might be legally half blind on a changeup wasn't even a cross of that's not on the CSA ... that's not on Aaron Boone Gary says not able to catch the baseball\nSo again you can as a Yankee fan you get a hammer Aaron Boone and similar you'll hear the red Sox perspective demar I Would just want to give you the ... the Yankee perspective today the red Sox deserved to win this series they hit and the timely moments and you've got to give them a lot of credit\nAnd I think Aaron Boone is going to take a lot more heat again I Would just want to like well my point I Am much more disappointed as Yankee fan I'm much more disappointed in the the ... those performances in these last two games than I Am upset about Aaron balloons decision making\nThat's where I Am as a Yankee fan right now\nAll right when we come back some of the Dallas Cowboys so we're going to\nThis is three to have some people in Seattle are desperate for a new franchise ...

I mean they have for starters and unfortunately for them that wasn't enough to make that competitive theories\nDo you think Terry Frank Cohn his job is in jeopardy should be in jeopardy this team that is falling apart now\nTwice over the last couple of years in the play offs haven't gone to the C. S. I. I I was hearing some commentary today like anybody bought Frank Conan like Terry Franklin has the pedigree well look the bullpen\nJust die to execute and they just did not the bullpen had eleven ER ray or they go out get Donald to know what do you think of Terry Franklin of his job security\nI Will be safe I mean remember when he came to Cleveland that was not a popular destination and part of the reason it's become sort of a model franchise is because the Franco to leadership but I Know you know this is the second consecutive October that\nYou know Cleveland has disappointed but at the same time is it really is all the Jose Ramirez ... style and were hit list until the ninth inning of games the reunion right is it really is all the Andrew Miller and Cody Allen solve our ... our\n... throwing as I say no to all that and lots of member you know the reason we have these expectations for Cleveland is in part because of how Frank managed and twenty sixteen when he ... over claimed some weaknesses won a big of a playoff game of Ryan merit starting and you know they found themselves in the world series\nAnd world went away from winning a championship so you know I understand uh the\nThe I guess the temptation to blame for and Conan maybe wonder if they should get a new voice than that but no I think you should be safe\nAnd I don't I don't know if I ever fire how it might be one of the situation we just retired\nYeah hard to understand are just so you can follow him on Twitter at our underscores ... Anderson a staff writer for CBS Sports major league baseball I'm really glad you mentioned that you just mentioned because I Want to talk about the Yankees here for a second you can't blame Frank Kona for the fall of those hitters I think that that is a point I think it's so easy in baseball\nPhysically baseball to go to the manager and pinpoint all the blame when things don't go right in the play offs it's easy to make the manager a scapegoat so I looked at what happened\nIn the Yankees play offs in the in their home games this year a CSA ... I say as a Yankee fan than I Am more disappointed in the performance is OCC Sebastian Emily ... at home against Boston three and four pitchers than I Am a boon than I Am upset\nAbout balloons decision making in terms of like my motion as a fan more disappointment towards the players than I Am a ... as a manager what are your thoughts on Boone and keeping ... in the game in game three and four\nWell let me start by saying that I agree that I think in October we have a tendency to focus too much on the managerial aspects of the game and you know it really shifts from the regular season you know this happened in August we've probably don't even talked about that because that happened under the bright lights we all want to be you know armchair manager so to speak yeah\nExpecting gas or something some cases birth gas and I'd say that only to say that yeah it's kind of first guessing building last night and a endgame for and the reason for that because\nYou know the Yankees strange is that whole thing or one of their strengths as you say is that all this makes sense to me to leverage it in a way where your maximizing your chances of winning and I think the most ridiculous part of the stuff Marino game was not that he\nWas suffering I go back there are number happening you know try to get through\nA never ending or whatever but the decision making the made when he brought in his reliever and yes I just don't understand why you would bring in land when gas ... unless you're just looking for links and if you're looking for a link why are you continuing the word ... asking me why are you continuing to warm green after when was then and before you really given up\nYou know a bunch of run so I don't know that part of the little guys you know what I mean I'll keep in mind Aaron Boone has in his first season the right manager was never manager before this is first postseason going up against a pretty good theme if he went up against the weaker team\nThis might not even matter and remembered Joe Jr already has some similar issues last year when he didn't challenge or hit by a patch so I mean no managers perfect and we have to keep that in mind even though it's very like you said\nAnd and challenge to his bypass so I mean no managers perfect and we have to\nKeep that in mind even though it's very like you said blame everything on the manager of the time of year\nThat I Know and and look I I think you're already had his moments of both the moments are shined even so much brighter when they are good managerial decision\nLike sorority last year piecing together eight innings of his bullpen when Severino gives you not think that was a brilliant move but then like you said that you have the other side everything is just exemplified in the playoffs and I think specifically in baseball\nThe light is shining brighter positively or negatively on the manager and I want to go to the national league here hum\nWhat kind of chances are you've given Milwaukee against LA I think bill walkie starting pitching as drastically over achieve some to this point I'm shocked I'll be honest with you are I Am shocked I add Milwaukee out a long time ago I thought that comes I'm going to win this division I am genuinely just really shocked that they are at this point what kind of a chance to do you give them against the Dodgers\nWell I think the Dodgers and\nSo I Will refer to you Bobby is it a yes or no Ken I hop on like put it like let's say you're out this weekend for ... number one against the or the red Sox and and I own a an Astros had and I wanted to join your group and try and blend in\nAnd be an Astros fan\nCould would you allow me to do that I Am totally accept any answer that you tell me oh just what you did last year we may yeah

I thought this summer was higher\n... only missed five games over the last four years I feel like it's been a lot more than that I feel like he's been out like had to sit out for a half or something maybe came back I don't know it's just been a perception that Sean McCoy has been hurt a little bit more maybe then he has\nBut look if I'm the Philadelphia Eagles I go I this is my priority list the other one by the way Jordan Howard they're reportedly trying to call the Chicago Bears and go get Jordan Howard\nBecause you're stuck in your head Jordan Howard's production in terms of his attempt has gone down to re Cohen has kind of taken that role on a little bit more now if you ask Maggie Maggie did say that he does want ... joined an hour to have more of a role than he's been happening so he wants that role to improve\nThat would be the least likely running back I see moving from their team I don't see the bears giving up Jordan Howard I think the bears especially with a rookie quarterback and missiles dubinsky I Can't I that that you need to have as many weapons as possible on that team a dual running backs system is perfect for a team like Chicago perfect for a team like Chicago\nBut I I don't know I I think if you're the Philadelphia Eagles you really go hard on this either for lady on bell or electronically my preference would be way beyond bell and of course any trade that would have to go through Pittsburgh leave you know that would have to accept that because he's the one who has to decide the franchise tender for him to be eligible for a trade\nBut a balmy beach if I'm the eagles I Need a running back like yesterday\nBecause look at look at a division like this team is ready to win now okay just look at all we're talking about okay Houston Astros\nI've been saying go hard after a closer because you're in ... they did that they got no sooner they got their guy okay Indians kind of there like in when you go ... look at our teams in the playoffs and major league baseball Dodgers when you go hard after made him a chance to even though you might not get 'em long term\nOkay New York Yankees okay they they go make some moves that get Andrew McCutcheon every single team like in the playoffs now when hard after their guy\nTheir whole that they needed Chicago cops okay a couple of years ago they went hard at the time and they never close if I understand that baseball players the individual baseball player is more valuable than the individual football player Howard ...\nTold us that yesterday he's been covering this league a long time I understand that but you have a gaping hole if you're the Philadelphia Eagles that running back right now I'm at small was not going to do the job\nYou need another guy and in especially in the division that is so right there for the taking they already right now Philadelphia right now is already the best team in that division but to me going hard after McCoy ... it would be okay\nWho do you think do you think the eagles let me ask you this before the trade them I which I think is weak six uh it it it was his week five so that he doesn't need to do this in the next week and a half do you think the eagles will acquire a running back I'm not going to ask you to predict which one do you think they're going to acquire whenever I run a back in the next two weeks\nWell yeah I think so because you don't you do not have an identity back there in the bedroom behind Carson Winston and you know on Carson when I started about forty fifty pounds a game on I was going to happen is you're a hundred\nRight without an analysis they don't have an identity at all that often if I were to say okay this often says this will do they block wall consistently I don't think so do they throw the ball field down well do they throw the ball down field welcomes distantly I don't think so that they run the ball all because it's only to the office or something like that it's no team in the end of the ...\nDo they throw the ball field down well do they throw the ball down field wall consistently I don't think so that they run the ball all because it's the opposite then I get a no team in the end of the east\nThat has an identity that Prescott Dallas Cowboys that the beacon jak identity you weren't that as your identity\nIs ... you know I Know the Boston was Dick you'll only get one out of every to play but you're right the eagles don't have any kind of identity offensively as you're saying yes do you what are the chances that will be a okay what a chance to leave a court what do you think\nAre probably a Seventy five percent higher than levy on bell or lower higher so you think he's more hack and I said it's a little more available than a lady on the I mean they'd be on bill hasn't ... play the game or report it to put it to the design of franchise\nFee and also we don't know what kind of way beyond bell are going to get there this whole how's he going to look weak one

back with less jumped in college football yes we are at the midway point of his these in these laughing as our guest house football editor for Apple on boards you can follow sees work on that one see All right see I have\nBeen on the Notre Dame bandwagon for a while now this is a team that I like this the team that I Would like to see in the college football playoff but I just want to break down and I've done this before on the show I just want to break it down for you because I don't think we've gone over it when I've had you on\nMy doomsday scenario for Notre Dame is a situation where Ohio State wins out they win the Big Ten title game there and they're fine Clemson wins out they were the ACC title game there and they're fine\nAnd then we have Alabama and Georgia who could go into the SEC title game undefeated and one of those teams have to lose now my fear is what's gonna happen last year is going to happen this year they won last S. E. C. team is going to get in and potentially will have Clemson Ohio State\nUh Georgia and Alabama and that would potentially my doomsday scenario here see believe Notre Dame out is that a realistic thought that that could happen or do you think in that scenario the committee would put undefeated Notre Dame in instead of that one last FCC team\n[noise] no I think it is a pretty realistic scenario um you know a kind of get to the most deserving versus best team debate and you know I think if you if you match up the loser of potentially the loser of the FCC championship game\nWhether that's Georgia or Alabama on a new ... I Would take Alabama or Georgia but then if you look at the most deserving part of that\nNotre Dame running the table um with winds over Michigan Stanford Virginia Tech us deep I mean that's the crumbs how resume the end of the year so I think it is realistic that Notre Dame cook it left out but at the same time something just healthy that\nIf the end of the year if ... Ohio State in Alabama or defeated at Notre Dame is the fourth Tina's undefeated\nI kinda think the fighting Irish we get there for five but it would be an interesting debate because we haven't seen that type of scenario set up um and of course there is a lot of football is because we have that happen\nNo doubt about okay now let me ask an out of the box question before we get back into this what is your opinion on how the college football playoff is set up because one of the things that I said last year we kind\nOf have this situation last year when we had Ohio State in Alabama and it was a decision my opinion is why do we have to make this decision why not\nHave a play on gay foreign aid team playoff like okay find you don't want the Eighteen playoff why not have to play in game because I feel like every year we're going to have that decision to make between do we give it to number five or do we give it to number four\nIn a perfect world what don't we have a playing game like major league baseball does to decide who really is disturbing to play in these playoffs\nYou know I have to admit as a fan of the Pittsburgh Pirates or the baseball wildcard playoff game hasn't really\nGone way past years but\nYou know I think realistically the college football playoff um will expand at some point whether that's sixteen or Eighteen\nI kinda feel like six these kind of a sweet spot because you know we do seem to get\nThe top five to six teams every year veteran contention\nThe hard part about college football is you know it's such a weird sport but that's what makes the greatest because it it could go and you also get these years where you have three teams that are deserving really not a fourteen years maybe this year it's pretty clear that Alabama is better than everyone else and we're just going through the motions of the season\nSo it's it's really hard to kind of hone in on what makes the most is because you hear about a year just changes\nI still think it'd be even get into twenty twenty five twenty thirty territory I think the college football playoff would and in the end to sixteen\nSo ah you know like I said not necessarily a standard uh playing game but I think when we will expand\nThe lesson is our guest the college football editor for Apple exports you could follow his work on swear at\nApple I did when I Swear I don't have money or Notre Dame I just watch this team and I I Would like to see what their maximum capabilities are having said that I Want to see the same thing with Georgia Alabama punch it allows states I think all of those let me just look in terms of the ... the landscape of the season all those teams\nJust deserve to be in some kind of a playoff what about the pact well what about Washington Washington wins out honestly say this was not an impressive victory on the road against UCLA you have the leader early yet UCLA comes back later\nIt can we eliminate the pack twelve at this point of the season for participating in the final four teams\nKnow I I don't think we can eliminate him yet but I think it's becoming more of a long shot in not only does washing not only the Washington struggle\nWith UCLA last week that went over the last to offer new starting to look worse and offering regrets does not to mention you know you I hopped in the top twenty five and then they get handled by a state last week\nSo you know looking ahead at a Washington scheduled game Saturday against Oregon is critical I think Washington me too when we're in a way\nTo sort of put their stake in the ground and say we are the clear favorite of the club and we are just head and shoulders\nBetter than everyone else I think it's going to be tough though because looking at their schedule they have Colorado there has been ... at Washington state victory at the end of the year I twelve and one Washington team that doesn't really have a mark he went and what happens with Oregon a course I guess\nBig college football fan here do you believe what the\nBlast and said that Penn State\nWould be that number ... team right now in terms of well really number two in terms of the outside looking in other college football playoff as we currently stand right now Penn State number eight him a country Washington number seven I'm so done with the pact well Washington getting lost against UCLA and the second half\nI used to I mean you got to be kidding me\nYou've got to be ... like UCLA had ... they were there they have they still and they don't want to gave me right there when this\nHow do you only when that came by eight points I Washington I'm I'm eliminate them a Penn State or they number two in terms of outside looking in right after right after Notre Dame in your opinion um yeah I\nCan agree with that I mean I I like a ... a great showing the Ohio State game you know rates are going I Wish they would want it but a great great show about ... or ... or ... you see that uh you know he really sort of the game but I haven't

Hopkins those two guys are number one receivers\nAnd and when I heard this probably I'll get your thoughts on here too I I just I don't understand what Jerry thinking here either because to me they have had a number one wide receiver and that was just trying in between two thousand a twelve and two thousand fourteenth he had\nMultiple sounds in your seasons multiple multi touch downs seasons and just because you don't have the Andre ... Jones\nDoes not mean you don't have a number one wide receiver\nAnd does Bryant who by the way it's still sitting on his couch weight and offered to be signed by a football team there's Brian said I don't know what Jerry meant by that but we sure had to keep the chains move it uh so do you do you agree with Jerry Jones do have they had a number one wide receiver in the past couple of years in your opinion\nHe must have been sleep up there and who you are I mean there's Brian was your number one guy from twenty to twenty fourteen I mean hey he had some injuries\nA you know then then goes way than slow this production down but he was still your number one target that you still had to double team so I mean how can you say you have to know more wide receiver who you who Bryce butler who that as an intern or cable an awesome national\nThat's his point I mean I think he's grouping does Bryant with the price bottlers in Tehran\nButler who has been a ...\nPoint I mean I think he's grouping does Bryant with the price bottlers into Tehran Austin's a nickel ... which frankly look I've taken my shot that does Bryan on this show and I think they're warranted because he has regrets but if you but he's talking about ... years\nHe's talking about ... years he's going back two thousand twelve to fourteen that does Brian\nI think did make an interesting point on Twitter he responded to this not only by saying the first thing he said was I don't know what Jerry meant by that number one wide receiver comment but I'm darn short that I Would have kept the chains moving\nThen he went on to say that you know it Jerry's right because I was not very we got defensive did you see this you got defensive he was like I was never really scheme to the ... the number one target was Jason wouldn't and so to me that was kind of crybaby us by does Brian or when I was a scheme to the office\nSo does ... everybody looks bad in this like nobody looked\nLike it and this is all coming I guess\nI guess the question was\nDo you think you have a legitimate target in Dallas right now\nThat might have been the question and Jerry Jones might have gone defensive and said hey we haven't had a legitimate target a legitimate target in the years so we talked about on the first hour adjacent Garrett hot seat level look\nWhen it comes to the number one target in Dallas that year they don't have one this year and to me that isn't necessarily I I take blame away from back a little bit\nBut the question does have to be asked does more blame go on Jason carrot or does more blame going the general manager in my opinion it's on the general manager I Do think Jason's scare it\nHas a hot do you have about seven or eight only because and and I know your answer is going to be the only because uh I think someone has to fall this year if Dallas is often continues to struggle and I think it will be Jason Guerra Bobby\nJones doing hits on the radio like why\nWhy is he doing that he\nIs he's the owner and the president and all that good you're Jonny doing all that he didn't get should be doing all the ...\nJohn Maher the giants owner does not do any radio he doesn't do any threat to the Houston Texans own or do any press he don't need to I don't think he he doesn't\nHave to have the time he doesn't need to why is it is a good point\nWhy is he talking on the radio why do you scheduled head yeah All right let me give you Jason Garrett's numbers one playoff it's it's ... it's it's very Jones that's why\nDoes Mark Cuban do hits on the radio do you think\nNot anymore he did he used to it probably isn't that funny that the two most involved donors in sports they're both in Dallas like by a long shot like humans just right behind the bench and Jerry Jones you he's available for comment on any given day he's probably available for comment\nFor the halftime report Jerry you want to cut down with radio the flagship in Dallas to say hey Jerry can we get you every single halftime show just get your opinion yeah me to a A R okay I'll be up there\nOkay so Jason gear let me just give you the numbers real quick one playoff one in seven season three playoff appearances total and at fifty four percent when it percentage yeah I think it's about time we start looking at the head coach\nUm but I Do really believe that the in this situation Bobby like specifically this year [noise] the ... and very much to work with if you're the towel cowboys whatever Steven car\nI when we come back Bobby's college picks and my lack of the week in the NFL we taught gambling next\nOvernight [noise] the ring\nSweet Caroline I'm going to make things you know in between the job of the eighth and the bottom of the eighth amendment Marco though I Can't stand so I don't know why they do this to Fenway Park so it really annoys me I don't like it whatsoever they do it and everybody thanking me down like ... nine to one they'll put this crap on these shows and\nI still I I always perplexing there's always shocked to always sweet Caroline the song that the red Sox picked a saying in between the inning not the red Sox players but the red Sox organization is a song that goes\nOn live\nNear me like wired up\nA bunch of drunk people I guess\nNow by now they know every word of the song they're just screaming it out for a man of Fenway Park when they do that and the ... you get to the bottom of the so I don't have to deal with this crap anymore was ...

I mean they have or the starter then unfortunately for them that wasn't enough maybe like the area\nDo you think Terry Frank calling his job is in jeopardy should be in jeopardy this the team that is falling apart now\nTwice over the last couple of years in the play offs haven't gone to the C. S. I. I I was hearing some commentary today like anybody But Frank Kona like Terry Frank Kona has the pedigree well up the bullpen just dies have to execute and they just did not the bullpen had eleven ER ray or they go out get Donaldson\nFrank has the pedigree well up the bullpen just die to execute and they just did not the bullpen had like an eleven ER ray or they go out get Donald to know what do you think of Terry Franklin his job security\nI Will be safe I mean remember when he came to Cleveland that was not a popping destination and part of the reason that's become sort of a model franchise is because of Franco to leadership but I Know you know this is yeah the second consecutive October that\nYou know Cleveland has disappointed but at the same time as they were clearly it's all the Jose Ramirez ... style than we're Hitler until the ninth inning of game ... right is it really is fall the Andrew Miller and Cody Allen fall apart and has it really is all the trouble of our\nMade it to throw in there as I say no to all that and lots of member you know the reason we have these expectations for Cleveland is in part because of how Frank managing twenty sixteen when he leverage level then overcame some weaknesses won a big of a playoff game of Ryan merit starting and you know they found themselves in the world series\nAnd world went away from winning a championship so you know I understand uh the\nThe I guess the temptation to blame brand Conan maybe wonder if they should get a new voice than that but no I think he should be safe and I don't I don't know if they'll ever fired\nHim and it might be one of those situations maybe this was hired\nYeah it's hard to understand are just so you can follow him on Twitter at ... Anderson a staff writer for CBS Sports major league baseball I'm really glad you mentioned that you just mentioned because I Want to talk about the Yankees here for a second you can't blame sprint Kona for the fall of those hitters I think that as a point I think it's so easy in baseball\nSpecifically baseball to go to the manager and pinpoint all the blame when things don't go right in the play offs it's easy to make the manager a scapegoat so I look at what happened to the Yankees play offs in that in their home games this year\nA CSA ... I think as a Yankee fan than I Am more disappointed and the performance is OCC Sebastian emily's Severino at home against Boston three and four pitchers then I Am a boon than I Am upset\nAbout boon decision making in terms of like my emotion as a fan more disappointment towards the players than I Am upset at the ... what are your thoughts on Boone and him keeping San Marino and see just about the in the game in game three and four\nWell let me start by saying that I agree that I think in October we have a tendency to focus too much on the managerial aspects of the game and you know really shift from the regular season you know if this happened in August we've probably don't we haven't talked about it because it happened\nUnder a bright life we all want to be you know armchair manager so to speak yeah studying\nGas or something some cases birth gas and I say that only to say that yeah it was kind of first guessing boom last night and a endgame for and the reason for that because\nYou know the Yankees strain is that whole thing or one of their strengths as you say is that bullpen and this makes sense to me\nTo leverage it in a way where your maximizing your chances of winning and I think the most ridiculous part of the stuff Marino game was not that he you know ... to go back there for a number happening you know try to get through\nA never ending or whatever but the decision making the made one he brought in his reliever and yes I just don't understand why you would bring in land when the F ... green unless you're just looking for Lincoln and if you're looking for a link why are you continuing to work ... can be why\nAre you continuing to warm green after when was then and before he had really given up you know a bunch of run so I don't know that part of his little got you know what I mean now he's in line Aaron Buddhism and his birth these in the right manager was never manager before the first postseason going up against a pretty good theme if he went up against the weaker theme\nThis might not even matter and remembered Joe Jr already has some similar issues last year when he didn't challenge or hit by pitch so I mean no managers perfect and we have to keep in mind even though it's very easy to use that blame everything on the manager of the time of year\nI I Know and and look I think they're already had his moment to look to moments are shined even so much brighter when they are good managerial decision like sorority last year piecing together eight innings of his bullpen when Severino gives you nothing that was a brilliant move but then like you said you have the other side everything\nIs just exemplified in the playoffs and I think specifically in baseball does the light is shining brighter positively or negatively on the manager but I Want to go to the national league here I'm\nKind of chances are you've given Milwaukee against LA I think they'll walk you starting pitching as drastically over a cheap up to this\nPoint I'm shocked I'll be honest with you are to I Am shocked I had Milwaukee out a long time ago I thought the cops\nAre going to win this division I am genuinely just really shocked that they are at this point what kind of change you give them against the Dodgers\nBut I think the Dodgers and sick and\nWhen the bats are hot hot you know and um you know ... ready to step up yeah especially in the bottom line up and if you do keep Korea and the seven oh yeah I was just going to say that yeah keep him in that sentence by because he's going to see a lot of great pitchers come as a way because they're going to say oh this is not the same conference gr\nWell and just in general as a rule of thumb you throw better pitches to seven eight nine because you want them to put the ball and play like one two three and four you might throw slider as in the dirt but in general in baseball you believe you can get seven eight and nine out by pitching chores\nAnd so by putting Korea there there's a lot of upside and there's not there's no downside\nLike of crave those on over for ... from the satisfy you say okay well courageous not back and forth you just take that on the chin if you're an Astros fan but a payoff could be potentially what we saw in that final game against the Indian where he is heading in that seven off right now we're getting dirty and I'll see as the eye

I I just didn't\nBelieve that the New York Yankees should've played this game and I did not believe the Yankees should've played game three like the Oakland Athletics played the playing game we saw how that worked out for Oakland itself\nI don't believe you can play this bullpen game starting in any number three specifically tonight\nThe CSA ... had a run on second and there was two outs and uh at that point it was one to nothing and my dad said at that point you should take see the ... out of the game and I'm thinking to myself you know what\nIt is so easy ... and ... it's going to join the show forty pass the our our ... our covers major league baseball for CBS Sports and all asking this question\nTo a certain point you have to trust your players and I do think that there is too much of a spotlight\nNegative and positive\nThat it shined on the managers during post season play in other words we give too much positive credit and too much negative credit to manage oriole decisions that happen in the postseason I mean ... they're like seriously ...\nTo negative credit to manage oriole decisions that happen in the postseason I mean ... they're like seriously ... cubs fans are thinking of themselves there was a story that came out after the cubs wants to play a game that the cops should do if this Joe ... is he's safe\nOK Joanna managed a brilliant game I thought against the Colorado Rockies it just didn't turn out your way\nOkay players make place managers make decisions obviously I just think too much credit and too much discredit overall in the course of major league baseball playoff games too much of that goes on the manager\nAnd so basically what happened tonight is ... and it happened over the last two nights for the Yankees it's real simple to think okay so you can hammer boon if you want\nBut two things happen\nYeah one one series coming back to the Bronx you won the last seven games you're Yankee fan you're looking at that and you're saying they've won their last seven games\nOkay yeah they're you're suppose in a fluid Severino on the mound endgame number three one of the plane gave you gotta have trust in it you got to have trust in ... you write in died sometimes with the guys that you trust and unfortunate for the Yankees they they died\nBut I I Do believe that it was the right decision that Aaron Boone made in both of these games\nTo at least try to see the ... out and keep them in for the third inning you enter a runner on again one I think two outs runner on second you're telling me you want to go to the bullpen and that sense you're telling me that you don't want to see if the the the ...\nWho's been pretty good all year can pull that out\nYou have to trust your players at a certain point and the bottom line is seven Reno and the the ... did not execute and sometimes that happens Jose Ramirez an ad went on corn on the own where oh for over in the series with the Cleveland Indians against the Houston Astros are you taking those guys out\nAn ad that number Seventeen combined them again number three no you have to ride and die with your guys somehow\nSo from a pitching point of view here Yankee fans tonight and you're listening\nI kind of support boom\nNow here's the other thing the Yankees scored four runs total at home again let's look at this from a thousand feet above the Yankees scored four runs total total at home against the red Sox number three pitcher and the red Sox number four pitcher\nSo excluding the boon decision making for one second I Know it's hard to do excluding that decision making for just one second you cannot if if I told you that at the beginning of the series that that was going to happen you score Fort runs total and the two games at home when you come back time one the one\nYou don't deserve to win the series and the ... against a one hundred when when soccer team you don't deserve to win the series you cannot expect a different result\nThe at bat that is John Carlos Stanton had\nIn the ninth inning first and second I Believe it was maybe it was ... was bases loaded first and second nobody out one out whatever is John Carlos standing you bring him in from Miami and this is supposed to be your guy he failed in a gigantic moment in a miserable way that was the worst step that\nI've seen in a year of any baseball player maybe I'm drastically overreacting 'cause I'm hot in the moment now but my goodness Bobby how bad was that you're swinging on a one one pitch on a slider that hit the left batter's box\nHorrible and then you strike out on a pitch that didn't quite hit the left batter's box but was so off the plate\nYou players have to make place players have to execute and the ... and then you add again Sanchez at one pop up\nThat that John Carlos ... they had Gary Sanchez behind the plate so I think might be legally half blind on a change of poisoning with across the ... that's not on the the ... that's not on Aaron Boone Gary Sanchez not able to catch the baseball\nSo again you can get a Yankee fan you get a hammer Aaron Boone and tomorrow you'll hear the red Sox perspective tomorrow I Would just want to give you the the Yankee perspective

I mean they have for starters and unfortunately for them that wasn't enough to make that like the theory\nDo you think Terry Brant Cohn his job is in jeopardy should be in jeopardy this the team that is falling apart now\nTwice over the last couple of years in the play offs haven't gone to the C. S. I. I was hearing some commentary today like anybody bought free and Conan like Terry Franklin has the pedigree\nOverlook the bullpen just dying to execute and they just did not the bullpen had like an eleven ER ray or they go out get Donaldson I what do you think of Terry Franklin of his job security\nI think he's safe I mean remember when he came to Cleveland that was not a popping the nation and part of the reason that's become sort of a model franchise is because of Franco to leadership but I Know you know this is yeah the second consecutive October that\nYou know Cleveland has disappointed but at the same time as they were clearly\nIs all the Jose Ramirez ... style than were hit list until the ninth inning of game ... right there really is all the Andrew Miller and Cody Allen salt art and has it really is full of a Traveller Bauer\nMade it to throw in there as I say no to all that and lots of member you know the reason we have these expectations for Cleveland is in part because of how Frank managing twenty sixteen when he ... over claimed some weaknesses want to have big of a playoff game of Ryan merits starting\nAnd you know they found themselves in the world series and world went away from winning a championship so you know I understand uh the the\nI guess the temptation to blame brand Conan maybe wonder if they should get a new voice than that but no I think you should be safe and I don't I don't know if they'll ever fired him and it might be one of the situation we just retired\nYeah hard to understand our gas you can follow him on Twitter and are under ... Anderson a staff writer for CBS Sports major league baseball's I'm really glad you mentioned that you just mentioned because I Want to talk about the Yankees here for a second you can't blame Frank Kona for the most of those hitters I think that that is a point I think it's so easy in baseball\nSpecifically baseball to go to the manager and pinpoint all the blame when things don't go right in the play offs it's easy to make the manager a scapegoat so I look at what happened in the Yankees playoffs in that in their home games this year\nA CC ... emily's Severino I say as a Yankee fan than I Am more disappointed in the performance is OCC Sebastian emily's Severino at home against Boston three and four pitchers then I Am a boon than I Am upset\nAbout boon decision making in terms of like my emotion as a fence more disappointment towards the players than I Am a ... at the ... what are your thoughts on the moon and him keeping ... arena when cc is about the in the game in game three and four\nWell let me start by saying that I agree that I think in October we have a tendency to focus too much on the managerial aspects of the game and you know really chef from the regular season you know this happened in August we've probably don't even talk about it because that happened under the bright lights we all want to be you know armchair manager so to speak\nYeah second guess or something some cases for gas and I'd say that only to say that yeah it was kind of first got him boom last night and a endgame for the reason for that because\nYou know Yankee strength is that whole thing or one of their strengths as you say is that bullpen and this makes sense to me\nTo leverage it in a way where your maximizing your chances of winning and I think the most ridiculous part of the game was not that he was suffering I go back there for a number happening you know try to get through\nA never ending or whatever but the decision making the made when he brought in his reliever and yes I just don't understand why you would bring in land when yes Adam ... green unless you're just looking for links and if you're looking for ... why are you continuing to ward ... give me\nWhy are you continuing to warm green after when was then and before he had really given up\nYou know a bunch of run so I don't know that part of his little guys you know what I mean I'll keep in mind Aaron Buddhism and his birth these in the right manager was never manager before this is the first post season is going up against a pretty good team if he went up against the weaker team\nThis might not even matter and remembered Joe Jr already has some similar issues last year when he didn't challenge to hit by page so I mean no manager perfect and we have to keep that in mind even though it's very like you said blame everything on the manager of the time of year\nThat I Know and and look I think you're already had his moments moments are shined even so much brighter when they are good managerial decisions like sorority last year piecing together eight innings of his bullpen when San Marino gives you nothing that was a brilliant move but they're like you said the other side everything\nIs just exemplified in the playoffs and I think specifically in baseball\nThe light is shining brighter positively or negatively on the manager but I Want to go to the national league here um\nChances are you've given Milwaukee against LA I think Milwaukee's starting pitching has drastically over a cheap to this point I'm shocked I'll be honest with you are I Am shocked I add Milwaukee out a long time ago I thought the cops are going to win this division I am genuinely just really shocked that they are at this point what kind of changes you give them against the Dodgers\nSo I Will refer to you Bobby is it a yes or no Ken I hop on like could I like let's say you're out this weekend for ... number one against the or the red Sox and and I own a an Astros hat\nAnd I wanted to join your group and try and blend in and be an Astros fan\nCould would you allow me to do that I Am totally accept any answer that you tell me oh just what you did last year we may\nYeah yeah after the editor shows me the Yankees in seven games and the championship you jumped on that show than I did I Believe I started wearing Astros\nJerseys to the station yeah I Do believe okay so is that a violation can't will you allow\nMe to happen now you can take your time no we we did that's fine I understand this is a difficult question and I'm not I'm not desperate here either way I'm just wounded like you see these cuts they're really open right now\nSo I Would like to cheer for your team 'cause I live in the city [noise] ah and I hate the red Sox you can mall that over our number one is in the votes will find out the obvious answer an hour to us over there [noise]\n[noise] I'm boarding WMA not while you were born Africans\nAnd online at nine forty WMA dot com\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Richard ...

E. C. team is going to get in and potentially will have Clemson Ohio State\nUh Georgia and Alabama and that would potentially my doomsday scenario here see believe Notre Dame out is that realistic thought that that could happen or do you think in that scenario the committee would put undefeated Notre Dame in instead of that one last SEC team\n[noise] no I think it is a pretty realistic scenario um you know a kind of gets 'cause most deserving versus best team debate and you know I think if you if you match up the loser of potentially the loser of the FCC championship game\nWhether that she Georgia or Alabama on a new trivia I Would take Alabama or Georgia but then if you look at the most deserving part of that Notre Dame running the table um with wins over Michigan Stanford Virginia Tech got us the I mean that's a cruise how resume the end of the year so\nI think it is realistic that Notre Dame cook it left out but at the same time something just tells you that if the end of the year if ... Ohio State in Alabama or all undefeated Notre Dame is the fourth peanut undefeated\nI kinda think the fighting Irish would get that for five but it would be an interesting debate because we haven't seen this type of scenario set up um\nAnd of course there is a lot of football that ... that happened\nNo doubt about it okay now let me ask an out of the box question before we get back into this what is your opinion on how the college football playoff is set up because one of the things that I said last year we kind of\nHave this situation last year when we had Ohio State in Alabama and it was a decision my opinion is why do we have to make this decision why not have a playing games for an Eighteen playoff okay find you don't want the Eighteen playoffs\nWhy not at the plain day because I feel like every year we're going to have that decision to make between do we give it to number five or do we give it to number four and a perfect world what don't we have a plan game like major league baseball does to decide who really is disturbing to play in the playoffs\nYou know I have to admit as a fan of the Pittsburgh Pirates for the baseball wildcard playoff game hasn't really\nGone away a year and a ... but\nYou know I think it realistically the college football playoff um will expand at some point whether that's sixteen or Eighteen\nI kind of like six is kind of a sweet spot because you know we do seem to get\nThe top five to six teams every year that are in contention\nThe hard part about college football is such a weird sport but that's what makes the greatest because it is critical and you also get these years where you have three teams that are deserving there's really not a fourteen years maybe this year it's pretty clear that Alabama's just better than everyone else and we're just going through the motions of the season\nSo it it's really hard to kind of hone in\nOn what makes the most sense because you hear about a year just changes\nI still think at the end when you get into twenty twenty five twenty thirty territory I think the college football playoff would expand to enter sixteen so I you know I guess that's not necessarily a fan of the playing game but I don't play we will expand\nThe lesson is our guest accountable editor for Apple I suppose you could follow his work on where apple I swear I don't have money on Notre Dame I just watch this team and I I Would like to see what their maximum capabilities are having said that I Want to see the same thing with Georgia Alabama clumps that allows states I think all of those let me just look in terms of the good the landscape of the season all those seats\nJust deserve to be in some kind of a playoff\nWhat about the fact well what about Washington Washington wins out honestly say this was not an impressive victory on the road against UCLA you have the leader early yet UCLA comes back later it can we eliminate the pack twelve at this point of the season for participating in the final four teams\nYou know I I don't think we kind of limited him yet but I think it's becoming more of a long shot and not only does washing not only the Washington struggle\nWith UCLA last week that went over or they lost to offer new starting to the horrors Auburn regrets does not to mention you know why you popped in the top twenty five and then they get handled by state last week\nSo you know looking ahead at at Washington schedules this game Saturday against Oregon is critical I think Washington to women women credibly\nTo sort of put their stake in the ground and say we are the clear favorite of the act twelve and we are just head and shoulders\nBetter than everyone else I think it's going to be tough though because looking at their schedule they have Colorado they had the ... at Washington state ... victory but at the end of the year\nI twelve and one Washington team that doesn't really have a mark he went and what happens with Oregon of course I just don't know that he will be able to jump in Ohio State or Clinton or someone like that so\nI think it's a long shot I think there are certainly window and by the week but as you in college football I'm always hesitant to write someone off yeah because how crazy this he goes and you just never know when you get in front of them for\nSpeaking of craziness I'm going to give you three games from last week and you rank them one through three in terms of surprising results Mississippi State bleeding all burned twenty three to nine\nFlorida over LSU twenty seven tonight teen Texas over Oklahoma forty to forty five number one for you is this is the most surprising thing from the weekend and number three is totally surprising\nI think the most surprising was Texas and I think it's just the way that Texas control of the game from the opening math and it was the fact that it was so high scoring you know I I thought is Texas but when\nIt would be kind of an ugly twenty seven to twenty four fight they would be able to to run the ball they would take a lot of time off the clock there the fence will get thought\nThey did some of the things they could have happened to continue to score and score quick\nThe kind of got into that back and forth game um but obviously a huge win protected and that they start to look at what can happen player in the even the teams could potentially rematch\nI'm In the big tall championship game I think I was surprised by Mississippi baby number than I was ... at LSU for her and I was you could put over to the third one in that mix in Mississippi State too because they had struggled so much on off in\nAn awkward defensively one of the better teams in the S. E. C. and of course the Florida now as they played so many close game in recent years any any kind of came down to whichever team was do better on the on the ...\nIs it the SCC and of course the Florida now as they played so many close game in recent years any any kind of came down to whichever team was do better on the on the in the trenches and which one of the turnover battle and that was for it or\nSee Lathan is our guest college football editor for Apple on sports coverage college football you can follow Steve's work on Twitter at\nApple on Steve All right I Want to get out of this year for one second because there's a and M. game I was watching this first of all I was frustrated because they happen to be the same as the U. S. sci fi and I was at a bar that will you know we've had a cover charge\nAnd so they just as the game was going into overtime every single TV in the bar turn to the U. S. C. fight which was really frustrating living down here in Texas everybody was doing at the screen it was a very interesting experience\nTexas saying them do you think they can be a top ten team next year\nI think so I I mean I think when you start to look at the SEC max the you either eat is Alabama or Georgia\nLSU Florida still at the top but Texans saying in starting to put the pieces together I'm I'm curious how the ... developed over the next two months especially you know the opposite of line has been a little bit of a concern there still needs to get better\nThat's right entree leadership one day live stream is a full day leadership are bent that you can stream from anywhere you'll see me along with every day millionaires and retirement expert Chris Hogan pastor and founder of the ... version Bible lap Bobby Grunwald and founder and CEO of charity water Scott Harrison\nDiscover what these top leaders due to disrupt the marketplace you can download the event workbook interact with other attendees thorough live feed and get all the same grade content as if you were attending in person know travel required may get a day for you and your team to watch to gather\nRegistered today Dave Ramsey dot com slash of ants or text anyone be twenty Eighteen to\nForty four to twenty two for more information\n[noise] time mourning WMA W warn Afghans\nAnd online at nine forty WMA use on\n\nThe news\nI'm Scott golden bird with one hundred and fifty mile an hour wins hurricane Michael's closing in on Florida's panhandle ABC's peak combs as in Panama City beach\nTower is starting to flicker here we're starting to see a lot of free falling out of the trees as many of these tall pine trees Harvey sideways by the when the rain coming in sideways now has the wind continues of all harder and harder with every family comes through\nSpeaking at the White House moments ago President Trump said after the category ... storm sweeps through FEMA is ready to step in as soon as it goes\nBy going to be working and we've got food supplies food change we're working with all of\nA say Sergei Michael's expected to travel into Georgia tonight then to South Carolina which is extending a state of emergency as that continues to recover from Hurricane Florence on Capitol Hill this morning FBI Director Christopher Wray talked about the FBI investigation into Supreme Court justice Brett\nKavanaugh FBI Director Christopher Wray descended the scope of the ... investigation into sexual assault allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nI've spoken with our background investigation specialists and they have a short me that this was handled in the way that is consistent with their experience and the standard process\nRain dating knowledge been scope was limited but he noted that background investigations are very different than criminal wind alley Rogan ABC News the Capitol Hill\nAnd there's been an arrest connected to Saturday's fatal limousine crash in upstate New York\nThe son of the owner of ...
