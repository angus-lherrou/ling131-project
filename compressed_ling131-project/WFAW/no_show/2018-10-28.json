Cheech is there one of those three days it stands out to use the most\nI mean you you got all of these games all three of them looked fantastic on paper um I'm going to say the one I'm most excited to watch is rams Packers and just really want to see what ... can do when\nHe's facing an off instead of just going to put points on them nonstop and I just want to see how the Packers respond to that so I'm excited for that game and and excited to plant I'm the one that stands out the most for me in terms of\nDaily fantasy and the combination of salaries for player salaries and expectations is definitely I'm just getting back on the train that I've been writing I'm running on the show and it's basically the game I told them at every single week last week in a ... ... it was bigger Mayfield including one\nThis week is the bangles taking on the hassle is box defense\nYou gotta keep attacking this\nTerrible bumps the fence until they can turn it around and\nAnd the hassle is box defense\nYou gotta keep attacking this terrible terrible bunks defense until they can turn it around and so the one that's exciting most from a daily fantasy perspective is that game and specifically the bangles\nI'm so at quarterback Andy Dalton comes in significantly cheaper than\nGolf Rogers in homes now moms is my boy if you ever want to pay off from a homes do it he's the man you are going to he's he's got a floor that is ridiculous his feeling is out of this world so I'm always going from a home but you know he's Ninety two hundred on fans will this week is an example\nAnd also you can get for Seventy eight hundred and that's a solid fourteen hundred or that you can apply to a different position and adult in can get me twenty two twenty three and ... says you know twenty eight twenty nine if I can save at\nFourteen hundred in salary and apply it to an extra starts in my line of that is a strategy worth exploring\nAnd Kevin ... is a very very hot topic of the shows 'cause we're all a liar and a dynasty weekend last year or my team had a lot of injuries tables near the top and I saw the big deal with and what I call the homes new Rome I got to be this go at all but I think Ron\nStill sour about it's about time we talk about the home she's always talking there for I ... ... a\nYear now since the war is now you're going to have homes to flaunt in his face for the next twelve years um the ... in my dynasty league I tried to make a trade from homes and they all their owner just wasn't even listening you know like that and there's now offer you're gonna make me that's that's that's kind of work so nice try Mike yeah\nI I just got lucky man I don't consider it scale you know it was pure luck that everyone again these promote code asked that way that's ...

do we have ... we have boy I assume Joe mix in the hospital with the bangles do you like any of the guys on the buck side already stopped him on the bangles side\nI'm oh the bagels it's very tough to nail down this box all fence and kind of get an idea of where the points of the the fancy points are coming from\nJames Winston is going to be popular this week I'm not a gene miss Winston believer so it's probably not somebody that I'm going to have a ton of exposure to and said look\nOver on my drafting screen Wednesday at the same price as Geron gossip and sure Jared golf has girly and you know in the ... there's that fear that they can lean on the run and any time and we've seen that the last couple of games that weren't competitive for them\nBut I mean given golf over Winston all day so a Packers deepest is terrible to ... it's not good but I mean they're bad against the run in the past so there was a sort of\nAll right or they just going to lean on girly\nBut I haven't seen where the rams do that but they do is they they come out firing on all cylinders in the first half and then when they take a massive lead the only non early in the second half and that's when he does his eating right and and so you know if you're if you're holding girlie that we are hoping he gets that third touched down or you know some time in the second half\nAnd if you're if you're holding off in his past catches your hope is that the opposing team will keep the game close so\nThe best case scenario for a charity off would be if Aaron Rodgers is having a good game throwing Chinese to um you know to bomb the Adams or\nA journal while saying or Jimmy grammar whoever he's throwing those touchdowns too because the more they're scoring the more the rams have to counter so part of the the fun of daily fantasy is knowing that\nThat's a that's a universal truth that will happen so knowing that we build our line up around those themes\nSo I definitely don't yeah I could build a lineup around if I think ... if I'm building on a brown ... I I'm going to put some Packers offensive players in there just because the scenario in which ... is throwing\n... putting up massive numbers involves the Packers doing well also um I'd like to do that with the boss uh and\nMy dolphin call but I just can't figure out which book\nWeapon will be used I mean to Sean Jackson they have to tighten that they use a Mike evidence isn't you know as consistent as you would hope so they spend the ball around enough that I don't think you need to bring it back on on the Gulf implied but I wouldn't do that on the Rogers um\nGolf sort of in on the on that game\nBut let me ask you this while we're sticking with these days because they do seem to be the best game to look at any chance he would take a flyer in a lot of on case ... is airing that that can be high scoring game to all of the chief deep I have a better as of late their social Syria holes in that the ... cent change because I\nPut off a lot of points similar to what you're saying here with the Packers having to respond to the ... the rams the Broncos cannot respond to the chase\nYeah I mean are are they capable of responding I like Emmanuel Sanders in the game I'm as an individual one on one thing but I think case kingdoms\nLack of talent is to ... it's concerning here so\nIn a week where we have these super stars on the ice cubes fine as they ... what we call a tournament site where you might use him in a massive tournament and he's going to be lower loans and he has\nShown about twenty five cents to a point type ceiling he has thrown for three hundred yards on more than one occasion so I mean it's not like Keenan can never put a good game together but\nPart of part of the deal with the number is and part of the really with a cheap seat fences there much worse on the road they're much better at home so I think at home I'm going to trust the cheap seats tends to be at least okay and the one piece and I don't mind from the Broncos\nIs going to be manual Sanders and maybe a little Lindsey is always Freeman is not play\nFair enough raw and you have any like wide receivers anything like that you have on your mind you want to ask Kevin about well\nSays you just brought up a Mayo Sanders I Would say a pivot from Sanders could possibly be the rookie Cortland sudden um he's been emerging in this off ants and the\nUm that's the easy answer and I'm definitely glad he took the easy answer easy way out of ... but for me uh we we talked about um earlier but for me the Denver Broncos I expected more from this team what the pieces that they added um yes they're young but they have a solid defence I'm On the other side of the football\nTo kind of makes a big place put them in and you give them a short field Vance Joseph to me I just I haven't seen anything from Vance Joseph ... to make me think that he's actually going to turn this around\nAgain I think that John Elway also might be sitting on the hot seat right next to them um you know what the decisions that they made as an organization\nAnd in drafting these players you know like a chat Kelly even though he was a meal aspect of the draft but you know my point is they just haven't really hit on these players ... son might be the exception to the rule and uh you don't fill one of the you know another player that uh come on for them but um again I I think that this week just sort of a losing streak for them\nIs an Iranian or what ever since the pain banning move which was just kind of a security blanket and a um a a a way for them to kill time that's how they could buy a while they were going to do with their organizations they haven't really done anything smart in my opinion I mean\nThey add they they just the pain is gone way down hill I think you're right about Joseph\nOr they could even more right about LA vaccine myself first although I didn't have to go to a general managers of presidents or whatever it might be\nTime mourning WMA not while you were born

which way it's going to be what we would go back to where they struggle against the Broncos they didn't really struggled as the Broncos they just bad at all night but they still found a way to get things done\nWhat I like about my home so much is and it's something we kind of talking early but it's starting to still playing out\nHis we've seen young quarterbacks with teams had weapons but they

smart guy we saw with jak Prescott and just prior early right he's he's gotten away from that immediately and that's that's impressive that's impressive ... that's usually something you grow into he's he's done it right off the bat\nYeah I mean that's something that I Drew Brees their Rogers does right now where this rather well you don't know who they're going to pass to do because they trust themselves without getting the ball so that person ... exactly and that's and that's exactly where that cross guy and you know I mean even though I Know he's not up for rookie of the year he kinda is him and he's worried about SARS\nAnd monkey rare I mean it's it's he's he's as close as you get it's like it's like a college player that was a sophomore but he played a couple of seconds in a game in his freshman year it's still it's still relatively new to you know ... they're all from a number one\nThe rams and the only undefeated team is not because that's why I put a number one you can be undefeated and be bad undefeated depending on your schedule this is undefeated good undefeated or their number one in rushing they are in the top ten and passing they don't give up a lot of points in these core a lot of points that's a great recipe for being undefeated so they are my number one\nGene that when you're talking undefeated I mean early this year we we kept leaving the dolphins out of the top five 'cause we just said you know they're undefeated but they're not they're not\nAs soon as you and I put them in the top five they go on the Olympics are going to lose it so we were right all along with Rand seem it's Super Bowl or bus I don't have any one stop but I'm the it's almost like watching Alabama\nPlay is a rarity no better\nYeah really I mean we even talked about what may be San Francisco will put up a good fight like they did with Green Bay you know they did if they want a nine point who are like twenty nine points\nRight and the Broncos kept the closer we lose cold that was really it put a Southern California there are playing you know they don't want him seeing snow freezing weather to Denver is trying to manipulate the system we get it now yeah exactly I mean

I I Am giving them a little credit for what they did against the Packers are kind of get a little little hangover effect even though I was kinda cool even though they forgot to show for the ramps

I'm I was I worked over nights and I was laying but it was like one one one thirty in the afternoon and I'm laying in bed and I hear\nAnd literally freaks me out I was one o'clock in the afternoon and this was when most home burglaries are right because they don't want home\nRight then like the cars on the cars in the garage and they think no one's own I'm thinking oh my God what do I do I I had no idea what I was going to do that you grab your aluminum vacuum cleaner ... yeah that's what I Wish I had that was my world point I Wish I had a aluminum pipe to know\nWhere is that coming from like is that an old time that he was being re famous\nHalf my vacuum doesn't happen illuminating papers\nPlastic stick centuries that go on the on the vacuum cleaner like if I Want to get between the cushions of the couch and I grab a little about one of the plastic things with a little tiny little tiny opening where I can get the crumbs in the in the in the in the ... the cushion sheets\nBut it doesn't have an aluminum pipe that sounds like very Nineteen Seventy ... type of vacuum cleaner that when they made a lot of noise that were really scary\n[laughter] which I think I over the head with that but you see that day I was it was it ended up just being at the door was slightly drug nobody really quite quite shut it all the way for them a couple of wind blew it open there was no\nBut I was walking downstairs I freaked out that somebody was in my house rummaging through our stuff and of course I didn't hear anything on the U.S hello yes hello how are you feeling stuff high\nBut just to show you were the good stuff is yes exactly ... so this nightmare scenario that I went through I thought somebody was in my house actually happened to those couple\nThe backup quarterback for the Denver Broncos who by the way he's the most popular guy on the team right now\nBy me next to von Miller because they think he's going to be the next savior was in these people's homes on their couch talking in coherently and got hit with an aluminum pipe from a vacuum cleaner you\nKnow I couldn't spin that story out if you gave me twenty five years to come up with a crazy crazy scenario\nIf you said hey I Need you to take an athlete pulled him out of a weird situation have him that it turned out really strange and just make it as bizarre is you can't [noise]\nI wouldn't come up with backup quarterback in somebody's home on a couch mumbling hit with vacuum cleaner tool a mad lib\nWas never going to occur in my in my brain but what's even scarier about this is that he had nothing in the system\nYeah I Know what you're doing I mean ... now that could be actually\nMy brain but what's even scarier about this is that he had nothing in the system yeah I Know what was he doing I mean ... and actually now that can be actually serious like I can be scary yeah I mean he had no drugs or alcohol is like All right you're\nJust was this uh you just heard Kelly lock the door which show which one is here today\nWhen you get possessed was that you know was this a party held at the Stanley Hotel and all of a sudden he just got possessed\nExactly oh how did you come back\nCompletely one hundred percent clean and mumbling in coherently and I [noise]\nI don't know\nI don't know this is just a weird story but I guess von Miller throws a mean bash though they're not and we need to go up there and they said they do like a lot of fun I can you know did I mean I don't know or\nWas it a manual Sanders who was dressed as a Dave Chappelle character yes he was carrying around a little Ziploc bag am cocaine\nThat's all right I was I was I was a it was going through um Twitter to see what Jim Kelly had to say about his nephews ordeal I didn't see anything from Jim Kelly\n\n\n[noise]\nIs produced by NBC\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News Nightline the films in Pittsburgh where the man accused of shooting up a synagogue yesterday killing eleven people and wounding six is him self\nNow recovering from gunshot wounds you suffered battling police ABC's Aaron ...

C. favorites not favorites\nBut one of the teams people like coming into the season they're three and five they lost an eagles twenty four to eight team and how about that story Jake where he had three guys detained in London for the jaguars because of the fact they didn't want to pay a barbell\nUnbelievable and not to start you were looking for no jags and you know blame ... streak of three are being undefeated in London is over with that early game and I\nI thought the eagles would play well I thought the eagles needed the game you know everyone just assuming they're just going to turn it on and when the division like I did last week yeah they got to start winning games and it was important game for both sides with the eagles are the better team and\nI don't think there's any surprise there you know the thing you wonder for Jacksonville is you know what do they do now you're three and five or two games behind the Texans you already lost to the Houston Texans earlier this season\nDo they make a move or they just gonna continue to ride it out with like ... and you know if they continue to ride with ... I don't think there's jak seems going anywhere\nWell I mean what what kind of move that you're talking like Derek car is that the move would be out there for the jaguars\nI don't know if anything out there right now I mean they should have gone after teddy Bridgewater from the jet ... he went in or trade it for when he was available improve the without that yes I Am ... I I it makes sense to me and\nNow they have no ... no one else to blame but themselves to reliably morals was stupid from the get go and you know they're sitting there are three and five and a weak\nDivision you still kind of your luggage over because if you look at the the Texans upcoming schedule they play one team with a winning record it you know and the second half of their year and you got three individual games remain and they're all at home so the Texans aren't perfect position to go out there and when this division now\nAnd what happened Jake pretty simply is dumb around David Caldwell and Tom Coughlin GOP blinded by like boy was having like to see the games in the postseason right against the patriots who we thought up the deepest was atrocious liquid ... both did to them and the super bowl\nAnd deal with the pets which was atrocious they got blinded by that and they thought that was the real for those but if you looked at his career he has games every once in a while that are decent yeah play for does the promise inconsistency so they said oh he's our guy going forward\nAnd they overvalued the I think they thought that they can get by with great defects in morals they were just enough absolutely not face sorry\nThat Seamus Winston throws an interception into the ends up so you have the bangles bringing it out to about twenty five yard line as they were putting a good drive together as you mentioned James went that had scramble for a first down zero zero game James once and throw the touchdown air excuse me there was an interception in the ...\nWell I'll tell you what you look at the bugs and I'm not so sure they're going to be sellers right John Jackson might want to be asking after the bugs are three and three and a writer and the mix it's my boy and he was one in six like the giants and the NFC or you know their Brown's light where you know they're not going anywhere\nSo it it's fascinating to see how that storyline will unfold and watch the outcomes of these games today because this will be the week where if you're a fringe contender a fringe playoff team and you lose\nThat could be the difference in whether or not your organization will become buyers or sellers at the trade that wind which I Believe is on Wednesday of this week so it is\nIt has a theory is is the thirtieth ones\nThat are that would be actually Tuesday so I mean it's coming up and regardless of how your team does this week whether they win or lose that could be a big factor in whether or not they either make a move for a player at the deadline or they become sellers machine that wants to require ...\nAnd get one of the guys that could be available\nStatement a straight line the lions right now they're in a scoreless game at the Seattle Seahawks that game is in Detroit this afternoon they made what I thought was a great trade earlier in the week they got Damon snacks Harrison from\nThe New York giants for a fifth round draft pick a fifth round draft pick for Damon snacks there and that guy is one of the elite\nRunners suffers in the NFL and for alliance team that is three and three trying to compete in that division and if not when the division because Minnesota the clear favorite but at least try to get into the playoffs the lions have been as the science team\nThat was a huge pick up for them getting somebody that could stuffed the run I really like with the line stay there and I thought they kinda stone way from the giants for just that fits round\nA huge contract remaining yeah the ... round the giants ... giants wanted\nDeclares number off the salary cap for next year but I think it's a good move for the lion's share their biggest weakness or one of the worst teams elite stopping the run ... facts Harrison is as good as anybody at stopping their own that's got I'm paid\nBy the giants and the first place when he was with the jets and was arguably the best interior runs ... fell and he's been a very good giant and I I'm fascinated\nWith the giants are doing by the way they're playing the Redskins and there were some of my favorites at home I get to Washington DC met foreign to leading that division and you look at the eagles winning earlier today they had to to keep pace with the Washington Redskins and and the Redskins they should have no problem feeding a giants game by now you just mentioned traded Damien stacks Harrison traded Eli Apple to change\nIt somehow Vegas does not believe in the Washington Redskins but you know what\nIf you're truly going to be a team that can go to the playoffs and when that division there should be a game I don't care if you're on the road against a giants team you got to win and early on do score and that but that to me we're starting to see the line come out and they get all the way down to a point where the giants have one in sexual done nothing for me to sit here and say yeah you know I said why their favorite now\nFor them to actually be favored to win that game going in I mean I was shocked that seems like\nOne of the biggest questions of the week a week eight that you know we talk about the games but then this is where sports and you know gambling we're kind of at this list you know this crossroads where\nWe're talking a lot of our focus is on the point spread and why that is a pick on when you've got a team that is in turmoil like the like the giants are and you've got a team in first place that the Redskins and you can go figure that out\nYeah well that's why as a gambler you look at that line and you say wait\nThere's something fishy here I don't know if I Want to say on this one there's something fishy going on here but\nThe giants yeah in the Eli Apple thing you mentioned is well Jake I liked that pick up from New Orleans they don't have a second cornerback Crowley is not even going to be active today and ... up in the same player was a year ago but still a talent ... apple there's a reason that he was the first round pick now he can't stay healthy that's been an issue and he's under perform so far\nBut maybe they think to yourself OK reunited with his college teammate and Marcia and let them or maybe the saints it's worth taking a chance because the saints right now\nOr at all and team with a thirty nine year old quarterback and Drew Brees\nYou're trying to win a Super Bowl and if he why apple can be\nBetter than can Crowley and you gave away what a fourth in a seventh maybe for Ely apple so I if I'm the saints I mean that's a move I definitely make the we already know the teams all end because they traded a first round pick next year\nTo train up a couple of spots to take markets Davenport in this year's draft so we know the saints would try to win at this moment and taking a shot in Ely apple I kinda like it from the same perspective because\nHey if he doesn't work out great you gave away a fourth and a seven for a guy that could turn out to be a good player\nAnd you look at a change perspective there to give him a third to bringing teddy Bridgewater and counting catastrophic what happened to Drew Brees their season wouldn't be over\nSo say it's making a move same feeling all in their weakness on defense has been stopped in the past you try and get some depth that corner bringing the guy who has town issues of course with injuries but\nI liked that move from the saints perspective there are going all and and I gave them credit for it and by the way update in Detroit matched averages Marvin Jones junior very thirty nine yard touchdown pass lions where they sevens nothing leave with two minutes ago and the first quarter so that game\nA very interesting match up to three and three teams that started I went to and they end up saving the lives of the early lead\nHad yeah can I to tell

and busters today watch every game at Dave and busters Galleria that Thursday Sunday and Monday grab your twenties you want to force light or Miller Lite are you ready for some football head up sixty enrichment and enjoy the games Dave and busters a great place to watch games\nBy the way I was aware that tells you is that Dave and busters last night he told me there was a baseball game on there last night apparently it was\nThe red Sox and the Dodgers they're two teams playing in the world series and apparently now after last night the red Sox have a three to one series elite over the Dodgers I'm not familiar with the situation of the red Sox win one more game they will win the world series\nWhich Roberts will win the world heritage MVP which will helping out his former too yeah which I guess is a big thing in baseball this whole World Series things I set a facetious like Red Sox back\nFrom board nothing yeah the one thing I Will I guess\nYou have to defend Dave Roberts on one thing I did not know this until after the game because I'm thinking to myself what had happened what is he doing apparently rich hill told him to watch 'em like rich he'll sit in the dugout before he went out for the seventh inning to watch me so once he got somebody on base he was worried about it but the thing you can't defend\nHow the hell does he continue to try it right and that's an out there\nThis guy literally every inherited runner seven of them they scored an Arab all the only way to bring them in the game first of all you shouldn't but if you are you cannot give this guy a dirty habit going that can only chance\nFor six ounce again after a failed the night before it's just these managers over managed they don't learn and the president actually had a tweet about unreal last night that was probably the most accurate thing I thought he'd never sent is president the United states basically recalling gay robbers over manager which\nYou know Mr President I respect your opinion and I respect your weight or they could spot on and what lesson I Know we're in football show but that was about as bad as it gets for ah for for a manager and a big spot is the second year in a row people who've had issues with the Robert over managing in the world series and\nThey know what your team went away from a championship and I would be stunned if they don't get it done just Red Sox game it's too good and the fact that LA headache for nothing leading the sixth inning including even that serious I mean that they don't deserve to win the championship after\nThat yeah and I think something is the Dodgers do lose a series now we did see somebody come back and twenty sixteen the cubs were down three one against Cleveland but the red Sox better than that Cleveland team mostly though the red Sox pitching is in a weird position right now where prices on on three days rest and Dale is in pitching even though it was on full rights so clearly sale\nThere is way more to that story with the shoulder then they'd been leading on throughout the postseason but nonetheless I think the other thing is going to look at in terms of just specific moves that he made the bullpen and the theories Dave Roberts is game wanting game to\nTo really not have Ballenger in Muncie in the lineup like those are two a your best five hitters all season long just because of the match up\nJust because of the writing of match up and let the match if you wanted to get Kiki Hernandez in the lineup that just that makes no sense to me whatsoever the fact that oh we got to go with all righty ... just because you think you get a better matchup against the left he was like no I'm Sorry like I get ... numbers\nAren't great against left he's but he's one of my best players I Want him in the line up\nEvery day and the other thing is you don't fear some of the hitters they put in their line if you actually fear Ballenger you're like OK he has holes in a swing but there are certain places I Can't put it or ... months he's gonna hit the ball in the park with some of these writers they put in there you don't really fear that so that's another thing I think a look\nBack and ... just got a quick update in uh Detroit Russell Wilson second touchdown pass just wanted to David more the Seahawks up fourteen to seven on the lions at Ford Field and James Winston through a nother interception his second of the day and the buccaneers still trail\nYeah dish ... Jackson wants out and see why the quarterback not consistent whatsoever so seven or nothing bangles in that game yeah the Denver Broncos in front of the cheese right now seven to three the chiefs just three points than the first quarter of this game they really hammer Denver earlier on in the season and\nRight now I'm about Monday Night game where they were downtown in the fourth quarter and him oh and by that\nThey didn't hammer um they they came back yeah that was the one Philip Lindsey put up good numbers and that came on getting that confused with last Sunday night game where they crush the bangles I guess I was focused on the orange but yeah Denver game to game the first time around and here we go again Denver playing the Kansas City chiefs tough this something we have actually seen the past\nI Would say three weeks or so with the exclusion of that Cincinnati Bengals game if you look back to the patriots game and now you look at this game we've seen the chief's office kind of start slowly which wasn't the case during the regular season but this is now to or to the past three weeks where they have\nGotten off the slow starts which kind of surprises me because usually Andy reads teams are so good in those scripted plays the first Fifteen if you will Jake at the beginning game so another so sorry for the chiefs\nAnd which is you know what ... which is going to happen because the reality is is graded my homes is flying there's going to be a game where you were slows already was it wasn't ... in that first after just the patriots who I Am ended up being forty three forty is the final score an absolute shootouts so\nAt least type of things are going to happen when the young quarterback the highs and lows and he'll be fine and we've seen as a lot\nWith quarterbacks having you know slow start to regain but the chief you know you can't take your foot off the gas or Denver because you give them an ounce or give them an inch I should say and they are going to take advantage of able to beat you that just got through many guys that are such dynamic often suppliers is why they're probably the most complete often tipsy Middle East\nAnd the Panthers again Greg Lawson with a touchdown grab it appears so it's going to be fourteen to nothing Thirteen to nothing I should say extra point is pending yeah Greg Olson from can Newton saw both the Panthers now\nForeigners who won the season and right now they have a six point lead with the extra point on the way\nOver Baltimore so the Panthers traveling well this morning or I should say this afternoon gray though and great to have him back in the lineup if you're the Panthers because you have the weapon out of the backfield now and McCaffrey some of these younger receivers the Devon bunches of the world the DJ mores of the world functions really emerging\nDisease and as a good target for new no side the numbers and to have great loss in in the middle of the field I mean it's really unbelievable it always flabbergasted me that you know he's the first to an end in NFL history to have three consecutive one thousand yards seasons that shocks me because he think Antonio Gates over the years\nNever had that Tony Gonzales never had that but what a weapon it has to have Greg Lawson back in the fact that he died surgery for the second time on his foot is really an underrated story for the Panthers because if he goes out for the season then you're really missing that piece here often that puts you at the top\nAnd would you say that Greg Olson has been able to come back and play well because he did an interview with you when he was injured on your show the breaking since that point ... and not only did he recovered faster from an interview is not buying like in the lead tied in that we know\nSo well and and they're the the Panthers I think are really doing a nice job with his limitations because he's not a guy that's going to get too much between the twenties but if you can\n... if you can allow him to be a red zone option NPR him with a Christian McCaffrey ... he's still not one hundred percent but he he want to limit what he can do continue to keep them on a snap count but you know they're doing a heck of a job with them\nBack to your question though Jake yes I Do think it's about Seventy five percent because he did an interview with me although I can tell you that the man had an awful phone line it was like echoing where I could hear myself\nI Do think it's about Seventy five percent because he did an interview with me although I can tell you this\nThe man had an awful phone line it was like echoing where I could hear myself that really irritates me of that phone but it's great and so what am I going to\nGet ahead phone line but he ... inside you from your question it is you just have to deal with the ...\nYou know it's funny I asked him about remember last year when everybody was up in arms and I understood why that he was calling a game during the ... I think it was the eagles and the rams\nAnd the teams are upset their like weight Greg Olson's calling the game like he can't be in any other meetings because in those meetings you get information from the same as like oh this is what we like to do on third out\nThis is what we like to do at the beginning of the game and the way Greg Lawson cannot be in these meetings and he actually got to call and NFL game well he was still a player announces unbelievable and you know what I noticed about that is great Olson is significantly better than a tight end that currently cause games in the NFL in those games happened on Monday Night football Jason what and oh my God is the horrible\nThat's the one thing I'm Upset about the patriots played on Monday Night I got to deal with that broadcast\nYou'll take away and they're going to destroy a buffalo probably tomorrow night and Derek understand that all got it's got to be out there might have to listen to the game on the ... when that much but you don't take the W\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMhm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMhm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMhm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMhm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "28"}
