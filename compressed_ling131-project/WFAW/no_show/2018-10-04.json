I think he got a ignored mainly because he just played on some awful teams and totally ... finally got there and he had a chance to go to the\nSuper Bowl and Nineteen eighty with the with the team but before that I mean you know I mean you remember and know how God awful the or you were in the seventies for most of the Herald career but I mean you know the size he brought to that position you\nReal big guys to play a ... you know to be that guy can get fifty fifty balls or you know his numbers are you know I was a little upset a couple of last year whenever a two person starting to get some attention and mention is a hall of fame guy\nUh you know I mean in my mind that no conscious Harold Carmichael the only difference is true played on winning teams and they had the misfortune for playing on court changed\nSome are terrible oh\nOh I get no contest cemetery along just on the greatest receivers\nUh football history but\nI mean there are different tiers of players are in the hall of fame\nI mean I think you're Harold hall of fame worthy but uh now I mean that's one of the dilemma as we face goose with you know there is one of the past who was a you know guys were throwing twenty times the game and and now when we think nothing of guys who are on fifty times are getting so\nThat's something we have to judge\nAnd take into account when we look at each Claire\nOkay let me take you back to these guys how was your muscles can where I was only ... not in the hall Karol has increased resumes and you're not even Scott\nYeah uh you know we're certainly the guy that you know I talk to Joe Oregon about him for several years\nWas told at one point that basically we moved on from that era or okay you know a very dumping in picked enough of those guys from the I mean you know and I was one of those guys who played when the war was going on\nUm\nYou know I mean a hall of fame or the in my mind but a majority and tells you they moved on a figured there wasn't a fight was finding any more\nThe course areas liberating because they let me take control of my education learn what I Want to learn and changed my whole life joined\nQuick here for free next door one one to two zero two sides the route of course there and you're going to success ...

you know the greatest of all time in nearly four hundred people\nFor the project and none of them don't know that\nThere is with us today to talk about what you learned about perhaps the most brutal figure in the history of coaching Indian thanks so much for joining\nA bank you guys have the opportunity I appreciate\nYou and you mentioned in your introduction that proved to be the most daunting challenges of your career how so how much of that was a product of Bill Bill checks or unwillingness to see this thing completed\nYeah that was that was part of it and\nI I did my last book on Derek Jeter who was a distant private figure but but that was chicken Jeter times of thousand and and I had a relationship with G are professional one going back to his rookie year I had a non relationship was allergic and uh also infamously wrote a column and two thousand saying that the crap higher in New England was a bad hire\nA so but that's sort of was there as well\nUm I just think the the dollar ticket as you guys know runs a Kremlin like empire and to try to get behind those walls starting from scratch without a relationship with him with him not cooperating with him telling other people not to cooperate\nThere were a lot of hurdles in front of me in a sense\nHe kinda made me better I I think he put obstacles in front of the players to make them better and I I felt sometimes like I was an opponent or maybe even a player\nAnd by doing that or not just not cooperating but asking others to do the same [laughter]\nIt just made me work harder and dig deeper and talk to more people and I think he forgot about some people that I got to and sometimes I felt like I was in a race with him to get to certain people and so in thirty plus years of doing this yeah this was not even close by far the most challenging thing I've ever taken out but also the most rewarding because [laughter]\nI got to the finish line after three years and a lot of blood sweat and tears\nIn what\nHe was the subject the ones who wants to be\nFunny because uh I don't know if you guys know Michel ... he's a columnist with the New York post long time yeah and I was talking with him about whether or not to do it and he said you really want to spend three years living with Bill Belichick\nAnd that that gave\nMe pause I actually I actually took another five weeks after he said that to decide to do it [laughter] um so uh I I always thought he was the most fascinating and mysterious figure in American sports and I don't think there's a close second even if you hate 'em you have to I think admit concede that\nIs pretty fascinating an intriguing and and so that's why I I took it also can being so long as I was in two thousand along with others but\nUm I was sort of the poster boy for the doubters in the media anyway and and I was a very intrigued by how he pulled it off how did that human beings\nDo this dynasty of time in the NFL would you guys know the whole thing is designed to prevent you from doing what he did to schedule the draft free agency the cap as opposed to bring teams at the top down to the middle is not the bottom and elevate the bottom feeders and yeah a a cease dysfunction and incompetence as a part of that\nStory but I think what he has built over time period he did it puts him a notch above Lombardi and brown and house and the rest I there are people who disagree with that assessment but that's the way I see is\nA run 'em down rumbling just Iran I hear in relationships don't just need to be better why do you\nUse blood with a guy [laughter] well let me say this\nWrong side of this is worked in the book\nOf two thousand profile Belgium because he got more out of them than pretty much anybody a that was that was the best\nWork done certainly on early ballot checking going on and I don't know if anything really beat that later on so that that that helped me Ron's work overtime definitely contributed to the book and hopefully that was reflected but um it is a the guy is\nI don't listen to his friends tell you how charming engaging years away from the facilities and I think most of America has a hard time reconciling that that's a major or notion with the reality of what they see in his press conferences\nI wanted to ask you about um really great because these guys are saying I Love them Tom Brady and I'm particularly fascinated\nBy his relationship with his head coach you quote an unnamed source too We're headed for a divorced a year ago and they bring us the or the windy port them out can you explain what you've learned about the dynamic of their relationship and how it's changed\nA well as long I can tell you I mean it's always been a transactional relationship it's it's always been a business partnership nothing else no love know warmth no affection they've never had dinner even once according to Tom Brady senior so\nUh but it worked at work and work like nor the partnership coach quarterback in the history of the league but last year after Eighteen years of unrelenting unforgiving coaching and palm had five years of that to Michigan sort of like twenty three years\nWar him down to the ... Guerrero situation the the Malcolm Butler venturing rarely pick him off just like it did most patriots you put all those things together and in late march my sources told me he was still considering walk away rather than playing for his head coach again\nAnd I think he actually would have at least after his release if not retired had to go up and not been trained in Brady compelled that are inspired that with his play and also\nJust being uncomfortable with droplets presidents and uh I think had he not publicly talked about playing at least eight forty five as often as he did if you take those two things the way I think perhaps he does walk away but he realized if he did retire after his release\nThat fan base that adores him to the nth degree would have turned on him and I think he wanted absolutely no part of that\nWell you know the last player and a one time Baltimore residents and longtime bell jak ah tolerate or too small anecdotes early in your book this were to me very telling what was giving one of his lacrosse teenagers was it a little while being able to the Clintons\nAnd the other one the secretary talking about bill's apparent problems with the postal service\nRight yeah I Know\nMaureen ... column she worked for march ... in Baltimore bills first job in the NFL\nAs you know Ron in Nineteen Seventy five and a he was supposed to send the film out to the coaches obviously on time and I believe it was supposed to be there on Tuesdays but she said if it was Tuesday and they were supposed to be posing coaches below we send it so I got there on Wednesday and she would she would feel these phone calls of screening coaches\nAre from the opponent the upcoming that Sunday and she thought at the time bill is just being a jerk\nAnd I didn't really have much use for her as a woman she felt that but then over time and she's lost his career unfolds he wandered and I and I write this book gee I I I Wonder if he was doing that for a competitive advantage maybe that was the first time he ever reach for and unfair competitive advantage or edge with an opponent a at Wesleyan\nHe he was a senior and uh he was sort of like a low point guard effect that kind of caused by a good vision but lack of athleticism foot speed to help them back a little bit but anyway he had a freshman teammate named John that Ficre who was a really good athlete a good football\nKind of look caused by a good vision but lack of athleticism foot feed them back a little bit but anyway he had a freshman teammate named John that Ficre who was a really good athlete a good football player but I never played lacrosse so built took us to come one night to try to help them catch the ball and he created and illegal pocket but he kept one string loose\nHanded to stick to make vicar the next day he's now a liver transplant surgeon in California and he told me the story and he said this is a legal pocket and built that I Know if an opponent point this out to an official and Iraq asked for your stick turnaround turn your back to him and pull on the string and it will make it legal again and then hand it to the raft [laughter]\nDo you see it eight twenty dollar ticket is already a pushing the envelope or to the extreme and I think in those formative years you see the mindset and the philosophy of constantly doing that forming and and and obviously he took that with him throughout his NFL coach in Korea\nUnity twenty I was saying was already a sheet\n\nA lot of people call them that and uh you know there are people too where they've looked at my subtitled and said it'd be really the greatest coach of all time when you're ... you're right that major strike against him and I think that's a fair opinion to half if you if you qualify him based on

Reno in the game\nAnd the fifth inning once he had gotten the bases loaded the bases were ... you'll hear walked basically the bases loaded and then Louie Severino came out for the city and I was thinking to myself at that point okay that's fine but if he gives up a base runner then you've got to get them out of game\nAnd ultimately he did give up a base runner let them in the game I was like oh here we go here we\nGo Bobby Aaron Boone this is going to be a mistake because at that point the Yankees were only up to nothing in the ball game\nAnd so I said to myself here we go and then another hit first and second nobody out here comes there and do walking down to them out and then they bring in ... now let me give you a history lesson on ... this is my least favorite relief pitcher but the New York Yankees hat because when it comes to control views so radically\nHe's been better over the second half of the season\nAnd so what ... the situations he was ... typically brought in on this year specifically the second half of the season where when the bases were empty and the damage that he causes with his radical pitching was limited because there was nobody on base but how can bring it down but tens there's nobody out too on\nAnd and guess what three of three down bring 'em in another time three up three down\nSo that one but two hands is is the first on selling hero in this game the second an unsung hero in this game Bobby beat is a hitter who made the sixth inning absolutely magical another three [noise]\n\nHow 'bout that loop voice ESPN television with the ... voice yeah you don't really know look void is neither do I really uh twelve pitch at bat\nFor ... voice in this ball game coming up forty past the hour Tom hands when it's going to join us of Bronx pin striped I Will ask Kim\nWho Luke voice is because that guy is ... I'm going to comparing the guys like Shane Spencer a that's a guy that comes to mind if you're a Yankee fan you know who Shane Spencer is ... voice against the athletics best pitcher was brilliant and just be letting that that that go on\nSo look everything that Aaron Boone today did worked the timing of getting the relief pitchers in and out obviously starting sever Reno was big\nAnd the Yankees are moving on I when we come back we will move on and start to preview the theories coming up Yankees and the red Sox by the way this is what baseball wanted and we'll get to Bobby's Astros that's next overnight SB Nation radio\nThat they should have you done to the Mexican restaurants yes I have how much do you pay for chips and salsa nothing's\nGoing ruin any idle paying candy making them right in the day when they bring me the solvent I just started ... that the rebels hotel you got to be twenty two dollars a call you or did it or to your chips\nWith fire rows of solving block 'em ups that guacamole and veteran made in Mexico and blown up or driven up that day oh you gotta be kidding where people want to you know you get the fruit ...

can follow Tom work on Twitter\nThat Tom half an hour time I think we got to start with Lisa ... there were questions at least on my and I and I had\nTaken a Yankee fan is it's it's ... getting the ... and not Jay half\nBut there's no question about it all questions were answered tonight Severino fantastic [noise]\nYeah lucky and he gave the Yankees what they needed a you know it takes a early on this week during a press conference he said that\nIt's possible that you know a movie set Reno has a quick hook or a short leash a it seemed like the script was going to be around four to five innings a five certainly at the most he said he wouldn't have a pool ... if he was cruising in rolling along but that wasn't the case that night and you know they sort of stuck with sports I think there was a\nRisky questionable move to send back out there a sort of thing after eight a troubling for the name but he got out of it and ah a must you know it's about surviving in advancing in this game so\nUh it was a big confidence boost or ... percent Marino he redeem them so if you remember last year he only got recorded one out in the wild card game against the Clintons last year or this was a big step forward but Louis Severino he's he's really is the X factor in that particular case you for the Yankees and\nUh if they want to advance the healthy I said they want to get past the Boston Red Sox are going to need every now and I have to step up once again or in the next couple of days\nBig step forward and a big confidence boost their ... della ... says well I got to say you know my hands is I I at least trust him when he was going on with nobody on and he's got a blank slate and you can just focus on the batter doesn't have to worry about the runners I thought you can't just did one heck of a surprising job at least on my end up coming in with first and second nobody out\nOn let's just talk about his hand to separate and I were you surprised that has affected us [noise]\nYeah look I I Would agree with you I think he generally is a you know at its best during a cleaning ... with a clean slate as you say\nHey look he stepped up the cleanup civil Reno's mess and um it's crazy you know the the L independence of twenty eight versus the do the parents the toy Seventy in at night and day I mean this guy was exiled last October and Yankee fans want him out of town they want it in trade in the last winter so\nUh it's really been amazing to see his turn around he's regained his confidence he's a you know made them adjustments to his mechanic\nOn that flight it was biting tonight it was nasty fastball was sharp\nEverything was coming up roses for him today and\nLike a you know the federal Reno move extending him for the best course of the ... to ... you know the parent is getting too many of them work so it's not just on having in such a clean slate at getting an extra inning the ending of work which\nWas that show that you know there is a risk involved there so it's certainly another confidence boost to prevent ... another reason why boom was able to access for off the majority of the game\nTom and putting as our gas I yeah I think that nobody could act in Illinois last\nGame will just between the comes in the Rockies Yankees fan or at least that a little bit of a boost there a time when it's our gas that covers the New York Yankees in the Bronx in New York Yankees blog you can follow time work on Twitter that Tom handsome so let's go to the very first inning how important was it for that Aaron Judge how I'm going to happen in the Yankees just hop off to an early like that\nOh that was important [laughter] I mean I you know you can't be ... or judges that ball down the middle you know if you're a picture that you know behind the counter\nNot in your best interests to a lady one down in the middle and you know and I believe the judge is now the the first player to have a two home runs into wild card game but another welcome game hasn't been around for that wall but I Believe is the only player to have to home runs in this game so I mean it was a a\nHuge moment ... a huge momentum story there right out of the day um and it's crazy that you know a guy like Lupe Trevino it's been so sorry for the athletic he came in the second inning and was really saw and he's just a Yankee go up and down Brophy winnings if only we started with him rather than a guy like a you know another guy so\nUh it's crazy how the you know a couple of games can affect the game that's why you know the welcome let's do extending so thrown there's nothing like it and\nI looked at the tone of cost them ... leader and you get a leader in the game then\n... that hold on a I mean I I mean I Would say you know midway through the games I don't think the Yankees were going to win that game to nothing I'm Ron Paul later in the game Chris apes do on shot the home run from judge a wouldn't make the difference is that there are only four of them next uh really was a huge impact so yes scared or\nYou know certainly need to get things going he only won one home runs the people the debate it off the disabled list but few weeks ago so a another ... an industry that goes on and on another confidence boost or for the anti snowing\nOr we'll get to that six sending in a second but knowing that Sean ... was hurt\nWere you surprised to open strategy coming into this game but because it wasn't a given that they were going to do this it was kind of rumors that they might try and you know piece together any by inning with that's fantastic bullpen that Oakland has what were you surprised when they announced their starting pitcher and basically announced their strategy for the game pitching wise\nNo no I wasn't surprised um ... you know you lose a guy like Sherman I he really is your age your number one picture among you lose them for the rest of the season\nIt looking options are limited uh and you know you can you can question whether or not it was worth about moving to do with a guy like contracts to start\nA when you have a death thing from being a guy like Fernando Rodney king shrunk tonight be abroad and eat and uh one of the best relievers and based on trying to also just did not have a new game tonight\nOr they have plenty of options I don't know who was the smartest idea to do with a hundred in hindsight\nBut I don't think it would be a shocking development to see the aqueduct go with the strategy ... loose team could pull it all they can pull off in an open are type a strategy game so it just didn't work out for the A's tonight and played played five seven games who knows that will be thrown out in those games as well\nUm I mean it was clearly little the AIDS to not want a guy like a\nLike a fire is on the roster 'cause I don't think they trusted them against especially on the road so I Know I don't think there's any any shocker supplies to the a shortage and it just about what can a\nTom Hanson is our guest covers the New York Yankees for Bronx pin striped dot com you can follow Tom work on Twitter that Tom handling okay so let's go to that sixth inning if I'm the average baseball fan I don't think I Know who ... is that the guy who ... I don't know how many ... I don't know how many pitches that ...\nThat was I'm going against it was eleven me you know the answer to that but it's just give us a little background to Hulu could voice is because he had the biggest that that\nI think outside of that judge home run because you're right that judge someone did not win the game because the AIDS ended up getting to more that voice that gave them because it's so and just give us some background on who look voice is\n[noise] well I guess the first of all he can call do quote a late bloomer um you know he's only been in the lead for two seizing the uh you know was brought up with a St Louis cardinals and eating out and stuck in the end he's twenty seven years old so late bloomer he is um and the Yankees but see them in a trade or you know at the trade that blind\nOr and then eating out and stuck in the end he's twenty seven years old so late liberty is I'm In the eighties\nBut see them in a trade or you know that and trade that blind exchange for a reliever chasing sure event in prospect pitcher named Giovanni ... it goes\nAnd in return the Yankees ... voice and we also got them international voted stole money like she really was the rate of the deal the Yankees were are just trying to cut some roster and give them a bonus for money and return\nAnd I really think Frank cashing in a I mean when it comes to look voice in the food that they caught him surprised when the Yankees but I think they saw something in void in terms of the power\nIn terms of his uh in terms of his raw ability but I don't think anyone expected this I don't think anyone expected a fourteen home runs over thirty ... uh in a short stay with the Yankees with summer it's been very reminiscent to a guy like she spends or if you remember the Nineteen Ninety\n... these are the different the made\nA little going on to become a bludgeon continue tonight you can see a replay he was a already getting ready for the whole ... he thought it was the fall when over the fence and hit the wall he had a a really hostile into third base\nOr five hundred that goes all the way up to eleven twenty five or ... you know one thing that I I was reading after the game tonight was this criticism of how the Oakland Athletics handled their pitching\nAnd uh when it came to the loo using the relievers didn't starting Hendricks right off the bat\nI didn't have a problem with it really I if I was in Oakland Athletics that well I I'm not I'm not saying you know obviously I didn't have a problem with Yankee fan but I'm saying if I was in athletics fan I\nYou're kind of really up a creek without a power because there's such a big difference between ... and whoever the heck out they had I guess my fires would have been number two on that list broke when they when they lost their age they lost the ability to manage this game the way they want it\nTo manage it and I I didn't think that\nThey really had any other option I thought this was a good strategy what Oakland did tonight I I really do um the but the problem ended up becoming there was just so much pressure on each of these guys coming in that they they know in the back of their head I only have it in a I got

J. yelled at is a very quality number two running back in Jacksonville but even with Joe mixed and being out\nI still like Cincinnati now here's the thing I Want to see from Cincinnati this week again my did play money money money\nWhen the patriots won three and a half Cincinnati tease that down to ... uh my question was that I I still have major questions about the seat that's major questions now I Do believe on tests perfect is back\nFor this week is so ... how much of a different he is a big difference maybe we'll talk we look at defense is like a show on leave with the Dallas Cowboys okay much only is it in for the Dallas Cowboys oh my goodness the numbers go way up\nWhen he's out wait out same impact kind of player give you one more example Carolina Panthers loop equally many concussions over his career when he's in oh my goodness they got the best friends in football when he's out oh you can run the ball\nSo von tests perfect thing back as the other reason I think will limit what Miami can do run into football and then was that powerful bang goes off and you're going to get out ahead I Believe in this game and you're going to force tannahill to throw the ball\nMay Cincinnati tannahill has to throw the football down ten in the third quarter I Love to play Bobby I really love what I when we come back yes the Yankees did win tonight over the Oakland Athletics will start talking and there'll be playoff moving forward some of the night of the nation radio\nIs a fantasy football\nIs anybody out there are so frustrated with the Carolyn Adam ... says I Am the first of all ... coming into the season we heard about first person being the belt out first source is going to be our number one running back for Chris Carson was only scratch Arizona and so we think it's going to be sharp petty\nSays the guy that gets Twenty one carry over a hundred yards shout and now we hear that he's gonna be a part of a rotation\nSharp petty\nSays the guy that gets Twenty one carry over a hundred yards at a couple of shelter and now we hear that he's gonna be a part of a rotation for Carson and\nWere shot is all but a non factor and I just don't trust these terrible and then Adam case what are you doing your top running back ... that are combining just over two weeks no wonder\nYou got your butts kicked in New England I think I can safely speak on behalf of all can you drink owners\nBet fantasy football show on Tuesday nights at eight eastern ... radio [noise] [noise]\nNo you can get the latest news reaction that breakdowns on your favorite NFL teams with as the nation's news broadcasting featuring coverage of the eagles sperm bleeding green nation that cowboys from blogging the boys the chiefs for arrowhead bride the chargers from both the blue and\nMore subscribe to any of these bugs yesterday on apple bonds ... sister for wherever you listen to your project as feed Asian go bad with us [noise]\nThis is three to eat\nIt turns out Jose is really bad at ... and he thought we'd have a little fun by printing out a blanket copy of the United states so they are originally only got twelve\nSafe you identify New Jersey as New York\nAnd same thing I Know the dirty jurors is not New Yorker sure\nI'm from ... from the New York the nets are from Brooklyn oh okay they used to be from New Jersey but before that he played on Long Island to see you didn't do that with the New York next before they would have New Jersey Nashville for they were the ... maps before they were the Long Island you know they were the New York times sprinting no it's not that I feel like\nWe're saying if you don't know where\nHe said sorry you don't get to tell me where things are and what I learned I feel like we're saying the same thing or are you yeah lake\nStreet heat with Patrick graces weekday afternoon at five eastern on as a nation radio\nJust to test me nation radio generation forays or a a tune in to this is science friday from by the end of ... three D.

I I think my first reaction would be the call nine one one and say okay I think I see my ... I think I might smelled gas there are thousands of people that live in this apartment complex if I pull the fire alarm I'm going to really just get everybody angry\nAnd then I Would just see what they would tell me to do I think they would tell me to pull the fire alarm\nNo prior to the political cause you know you never know grabber you never know what could happen to make a move me\nBobby I was tired I just I just I just wanted to go to bed you know that's all I wanted to do okay All right so it gets you know he doesn't have to worry about a gas leak I guess David Price if he's going on to a going to play in New York City 'cause guess what he's going to have to play in Boston\nAnd so it's okay no gasoline for him but I say this I think David Price at home I gave him a much better chance then he went on the road I have a lot more confidence in a David Price at home than I Do on the road\nLook tonight at least when it comes to the Yankees list is not a trot around the bases what this is is a sigh of relief you got passed it okay 'cause the wild card\nGame is nothing you know ... this was a great game I think it's great drama I think major league baseball that a fantastic job in getting this game played uh\nIn in changing the rule but this is to me at least as a Yankee fan not big accomplishment\nBut Iraqis it is a little bit more of an accomplishment because not many people actually believed in them Yankees debate when a hundred games as you say the Yankees won a hundred ... here than it is so just imagined that like the Yankees I talked to many pessimistic about the show talking about how many Yankees fans or glass half empty and how they're pessimistic okay\nAnd Yankees fans should not be as pessimistic as they are because they want a hundred games\nWhat happened to simply this year and why they had to play the game like this is the red Sox had a historical sees it\nBoston was fantastic in New York head injuries down the stretch they didn't have air and judge for the last month month and a half but I Want to go back real quickly before we go to the NBA here to something that I said when the Aaron Judge injury happened I remember this because this is right before I went on vacation for about a week the vacation I didn't tell by the beach about\nThis is one I thought I said I'm Glad the injury to Aaron Judge is happening now because he'll be able to come back\nFully strong for the playoffs every team as injuries every you can't avoid everybody as ... what are the Astros kind of dealing with right now George Springer it's got an injury going into the playoffs\nGeorge Springer is injury happened a little bit after Aaron judges injury happened and it's the same kind of deal Aaron Judge is dealing with the rest and\nGeorge Springer is dealing with the phone right\nIt's on your hand it affects what you can do at the plate so the fact that Aaron Judge injury happened when I did and granted obviously it took them a little bit more time to get back then a lot of people thought\nBut that's okay because it happened early on and he could recover and Aaron Judge is creamy the baseball right now\nIt is literally just are you the all of them at this time are hitting their stride I really do think and I did not think this last year Bobby I think the Yankees line of one through time\nIs the best in baseball right now I think the Astros are very close second the problem to me a Springer with the health and the problem to me is correct I don't know if I could trust Korea to be the same Korea that he was last playoffs because he hasn't been that Korea this year\nAnd so that's why I'm ... I I Know there could be pushback from Houston there could be pushback from everybody the American way but as I was just watching the game ebb and flow tonight I'm thinking to myself man who do you pitched to\nIf you're facing the Yankees lineup who do you pitch to like the Oakland Athletics strategy today because ... got hurt was we're going to ... slowly but surely relief pitcher\nWho do you pitch to like the Oakland Athletics strategy today because Sherman I got hurt was we're going to ... slowly but surely relief pitcher one in the time to an out of time but there were no holes that's one of the reasons this didn't work\nListen look boy a guy that you know I found out about like an hour ago and you probably just found out about tonight as you were watching the game I looked at this

ball this is during warm ups okay and he's just tosses it down all like I guess this is what he does like this is the equivalent of long taught for Patrick mom has a gun sales later you know starting pitchers do long toss before baseball game he throws the ball and then you kind of lose it\nAnd it lands at the opposing can yard line\nI'm watching the video right now like ... he doesn't even like\nKoch back really far to throw it\nI I was sent this video by a friend that I was ... and he was just like take a look at this and it's just one of those videos that it it just amazes me that

and\nScreaming because I was you know this is my team that I watch them they just they did win the game and they have after Bobby I was so stressed out today and part of the reason that I was so

reporter's job is to report what is actually happening on the team's not make up stores and that's a problem that we have some times you know in the political meeting\nAnd that's just a general with the media report what happened so now I read the story of my gut reaction is like what are we doing here like Aaron Rodgers you take a call from Aaron Rodgers\nWho is a perfection is Aaron Rodgers is one of the best in his craft you take that quote and you blow it into oh we have some big conflict going on a Green Bay no sets a perfectionist saying okay yeah we beat that seemed to want to do nothing but I Want to do better I wanted to be forty five nothing\nI respect Aaron Rodgers honestly for that to me this is a non story about did you see this\nI didn't see the story but it's just so much a hoopla out of nothing or a reporter is trying to get some clout to click bait\nThey lick you know this is also as long as you're look you're a hundred percent right this is also\nA product of

it is a little bit more difficult to judge exactly how much the newspapers being bought\nThat it's not the case with digital media now you know digital media you can easily judge how much your article gets clicked and so that is a problem with the media to be honest\nIt's got a lot more philosophical then I thought it was going to become but I I just I I just I'm with Aaron Rodgers here and I

Reno do Severino was great he went four innings gave up to its no runs seven strike out uh and and the question that I have coming into this game for the Yankees was why Severino why not Jay happily we used to have a RINO came into this playing a game for New York tonight\nA five point five E R I and the second half of the regular season\nWhy go to him not half although so to a a questions were kind of answered for me in the broadcast in the first inning of the game when they were talking about the Oakland Athletics specifically and how they struggle against fastball pitcher and that's what Louis ... if you watch these first inning of this game I mean he was blowing Ninety seven mile an hour fastball after Ninety seven mile an hour fastball\nBlowing them right by the Oakland Athletics there's so that's why you know you you want matchups to favor you obviously in baseball cross sport do you want matchups a favor you\nAnd so that is ultimately when it came down to you take a risk with a guy who hasn't been good because matchups favorite you in this game enda\nMatchups potentially could favor you in the next game if Severino does his job because the other option was Jay ... tonight\nAnd Jay half was acquired by the New York Yankees after trade deadline this year and one of the reasons I Believe he was acquired as because of his outstanding record against the Boston Red Sox guys got an under two ER ... against the Boston Red Sox this year keep in mind half came from Toronto\nIn Toronto is I'm In the American league eight\nAnd so that was the mindset for Aaron Boone\nUsing the latest technology Boston solution to hear losses permanence and protected by the bosley guarantee plus since possibly has new non surgical options you what would you yourself detects now for an absolutely free information and the gift card for two hundred and fifty dollars off\nNo matter what level of hair loss you have ... ... five five to eight five eight five zero that's K.

Yankees moving haunted faced the Boston Red Sox and the next round the major league baseball playoff here and talk about it as Tom hand when he worked for blocks in ... New York Yankees blog you can follow Tom work on Twitter that Tom hands on our time I think we got to start with Louis ...\nThere were questions at least on my end I and I\nAnd I think any Yankee fan ... is it the first ever you know getting the start and not Jay half\nBut there's no question about it all questions were answered tonight or Sacramento is fantastic [noise]\nYeah looking and he gave the Yankees what they needed a you know I think\nEarly on this week during a press conference he said that it's possible that you know a movie set in Reno has a quick hook a short leash a it seemed like the script was going to be around four to five innings or by certainly at the most\nIf any wouldn't pull out if he was cruising in rolling along but that wasn't the case that night and you know they sort of stuff that it's worth it I think there was a\nRisky questionable to send them back out there to start the fifth inning after eight a troubling fourth inning but he got out of it and ah a must you surviving in advancing in this game so\nUh it was a big confidence booster for Severino he redeem them though ah remember last year he only got recorded one out in the wild card game against the twins last year\nOr this was a big step forward but Louis several you know he's he's really is the X factor in that particular case you for the Yankees and\nAh if they want to advance the ALPA after they want to get past the Boston Red Sox are going to need that Marino and I have to step up once again or in the next couple of days\nThe except for it and a big confidence boost their ... della ... says well I got to say you know ... I I at least trust him when he was going on with nobody on and he's got a blank slate and he can just focus on the batter doesn't have to worry about the runners I thought but can't just did one heck of a surprising job at least on my end\nUp coming in with first and second nobody out a way but just talk about ... and I were you surprised that has affected us [noise]\nYeah look I I Would agree with you I think he generally in the ad in bed during a cleaning ... with a clean slate as you say I'm\nLooking up the cleaned up several Reno's mess and um it's crazy you know the devil in the hands of the twenty eighth team versus the do over there for twenty seven the in at night and day I mean this guy was exiled last October and yet he's\nFans want him out of town they want it in trade in last winter so uh it's really been amazing to see it turn around he's regained competency uh you know made them adjustment to his mechanic\nOn that flight it was biting tonight it was nasty fast ball was sharp\nEverything was coming up roses brings today and like a you know the civil Reno move extending it for the extent of the cost of ... to ... you know the parent is get doing some work so it's not just yeah all having in pitch a clean slate of getting an extra inning the ending of work which\nWas that show though you know there is a risk involved there so it's certainly another competence supposed to prevent handled them another reason why boom was able to sail for all the majority of the game\nTom and putting as our gas I think he said that nobody could act Illinois last game will just between that comes in the Rockies Yankees fan or at least at a little bit of a boost their time half when it's our guests are covered the New York Yankees in the Bronx in New York Yankees blog you can follow time work on Twitter at Tom handsome so let's go to the very first day next how important was it for that Aaron Judge home run that happened\nIn the Yankees are just hop off the one early like that\nOh that was important [laughter] I mean I Know you can't give that are just that fall down in the middle you know your picture that you know behind the counter\nNot in your best interests to a lady one down in the middle and you know and I believe the judge is now the the first player to have a home run into wild card games and other welcome hasn't been around for that wall but I Believe that the only player to have to home runs in the game so\nI mean it was a huge moment a a huge momentum story or right out of the gate\nUm and it's crazy that you know a guy like little tornados been those dollar from there but he came in the second inning and was really somebody shut the Yankee go up and down for a few innings if only they started with him rather than a guy like a you know another guy so uh it's crazy how the you know a couple of getting can affect the game\nThat's why you know the welcome so extending so grown there's nothing like it and\nBut you know that's not the tone of course the founding leader a leader in the game on\nThe road ah I'm In I'm In St Louis midway through the games I I don't think the Yankees were going to win that game to nothing I'm right here in the game Chris tapes do on shot the home run from judge a wouldn't make up in the early ... that's a really was a huge impact so yes or\nNo judgment you need to get things going on one home runs the after that it off the table but the few weeks ago so a another ... ... that goes on and on another confidence boost up the ante snowing\nOr we'll get to that sixth inning in a second but knowing that Sean ... was hurt\nWere you surprised that open strategy coming into this game because it was in a given that they were going to do this it was kind of rumors that they might try and you know piece together any by ending with that fantastic bullpen that Oakland has what were you surprised when they announced their starting pitcher and basically announced their strategy\nIs there any by any with that fantastic bullpen that Oakland has what were you surprised when they announced their starting pitcher and basically announced their strategy for the game pitching wise\nNo I'm not I wasn't surprised um you know you lose a guy like Sherman I he really is your age your number one pitcher and when you lose them for the rest of the season\nYou look your options are limited uh and you know you can you can question whether or not it was smart about Melvin to do with a guy like ... to start\nOr when you have a hand or death thing from being a guy like Fernando Rodney although he wasn't shrunk tonight be abroad and eight and a one of the best relievers them based on trying and also just did not have a new games that I have\nA they had plenty of options I don't know who was the smartest idea to do with a hundred in hindsight\nBut I don't think it was a a shocking development to see the aqueduct go with the strategy and ... ... the team could pull it off they can pull off a an open are type a strategy game so they just didn't work out for the news tonight I played five seven games in most I Will turn out in those games as well\nI'm ... I mean it was clearly in the age do not want a guy like a\nLike a fire is on the roster 'cause I don't think they trusted them against the Yankees especially on the road so\nI Know I don't think there's any any shocker surprise to me a shortage of interest and I worked in a\nTime handling is our guest covers the New York Yankees for Bronx and strength dot com you can follow Tom work on Twitter that Tom handling okay so let's go to that six sending you find the average baseball fan I don't think I Know who loses boy is that the guy who ... I don't know how many ... I don't know how many pitches that\nThat was I'm going to guess it was eleven me you know the answer to that but it's just give us a little backgrounds\nWho lose the voice is because he had the biggest that that I think outside of that judge home run because you're right that judge home run did not win the game because the A's ended up getting to more that voice that gave some questions so I just give us some background on who look voice is\n[noise] I guess the first of all he can call do quote a late bloomer um you know he's only been in the lead for two seasons he was brought up with the St Louis cardinals and eating out and stuck in these twenty seven years old so late bloomer he is um and the Yankees but see him in a trade or you know that will tell you that blind\nExchange for a reliever chasing sure event across the pitcher named Giovanni ...\nAnd in return the Yankees ... boys and they also got some international bonus pool money's like she\nReally was the ravens a deal the Yankees were are just trying to cut the roster and get a bonus for money and return\nOn a really burn cash them in a [laughter] I mean when it comes to look voice as soon as they caught in the Bronx in the ANC I think they saw something in void in terms of the power in terms of his uh in terms of his raw ability but I don't think anyone expected this I don't think anyone expected a fourteen homeruns over thirty were these\nAre short stay with the Yankees with summer it's been very reminiscent to a guy like Shane Spencer if you remember the Nineteen Ninety\n... these are the different the made a little boy don't become and he continued to Ninety the attorney the replay he was a already getting ready for the whole ... he thought it was a ball went over the fence and hit the wall he had a really hustling to third base\nIt's an extra twenty five percent bonus that the one hundred twenty five percent bonus only with from local when one twenty five\nSo he can take that one hundred dollars on your first Ben and make it twelve hundred and twenty five dollars do not leave money on the table Bobby doesn't do it why should you use promo code when one hundred and twenty five at the SB Nation one hundred and twenty five percent bonus coming up today did you look at that Patrick my house past that I was telling you about yet\nBut didn't get a chance to man I'm Sorry if you don't have to apologize to you know some other things are\nSo to okay it might take me a little bit at the time to forgive you though huh is that okay\nYeah I mean aren't used to you know ... for no rooting on your Yankee I'm absolutely exhausted [laughter]\n[laughter] I Can't wait to see and then friday or at least I have the day is a day game and Lisa\nYeah or friday\nI miss the game as I Know it's\nA

your car listening right now because I Am the kind of person if you watch the game will be with me tonight or you were around me at all today I'm a very glass half empty sports fan as I think a lot of New York sports fans are\nLet me amend that a lot of Jewish New York sports fans are Jewish people I think for the most part are very glass half empty people now you combined the Jewish nist with sports Bobby I'm just explaining the culture of just explaining New York the typical New York Yankee fan who was a Jew\nI Am a very oh my goodness the worst case scenario is going to happen that's kind of me\nAnd so I was thinking to myself oh when I'm when I first started the show should I come across as someone who's completely objective 'cause I have no problem criticizing mild pain I have no problem coming on here and telling you that the giants off into blind is absolutely terrible\nAnd so I eventually decided that no I Want this radio show to be completely genuine and to be completely real and for it to be completely one hundred and ten percent me and so that's what I'm going to do tonight I'm gonna\nSo now with the Yankees winning this game seven to two and moving on to play the Boston Red Sox Jay half will be able to pitch in two of those five potential games against Boston\nSo that is ultimately the reason why Louis ... started the game and and credit Aaron Boone because my main concern\nOther than Louis Marino coming into this game was Aaron Boone and his managing you know I thought well yesterday Joe Manchin and bud blacks were brilliant not good\nReally act in their managerial decisions to go Thirteen innings and really make no mistake do you know how difficult that is you know I Know you know you could say that's their job\nBut that happens so often like Joe Gerard he was brilliant last year piecing together eight innings of bullpen work when Louis several Reno's dunk in the first inning against the Twinkies last year\nAnd you're already was fantastic and so I thought Aaron Boone first fear manager\nWhen I have a difficult time managing a game if Louis ... down in trouble which ultimately he did when we used to have a RINO in the fifth inning the one questionable move you could say by boom tonight was leaving Luis Severino in the game\nIn the fifth inning once he had gotten the bases loaded the bases were ... you know he had walked basically the bases loaded and then Louie ... came out for the city and I was thinking to myself at that point okay that's fine but if he gives up a base runner then you've got to get them out of game\nAnd ultimately he did give up a base runner left them in the game I was like\nIf he gives up up based runner then you've got to get them out of the game and ultimately he did give up a base runner let them in the game I was like oh here we go here we go Bobby Aaron Boone this is going to be the mistake because at that point the Yankees were only up to nothing in the ball game\nAnd so I said to myself here we go and then another hit first and second nobody out here comes there and do walking down to them out and then they bring it down but to understand let me give you a history lesson on ... this is my least favorite relief pitcher but the New York Yankees at because when it comes to control he's so radically\nHe's been better over the second half of the season and so what they want the hands of the situations he was specifically brought in on this year specifically the second half of the season where when the bases were empty and the damage that he caused his with his radical pitching was limited because there was nobody on base\nBut how can bring it down but tens there's nobody out too on\nAnd and just bought three up three down bring them in another time three uh three down so genuine but tens this is the first unsung hero in this game this second\nUnsung hero in this game Bobby beach is a hitter who made the sixth inning absolutely magical another three [noise]\n\nHow 'bout that loop boy ESPN television with the ... voice yeah you don't really know look voice is neither do I really uh twelve pitch at bat\nFor look voice in this ball game coming up for the past the hour Tom hands when it's going to join us of Bronx pin striped I Will ask him\nWho Luke voice ... is because that guy is ... I'm going to compare and guys like Shane Spencer or that the guy that comes to mind if you're a Yankee fan you know who's Shane Spencer is ... voice against the athletics best pitcher\nWas brilliant and just letting that that that go on so look everything that Aaron Boone today did worked the timing of getting the relief pitchers in and out obviously starting Severino was big\nAnd the Yankees are moving on All right when we come back we will move on and start to preview the theories coming up Yankees and the red Sox by the way this is what baseball wanted and we'll get the Bobby's Astros that's next overnight SB Nation radio\n[noise] this is pushing the God\nWe had to the rocket mortgage loans hotline where we find von Miller as a defensive player who's paid the fact the quarterback how tough to deploy your position with the new rules\nYou know it was a football or to to really move you know what I told her you know the answer for protected according to what it was just curious as to what the situation for me when you were to go for the ball you know ... or ... to give them for you forgot a great showing for the war for the bar if it like to go\nOn strike force rumble who could be square hobo especially you know for me to ... or do you can go\nThe game against the against the raiders or Todd Davis's tells you you had your strips that could be called back and he said ...

I I at least trust him when he is going on with nobody on and he's got a blank slate and he can\nAnd it's ... just as well I got to say you know I I at least trust him when he was going on with nobody on and he's got a blank slate and he can just focus on the batter doesn't have to worry about the runners I thought I can just did one heck of a surprising job at least on my end\nUp coming in with first and second nobody out on let's just talk about Kansas and France and I were you surprised that it affected us [noise]\nYeah look I I Would agree with you I think he generally is a you know and in ... during a cleaning ... with a clean slate as you say\nHey look he stepped up they cleaned up several Reno's mess and um it's crazy you know the telling the parents of twenty eight team versus the do the parents for twenty seven the end it's night and day I mean this guy was exiled last October and you can you Yankee fans want him out of town they want it in trade in last winter so\nI it's really been amazing to see his turn around he's regained his confidence he's a you know made them adjustments there was a mechanic\nOn that flight or was biting tonight it was nasty fastball was sharp\nEverything was coming up roses for him today and like a you know the arena move extending input best course of the ... to let you know the parent is getting to work so it's not just on having in such a clean slate and getting an extra inning the ending of work which\nWas that show the you know there is risk involved there so it's certainly another confidence boost to prevent ... another reason why boom was able to access for off the majority of the game\nTom and soon as our gas I yeah I think he said that nobody could act Illinois last game was his name that comes in the Rockies Yankees fan or at least a little bit of a boost their time handling sarcastic I was in New York Yankees in the Bronx in New York Yankees blog you can follow Tom work on the winter time handling so let's go to the very first inning how important was it for that Aaron Judge home run to happen\nIn the Yankees are just hop on the one early like that\nOh that was important [laughter] I mean I Know you can't do you have to earn judges that fall down the middle you know if you're a picture that you know buying the count\nNot in your best interests to a lady went down in the middle and you know I I Believe the judge is now the the first player to have a two home runs into wild card game than other welcome him as an been around for that long but\nI Believe is the only player to have to hold on to miss games so I mean it was a huge moment or a huge momentum story there right out of the day\nUm and it's crazy that you know a guy like Lupe Trevino it's been so sorry for the athletics he came in the second inning and was really somebody shut the Yankees up and down for a few innings only they started with him rather than a guy like a you know another guy so\nUh it's crazy how the you know a couple of things can affect the game that's who I you know the welcome so exciting so thrown there is nothing like it and\nI looked at the tone of course some pounding aiding them later in the uh later in the game then\nThey looked at home I really don't know I mean I I mean I'm In St Louis midway through the games I I don't think the Yankees were going to win that game to nothing them later in the game Chris tapes to a shot at home mom from judge a wouldn't make it look for ... for about six or really was a huge impact so yes judge a\nYou know just really need to get things going he only had one home runs in the ... the activated off the disabled list a few weeks ago so or another I I mean and this goes on and on another confidence boost or for the anti snowing\nOr we'll get to that six sitting in a second but knowing that Sean ... was hurt were you surprised that open strategy coming into this game but because it wasn't a given that they were going to do this it was kind of rumors that they might try and you know piece together any by ending with that's\nFantastic bullpen that Oakland has what were you surprised when they announced their starting pitcher and basically announced their strategy for the game pitching wise\nNo no I wasn't surprised um you know you lose a guy like Sherman I he really is your age your number one picture among you lose them for the rest of the season\nLook your options are limited uh and you know you can you can question whether or not it was smoking about Melvin to do with the guy like ... to start\nOr when you have a hand or death thing from being a guy like Fernando Rodney although he wasn't drunk tonight Mitt Romney and one of the best relievers based on trying to also just did not have a new games that\nThey have plenty of options I don't know if it was the smartest idea to do with a hindrance denying thing but I don't think it was a a shocking development to see the athletics go with this ... ... ... this team could pull it all they can pull off a can opener type strategy type games so\nHe just didn't work out putting aids tonight and they point five seven games in most that will turn out in those games as well um I mean it was clearly the age do not want a guy like a like a fire is on the roster 'cause I don't think they trusted them against the Yankees especially on the road so\nI Know I don't think there's any any shocking surprise to me a strategy and just do not work in a\nTime handling is our guest covers the New York Yankees for Bronx strike dot com you can follow Tom we're going to winter time handling okay so let's go to that six sending you find the average baseball fan I don't think I Know who ... is the guy who ... I don't know how many ... I don't know how many pitches that\nThat was I'm done it just it was eleven many you know the answer to that but it's just give us a little background to Hulu boy is because he had the biggest that bad\nI think outside of that judge home run because you're right that judge Joe Brown did not win the game because the A's ended up getting to more that voice that keeps them because it's so and just give us some background on who look voice is\n[noise] well I guess the first of all he can call do quote a late bloomer um you know he's only been in the league for two seasons he brought up with the St Louis cardinals and email and stuck in the end he's twenty seven years old so late bloomer he is um and the Yankees\nSee them in a trade or you know at the trade that bind exchange for a while they were chasing event across a pitcher named Giovanni ... it goes\nAnd in return the Yankees ... boys and they also got some international loaded for money which really was the ravens the deal the Yankees were are just trying to put some roster and get a bonus for money and return\nAnd I I really don't burn cash them in a I mean when it comes to look void that they caught him surprised when the Yankees I think they saw something in voice in terms of the power in terms of his uh in terms of his raw ability but I don't think anyone expected this I don't think anyone expected\nA fourteen homeruns over thirty were these are short stay with the Yankees with summer it's been very reminiscent to a guy like she spends or if you remember the Nineteen Ninety all these different the made a little boy don't become and he will continue tonight or you can see\nA replay he was a already getting ready for the whole month ... he thought it was the fall when over the fence\nOr five hundred that goes all the way up to eleven twenty five\nOr ... one thing that I I was reading after the game tonight was this criticism of how the Oakland Athletics handled their pitching\nAnd uh when it came to the loo using the relievers and starting Hendricks right off the bat\nI didn't have a problem with it really I if I was in Oakland Athletics that well I I'm not I'm not saying you know obviously I have a problem with a Yankee fan but I'm saying\nIf I was in athletics fan I you're kind of really up a creek without a paddle because there's such a big difference between ... and whoever the heck else they had I guess my fires would have been number two on that list for Oakland\nThey when they lost their age they lost the ability to manage this game the way they want it to manage it and I I didn't think that\nThey really had any other option I thought this was a good strategy ... opened did tonight I I I really do um the but the problem ended up becoming there was just so much pressure on each of these guys coming in that they they know in the back of their head\nI only have it in a I got to make the most out of the thing I think mentally that's that's tough\nFight every one of the

studios\nHere Matt Harris [noise]\n\nESPN television what's it called New York Yankees that was the first home run by one of the gigantic power hitters that the Yankees have the other one John Carlos Stanton hit later in the game that was pretty far I thought it was found\nI first saw it being a body of the Yankees do beat the Oakland Athletics tonight seven to two and they are moving on to a series that major league baseball is quite happy about they will play the Boston Red Sox nice to see this rivalry renewed in the playoffs\nI think the red Sox game one is going to be so fascinating to me because is Christian Bale healthy I'm curious what the Vegas money why it's going to be honestly\nI think Vegas is going to put a cautious line on it because we don't quite know what ... going to be like\nJay have traditionally this year's specifically has been very good against Boston I Would say the red Sox game number one are going to be about minus one Seventy minus one sixty on their home or tourists\nBut if Boston does lose that game\nDavid Price should be on the mound for game number to lots of people have questions about David Price as they should because David Price traditionally in the playoffs as late an act\nBut David Price and this is the argument I've made the people this year David Price has been a different second half of pitcher this season and then he has in previous years and so because of that me as a Yankee fan\nI Am looking at that and I say look I'm expecting to get the best David Price the second half David Price that we've seen this year\nDavid Price would not have to go on the road he could date nights and comfy sleep in his own bed not have to worry about travel or three ... fire alarm at a hotel by the way Bobby I got off work two days ago and I was just getting into bed\nAnd literally the fire alarm went off and I was outside for like thirty five minutes as they thought it was a gas leak\nLet me ask you a question if you smelled gas at four thirty in the morning are you pulling the fire alarm is that is that what you're supposed to do\nYeah critical blue leg or do you want to get to know\nI don't know I was as someone who is just getting off work and wanted to get into bed it was a false alarm\nGas you know okay okay I mean is there I ... I I think\nMy first reaction will be the call nine one one and say okay I think I see my ... I think I might smelled gas there are thousands of people that live in this apartment complex if I pull the fire alarm I'm going to really just get everybody I agree\nAnd then I Would just see what they would tell me to do everything they would tell me to pull the fire alarm\n... political cause you know you never know grabber you never know what could happen to make a move I mean\nBobby I was tired I just I just I just wanted to go to bed you know that's all I wanted to do okay All right so I guess you know he doesn't have to worry about a gas leak I guess David Price if he's going on to a going to play in New York City 'cause guess what he's going to have to play in Boston\nAnd so it was okay no gasoline for him but I say this I think David Price at home I give him a much better chance then he went on the road I have a lot more confidence in a David Price at home than I Do on the road\nSo look tonight at least when it comes to the Yankees this is not a tried around the base is what this is is a sigh of relief you got passed it okay 'cause the wild card\nGame is nothing you know ... this was a great game I think it's great drama I think major league baseball does a fantastic job and getting this game played a and and changing the rule but this is to me at least as a Yankee fan not big accomplishment\nFor the Rockies it is a little bit more of an accomplishment because not many people actually believed in them the Yankees did they win a hundred games as you say the Yankees won a hundred ... here it is just a magic that like the Yankees I talked to many pessimistic about the show talking about how many Yankees fans or glass half empty and now they're pessimistic okay and Yankees fans should not\nBe as pessimistic as they are\nBecause they want a hundred games what happened that simply this year and why they had the playing a game like this is the red Sox had a historical sees it Boston was fantastic in New York head injuries down the stretch they didn't have air and judge for the last month month and a half but I Want to go back real quickly before we go to the NBA\nHere just something that I said when the Aaron Judge injury happened I remember this because this was right before I went on vacation for about a week the vacation I didn't tell by the beach about this is what I thought I said I'm Glad the injury to Aaron Judge is happening now because he'll be able to come back\nFully strong for the playoffs every team as injuries every you can't avoid it everybody as ... what are the Astros kind of dealing with right now George Springer it's got an injury going into the playoffs\nGeorge Springer is injury happened a little bit after Aaron judges injury happened and it's the same kind of deal Aaron Judge is dealing with the rest and George Springer is dealing with the phone right\nIt's on your hand it affects what you can do at the plate so the fact that Aaron Judge injury happened when I did and granted obviously it took them a little bit more time to get back on a lot of people thought\nBut that's okay because it happened early on and he could recover and Aaron Judge is creamy the baseball right now it is\nLiterally just a you view the all of them\nAt this time are hitting their strength I really do think and I did not think this last year Bobby I think the Yankees won one through nine\nIs the best in baseball right now I think the Astros are very close second the problem to me is Springer with the health and the problem to me is correct I don't know if I could trust Korea to be the same Korea that he was last playoffs because he hasn't been that Korea this year\nAnd so that's why I'm ... I I Know there could be pushback from Houston there could be pushed back from everybody in the American way but as I was just watching the game ebb and flow tonight I'm thinking to myself man who do you pitched to\nIf you're facing the Yankees lineup who do you pitch to like the Oakland Athletics strategy today because Sherman I got hurt was we're going to ... slowly but surely relief pitcher one in the time too and at a time but there were no holes that's one of the reasons this didn't work\nTo ... slowly but surely relief pitcher one in the time to an out of\nTime but there were no holes that's one of the reasons this didn't work listen look boy a guy that you know I found out about like an hour ago and you probably just found out about tonight as you were watching the game I don't listen to this moment on another three [noise]\n\nSo that happened in the six Senate theloop boy who was traded foreign some obscure trade that Brian cash and was able to pull off Luke voice got the big hit in the ...\nThe Yankees move on to play the Boston Red Sox and our baseball player nationally tonight we got the Iraqis back at it against the brewers and later those Atlanta Braves those young Atlanta Braves taking on the Los Angeles Dodgers All right let's play a game\nYou can find a free screening\nDay frantic so\n\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend the quick Churchill checkup then just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage can tell you if\nYou could save some cash each month they've helped thousands upon thousands of my listeners keep more cash in their pockets through smarter mortgage\nI Want you to call Churchill for your check up and see if you can lower your monthly payment or better yet she how you can pay off your house or like think about it what could you do with your money if you didn't have a mortgage called Churchill a AAA alone two hundred triple light alone two hundred or visit Churchill mortgage dot com\nFor your Churchill checkup that's AAA loan two hundred or Churchill mortgage dot com this is a paid advertisement and email us id won five nine one ... consumer access dot org equal housing lender seven sixty one old hickory boulevard Brentwood, Tennessee three Seventy wrote to set a\nTime ... do you have any job while you were born Africans\nAnd online at nine forty WMA huge on jobs [noise]\n[noise]\nMaybe the news\nGot Goldberg senators on both sides of the aisle and gone through the FBI's forty six page report on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh including Republicans swing voter Jeff Flake who called for the borough\n[noise]\nRobert Blake as of now it's not saying if you vote yes on Kavanaugh's nomination more from ABC Stephanie\nRamos he Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer and Senator Dianne Feinstein are calling the FBI pros and to judge Brett Kavanaugh not thoroughly enough Senate Judiciary committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein\nIt looks to be a product of an incomplete investigation that was limited or perhaps by the White House I don't know signed\nSigned add to the most notable part of this report is what's not in it a reference to the FBI decision cannot interview catch cabinet nor his accuser Dr Christine Blasey Ford Stephanie Ramos ABC News the Capitol\nTowards lawyers about set a lawyer a letter to the FBI Director Christopher Wray questioning why his agents did not interview several witnesses who said they would have backed out for its claims outside the capital [noise]\nAnd I have enough protesters have gathered they are chanting shame vice\nPresident Pence is echoed President Trump's assertion that the un last week that China's trying to interfere in us elections as we speak Beijing is employing a whole of government approach\nUsing political economic and military tools as well as propaganda to advances influence and benefits is interest in the United states\nSize president speaking at the Hudson Institute in Washington this morning several Russians are now facing charges in the U.
