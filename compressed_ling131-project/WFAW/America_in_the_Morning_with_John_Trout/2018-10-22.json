because of the way that the Internet is regulated or or divided up between the\nSo called neutral platforms and media companies they've gotten a free pass in terms of regulation because they insist that they are neutral platforms and therefore they have no legal liability they have no regulatory controls whatsoever\nBut the fact of the matter is they are not neutral platforms they do it and that that they exert editorial control or that they do um uh hide certain stories and push other stories so I think that this calls for a fresh look at how we deal with Google and I think\nPart of that fresh ... has to be looking at antitrust action they dominate roughly Ninety percent of global search in the United states it's eighty five Ninety percent and that to me is a dominant position that's
