interesting moral question your views on it might disagree with\nLight views but as you say the question is who's going to take this decision isn't going to be America for the corporate\nPolicies Facebook or whoever it is it's manufacturing technology will do we think this is a broader social issues\nThere should be determined by reference to principles that we all know what other stab bats in parliament sort ... legislatures when the price of oil publicly ocean do you as an individual use uh taking up all your conscience to decide whether you should do show systems such as it\nIs a big political question that we don't we know we we better you started asking a lesson I'd altering or\nDo you do you ever get the feeling that that all of this is sounding the alarm is is sort of like what happened with climate change and global warming that uh you know it's it's happening it's happening we're in the middle of it\nAnd suddenly it's here and whether or not people are listening is the question and how do you take that and go okay we need more police saying well who's the person that says what the policing should be these are all such big questions to be asked\nUm the answers have to come I think what you're saying in the book sort of um collectively because we are all still living together it has to be a collective answer\nAbsolutely I think the analogy of climate change is a very very good what climate change is a global problem like issue technology it's up to a long term problem in the sense that it creeps up on you and it's no wait and immediately opiates that it's a gender thing to a two year reelection cycle full\nYear reelection cycle which makes an unattractive aspect of policy to talk about so I tried to do in the book is say to people you know one of the basic jobs are being a citizen in the future to understand the technology but increasingly given our lives I certainly think that one of the jobs\nOf being a legislature the feature to understand technology I think one of the jobs are being a technologist is to understand the politics and the ball implications but the basic point you make is right this is a\nProblem that is ruled and why the generation that we like it at college at the amount of special interest groups on edge on the sidelines who are interested in it\nSo I uh I spend my days trying to achieve a critical lack of people

less than we're we're living right now and apparently that is not a dream is it\nNo it's not it can sound like so much marketing hype I Know on the surface but look more closely you look at it you begin to realize that there are a lot of interesting pretty pleasant safe welcoming places\nTo live around the world that are really super affordable the cost of living is low but right now there is something that's kind of super charging this idea and that's the strength of the u._s. dollar against so many currencies worldwide the euro\nFor example the Colombian peso the Mexican peso a Dominican Republic peso so countries that are on our short list of\nReally interesting and and appealing places to consider some of them are even more affordable than ever right now for Americans\nAnd now in your book on how to retire overseas ... that you can retire on a budget of his little is twelve hundred dollars per month and probably live better than where you're living right now\nThat's true even on a budget of about twelve hundred dollars a month you have several really I think\nInteresting places chicken sitter look at say Quaker Ecuador ... maybe a beach town on the coast of the Dominican Republic for many that's the ultimate\nDream of paradise and it really is possible to live there on that budget these aren't going to be luxury leveled lifestyles you know you aren't going to be living in a penthouse high rise\nWith the driver and a maid and eating out five nights a week but you aren't going to be living in a dangerous neighborhood back off the beach and unable to afford\nTo ever go out and do anything either in these places I'm suggesting like\nEcuador Billy's Dominican Republic the average local income can be five hundred seven hundred eight hundred dollars a month so if you have\nTwelve hundred dollars a month relative to to the rest of the economy you're very well off\nA lot of this is dependent on how well the dollar is doing\nIt is in in some cases but in in the case of Ecuador no because Ecuador in Panama use the U.S dollar if you have a very limited budget and it's fixed because you're retiring say on Social Security alone them one way to take this concern about currency exchange rates off the table\nIs to choose a place that uses the U.S dollar and the two best options in that category right now would be Ecuador in Panama\nWhat about the financial issues things like taxes currency exchange things like that that might trip you up if you're not careful\nTaxes is an interesting point because an American does retain his tax obligation to the IRS no matter where he is living or how long he's living outside the United states but the thing to understand is it's a tax filing obligation not necessarily an obligation to owe tax so every
