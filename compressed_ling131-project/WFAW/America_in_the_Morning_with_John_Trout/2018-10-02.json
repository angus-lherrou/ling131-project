policy analyst\nThis would involve I gather first and foremost a number of changes regarding making automobiles\nYeah that's a big one so I'm the agreement we have what China for whatever reason as lopsided in favor of the Chinese and to our detriment China makes a car\nTells it here or we charge a two and a half percent tariff we make a car sell in China they charge us a twenty five percent or more on some products China was even trying to get out of the two and a half percent tariff and they did that by\nSending a car that was three quarters of the way finish\nTo Mexico Mexico would put a ... a little things on it the hub cats and a few things\nAnd then say we produce the car in Mexico so we can sell it in the U.S without paying any towers at all this agreement says that large percentages of the car and more than Seventy five percent of the car has to be made in Mexico in order to qualify for no a terrorist\nThough that and uh same thing with\nCanada Canada has uh some agreements that are lopsided in in their favor for instance or the dairy farmers\nUS can produce a product in the U.S a dairy farmers can produce a product sell it for a dollar there dairy farmers costs three fifty so Canada want to put\nTo protect their dairy farmers they were going to put two hundred and Seventy percent tariff on that says something it costs the dollar has a two dollar and Seventy cents tariffs that'll sell for three Seventy the Canadians can do it for three fifty\nKeeps the Canadian dairy farmers in business closes the American dairy farmers out of that Canadian market this agreement begins to and that doesn't completely ended up against the end\nAnd Brazil but it would be a model for other deals that we do down the road to principally a one on one with the Chinese when you appear to my nighttime talk show you indicated that some of the trade deals that we have made with other countries are just\nAbysmal they are terribly lopsided against the United states in other words we ... we heard Donald Trump throughout the campaign and we're now starting to learn to things or at least that bad and maybe worse\nWhat in your view was the motivation or my personal thought would be that the motivation has to do with this sense that\nThe United states is so rich and the rest of the world was oh so poor and therefore we owe it to other countries do shaft ourselves and ah and therefore make it easier for other countries but which is a pretty lame excuses in my view\nYes yeah I I'm not sure what exactly the motivation is but every single one of the trade agreements as lopsided in favor of the trade partner laughed at what we have with the European Union agreements with China South Korea which we sort of fixed a little bit\nLast time a last week rather and Japan to their all lopsided and as a result of that\nWere buying a lot of their products and our money flows out of the country they're buying very few of our products so very few little of their money is flowing into the country we have a huge negative balance of trade the tune of hundreds of billions\nOf dollars every year Trump said I'm not going to allow that to continue I'm going to get people to the table quickly\nGoing to create a sense of urgency to bring them to the table I'm going to slap\nTariffs on we're in a stronger position than they are they're all going to come to the table and negotiate with us and I'm going to make sure we come up with a deal that is much more fair\nToward the Americans were going to put the U.S make America great again and we're going to put America number one let's concentrate on Americans first and then we'll take a look at other people\nAnd when we look at Americans of course there are consumers and there are producers of things and I guess that the policy up till now has been pretty much one of\nLet's give everybody a slight break on some prices and a few Americans we will simply a driver stay to their hearts and will rip out their jobs and and uh in some cases destroy entire communities but it only affects a few and the rest of us will get cheaper brooms isn't it pretty much the argument that it's been followed up till now\nThat's exactly right that if if we make things in China where they pay their workers are they started out as a dollar a day there are a little bit uh over that but\nIf we make things in in China instead of making it in the U.S having a shirt cost fifty dollars making in China bring it over here it only costs twenty five dollars consumers will be able to buy more shirts they should have a
