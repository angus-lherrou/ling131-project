about this with Rob and like the general counsel and director of the center for the American future at the Texas Public policy foundation their website Texas policy dot com\nA long and painful procedure but uh for the administration did has been a significant victory your thoughts about any lessons that you hope we should look we have learned or that we should have learned from this entire process\nHas been a world where the past several weeks but the right outcome we got to at the end I think in the wrong path or do I think there's two lessons you learned on is that when conservative stand up and do the right thing\nAnd have courage that we can get to the right outcome\nAnd the second lesson is that and looking back over the past month this is an experience that the American people should never be drugs through and she never made to to any person again as what was it was done to judge now justice Cavanaugh\nI Would I Would agree with you or one of the thing that I think that we might keep in mind and that is that if someone suffers a sexual assault that is a terrible thing one can hope that if the person who did that is a brought to justice is try if convicted is sufficiently punished\nAnd I am prepared to bend over backwards offering all kinds of ah a constellation and uh and sympathy to such people\nHowever when such a person then goes in the direction of accusing someone else will having done this\nI'm afraid the standard has to be considerably higher neighborly you've got to have some kind of goods to actually offer you've got to be able to be specific to offer the kinds of things that can in fact lead to a credible accusation otherwise it's not enough to say that I was one sexually assaulted and\nLet's pick some guy whoever's handy because any will do because they're all pigs that doesn't cut it\nWe were so close in this to setting a new standard that\nThe accusation is the conviction itself and we saw that start to snowball when you started to ... completely absurd accusations ... none of us late\nOr alleged against justice Kavanaugh after the first couple of allegations began to to gain traction and\nIt quickly spiraled out of control I think that the Senate Judiciary committee should be commended as Karen Grassley at bringing this back to a disciplined focus process\nThey gave it a fair opportunity for\nCredible accusations to be evaluated a but also moved to that through and got to an end point where with sufficient have information that committee was able to make an informed choice in this one I think it was the correct one to confirm justice catalog\nAnother lesson that I Would hope that would be learned would be if in fact someone does suffer a sexual assault it\nMay be terrible you may want to manage the memory from your mind if you wish justice\nYou should make yourself sit down and write down details names places times are all kinds of information that they can actually be used to because if in fact you allow the terror of the moment to just a\nWash away the details you cease to be a credible witness but that's another lesson that I think perhaps that we might learn on the on the confirmation process itself\nA or their reforms that should be made or is it just a case of live the gross national attitude\nYou know I think a lesson for and what the reform is that I Would like to see is I Would like to see accountability against those that abuse the system I would like to see accountability against any staff at the Capitol that leaks confidential information\nI Would like to see accountability against individuals subject to the penalty of perjury that intentionally provided the false information to the committee we have to draw the line and say the truth matters\nAnd that windows are going to use the process there has to be consequences so that hopefully that will be a just waiting to anyone to try to repeat those types of abuses in the future\nRobin ... general
