Kevin\nI'm you've got Kansas City a New England fifty nine so moved treated right there that you got a lot of total so that gives you an indication of what what type of a\nFire power that's out there the season and then about\nAll right you just mentioned Kansas City New England my home's did not have a great game last week New England as a couple of guys back Adelman included that seemed to make a difference just to talk about Kansas City of New England it should be an exciting game on Sunday night\nThis is going to be the actually the game of the week or for Sunday night and that you know this is the one where you know is there a tell all these to say get your popcorn ready because you know this is going to be a great game to watch 'em when you look at the New England\nIf you know it's there's a tell all these to get your popcorn ready because you know this is going to be a great game to watch 'em when you look at the New England patriots they're starting to come together now\nI'm sure they add a little full started out of the game they had a tough game there again um what do you call it the Jacksonville in a week to I Believe that went down in Jacksonville we had a tough one week one twenty seven twenty against the Texans and then they got destroyed I'm In Detroit plenty thick stand but you look at the last couple of gained\nThirty eight seven at home again to the dolphins they won last week or thirty eight twenty four\nSo you know things are coming together now Josh warnings that are now\nUm you know the the weapons are they've got idleman back a Brady is Brady he's hitting sixty seven percent on the season ah and there was a revenge factor here you know or the last the last year a week one Kansas City came in there and they one forty two twenty seven so I'm New England or you know they're they're one of the toughest\nTeams at home in the NFL and that will do some research\nAnd going back to the last two years and including the first five games of the season\nNew England has the best home record in the NFL at Nineteen and five and they've covered Seventeen Seminole for the spread so um if there's one team you don't want to face at home in New England but Kansas City on the other hand you know these these guys\nAll they do is is just keep winning right and then we talked about this last week\nYou know sometimes you just look at a team and all they do is win and eat eat do you just can't look for reasons to be able to go against them they just like to you know just they just have the uh the magic firepower going there on our fence but you know uh it's not as if they're reading a lot of world leaders right that they played the chargers\nThe Steelers well you know they had them lead to a shootout or they played the forty niners than they one thirty twenty seven I'm the big one a tight one in the Denver twenty seven twenty three and then they will not home last week and the ants are the Jacksonville Jaguars so\nI'm looking at um New England to dominate this game here this weekend and there'll be um VHS uh\nUh the Rand report has a New England linguists game twenty two points out on the sixteenth point six till we like the patriots and this one here\nFolks on line is I see it or the patriots three and a half versus Kansas City and the Raymond report drawn Raymond likes a New England by six and a half and your thoughts and again all you have to do to sign up for the ... report to matter where you might be listening you go to ATF stash dot com ATS danced dot com and again that's\nA very very hot or the report was last week go right to another game this week um [noise] and this one's always interesting Pittsburgh Cincinnati and Marvin Lewis again has never won a playoff game I don't know it was a chief does this year is he out or not because people say that every year anyways Pittsburgh Cincinnati or\nI don't see much chance here what do you see\nYeah well again right we've talked about the runner in this game is that fifty three and you know that's Bruce firepower the only concern I have with Pittsburgh right now is okay big banner is lighting up he's hitting these two Fifteen for a one thirty eight for two Fifteen on the seasons hitting a fifty four percent of his classes\nThe running game against Connor but the thing here that scares me a little bit of both I always say in the running game you know bad men needs Robin and right\nNow Conor\nThen ... burger is your second leading Russian on the team now that's not good [laughter] you know what I'm saying so they're going to have to find a a another goal and live you know they'll come back after the um the by so that's going to give them a little boost\nBut you know they're receiving corps they're the defense\nAre still you know still running a lot of points um but\nYou look at the Pittsburgh Steelers when they're facing that AFC North division teams are seven and two and one on the straight up\nAnd when they're facing the Cincinnati Bengals in Cincinnati there are six and one straight up so they got the bangles number at home and uh you know the Pittsburgh Steelers they're good very good role team there eight one in one in the last ten and when I look at the last two years\nOr the Steelers have one of the best records on the road at fourteen five and one and the only thing that's better than the Steelers is the New England patriots which are sixteen and three so I'm you know and you look at the first game like there in every game\nAnd they can put some points on the board and then you know if if you look at Cincinnati last week they got down Seventeen nothing and uh you know they they rallied a nice little come back but you you can't do that against the big teams because they you know sometimes you look in the fourth quarter is too late so I look for Pittsburgh\nHere too I'm pulling this game\nRon Raymond ... you mentioned living does gonna come back after the break comparing to James Caan or because I said hunters are good running back and get here's a guy who defeated cancer so you you know you just wish the best form\nShe the jaguars you've been going there every year and they were so bad for
