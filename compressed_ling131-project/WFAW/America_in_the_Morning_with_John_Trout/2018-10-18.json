civilized country which could ever have this as an outcome\nOh you're right about that gym but as we both know there's nothing about that country that I wouldn't call civilized\nIt's one of the most brutal and barbaric regimes in the history of the world I think from the way they treat women to the way they treat people like this like this journalist and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood as I understand that\nAre released a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood yeah the reporters really does not seem to be the most\nSavory character a ... on the planet but again there's little about that peninsula that is a a twenty first century and or if it's verge you one thing that I find that truly remarkable while I Would not for one moment put such a vicious murderous past the Saudi regime\nBut I have in the past thought that they were fairly adept at dealing with the United states that has to say to be aware of what the reaction would be to something like this so they don't like this

know there's a tape of him thing or somebody telling you hear me better be quiet you better shut up or you know this is going to happen to you back in Saudi Arabia essentially\nHave their own questions I gather about the uh the technical means used to a a record of various things that are attributed to the possible demise of the of the journalism question\nAgain the bottom line I suppose is that we are promised an explanation by the Saudis census was Saudi Government property and I'm not sure who else would be in a position to really uh offer information about what was happening on their property the problem is of course\nThat a salary explanation to say the very least a cannot be taken at face value\nIt cannot\nI mean they're certainly not going oh yeah we send a wet team in there to chop him up for our lives but that's exactly what it sounds like happened and say they did it\nWell it it would certainly so appear uh that that is the case now that given the fact that the Saudis have been useful in that part of the world and standing up to Iran be mostly stabilizing single element in the region\nAgain it's already does not excuse this kind of behavior but if you look at the options that are available in the Saudi peninsula there are no Tom ... a or a John Adams was walking around that peninsula the choices they live\nIf they did and they would live if they did the choices are pretty much the Saudi royal family brutal but more or less friendly to this country or\nAl ... or ISIS equally brutal and very unfriendly to this country in other words the notion of
