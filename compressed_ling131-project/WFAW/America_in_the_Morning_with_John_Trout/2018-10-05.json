interesting that has apparently been shown a blade or as a has been reported in a number of of Venus a Republican interest in the mid term election is up but uh still I gather the lead generic ballots are still show some edge to Democrats\n[laughter] yeah there's still a lot of energy and the Democratic side and that's not subsided that's only gonna get increased uh because of the left anger if Kavanaugh is\nIndeed confirmed as it looks like he may be and so the Democrats are have that anger towards Trump mostly and so this has occurred over to trying to\nAh really showed trunk that uh he is not the only one who's in charge of the government if they want to have a check and balance system and that's how the competition works and parties traditionally lose many seats in the mid term it as well\nAnd ironically I Believe the average in recent years a for a a a party that just taking over the presidency and their first midterm they tend to lose I Believe on average twenty four seats with just happens to be the current margin but I'm not mistaken [noise] so uh that's certainly cutting the line fine\nYeah and uh if you talked to some of the things that they could lose Tony [laughter] and so this is a real a blue wave that seems to be building and even though the Republicans are a little more energetic\nAdvocate Kevin that may not hold for a whole month or without him in the news

like a you know Democrats are getting more ethic and Massachusetts great but uh that doesn't a diary they're going to move the needle\nYeah [noise] and I I look at at the the outcome or let's assume that as we speak or that it does go as it seems to be trending and that is the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nSo Democrats would lose going into the midterm election November sixth and would that make them dispirited and disheartened discouraged or would it make the mad as hell\nI come on the side that as kind of make them more encouraged to go to the polls because uh and
