ready my trout\nListen he may be the best player but how many game to the ...\nI think a I'm Sorry I missed that many games you can't be named player of the year is improved just play in center field he's now a top notch center fielder and I think he's probably the best all around player but if you missed thirty something games can you win\nBy or a beer baseball America says yes what do you say one eight hundred eight seven eight play one eight hundred eighty seven eight seven five to nine let's go to a case HP fourteen hundred in Las Vegas and record talking baseball what's on your mind\nDuring the games is less than twenty percent and that's just a decent tip so\nMight drop the best player in baseball and unfortunately he's with the west the best team\nSo um and you know I have a question for I have a crushing the empowering white okay and this has to do with the instant replay okay how fine line or is it drawn\nI have seen replay call somebody out because their hand came up a second base\nMaybe a quarter of an inch while the tag was still applied and I think they've gone too far I think that the hitting the Rockies game which was which was bell with all that magnification it was ... but in the old days that's or you know after bases clearing double or triple down the line there so\nUh I'm not a real big fan of the of instant replay ... in ... in total\nBut don't you think the magnification has gone too far that maybe they could limit that that is a technological or they have that ability to do that where you're going to remember you're probably five five or ... times and and that's it can go to a hundred times\nWell let's go to David York of empires media David you have a strong opinion on that\nRole I Am an opinion I'm either want to ... to be called writer your dog show to arbitrarily say it'll be five times magnification or a hundred cars to produce or\nThe only reason to have a crucial issue to call the play and what factors that technology allows us to call the police were called in to report everybody or or whatever you\nAre so Alaska or or ... recalled right or not\nYou know in Iraq surely not when it's down not when it's down to a thousand which\nYou can magnify I'm a photographer you're magnify something I've been to see that I don't think that's the intention of instant replay is that replaced her you know corrective obvious air or something to remove me as a little too close to call\nBut honestly one or two guys for coming off the beggar each book coming off the bag by your worst than a quarter of an inch you consume clearly just through the magnet the production process I think that's wrong or did you get the human element out out of run part we could have total Roebuck\nThis isn't a discount

America\nMaybe my favorite part of the show up during the football season certainly is a Ron Raymond Indonesia Rehman report in the world series of handicapping without further ado Ron Raymond how are you doing [noise]\nHey how you doing buddy love is is this is great this is a I got to keep saying every week it's like Christmas now to go over and you know they're not\nFail college football you know up here that the bell NHL Hockey starting and major league baseball by God was that a lot to talk about these days\n[noise] All right uh well first of all let's talk about the uh\nRaymond report doing very well I think about sixty two percent last time we check tell us how folks can jump aboard the ramen report\nYeah it's a little bit of a hiccup lots where he's not too bad still a positive result we want eight and seven um and fire in one week all evidence ... nine and six week three and a ... fifty two percent on the season\nAnd there people are interested in the rain report all they've got to do is go to ATF dot dot com and a sign up and\nGive it a shot in it and there's also a lot of tests to test trial we have a link at the top that has a pretty rare report and uh we um we showcase one game of each league do people want to check it out or they can just to test drives out one game\nATF steps dot com ATS match dot com for the Raymond the report and um the world series of handicapping is that guy still doing as well\nYeah you know what he's still reading but it cooled off or just the ... were you born one and you know okay it's like you know what goes on to come down right but the as it is still leading the contest the Nineteen men to for fifty four point seven units\nAnd uh right behind them there is a guy called shot caller\nAnd he's Eighteen nine and one fifty point to their units and I'll read one is Seventeen eleven and all for forty six point nine zero units which is still impressive and the way the contests where it is a huge conduct and make seven flush them each week they write those stakes are from seven units one unit\n... and at the end of the year the a player who wins the contest\nWins a role in cash and the world series on handicapping a ring [noise]\nHey Renee I got to tell you the truth you know everybody who does these shows that I've been doing for forty years think that we could\nBe an NFL scouts or major league baseball scouts alright I saw pat ... played many a game at Texas Tech I thought yeah he could play in the national football league\nBut I got to be honest with you I had no idea if you're playing like he's playing now that left handed batch last weekend it was on believable how many times do you ever seen anything like that\nI'd never seen anything like that um you know it's funny because a lot kind of fell network and there's a lot of comparisons and then that's what happens when you get the uh the the quarterback or them all looked at as is having a great season and everybody tries to compare them and everybody's comparing them right now there are\nAnd the only thing that um yeah I Know he just he something special right now and uh you know he's a plea and if you're an NFL fan he's a ... or ... you pay that they could see that guy play football player\nYou know he's a ... and if you're an NFL fan and he he's a young you the price of admission you pay that they could see that guy play football for sure\nI tend to put you on the spot or they got a tough game is a week or ... against the chiefs uh jak strain on teach a course for no she's of course have that home field advantage or how do you see that one working out\nYeah you know what this is I'm a a good for you know a different of mine in the industry longer you know rough color he used to keep saying you know you get into the situations in in at the beginning of the year where you did a team like Kansas city's four no and you keep saying yourself okay this is a week they have a let down factor this week\nI'm you know that this team beat them\nAnd they just nine out of ten times these teams just keep winning and then you just you train your your mind to say you know what that they can't continue like this\nAnd then you look at the end of the season I see no they're fourteen and do their team and three and inside the plant like this where you look at these teams and you say you know what they are a good team and I look at the Jacksonville uh the jaguar team there are very good team also but the thing with Jacksonville\nOkay is there a Jekyll and Hyde team on off and they got a great defense a big plane a at a good cup division now Tennessee a game a good ... a ... a couple of weeks ago uh you know they have this off a call ... game last week against the gas\nAnd um I have a stat here on the Jacksonville Jaguars and you know they benefited from uh from some home home cooked in the last three weeks you know they played the the last three um you know they've only been on the road once this year was weak one against the jets\nAnd that one Jacksonville is on the road and they're coming off the three game homes than their wandering made against the spread straight up and uh yeah so this is going to be a tough tough test for Jacksonville North for net this week\nYou had a hot quarterback with I'm Patrick my home and on\nAnd uh the the Rand report is all over the game and and they\nYou know and the thing with the rain report a threat if it's the typical based and sometimes you know you want to maybe I got to incorporate more of the situational angles into this thing but I'm all over Kansas City this week I agree with the Rand report and before we have is um\nWe have the uh twenty nine or sorry I just got to bring to celebrate here yeah we have ten city twenty nine point two five to twenty but we like the ah the change in this one\nTo win and to cover hum a the Raymond report of course I\nDo is going to ATF staff dot com ATF stats dot com or the world series of handicapping just go to the world series of anti Kevin running how long\nHave you been doing the the Raymond report\n[noise] so the Raymond reports been going on since about two thousand and five oh I've been in the industry since Nineteen Ninety nine a started in the old days or you know when there was like I remember the you know there was a better world and\nSure ah the ... all those guys in the beginning but uh we started a a started off with a site called ... dot com and\nYeah you know I grew into other sites and yeah and now the ATF the stats is the home of the rain report\nI used to choose your handicapping on a scenic chicken to never forget that it is a lot of fun and uh\nWe did pretty well a second about something that not doing pretty well and that's the falcons and the Steelers falcons one in three the Steelers one two and one\nFolks I mean a pianist out there and you're listening and of course you can email us sports sprint at AOL dot com tell me your thoughts about going to be one in three and the Steelers one to win one for weeks into the season but I ... the question has to be said and asked of Ron Raymond I think James Garner battled through cancer\nNice young man can play in the national football league but he is not loving and do is build a difference why the Steelers are doing with it or is it their defense or lack there of\nWell you know what that is a combination of a lot of things and the thing when you're you're involved in the football team there there is a a Brotherhood and chemistry that's built and when when the when the big piece of the puzzle like love on bell is not in training camp\nYou know there's things that you just don't want to keep ... every day and it just gets annoying\nAnd I feel for might sound like you know of course he walked all is pieces right and the thing with a lot of coming in here and you use that as one and three and then there's an old saying in life right misery loves company and what a great a\nWhat a great uh you know invitation for the Pittsburgh Steelers to have this weekend to have a team that\nYou know again like Jacksonville coming off the tree any malls than\nAnd um you know they're coming into a and they see a stadium where they haven't done well against um non conference opponent one wouldn't be a lot of falcons\nAround the Homer road in their face in the non conference opponent the last three years there too Nate against the spread and three and seven straight up\nBut like what is she fearing well what do you fear whoa what would be the repercussions of doing that\nBut I don't know why you would regret doing that\nHe asked for more we asked for a long term deal they didn't give it to only got hurt ... he's losing millions of dollars I don't know why he would regret flipping off the Seahawks management does ownership would be upset with them yes oh were\nMad at you for what for not for\nNot accepting your faith in life I mean what are you know I mean his teammates are all going to they're they're gonna understand oh the rates are like well done are you kidding they probably all wish they had the opportunity\nTo do that and pretty much every uh every blurred the NFL's like I Wish I could do that\nI Wish one time one time I could give the middle\nFinger to everybody of you know in the in the organization that is trying to screw me over that man and maybe it's the talk of the organizations I'm certain Brady wants to get on to ... know 'course she does coursing\nUnbelievably I made you not the other way around so yeah no kidding [noise] so the fact of the matter is Steelers will get love you all go back and we'll see where it goes from there they might be out of the playoff picture by then the way they're playing nevertheless\nEight hundred seven seven seven zero seven

Red Sox but if you want to hundred plus when teeth\nThat have a history against each other that are excellent baseball teams where one of them is going to go home after a five game series and there is tradition and there is compelling personalities and there are stars on both sides of the of this rivalry\nThen I think you get you're getting a baseball series it's worth your attention it's hard I get it because the way\nThe media the national media makes every Yankees Red Sox game in June and may the most important thing under the sun and if you live in Colorado where you live in Los Angeles or you live in Seattle you live in Oklahoma or you live wherever\nIt doesn't resonate and no matter how hard these national media entities tried to Jemma down your throat it just doesn't resonate but this was going to\nBe a very good series [noise] these are two teams that are very very loaded\nAnd there's there's an advantage to the red Sox because they can pitch and they can pitch better than the Yankees but don't under estimating the five game series how far hot bats can take you I don't trust taught bashing the seven game series because I Do think in the end\nGood pitching it along seven game must win for\nKind of kind of a kind of your week week and a week and a half\nYou know my thing for prime which player forces opposing coaches to make the most adjustments LeBron it's sixty percent James Harden the twenty percent\nOr which player is most likely to have a breakout season in two thousand Eighteen thousand Nineteen I was I really liked this picked because I was talking about um last year Jamal Maria Denver I'm real drummer he played great last year I was really really liking this answer\nA brand name of the LA Lakers would have been my picky came in second but I liked the fact that they're recognizing Jamal Marie in Denver airing board and was third for land which seven percent less point guard in the NBA Steph Curry Russell Westbrook as second at Seventeen percent Korea fifty seven\nWho's the mass shooting guard in the NBA that goes to James Harden who's the best small forward in the NBA that goes to la Braun who's the best power forward in the NBA as Antony\nDavison who's the best senator in the NBA that's also Anthony Davis and interesting interesting which team made the best overall move this off season okay here's where I get this is where I get silly\nThe number one team in this in this survey who made the best offseason move\nThe number one team is the Lakers but here's my problem with the answer Seventy percent of the GM's that were polled said the Lakers that meant to one percent said in Toronto and everybody else said Dallas Indiana or Oklahoma City\nWhy wasn't this Ninety five or a hundred years got the brawn James ... Leonard\nAnd going through the raptors is a better off season move than LeBron James going to the Lakers that's just\nThat's just trying to be different that's just like when when you know four or five dentist surveys recommend sugar was gone for the patients who chew gum there's that one didn't just it's like no I don't recommend sugar ... if you chew gum now because I'm going to be the outlier in this survey it's not going to be five to five\nIt's just you know that's that's the ah those those are two or three writers not voting Ken griffey junior and to vastly exactly just outta spite just out of no one can be unanimous\nI Will be I think it's a hundred percent the Lakers and LeBron James it's a smoker the off season but didn't want to invest some of the decade and one of the quietest moves to exactly very all of a sudden it was just oh\nIs it like a cool\n... which one player acquisition will make the biggest impact okay Ninety seven percent of the brawn James but Seventy percent said it was the best overall move this off season he's silly GM's what's wrong with you ... Kevin's with the most underrated player acquisition and Lee demar to Rosen was second\nThe Marta rose and I don't think it was an underrated we talked about that a lot\nOf the Lakers or the team most likely to improve this upcoming season Dallas got seven percent\nDallas Dallas seven but they do is they look a look at ... ... what do they do he he's been voted the work he's now he's voted the rookie the upcoming rookie of the year Marvin badly the third Sacramento Seventeen percent the number two ah let's see if\nYou know I'll go back on my comments 'cause dollars is really bad last year or that there should be allowed but Lakers yeah by far and away are going to be the most improved Jane\n... been Rudy go bare the best defensive players in the NBA Carl entered the best perimeter defender ah let's see most versatile defenders dream on green\nOkay is it to the kitchen and the uh you know they're not exactly here's one I really really like OK who's the head coach in the NBA\nThe Greg ... now my ... now Steve Kerr know best coach in the NBA according GM's is Brad Stevens of the cell that would have said that yeah but here you know what's funny about that I remember when Brad Stevens got that job\nAnd the butler yeah it was like the Celtics were terrible and Danny Ainge was like I'm rebuilding man I Need somebody that's going to hang around while we rebuild this thing and he was young and he comes from butler and I my thought was okay it's a ...\nIt's a perfect trade off and I know said this many times Brad Stevens go into the Celtics I thought it was perfect trade off for both those a win win for both Danny Ainge had a young coach that was going to put up with some bad basketball with some bad basketball players 'cause he was going to get rid of some contracts he was going to move some players\nAny of the young coach that was eager to be in the league Brad Stevens was going to get NBA experience learn the arenas learn the referees learned how to schedule how to how to kind of pace yourself in an eighty two games schedule in terms of coaching he's going to learn how to do that\nAnd then you know when the time is right in the Celtics were going to get ready to become really good get the players that they wanted to get the draft that they wanted they would probably go to a more experienced coach but Stevens would've been in the league long enough\nTo maybe land with somebody else oh no no no that's not how that worked at all Stevens ended up becoming a winner almost immediately in Boston and now GM's think he's the best coach in the NBA God Bless the the young kid\nThat's fantastic well not only that but I mean you think about what he did last year with the same yeah he's out age or an hour if they were the entire\nWere really you know I'm tired of this for the entire season minus Iran got hurt and they got her and he's still\nThat was it George ... if they were the entire will look you know I'm tired of this for the entire season minus Iran got hurt and they got her and he still took a deep into the playoffs\n[noise] what's your children's the best often Steve Kerr now he has the best players yeah that's [laughter] that's\nKinda too but that's silly which he does not run the best stuff as I Do you how many times he draw up a yes or no if\nYou have a dream on I Want you to go to you know this way Kevin you're going to hear stuff you're just going to fire is shot from half court the exact like come on and that was drawn up trying to play Kevin red clay Thompson Steph Curry dream agreed on the court you're telling me he's drawing offensive to ask him what next year he's gonna be the best stuff as a coach too\nWhich team is the most fun to watch Golden State of sixty percent I buy that\nI Know you're on your hands all over I was I think yeah I think Houston's fun to watch I think he's been should've got more than seven percent of both I like Houston Houston this way fun\nOh which team is the best home court advantage Golden State of fifty percent promising in court Philadelphia\nOh which players the most athletic Russell Westbrook forty eight percent honest fourteen that's pure stew shooters Steph Curry wow I Am no surprise that they're Seventy three I mean what does which which what twenty seven percent didn't save Steph Curry\nCome on a player fast is with the ball is Russell Westbrook I thought John Wall I think John walls the passes but you know it's probably just apples and and Macintosh and granny Smiths\nI mean I'm Talking about you really really good players or let's really good apples I now I Will say no or which players the best leader LeBron James at thirty percent Chris Paul at twenty seven percent the most versatile is LeBron the player with the best I\nShe was LeBron oh here's here's my one of my favorite questions which rules needs to change the most one the number one Eighteen percent I Wish it was higher playoff feeding one through sixteen or we find we talking about this all the ... all the time every time we get to like just\nJust get rid of the conferences and see them wanting to sixteen and you you might have a much better playoffs\nYeah especially in recent years when the ... it was an east really was just it was only LeBron but then it it out or what team around was on a just LeBron is going to make to make it to the finals it would've been nice like say last year it'll be nice to have a a have a warriors rockets\nOh of course my mother's sixteen and they just see them that way I just had warriors rockets in the final ... oh God I Would have been\nFantastic I Wonder if Adam Silver is going to toy with that idea that would be very interesting idea try once he was trying to do what I Want\nBut doesn't work then you know what this is a
