states\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nTrump made his comments during an interview on accents on HBO but some members of Congress said this executive order idea is not going to fly\nYou cannot and birthright citizenship but an executive order\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan in an interview with W. V. I. okay radio host Larry Glover says Trump is getting some bad advice if he thinks he can\nYou know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear\nThe fourteenth amendment gratified in July Eighteenth sixty eight reads in part all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and the state where and they reside Speaker Ryan says that very phrase means the president cannot simply change immigration policy on his own\nWhat does it very clear is you can't change this via executive at the very least it would have to be statutory through Congress Ryan\nIs not alone in challenging the president's ability to change immigration law without congressional action\nSenate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley towns Iowa CBS too it seems the words were born in the United states as they pretend to citizenship a pretty simple\nBut the president has an ally and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says he will introduce a bill after the midterm elections that will accomplish the president's goal to crack down on illegal immigration in a series of tweets grand says his legislation will be along the same lines says the\nProposed executive order and he writes finally a president willing to take on this absurd policy a birthright citizenship\nOr they say the president's talk of executive action is a blatant effort to fanned the flames of anti immigrant sentiment\nJust days before the midterms Democrat Amy Klobuchar says voters should not in her words take the bait Speaker Ryan ... even with a Republican controlled house and Senate the president's plan is a nonstarter we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws being executive action and obviously as conservatives um you know we believe in in in the constitution\nIf Senator Graham steel gains any traction and Congress it would have to cross him steep hurdles legal analysts say it would likely require the repeal of the fourteenth amendment and then approval of a new amendment this process requires approval by two thirds of both houses of Congress and ratification by three quarters of the states\nSince the constitutional amendment process can take years to complete Paul Ryan says there is a better way\nI think the ... the

day\nWe give me a lot of fun you know this whole time of year can be a lot of ... joined us he is an expert\nOn the travel and the amusement parks vacation and the like and he's a good offer some thoughts about some of the best Halloween as thrill ride that are out there and the holiday travel in the in general\nHow big of a deal is that how big an industry is it for a Halloween thrill rides and what kind of a spectacular special effects are available these days\nAbout Thirty years ago this was unheard of the only the uh the southern portion of the Bible belt or like a land or Six Flags over Texas did it nowadays you can find some of the best Halloween uh uh I I guess the facts and\nAnd different uh different events at places like universal studios are not scary farm in California Kenny ... and ... west ... um I guess the Halloween weekend cedar point which Sandusky, Ohio and of course Disney is going to be doing\nThe Mickey not so scary Halloween parties which are great at both ... and of course a scare winds its heroines and and uh North Carolina and a and one is ... how the streams so there's a lot of that ad becomes very big business and\nPeople just love going to these events\nSo I guess age appropriate message is important for many of these things right I mean you you can't a scare the daylights out of the some kid who's five years old\nThrough and the great part about the amusement parks whether it's summertime wintertime or even Christmas Time is that there's something for everyone at the parks you've got the the really crazy rides for the kids you've got the smaller ride\nFor the for the toddlers you've got an tactic shows where everyone really has to audition in order to actually be picked on the food or you know the different types of food and plus for the older people they they will and scooter is now a because normally takes about four or five miles of walking\nTo the entire park so these are these are ways that the whole family could come together in a very short period of time and and make memories\nYou've got the uh been there done that syndrome or people get bored easily and so I guess there's a a never ending escalation bless you got to go out do your competitor and the result is that I Would have to think that some of these rides\nWind up asking even things as as tough as a as steel and concrete to do things that maybe they weren't designed to do short question how dangerous are these rides\nThese rides a pretty safe I mean if you go back to the turn of the century at Coney Island where there were a lot of injuries and it's gotten much safer technology is actually surpassed uh uh these injuries in fact you are very rarely hear of an incident when it does occur and amusement park or any type of the year\nI usually on the news so you'll hear them very often and you really have about a one and two hundred and fifty million sense of being involved in a cafe Tallahassee and them years before I could add to that\nNinety five percent of those incidents that we'll be right or Arab not the actual amusement park but something that the writer did a that was not something that would they needed to do or or told not to do during the ride\nHold on rides based on the old aspects of pop culture like video games or movies like like say ghost busters are there are there rides based around but he strings\nYou'll find a ride based on most of the marvel and DC Comics of course Batman you'll find several of those all around you've also got a\nAll the rides but Spider Man for example or you've got to Iraq and roller coaster which is\nA geared towards the Aerosmith uh people who love the Aerosmith uh it's a very big way to draw people in\nIs to make it after a movie or a comic or something that uh that people can actually uh you know in get involved in and most importantly while you're waiting to go to these rides there's a nice Q line so you can see this story unfold\nBefore you actually ride the roller coaster so that's been a big thing at a big plus for amusement parks or to actually drop people and\nWhat about indoor ride or does that exist and now we play football in doors now\nAmusement parks to actually drop people and\nWhat about indoor ride or does that exist and we play football and doors now\n[noise] indoor rides are amazing and one of the best and I'm sure everyone out there that's probably listening nose of the first one which of course his face now and one of the first into our rights to come on board my only goal Eighteen miles an hour but because you're in the dark and because of the special effects\nI it would seem to be going fifty or sixty and of course are on the same light we're looking at rock 'n' roller coaster over Hollywood studios which\nGoes zero to fifty five and a ... few times and and that one is absolutely amazing so you'll find at least one ride in every amusement park that that dark ride on a little bit easier to uh
