Redskins there are six and one in the last seven visits to the uh\nTo Washington so um you know I did this ah this was a doctor or for the Washington the Dallas Cowboys [laughter] um you know I Try to have been looking this week you know every week we're we're getting more and more data into the system\nAnd I'm Talking to a buddy of mine and we were talking about average offensive average place per game\nRight you know and and in order to win the ballgame yeah it sure helps to have the great they all have the the office on the field and we're going into a game this weekend where you got to the you know two very good defenses\nUm you know yards per per game\nA Dallas is right for their own yards per dams against at three Fifteen point to Washington's rank threw a fit that treat treat twenty six point to a game\nSo you got two very good defenses you got a couple of Jekyll and Hyde off into this weekend going at it um and when you look at the strength for Washington you know you got Alex

seven a place for gang comparative fifty five for a Minnesota\nNow Minnesota hasn't been well against the jets there um the last three visits in a I keep calling the all metal and but the last three

Bosh and Wade got together the Celtics already put together something similar to that [noise] um [noise] so yeah and then of course we all know about the patriots and go to the Superbowl falls\nOn the matchup between you know Derek ... via ... versus Andrew Luck\nYeah exactly I Want to know what captain Andrew Luck is going to say about Derek ... be William an old man\nGeneral ... like quote ... Williams through a wildcard towards us [laughter]\nYou're right a third of the men with delicious da\n... very disappointed that they did not go with soldiers who couldn't hit us with their shot guns from two feet away instead with the crafty veteran that they can just brought into the units we were looking to return those can involve fire towards us the [laughter] a Detroit\nAnd Miami did you know the lions are like a six point favored in this game on the road against the dolphins given bronchitis Wyler the kind of love and respect he deserves Ron ... come on\nFor a while and deserves are ... out of there are some respect my throat some respect throw some respect towards that giraffe oh God poor poor ...\nJust this is all all he needs was to come into the dolphins play really well and then everybody go up did you see what ... we'll see how long that last he's like I Can't buy respected mislead or the ... I don't know this is like a two I I I I just I Can't get I Can't get into this\nNow I think last week maybe maybe I'll be wrong but I think last week was just an anomaly would ... I think so as one of those things where all the other team just in game plan for him but I think he's very easy to game planning for\nThat nobody is I think so too I don't think this is the law is only the fat or anything crazy like that and the lions are one of those things we know nothing about them either I mean we do math staffer I don't know anything about that defense was that was that defense is able to maybe ... able to carve up that defense I we don't know\nI like golden Tate I like watching him I don't know why you name it great name that is a good name and is the third yeah that's right I Know that was see that on the Jersey like\nGod he's just you couldn't think of a different name but I Wonder if they're silver Tate\nThis is a uh I Know go yeah exactly exactly how or platinum tape addict Stockton is getting the call on this one in Miami and take stock has been around a long time I like to ...\nTo guide over a dozen butcher any names that all the way to ease the butcher that is very true I'm sure there's a certain a female and movies that may have that name somewhere\n[laughter] uh Houston Texans in Jacksonville both teams are three and three or ... both teams are difficult to read right now the jags were\nLost to in a row and in the two losses have given up like thirty five points on average in those two losses and the Texans have won three in a row but arguably coming off one of their worst stop fence of games\nUm instill was able to win because Nathan Peter ... who's the quarterback and the other team he was more than happy to give them interceptions provides her late touchdown pass that's right he threw a touchdown pass\nExactly of both teams are tied with Tennessee who's also not very good for the division leading the agency self somebody's getting this division folks somebody's winning this I don't know but the Texans or a villain Brian is six to all the time against the jaguars left because most of\nThe time the jak stunk so now they're supposed to believe ... pretty good limit for and that is not going to play listen I'm look uh I I this\nIs not a bad game it's not a great game it's like a three maybe a two and a half to not a great game it's but it's not terrible either it's it's ... there's some value here because somebody's winning the division is probably going to be one of these two teams\nNo no it's not worth the titans apart but come on\nI mean it really is it will be a precursor to ah what what succumb\nYeah and that's all of this game is is this see okay you know what I mean if the taxes are able to ah still\nWant to Jacksonville than than Texas have the the advantage at this point\nAnd I like watching Jay Jay y place so I you know whenever he's healthy and playing I I I think Russian and play you know let's\nSay I mean and that's something that we are fun to watch is jags off as verse sections effects because of Texans ah can\nPressure the quarterback what's like boy was going to do which bleak morals are we going to see that's a question that's been on everyone's mind each and every week in Jacksonville yeah there's like more of those will show up\nIs a seven sack some seats so I yeah and it's like a wading with his brother um yeah exactly Minnesota Vikings at the New York jets man I'm Sam Donald\n... are we done watching seemed Arnold I Am he kind of in the scene where he goes from\nNow on now is that the one game that for him and that was pretty good for those ... ...\nIt's just when the journal doesn't do anything ... one of the way back they won't last week a bottom two goals yeah exactly they couldn't get a new house the forty ... thirty Arlen\nWashing jets kicked field also what I mean to kings and that there is\nI mean for someone who is supposed to be out of this is the NFC championship for this this will be you know the the team representing the NFC and the super\nBowl they look far from it oh I Know I Know they're like anywhere close to being in the super bowl\nGet these um you know these NFL cats\nIt looked far from it oh I Know I Know they don't get anywhere close to being in the super bowl\nI get these um you know these NFL capsules like that that from you know they give you a game notes and information and so any and all these times when I get an NFC an ASC matchup they always have streaks razor little talking points for the game and in this one it says the jets and one seven of the last eight and ... against the Viking\nThis isn't a relevant or completely irrelevant that\nBecause these teams play once every four years so this is going back what Thirty years like Dole okay yeah they have the Vikings number remember when a kennel Brian beat friends parking dinner Nineteen eighty one I mean ... what is what is the Kevin out of eight meetings against the Viking the plane different conferences\nThat is that's been a relevant that I mean I guess it's a fun talking point but there's nothing there\nBut the jets are just leave the all time series against Minnesota if you want to go way back eight to ... that's the only thing I got to the game because it's like a it's a two ... maybe\nIf you like a Kirk Cousins throwing the football more than Sam Donald I don't know it's only got about a two\nTrips fans are a little excited though they're like they're like the future with Donald but that's it Tom Brennan used to be Arizona
