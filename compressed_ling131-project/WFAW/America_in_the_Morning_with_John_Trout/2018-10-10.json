timing of her resignation announcement\nNo because the resignation was tenders days ago I understand that the diving and stuff that fact but frankly I came out and it's something that they were going to know her as a nation than they did it anyways and what I Will say to that is that I Believe Nikki Haley I mean the idea that she you know someone who is a very high ranking official as friends of private planes\nI'm twenty two and I know people with private planes so I'm sure the governor of South Carolina you know a lot of people like that and then you're hired tiny get fat and free traps on

be a little bit different but as far as the governor of South Carolina eyes I\nThis is not contrast to point out whatsoever\nYeah looking at a just a her uh her future she says that a few spent
