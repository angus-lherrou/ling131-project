these bombs will talk to a doctor John Huber a clinical a forensic psychologist and chairman of mainstream mental health their name as their website main scream mental health\nDot org ... first of all it is at all clear if we're dealing with a very inept bomb maker who set out seven bombs none of which went off including in the case of the bombs sent to CNN address the John Brennan the banning of white powder that was nothing there was not a poison of any kind\nOr are we dealing with someone who set out devices that they were deliberately are hoping would not go off or just to try and promote

could answer if they chose to which they clearly have not chosen to they could tell us right off the bat whether or not this was an inept bomb maker ... who deliberately made bombs that would not go off\nA also a U appeared on my my talk show last night and you took note of how the authorities handle the Austin, Texas bomber recently\nExactly and they kept all their evidence tied to their chest
