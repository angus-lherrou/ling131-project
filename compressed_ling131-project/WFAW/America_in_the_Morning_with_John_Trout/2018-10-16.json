helped create the rise of ISIS\nThe remote to rebuild authorized China or Russia or the felt comfortable to invade its neighbors yes unfortunately it is time to remind everybody why it is that we fight than the the the stories of the heroes who have fought for this nation\nIs it always necessary to fight a war that involves a shooting in one another you you take note of for example in the book why we fight that we won the Cold War without firing a shot cannot be replicated in the twenty first century\nUh yes indeed this is talk some soup called the ultimate victory is\nA winning without
