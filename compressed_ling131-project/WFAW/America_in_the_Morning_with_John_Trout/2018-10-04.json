president's father Fred Trump transferred millions of dollars from his real estate empire to his children without paying taxes on it\nReporters examined over one hundred thousand document before concluding that Donald Trump received to today's equivalent of four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father Mr Trump always claimed that he never got more than one million dollar loan

inaccurate deep captain ... New York\nNineteen to jumbo Hanna says this new times ... port could be a taxing situation for Trump as New York state tax officials take up the matter\nTo talk about that is Alan Smith senior policy reporter for Business Insider dot com\nThe just of the New York times story I guess is that the president received a lot more help from his parents\nThan a a has been perhaps publicly acknowledge do which is of course not illegal and that he in turn may have helped them hide some of their wealth later on almost a a I guess paying them back if you will did you go into further detail about what the times says\nI Would say that's that's a pretty good summary um of course President Trump for years it said that he had got in a small billion dollar loan\nFrom his father to really start out in and get his business going and what the times reported was at least in twenty Eighteen dollars that amount was really much more like four hundred and ten million dollars at least what he had received for his father a throughout much of his life\nThis started off when he was three years old he he began making about two hundred thousand dollars a year\nA and his his father and then eventually having a sibling was set up a some of these corporations some of these sort of a sham companies\nTo help move money in between members of the family\nNow experts told the Chinese or the statute of limitations that a lot of these things are likely you know well we're we're well beyond that because it took place a long time ago so\nWhether we're going to see any legal action on it\nUp in the air seems unlikely uh the New York state tax department is looking into it they open it in ... and the leading Democrat on the Senate Finance committee is requesting that the IRS ... look into it which can be\nLike the more serious pro but the federal level [noise] um but so far it it just looks unlikely that anything on that route is going to come out and touch does paint a picture of a narrative that Trump is also a lot of being a self made billionaire and\nLook narrative is very important in politics I mean president trouble able to craft narrative that helped him become the president this was a key key aspect of it is a central to teach the self made billionaire and there are a lot of businessmen who brought\nFor political office especially the presidency were not able to win because people didn't really take them that credibly as being a self made billionaire but a lot of people who follow Trump did I mean this this does have an impact there\nIt has an impact of the little question about that although again if you've ever followed it that closely\nI mean even his initial claim that uh he only got his start with a million dollar loan from his father yeah I remember the first million dollars my father gave me and it sure helped out a lot I mean ... that's a joke obviously okay so we had a lot of help fine ah there's no question about that I mean I never\nCared much one way or the other people's self made or not and I know apparently a lot of people do but I mean that to me is is right down there at the tabloid level of of something you would see 'em a headline of the

I Would take very very seriously the law matters do any of the things that are brought forward in this time story Allen Smith strike you as a open and shut a yeah that that's the illegal\nOr do some
