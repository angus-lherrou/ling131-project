disapproving D.C.'s ban on handguns in approving a ban on machine guns and in approving longstanding regulations such as concealed carry and felon in possession laws\nHeller established at the scope

the Supreme Court despite the fact that there have been any number of such cases bubbling around out there which may be symptomatic of a larger condition that the Supreme Court and that is a reluctance to touch hot potatoes I've never understood that\nI understand why Congress doesn't like to even though it's their constitutional duty to do so but they're afraid of of reelection if they vote on some controversial issue that's a chicken but a understandable with the Supreme Court they're there for life\nWhy should they shy away from such issues\nI think a a a historically as we saw with the retiring Justice John Paul Stevens [noise] ah there are some liberal justices who have been on the court who really didn't want to take on the second amendment rumor Sanford limits and wrote that great piece or some years ago called the embarrassing Second Amendment\nOr you know there's there's a lot to that sentiment a it's an embarrassment to a lot of these liberal\nThe jurors\nWho
