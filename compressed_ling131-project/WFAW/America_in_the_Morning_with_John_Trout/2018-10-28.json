S. dot com but you can also see Iran and Iran do Raymond report every day by going to YouTube is that correct\nThat's right so what I Do every day Fred is I have a a YouTube channel and people can find that just by a typing in ATF back three picks and uh we do a little podcast everyday on we'll get a forecast on whatever\nSport to go on that they do this morning I did the NBA forecast and NHL and and what we do is give our um earned a a A R predicts and gone to the games and what the computer picks out and cover or you know what they like and the thing I've noticed with our um atheist forecast\nThey've done very well with total you know when when you consider you're dealing with um [noise] you know or the ... for the side it's more geared toward the favorites but I found in the last couple of years that the uh the totals or the ... you want to go and if you're going away drawn these game\nOh if you're talking about the toll certainly have jumped last time I checked it was three point nine points higher this year than last a day you know again or a forty five to ten when for Kansas City on Sunday night\nOr the total was fifty six and a half they stop asking about eight minutes to go because they didn't want to embarrass um\nThe opposition at that point and that's what you know you just you don't try to do that in the national football league for the people that have the over fifty six and a half would have won didn't win because nobody can stop the ...\nI Know Kansas City I'm ... something special to here they they got hunt going um they'll Kyrie kill the defense is playing somewhat yeah you know good a good a defense\nYou know there's still there's still a when I look at the Kansas City a bad thing you're the game they rank thirty first and the league um I'm a defense so they still got to work to do on the back and other defense because if you get a Tom Brady or um\nDirty first in the league I'm On the past defense so they still got some work to do on the back of their defense because if you get a Tom Brady\nOr um you know you and you know you do it as crazy as this might sound Tampa Bay they got the number one a passing off ants in the league and that would be an interesting match up you know obviously Kansas City would probably be a\nSelling point favorite ... you know it would see if that would expose their their secondary but they're very strong in\nThe other facets of of the game for sure\n[noise] talking to Iran and Raymond at the Rand report in the world series of handicap speaking also go to the world series handicapping and uh she didn't go seven or seven no question will vote what was in first place there\n[noise] so uh yeah that's right where are we sending all read is still leading this guy he's\nWritten a member of for the last couple of years and he's a he's consistent I'm obviously the record at twenty five twenty three and one doesn't mean anything because in this process read it's all about the units right you got to ... you know if you if you and your top rated place then you get seven units and the way we can contest as we rank are selections\nSeven units to one unit ... total\nAnd I'll read right now he's at forty eight point one zero unit so that means if you wager say um ten dollars on each of his pitch she'd be a forty dollars this year\n[noise] alright well watch happening this week in the national football league but I must talk about because what we we have a lot of listeners who are I don't know why or New York giants fans what's going on why did germ or go for two and what's their chances against Washington\nBlah you know according to his math [laughter] if you figure that if they would have converted that to point conversion and all they needed was a a touchdown and that you know and even the the converted touchdowns right now in the NFL or not give me a break [laughter]\nNo I mean these are things that he thought that if you can get that to point diversion get attacked down and take the extra points ever did win that game but hey you got to give credit to the kicker\nFor um uh I forget the two they're playing a lotta kicking ad that long feel oh fifty seven year either or fifty six yard um you know everybody's talking about the the game but that kick her for 'em and he was a just brought into a couple of weeks ago for a lot of ... he did a good job\nThen you put pressure on on the giants chicken that a fellow at the end which uh you know I Know but I Know one thing people are happy about is that they got the backdoor cover for the giants um because you know whether you like scoring a\nYou know like like the on Sanders says right do you believe in ... well I Believe that I'm On Monday Night because you've got to the doctor covers [laughter] hey if you can do that all every week I'll take it\nAll right but they make the deal they do they deal apple away fine cornerback they're about to deal Jenkins is the last thing that I heard so the point is what's sad is that James some of the players do not like he likes some do like a U I of course ... always speaking up what happens is weak\nThough the the way I see all these changes happening is you got some selfish players in that room who have playing for the name on the back and not the name on the front and really when you see you know they're changing you know the trading guys mid season you don't see that much in the NFL\nIn ... the email back in the you know a couple of years ago ten years ago you would never see a trade in the in the NFL mid season this don't do that\nYou know now that it seems like the the theme is happy room happy team right and uh by trade and he like apple was Ely a problem in in the room was the the L leading on discussion as the other players they have got to make a change in leading the rat 'em but you know what the giants got their hands full this weekend there facing the Washington Redskins\nThere at one point under this weekend and I look back and said you know how is the giants going to win this game this weekend and the only way I can see the giants win because of that group of players\nYou know the the last thing you want to see is old out back and losing it on on his teammates and coach in the first half the game but if you want to keep a guy like go to Ellen track\nAt an early lead in a lot because the guys that go with the guys that controlling your brown these guys caught the ball and they want to win and then you want to keep these guys happy to have a winning environment habit winning the attitudes and then when I look at the ... you know the giants are one in six on the season and they're all the when um this year\nI looked at it that um I forget who was the thing was that used them that they'd be and I looked at halftime scores of all their games\nThey were losing every game at half time except for the youth in game so if the giants can get a league before half time they got a really good chance of covering the spread this weekend and the atheist forecasts his armed and [laughter] it's a big\nBut I don't really remember I thought for sure it would be loud and clear would be the beat LA chant\nYes exactly that the Celtic fans you know I mean would do on the radio when they play against the Lakers well do you know where that there'll be the LA chair that actually came from no do they have and I will tell you I Will I Would

W ... currently it's forty three\nThis this has been Asia's am another kind of daytime radio program\nHas beat Asian radio and on the radio on the line from the O'Reilly auto parts studios ... better ... better prices everyday\nAlongside run over here's Tony de\nWatches\nOf the game is somewhere around the house\nWe just got back from coming out going out to eat and I come back and I'm watching the game and I'm On my computer\nAnd I'm just I'm basically doing with normal people do which is just kind of have the game on in the background and then it hits me as the game is going in the first quarter and I'm kind of halfway paying attention to it it hits me then she'll bark is calling the game\nShow is calling the game and I thought to myself wait a minute didn't you hear him yesterday at Fenway Park with the red Sox and we're like not\nHear him again on friday night when he goes to gain three of the world series no oh no oh what kind of monsters\nAt the Fox sports studios told him oh yeah when you're done with that World Series get your butt down either Houston to call a Thursday night game against the dolphins and do you sleep\nWell they got some we got some ... to do when you get down here they looked at as he says on your way right yeah right on your way to LA stop in Houston and call a football game\nWait a minute don't you have other broadcasters on the steps that could just do that for me while I I don't know cover the world series no no no no no you get down here and you cover his his game for us you call the Texans game we need you right now he's like oh I guess okay\nGet on the private plane go down to Houston bang out the game fly to LA no he's off his right\nThere on board the game as lay the fourth quarter of the game it's been decided so just you know Joe Android just you know woody banter going back and forth and at one point I really felt like I'm watching this and felt like Troy is angling for Joe to get them into the world series [laughter]\nOh yeah [laughter] like can I joined the Joe Joe mentioned something like you want to go you know or do you want to go to the world series or something like that enjoys like well you know I you know I spent a lot of time in LA I was a judgment I was there Thirty years ago in Nineteen eighty eight and ... you know we\n... I think they beat Peyton Manning's last game with the Broncos they played against Kansas City that was that was when broadcasts while they took over there so I Want to go back and say that although the Libby Brock yeah they yeah they'd be broadband infant any young man he didn't finish so that was that was the start of the wrong guy that was ... way way too over word\nSo I'm I'm very rarely intrigued by this game because you know I mean first of all is the chief says you're not gonna you're not going to be disappointed watching the chiefs no there although this is the first time playing in daylight and how long oh I Know\nThat's what I noticed that as I was thinking I was like is this a sudden they gave us a four o'clock you know it's noon ... eleven o'clock kick all of that that could hurt him to the city no no sorry new there in um are there in uh central time\nBut what really intrigued me about this game I Want to know how the Broncos bounce back from the cocaine party I Do\nToo I knew to von Miller is making a very big public stand that no no no that was a safe fun legal party\nJust got Chad Kelly fire don't yeah I mean it's it's not that close to the love boat but you know you've got some good storylines out of it you know I ran the jihad kill his story had dinner last night with my family I rented it might even my wife said\nIs that enough to fire a guy in the NFL I said no it isn't\nThere's more to that story but no it isn't walking in somebody's house sitting on the couch in a non threatening way yes it's going to get you arrested yes it's going to get you in trouble with the law yes you're going to pay a fine probation whatever you know it's probably up there they don't give you a felony I don't know what it is\nBut it should have been enough to to to to uh get him fired that's ... that's fixable and even she agreed so I\nI think there's way more to that story than meets the eye opening thing it was like a you think it was like a combination of stuff it's got to be a combination of things\nBut uses for them as hot as the last straw that we can't go down this road maybe\nIt was a good teammate and you know in its own valley like we didn't know that maybe for the team didn't like him and he didn't he didn't and beer and sell to people and this was when this happens like good now we have a reason to you know who sleuth let's Megan Kelly him and get rid of him\nHey are they related yeah find a reason to fire him 'cause we never liked him in the first one egg and Kelly Chad Kelly\nConspiracy Washington against the giants you know if you're\nIf you really really need something to do like every shore in your house is done and this is\nThe only game on and you don't want to paint the house or kill spiders with a blow torch watch Washington and the and the giants\nOr if you live and breathe breathe H. T. T. R. that's right and I just want to see out of the giants bad bounce back by pulling a raiders\nI think I'm going to give this game of three to see a giant if the giants train players to Washington in the middle of the game I think they should write like just move or outside and they go up and down they go to Nate shoulder [noise]\nGo over there and shoot up [noise] let's see uh let's go down the list and you you are over there you ain't playing today you're going off to Charlotte a you're staying unfortunately and I\nJust I Want to see if the giants to make those kind of moves if the government is like well I'm not done drinking\nOr here we had oh and we have a giants play or a free are forgetting the bills player's name you know just all retired at halftime\nOh that's right [laughter] forgot about him too right yeah\nIt was a giant ... come in and one guy just like I you know I quit yeah force I'm going to force the trend right now\nCleveland and Pittsburgh oh is this not a five this is a five they gave us high in week one which is better than a tie\nWe need to five more quarter that's all we're asking for Cleveland Pittsburgh five or a quarter who\nJoined us play another five quarter game\nI think the browsers get ... I think the browns could win this game and it's sacrilegious for me to say is a Steelers fan I think the problems could win this game yeah they're they're they're generally hammering the browser do right outside of the ... we ... we keep bringing this up people 'cause we're going to remind you of it because\nListen I I Love Alex gold and he's probably right when he says that you got to be high if you think they're going to win a game than we are but we are we are because\nThe ... the ... outside of the chargers game this prose team has played six games which were ... so amazingly close it's ridiculous OK\nThey were there were a kicker away from meeting the Steelers there were a kicker away from beating the state's let me repeat that they were a kicker away\nFrom feeding the tapes at the beginning at the beginning of the season they were a bum blown stupidity tall might official beating the raiders they got blown out by the chargers and they were kick away from being the buccaneers\nSo yes they absolutely could have they could have had eight wins on the season is you think\n... there's got to be a problem with the camera where God if it's you know the over under of going into overtime please because you'd almost have to be I mean in Vegas is draw a line that has to be a big number\nThere are a bit going into overtime please because you'd almost have to be made a big draw a line that has to be a big number because most people coming over time I ... I think the browns when the straight up I think they're good I think they could\nYou watch a blow it out and we'll be embarrassed to get a get a ride but I'm riding the train all the way to the end of the season folks just bear with me or one more hour twelve o'clock game and then when we come back we'll do the rest of the NFL a schedule Baltimore Carolina uh this\nIs good this is a good this is like a four ravens got a good defense I mean that we'll check to see if they still got the number one scoring defense yes they are giving of fourteen points a game Caroline is if the Carolinas tricky but they're still pretty good football team in foreign to this is again I'm going to support\nYeah so what we're saying America's a you know the schedule when you're going down and looking at the schedule it may look soft\nBut it but if it was a strong yeah you know the beginning part of the you know the ... there there's a couple of games don't even bother\nThere are some Dutch and if you're watching if you're watching Sunday or NFL Sunday on red zone you'll know that the games that they're going to be showing the most because they're the ones they're not going to see it all oh I agree completely absolutely\nNo my goodness sorry when we come back we'll do the uh what they call the four o'clock games depending on where you live and the Sunday night game and then the Monday Night showdown classic between the patriots and the bill that's all coming up next on his ...\nHis ... ... just a God or where he's kinda getting these kinda getting low board rule restless and he just looking for that next big\nPayday the way that you're putting it out there it kind of makes sense is way when you listen to Floyd right now it sounds like it's common as he ate confident that it's happening right now I don't know details don't know what's sad day but have you with us from the floor and it sounds like it's happening when I listen to ... it all makes sense\nOf hey net payday [noise] ah yeah\nI haven't sending things ... and throw it against the wall and we'll stick are you all interested as fans and seeing this oh there is holding all entertaining further and ... and then you you might throw this against the wall and it just slides right down like a ban the painting [laughter] you know what\nI was you saw social media trash\nTalk tune into the sports right now we have from three to five Easter and not only on tests mediation radio\nBusiness or it's more than ... than Dallas hopping point where they stand in Tony I'm Glad you're not that hard to get the coupons and local favorite\nBath restaurant fires in housing cloud seeding confounding said he has to offer that has it all over the map dot com ... team personally reviews and then they\nTry to make sure he's going to the Syrian you're coming back\nFrequent you Matt Damon calling from Avon dot com [noise]\nThis is pushing the God\nHe will eat right that was the Mickey Mouse cartoon with him\nBecause that's the first thing that I'm thinking [noise] so I\nDon't want to hang onto her Iraq I'm Talking I'm mad they hired\nFor\nWhat level it's getting stuck in life are the children or whatever size ...

about the world series and then Ron goes hey I just send you a video check it out sky and that is here\nAnd I'm like okay why would I click on this to change my mood for the weekend and I'm watching this robot jumping on blocks and doing back flips as if it's a human dressed in a robot costume why did you do that to me now I'm petrified\nYeah I well 'cause I Need to make you where it's coming it's coming sky is alive why would somebody invent this ah what's the purpose was I was on the total global domination\nUnless they're building an army of this to take over and mosques they don't\nBuild one never knows what oh no no no no they build and one and then as soon\nAs this robot starting to realize as I can think for myself Oh yes he'll start training all his robot buddies\n[noise] do you remember the two AI computer is a ... that created their own language as quickly as possible to talk to each other and everyone's like\nPull the plug oh my God no I don't know when he got out and make it look\nThat up there too they had to AI machines to different machines tried to communicate with each other and they couldn't so they just did what normal people would do I guess just create your own language immediately and they both understood [noise]\nNow it's coming it's coming a deal on last because like the smartest guy on the planet he's a little quirky but he's like super smart he's petrified of AI if he's petrified of AI I shouldn't be mortified\nBy it and you kidding me up at night he's our John Connor right now yeah\nAnd it leaves the lawn must could build himself a spaceship and get out of the apocalypse robot apocalypse now I Can't do that I had to be calm down there you know they have to either become their little ah there was a slave\nPopulation robots take anything is going to do you think one of the apocalypse happens you can just takes off for the moon since ... sits on a beach chair and watches yeah I mean he just goes I told people eating popcorn and you don't yeah told you\nTold you this is going to happen\nIn all seriousness so this is one of the reasons Eli must Who's Afraid of a a and he made this he made this um example\nHe said look the problem with the eye and I'm paraphrasing here I didn't I'm not I don't have the exact quote somebody just paraphrasing kind of the way he put away he put it\nThe problem with a guy is it doesn't have any\nMoral ... there's no morals attached to its decision making\nSo let's say you you tell a lie you know I'm really getting sick and tired of getting spam email I Need you to stop I Want to I Want you stop spam email\nSo the the way I Will say OK what can we do to stop spam email or we can do this and we can do this and I can I can flag this eventually we'll get to the point\nAnd this is where the line Moscow scared he said the bench surely would get to the point that it would kill the people who sent you the spam email like he doesn't have any moral there's no moral equation border then as soon as I said earlier right so instead of creating like an algorithm\nLike he doesn't have any moral there's no moral equation knowing that as soon as I write so instead of creating like an algorithm that didn't work or or who is still a problem it would just go down the list of all the possible ways\nYou could not get spam email and the and the bottom answer is we'll just eliminate the people that are sending you the spam email and you won't get this but it doesn't process that that would be a horrible thing to do it just wouldn't do it it would just say well let's just do that\nAnd that's and that's that's that's the terrifying thing that's the really terrifying thing and that's how I was making a start yeah but think\nAbout how you could get rid of political opposition with AI you could you could get their computers flooded with all sorts of illegal stuff you could send the computer um all sorts of top secret documents or made different kind of illegal pornography or whatever I could that could that could you can go to war a political opponent easing\nI got this is scary stuff we're always on what you're saying Tony is that you can use theoretically social media to for the call on if you think you're right yeah I mean\nWhat crazy talk is now this is nuts but this this video you sent me of the robot I my first reaction to it was that it was was that a human dressed up in a robot costume and you said no that's an\nHere's the thing if they made it like a cute little tiny robot I'm fine you know what I mean I can you afford if if that was the combat those were the type of robots such has sided and take over the planet you know we just\nStep on them which is drop kick him you know we all put our becka one bar helmet\nThen you know feel go these guys all over the place but this thing looks like it's at least six feet\nTall yeah no maybe live five bass and you know what those type of robots that's what takes over the world and here's the deal it looks indestructible you just give them a gun were done we're not we're not going to say do you have an election or anything like that in your house I do yeah\nI actually we have both where we then they have at home and they haven't really met you know we have a we have a Syria home home salary a home Siri and we have ah the echo and they they haven't met yet\nOkay they'll let them eat because then it's going to take over probably yeah don't let that I haven't had the\nYou know all the random ah the random talk from Alexa\nWord yeah a lot of the middle of the night I haven't had that happen to\nKnow not yet but I had like election would come on at certain times um where I freaked out like I ... I just randomly would just come on and I'm like I don't remember asking you thing that I was so that was too afraid\nThat I haven't found that with our theory home thing and that and it ... it's not that old we were just sitting there in the kitchen one day and all of a sudden this that decided then to play a song and whoa wait wait and say hello to Syria you have to go I have a theory", "show_name": "America in the Morning with John Trout", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "28"}
