he was he was questionable during the week and now they probably should listen to him as doubtful and that's another issue with the NFL injury report and as we see gambling 'cause you need more

brought costs Wyler despite all started looking good to that we've seen enough now I don't believe in tannahill either but no than it will be back as far as your question about should the dolphins back on the court I yeah I mean I I don't think they know the answer\nI don't know where they can be on the draft drew lock it some of the quarterback Adam Missouri I didn't think we'd be talking about Missouri Tigers by the way I'm a KU grad so I Can't stand Missouri so I think through luck drew lock sucks um but that's just me being a biased Kansas Day off\nI have no idea where the dolphins are going to go on the job now you said you have your duty\nSimulators whatever that's then keep doing them in keep doing my draft I the dolphins or foreign to write\nShouldn't be talking draft if you're a a a dolphin fans should be thinking about wildcard spot in a play out the dolphins today show that they uh they they easily could have gone down to Chicago and lost three in Rome showed a lot of fights out when it's a big time victory morale booster and confidence boost or for that football team\nOr so I think if you're a dolphins fan you shouldn't be safe worried about what you're going to do in the draft you should definitely be looking ahead\nAnd see what you possibly do the rest of the season and find a way to make the post season\n[noise] alright Shay earlier today\nAFC North showdown Steelers and bangles there was a Steelers like twenty eight Twenty one victory they were marching down the field without ten seconds to go say they're going to set up and get a game winning feel go anyway\nChris Boswell instead quick pass Antonio brownie takes him to the house and\nVirtually walk off with all when there was about ten seconds or so to go game winning touchdown from droplets burger to Antonio Brown\nAnd the game that I I felt it was one or two things we were going to learn\nThe bangles could have gone to five and along with a victory and they would have sent a message to the rest of the division and certainly the Steelers team that has own them now still does own them oh it's six straight wins now for the Bangor ... for the Steelers over the bangles six straight losses for the bangles just to Pittsburgh and\nSince he could have sent a message that he knows his our division now we're in control you could have had the Steelers stuck it to three and one\nInstead the other side if you're Pittsburgh going in this game or say no no no no we're going to send a message that we are right in the thick of things still here in the AFC North we still control this division we still own you if word if you're Cincinnati and the Steelers did just that the Steelers are three and two and you look at that division right now\nThe bangles or their foreign to put the ravens are three into their playing again right now they could get the foreign to with a victory the Steelers are three too long the browns or two or three and one\nAs soon as we're right back in the mix in division ... in fact I don't know what the odds are Shea I still and I really like the bangles because they're putting up a lot more points than we've seen under any dolphin before but I Would still used today\nYou know gone to the head you got to pick somebody I still taking the Steelers to come back and when the division history tells us and today was a big head to head we saw what happened the bangles you can't win a division and so you can beat the Steelers and you haven't done it\nYet but it's a mental block for them I mean go I mean whether it's in the regular season where you know you think they're about to go where the ... and then they just dropped into the Steelers or that is famous twenty Fifteen playoff game\nIt's just and then it until they prove they can beat the Steelers and the Steelers are vulnerable that's the thing is you know there's all your debate that say they've already taken a step back but\nIn the end when you have that passes that that often in the past and can touches your chances every game even if you're not playing your best and\nYeah the bagels really this is at home it was set up for them and you know when Nixon scored a touchdown you know you thought you know could this be it but they went right down the field and uh\nIt wasn't like any dolphins played that either may know he suitable forty two times okay two hundred twenty\nNine yards and two touchdowns but he didn't have an interception so it was a fairly mistake free game for the most part but you're you're talking about being down at half time and and and the way the game was kind of go as a really good football game it typical AFC North battle but I I was a little surprised Joe ... you're right they couldn't get him going I think\nAn underrated thing as good as makes it is he had a loving caring sixty four yours not having Bernard was really big for for the bangles today is they like to go with one two punch Bernard's a third down back it gives them a great option out of the backfield\nAnd I really do think that that was part of their issue today it's not the reason why they lost but that's an underrated thing to look at when it comes to the bangles in in why offensively maybe they couldn't get things going again 'cause this is not the same Steelers defense that's been proven right at the office I still think is legit\nBut that defense is not ever going to be what it was this year there's nothing that's going to happen this year that's going to turn the Steelers and to the same type of fearful the ... it's been years quite frankly just the Steelers defense was totally daunting right and certainly this year with some of the the injuries and you know not having Ryan cheesier and in in the tragic situation there\nFrom a year or so ago and actually today I Believe was a year anniversary of of of that a terrible injury that he suffered\nBut I think not having Bernard was a big blow for the bangles today on the other side you look at the Steelers offensively so big been three hundred sixty nine yards a touchdown he threw the ball forty six times but James Connor\nAnd we know that the sewers they go on a ... I Believe it is next week ... shows up guess who shows up next week levy on bell supposedly will show up next week and he could have shown up\nSaturday by the way and not play them still got a hundred thousand dollar check I don't know why you didn't do that\nYou know he's costs himself five million is one thing that game five million I Know you want to\nA week and he could have shown up Saturday by the way not play them still got eight hundred thousand dollar check I don't know why you didn't do that you know he's costs himself five million is one thing that game five million I Know you want to send a message but at some point the money doesn't it get up there enough where you're like All right I Want to send a message but we're not just talking a million dollars five million dollars he is cost himself by not showing up\nIt's race you want a big deal you're almost giving up half of the deal that you you were gonna sign for on the French fries [laughter] like that's crazy yeah crazy man but James Caan it was great\nToday Nineteen carries a hundred and eleven yards two touchdowns and I know big band had comments earlier this week or this past week and say you know when bill comes back he thinks Congress should be part of the mix absolutely think how dangerous they could be I don't know how they're going to divvy everything up\nBut you have ...

I just don't like doing ... well yeah no\nAnd that that she will score but I also think Tom Brady coming out no problems going on and she said oh I'd say the ... the only difference is and will break this game down more the only difference is the chiefs the last two weeks of show they can actually get some pressure on the court like water deepest mistake and I expect the patriots to run it down their throat\nThat she's actually can get some pressure on the quarterback so what we'll preview Saturday Night football in just a little bit up next we'll we'll go back to one o'clock window and also I Want to ask a question about one head coach right now\nIn Denver as the rams are up Thirteen to surround the Broncos blue birds have been out I don't know if it's just for ... also for their head coach Vance Joseph ... almost got fired last year so I asked that question\nDoes Vance Joseph ... make it till the end of the season is a valid question here say he's on a game with a ramp seen that many you think are going to the super bowl yes but when you know your old line is as bad as it is you gotta start switching\nRight that\nDid not in good for him in Tampa he fortunately got out why could and ends up in the broadcast booth and\nI don't know if it starts at the game has passed him and I don't know if I'll go that far certainly he's tried to implement things just in terms of culture that they probably don't fit here with guys in twenty Eighteen but also what he's done the raw they'd given them full control the ... there's nobody to blame by him but McKenzie still the G in there but we all know what's going on there\nJohn grows running that franchise and he's running it even more into the ground and what it was and it's embarrassing absolutely embarrassing and then you see the reports out this morning\nWith the raiders that they might start blowing it all up in terms of I'm Ari Cooper there's a report that they could trade I'm Ari Cooper who\nHad a nasty hit today by the way I don't know what his injuries that he got nailed that should've been a helmet to helmet call I don't believe the fly with even thrown for it\nBut Fox Sports Jay Glazer reporting that the team may actually finally throw in the towel and this year realize who they are one in five and that they're actively shopping according to Jake laser\nThere twenty Fifteen Percent pick MRI Cooper and they're twenty sixteen first round pick called Josef or Cooper's been two years I Wonder what you would get for them but that's the definition of a fire sale you already tried to put them back\nAnd now you're considering trading mark Cooper in and\nCarl just now at this point I don't know I don't know if I totally disagree with those but just speaks to like they're trying to pull this whole thing how are they gonna pull any product on the field by the time they get to Las Vegas\nI don't know and the crazy thing is like\nWe talked about their cards were sixteen my member how excited every one was about the raiders back in the thousands extend that was like oh they're coming you know the raiders of finally got out this decade long slow yeah it was just being horrendously brown and poorly managed to have real talent now\nThey make that run to the last probably would have won not division ... maybe I mean it was a different talk they were the second season to their car got hurt by the patriots\nAnd then everything just\nThat's just falling apart so quickly and like less than two years and now you're talking about a fire sale again it's gotta be tough to be ready to stay right now just after all that excitement from that season and now it's looking like you're ... you're going through another rebuild and your team was relocating it's just not good\nThoughts number next year they're probably not going to there's a good chance they don't even play in Oakland there's a chance that they have to go play at San Boyd stadium the holiday to you and I'll stay on the streets like twenty five dollars yeah in the dumps too there's a good chance that they might get kicked out of Oakland and and they may have to go to Vegas a year early\nIn the ... report suggesting that um play at some of the raiders French or this is this is\nAgain I I'll be honest I'm not I would be like I said great joy in it I take great joy in it big rival any fc west but my chiefs I take

I mean the twenty twelve chiefs were just so yeah yeah anything could happen to that point is that what needs to Peter meant just cut the guy move on I mean the Texans here's the thing they won three games\nShould have lost the Colts game you could argue they should uh last today's game even the cowboys certainly like three wins or when is when you you will certainly take them but the way you look at how they've gone to Don and still ... there's no reason why my opinion though on the Texans despite winning three in a row\nIn less your take is that I did a vision so bad you feel better about it other than that I still watch the sections today she and I might start to good football team\nYeah they they they probably the worst ... to ... I mean who who else is three and three I Try to think talk talk my head I think there\nAre so right now the titans are getting blown out they're gonna fall a three and three they're getting crowds are often just pathetic today against the ravens and they all year they haven't been able to establish Derek Henry and and in the backfield it's been there are deep and so it's got um three and two they're gonna lose that either in a row three and three the jags are going to lose they're going to go to three and three so you're going to have the titans jags and Texans\nAll a three and three who's the best side of the three\nHonestly I still think that Jack ... gets right I don't know what's going on\nWe're looking at another AFC software the night somebody's going to be nine when maybe when the way the labels is playing they might actually not be at them I thought they would at least one ten ... still get ten days even after last week's performance against the troops\nYeah their defense is just not quite as well these last couple of games and they just got dashing again Dallas is now going up thirty seven to several does he touched down the road and they got gas last week I just\nThey're not the dominant needed a bit and look maybe it's just a two week thing they do to get healthy and then you get in on that back but it it got me look at near disappointed to me now\nOh certainly yeah I mean this was a team that and I and you would you the top two or three teams the AFC heading of the season you would have said\nThe jags would have been right there and they're not they're not even a top three team in the ... right now they're not the Bengals are better than it there's no other way you can point is pretty simple dry angles around when we got ours are better as well as there are ways down the list the jags have all\nKinds of issues defensively all of a sudden they can't get pressure on the quarterback and so yeah things things should be a little concerning in Jacksonville with what you're saying by the way another touchdown just now for the cowboys thirty\nSeven ... seven\nOn top of the ... I mean it's just an asshole thing at this point that the latest leak Eliot Fifteen your rushing touchdown he's got\nNinety One yards on Nineteen carries in a touchdown jak Prescott eighty one yards on the ground and a touchdown also two touchdowns through the air both to coal Beasley so it's been a certainly a completely different office of performance and what do you know it comes against the jags that's why football's grades so unpredictable you would have told me this off into the cowboys they would finally figured out a little bit\nAnd it would happen to get to the jags defense I would've said you're crazy but\nBalls grades so unpredictable you would have told me this off into the cowboys they would finally figured out a little bit\nAnd it would happen against the jags defense I would've said you're crazy but the past Russia has been an issue the last two weeks for the jacks have not been able to get pressure on the quarterback it changes everything and I agree with you offensively not having for net I saw the stat popped up during the NFL broadcast right now and they were mentioning just how often they run the football\nCompared with ... and the game and when he's not and it was a big contrast as you would expect\nIt was something along the lines and I and I'm estimating here 'cause I don't have the exact number of front of me but it was fifty one or fifty two percent of the time\nRushing percentage with for that and it drops down like thirty eight or thirty something like that when he's not it goes from the most rush percentage attempts in the NFL to now they're like twenty eighth which what means what it means that they are forced to pass the football more\nAnd that's not a good thing when played portals is your quarterback and it's it's pretty simple in that regard he's only ... times but they've they've just been out played and\nOwn coaching as well it's not just for net it has been an impressive victory on the way for the Dallas Cowboys and the right in the thick of things in that division\nI I also wanted to take a look though in updates you on the other two games hear Broncos still trailing by ten somehow they're still in this football game rams\nTwenty Broncos ten ten fourteen to go there\nAlso the ravens still all over the ... Twenty one nothing they might shut out the types of the times and not be able to move the football Alex Collins with another rushing touched down in the third quarter and he has two on the day he's been terrific they're actually feeding him the football match and good things happen when you do that sixteen carries\nForty three yards to touch down so not a high average by any means just want to point seven yards per carry\nFor Alex Collins but he's had a couple of big time runs it found himself in the end zone and so\nEach week on on the show shall we do it all during the week up on\nThe gold standard you're on the network top five bottom five in the NFL\nRight now based on what you've seen even just in the AFC who are we say the jags aren't adopting who are your top five the way things are going and we have to a big deciding factor for some will be patriots chiefs tonight Senate football which next hour we'll talk a little bit more about what you think top five in the FCC and the AFC\nTo me no question right now entering tonight that she has to be the top AFC team not just because of the record but just in general what we've seen number two the bangles right has\nTo be the bangles it any more they lost and I know but I still think it has to be the bangles I Know they lost the Steelers today who else is going to be\nSomebody the patriots or they number two if they beat that she said I don't give me that if they beat the chiefs and I'll give you that\nYeah honestly there's an argument to be made for the chargers the chargers it looked really they lost tens of what number two\nThey lost the games and the league I mean they lost to the rams was this was the rams oh jeez everyone says into the cheese yeah they went into Cleveland and destroyed it pretty ... pretty much ... minutes yeah and they were good say took care of business", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "14"}
