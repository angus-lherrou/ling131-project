Jackson\n\nOn Tom ... here is uh some of the transcript of of that conversation er visits coming from pat Riley\nThere's been a couple of different incarnations of this deal the first one he didn't want to take back Georgia game\nThen the next incarnation was okay forget all she was straight up just for Jimmy on your end they finally relented unjust Richardson they were giving them Josh Richardson then Dionne waiters was going to be the cap filler and then a protected first round pick medical works change which is generally like you know when when you get the medical ... that's like this is basically\nA done deal and then uh it was called back and wanted more picks pat Riley\nI was told and this is a except from the uh the report from a horse to Donald VSBN said pat Riley literally I was told called him\nUp someone who sleeps with mothers and hung up the phone he dropped the Sami al on them family else back\nCalled among both do\nThey spent weeks working on that deal and then at the very last second page try to be a fan of the pocket for more and Riley told them where we could go\nAnd you remember that was so when you know what was it a Tuesday when the reports came out about the how they re engage the rockets\nAnd I said you know if they if they can get around the PGA Tucker issue I think a deal with the rockets could make sense because how badly did they burned the bridge with Miami if they decided to scrap that altogether and go back to the rockets\nNow we're finding out how badly they burned the bridge that Riley dropped the family yell special on Tom ...\nDo you think they're completely burned a bridge though because it wasn't their dinner we'll just say that we're trying to re engage Miami\n... we haven't received an update from that so maybe they had to re engage in a day to go so well\nIt may be you know if if the re engagement came from the widow or came from late and\nThey might have re engaged for pat rallies middle finger [laughter] you know there are certain people in the world but it's not a good idea to take off\nOne of them is pat Riley\nI bet Riley is still considered basketball like God yeah royalty\n\nIf if you take off pat Riley he might justice will tell you to go to hell you don't ... understand acquiring butler is not going to make them\nOne seed his you know what will will\nYou to go to hell you know Riley's understand acquiring butler is not going to make them the number one seed\nHis you know what will will will chase hammer will chase somebody else a but but I'm not going to deal with that kind of Mickey Mouse stuff where you know we got a deal and that the last second you want to renegotiate\nSo unless Glenn Taylor is going to personally pick up the phone to pat Riley I don't know that while he was going to do because he's probably super best\nWhich means that right now the rockets might well be the leader in the clubhouse and if they can somehow get Jimmy Butler without giving up PJ Tucker it is on between the rockets and the job it is\nOn\nThe rockets were Chris Paul hand me away from being world champions last year\nYeah they added buggy causes we got to see how ... going to come back from injury you know it ... it was a major injury and how well he mixes in there you know Jimmy Butler and Chris Paul those two guys a lot of that same mindset we ... we were here today we work today where here today we work today\n\nI think butler is actually kind of move that they can keep PJ that's the kind of move that could actually put the rockets over the top\nOr just straight\nFrom Wisconsin radio networks for his titles down right\nNow what's the latest from land but here's the other guy [noise]\nSecond year ...

I suspect they'll take ... that's the one area where they might hammer him a little bit in terms of the a financial penalty they they tend to go a little heavy on that in terms of suspension though they\nRarely ever do anything of any kind of know at least to the stars I'm so that he will get you know the obviously the majority of his money back\nOr whatever they want to take a couple of hundred grand ... they might take from um I think maybe a quarter mil they might take 'em but uh after that they'll they'll give it back to them so no they're not going to hold his first forever that would be extremely unusual\nNow Habib as you know kind of gone on the offensive here with us see it's almost like he's pointing it damaged blaming them for you know Nevada holding up this perverse\nAnd threatening that if if you if she gets rid of one of the guys on his teams of our to the Gulf that he went up and quit the organization now to the guy was supposed to fight on ... and now that fighting scrapped\nAnd I know Habib likes to say hey this all goes back to Connor throwing you know throwing Dolly the bus endangering people but\nDoes it actually go back to a beep and his team trying to corner low Bob in a hotel room isolating him and going after him and his his it kind of go back to that does it go back further\nYou know it's a really interesting question what does this all stems from technically you're right this really got started with\nOur to him being cornered in a hotel but then you have to ask yourself well why would be do that well it'd be did that because in an interview remember are too low ball the reside in Ireland\nAnd it's kind of ... best friend but his native Lee Russian speaks with a Russian accents and offices fluent in Russian and did an interview in Russian media where he said some pretty unkind things about it'd be that was what the confrontation was about so again every one is praising or at least some people have mixed feelings about Habib\nJumping out of the cage to defend his religion and country and families on her\nBut that sort of what he was doing to a degree anyway when he confronted or to him\nFor making comments about him being cowardly and things like that again ... for those guys it's not it's not a game there there there are playing with you so you say something like that those are quite literally fighting words\nIs that a proper way to go through life I Would argue with not especially want to be a professional athlete but again we're talking about these different classes of culture here and how everyone navigates that space\nNow that that fight between ... and ... that can shut down and find them in camps like to me I almost want to see that bite more now\nGod you know that's what ... to it are too low of off the Twitter and he said oh let's put that fight back on\nMan I don't know how you do that without a major major major security presence because you've got to remember it's not justified itself\nOr backstage or on the night of the event those guys have to check into a fight we go on Tuesday and then on Wednesday they have press events on Thursday they have more friends over the friday they have their way in which means you're going to have to have a heavy security for all of that and they're not going to be fighting on a major car\nEarth Day they have more presidents Fridays they have their way in which means you're gonna have to have a heavy security for all of that and they're not going to be fighting on a major car they're going to be fighting on a smaller quarter and a smaller arena with a smaller police presence and smaller amount of UFC staff that changes the dynamics of things completely so it's like\nLook if that's what's required to keep Habib and people want to see the fight as as you noted that I think you'd find a way to do it but you can't put her on that little card that it was on need to put it in a place at a time where you have the resources are there\nTo make sure nothing gets out of hand because that's not easy they have a lot of interaction not just those two fighters all of their camps you have to be very very careful\nYou know they got a date coming up November third Madison Square garden my old hometown that that'd be a perfect place to put it yeah you certainly going to have plenty of security in New York\nYeah but see here's the thing I actually think that might be a bad place to put it right why because you Irish will travel they support the arts them as one of Congress friends and there are a ton of Russians in New York City oh yeah\nOne of the remember this that's probably was rumored to be a the original McGregor versus ... fight was rumored to potentially be taking place in New York City car McGregor said he wanted that fight in New York City for that very reason you see the side of the for a lot of reasons not strictly for security there were other financial considerations\nIn place that they weren't going to put it there man that is a dangerous part you got to put a neutral territory like of Dallas texas or ah Atlanta Georgia or something like that\nNow you're in New York City a huge Irish population meant almost the entire town of forest hills almost all Russian right oh I mean that yeah you got a great turnout for that\nBut I think that's a that's a big car with a ton of security you know big stage\nUh everything is there for you to you know with if if they're going to try to capitalize on this ... between Habib and Conor man that would just be ... it's All right there just just waiting for the money\nAnd I thought they should have put the first part there but I'm just throwing your guys men look look how fast is pulled out of control the the authorities in Las Vegas that are pretty admirable job trying to contain that fire but and I looked to cops in New York NYPD have some of the best in the country\nTo taste did did you pay a yeah but I mean you'd be earning your paycheck that night if it was\nNorwood talking about ...
