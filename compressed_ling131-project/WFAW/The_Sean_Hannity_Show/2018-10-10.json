they're going to go back to the killer bees and they're going to try and make one last run with this true right\nI feel like they they will um but I'm not going to put anything past given given the

are the ones where you figure if anybody's going to go off in a situation like that it's going to be Jordan read but I at least I guess he came out of the game healthy so can we say that\nI mean we are going to be sickening they'll help you I guess it's a little bit about that\nOh well man ... speaking about another team well you know what let's just stay with that game because I wanted to start quarterback unusual but a couple of guys I don't want to talk about the skilled players let's go to the backfield because coming out of that game not only did the Redskins get be pretty good on the field\nThey got a couple of guys in the backfield that how some injury concerns Adrian Peterson said that he played with a dislocated shoulder he says he's going to be fined Chris Thompson's cuts banged up ribs what do we know about that Washington backfield\nStarting with the book in the shoulder I didn't they held a novel cautionary it really difficult to come back in right away and quite rude\nYou started with a P dislocated his shoulder I didn't they held in our precautionary it's really difficult to come back in\nRight away and play through that but it is an injury that can be played through so there is something to be said about what he's saying about wanting to play through it so I think there is a chance that he plays me sick\nBut the problem with the vocation is it's literally with\nThe ball popping out of pocket of the socket and the ball has to be reduced\nBack into talking though and compromise and the ability to shoulder because in places more stress on path and stuff like the labor him which provide stability around the joy and active structures like the rotator cuff the foreign muffled death around the joined trying to trying to keep it as stable as possible and so we have moments where you have to leave the game for a short period of time because they get irritated agitated\nDifficulties reaching up overhead a block and getting are lot extended farming but definitely something he can play through and I expected knowing his history I expect them to be able to play through it but but you can sure as well because I think when you're limited combat and I'm Chris Thompson\nLooking like a ribbon dream he got hit pretty hard limits to pointing conversion\nUm unless it's unless there's some sort of step back a lot more to it than just\nSome confusion of the ribs or a little bit of your patients uh cartilage between the ... it's more of a pain tolerance issue and he said every day to day if I expect him to play unless something else comes out down the line that are for serious in their butt off\nBut we know Adrian Peterson has had so much success in holding on to the football because he's he's known to not have any bumbling issues whatsoever so I have to imagine that\nIf they can find a way to secure that shoulder how much in terms of ball security would that be an issue did do they have to try and put a little bit more security ah I'm On the shoulder I mean how would that affect how he'd be able to grab on to the ball assuming that he's going to try and play through it\nI mean clearly there's only so much you can do there is some great you know you can do to protect give you to send them a little bit more ability\nThey'll likely you some rehab and the recovery stuff\nThis week just to get ready but you're likely to hand carrying a lot of carrying the opposite arm and he will be able to carry on with the ball but any time to get that the armed gets grab dogs\nIt's not going to be easy for the for the muscular Cher around the joint to be able to withstand the fourth and there's somebody trying to rip them all out of that arm so I'd expect them to be able to like ... and in a sense and then be able to look at it as much as possible this week\nLet's stay with some running backs here and then we'll circle back to quarterbacks Lamar Miller running back for a the Houston Texans he's got that chest\nIssue he was active but he didn't play last Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys that's where we saw a lot of Alford blue what do we know about Lamar Miller's chest\nUp and people thought there was a chance that he was going to play a buddy you know he ended up not playing at all it seems like he's in line to play the weaker than I Do a lot of details on exactly what it is that he's dealing with other than it's just a test injury and so I I think it's one of those things where maybe it's more of a sort of this year and it's not that they didn't want to\nSay you know put him out there and making susceptible to suffering further injury and so I expect him to play a week's sex but it's kinda hard to tell and honestly behind that off into why I don't really know how much you're going to get out of them anyway\nPilot let's go to a breeder from San Francisco and he he just he has not had any success in terms of being healthy seems like every week\nThere's something else he had that knee and then he had the shoulder and now he's back to India and it sounds like he boy is it a near it it is it an ankle I Know that he avoided from what I've\nHeard he avoided a high ankle spring but\nIs it a near isn't an ankle because I'm I'm hearing conflicting reports\nIs an ankle and you're right he did it for the idea of putting the didn't MRI on there and this and it looked like that the ligament that our brains in a high angle frame which of the way with the whole together the two the two golden though in the lower legs it'd be an ... it's ...\nIt looks like it's more of a I'm a relatively significant low engulfed brain which again is ... anything if need that so that kind of dogs the boss there but it's a significant enough rain where my share our coach jak how Shanahan came out and said he'd likely to be dealt wedding this weekend so I think they're going to use the entire week this week an all week a practice next week and they can\nHave a better shot I better likelihood of them playing will be ... I'd expect him to sit out in the weeks six these can be anywhere from\nTen days or weeks depending on the guardian below ankles plane depend on house out injured them are so I'd expect him to miss me sick number what kind of take a week by week and they might day having until we come\nWhat does it say that the niners have already said that he's doubtful lotta times we see the gamesmanship some teams but the niners right away came out said hey he's not but we don't think and it's a Monday Night game too so that tells me that they're not optimistic at least for a week or two with him\nYeah usually you don't see that you don't know what I'm saying that's a long week like you said so I'd expected to be at least the one week after it wouldn't Shockley and in this mix them in as well but I don't think it's one of those things where it's going to last four to six six eight weeks like it could happen to us by\nOur let's go to Atlanta and Matt Ryan reports or is that he left the game against him Pittsburgh and the fourth quarter after strips acted come back to the game was well out of hand at that point\nBut he had some X rays which seems leaving the x-ray room at a Heinz Field it doesn't sound serious but he's got that she's got a ... a match up against Tampa Bay but is there any concern about that Ryan split\nWhile you know they're getting their initial concern is always fracturing situations like that the fact of the mill fracture the good side uh it's probably going to be more of a store and it says you possible bum bruising maybe a little bit of an ankle spraying it I'm not a lot of details on exactly where are you feeling the pain and what he's feeling but it's more than likely he's going to be ready to go he's not a guy that relies heavily on his mom do the in the first wave\nHe has a mobile guy but it's not a huge part of his game so I'd expect them to start me thanks I wouldn't worry about it from that standpoint\nThe probably the managers ... don't be surprised if you hear that he's been a boat\nThat want to be out of the ordinary as well just to cut them off well and you know necessary demands on the on the foot but he didn't he shouldn't be starting only six\nAlready got a couple of wide receivers from a teenage really here first of all go to Green Bay Aaron Rodgers desperately need somebody to throw the football too he threw for four hundred and some odd year four hundred and forty two yards and three touchdowns but Green Bay they don't have that balance in the run in their past\nA rental Cobb he's got the hamstring ...

because\nThey can't do it right you're not gonna stop anybody I laugh when I hear people say well this person's like their defensive player this one's is something that I hate when they do it with

especially on that count as three points you don't want to give them up and all the way this defense is they just give them up now wide open\n\nAnd it's bad and and there there needs to be some

something right now teach me something during what's the difference between a traitor and say ooh hedge fund manager\n[noise] okay so there are there are a hedge funds and there are a mutual fund drives a hedge fund is that there was some technicalities that allows something the hedge fund meaning you can go long and short means you can bet against the market\nWhereas all of a mutual fund just sets long uh that that they that the whole thing is that they carry go off to hedge funds have a lot more I guess leeway as to how they can maneuver and how they can trace now to be a traitor that's a pretty generalized term a\nGiven me an independent trader which I was which means pretty much just trade your own money and you know whether you win or lose you only have yourself to blame when you look in the mirror at the end of the day if you're a proprietary\nTrader so companies like Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley bank of America they have I seen these rows and rows of New York [laughter]\nThey're like they're they're like terminal five at the airports I mean they're trying to take rooms filled with hundreds if not sometimes\nThousands of people and traders and these people trade on behalf of the firms that they work for their proprietary trader so if you look at the earnings reports of Goldman Sachs and bank of America they will report the type of earnings they have and these companies make an excess\nOn most days of two hundred million dollars on my bed day\nTrading with their proprietary traders\nThat's a very difficult thing to do and they make money pretty much every day there's\nBarely a day of the year where they have a losing day and that you know doesn't that doesn't pass the sniff test when you're in the trenches like I was an your scratching and clawing you know for a couple of problems like Barrow flying down and pick up your chromosomes sidewalk these guys are you know it it's either a major\nFor throwing around major money you'll get in their way and you've got run over\nBahrain where we're going we're going to go right now to something I Want you to I Know you've done your research on this the President Trump but he made a big promise most some of these called carried interest\nUh it was during the campaign I had no idea what you're talking about I Wonder if he did but he said he was going to do away with it it was a scam he really attacked the city you know you have the impression it would be one of the first things he was going to get a get out of there\nAnd it's something that ah these hedge fund managers take advantage of so tell us what to curate interest Jews and uh did the president to get rid of it\n[noise] okay so carried interest as this kind of innocuous term if you don't know exactly what it is it really don't care what it\nIs doesn't seem like it affects you right but this is exactly what it is and you know if you remember candidate Trump entire Montrose during the campaign was I'm going to drain the swamp and America with his words America was built by the middle class not the rich hedge funds guy\nAnd the hedge fund guys are going to have to pay for what I'm going to do to them at cetera et cetera so that's what period interested what state you're ahead let's say you're a hedge fund manager and you manage five billion dollar hedge fund other thousands of hedge fund some are smaller somewhere bigger but five billion dollars a pretty big fun\nYou're managing other people's money not your money you're managing investors money what your profit and loss is at the end of the year you take twenty percent of of your winning your take twenty percent of your earnings for yourself well what interests does it allows\nThe billionaire hedge fund managers to\nPay only eight twenty percent tax rate on it instead of the thirty nine point which wasn't used to be the high thirties which is the highest tax bracket there is any or with the hopes to pay that because you're earning profit on other people's money is not your money\nTax bracket there is\nAny or with the hopes to pay that because you're earning profit on other people's money is not your money there was absolutely ludicrous to anyone who looks at that doesn't need to scratch the surface of the the path of this this is not even remotely logical that these guys are getting away with saving twenty per than\nOn the Texas oh just just just a quick mathematics here\nIf you're running a five billion dollar hedge fund but they make a ten percent return that you're pretty modest that means you made five hundred million dollars in profit\nTwenty prevented that you're taking for your own\nPower pocket that's a hundred million dollars for your own pocket right right so you went to the government\nThirty nine point something million dollars in your only paying the government twenty million dollars you're keeping an extra twenty million dollars for yourself now multiply that by several thousand hedge fund and multiply that by with her more than ten percent we're talking about billions and billions and billions of dollars\nBeing held back from paying their share their fair share of taxes\nHow did this happen you know we're this loophole for\nIt it's it's funny you should ask correct so [laughter] so I'm I'm gonna I'm going to talk about\nAnd you know a ... or whatever you want because I'm a I'm going to get going on the\nNews coming up and you know we we can't stop now\nOkay so it's very hard to argue that there's a correlation between political campaign fund raising and legislation\nThat either the port their hits the pocket of Wall Street so far we haven't seen any legislation that the pocket of all it all we hear about politicians\nAre having the greatest prospect of winning are the ones who raised the money right so what the money you have to do with their platform or their ideas you'd think\nIt means that they'll have the part of the three each other methods to the voters are buying this radio TV well that's true of all the great but the the fact that money is launching against her opponent\nPac superPAC political action group that don't have to disclose where there were the ... where they get their money from\nSo I Want to get into a little bit about what McCain what the McCain Feingold legislation was back in two thousand two and how that was overturned than in two thousand ten\nBy the Citizens United versus federal election commission decision that decision basically granted free speech\nA free speech protection at first amendment's protection that originally prohibited a restricting donations to the political action group so tell me what we have to break because I'm going to go into the McCain Feingold legislation\nThrough there right now that's a good place to stop because we have to first of all but\nUh yeah in the McCain Feingold I was a big fan of that I really appreciated the Democrat and Republican working on legislation like that that the identified as a problem\nCorrupt the opinion as I'm On the emily's list case that struck down the restrictions on uh\nOn on super PAC was judge Kavanaugh the judge Kevin uh\nDeclared that these super PACs are constitutionally entitled to raise and spend our limited money in support of the candidates that they chose for elected office he also said in his opinion that it was implausible that contribution to independent groups could corrupt the candidates well\nYou know what candidate Trump was right and Kavanaugh was wrong it does corrupt candidates thought even with with Democrat Bob Menendez a ... I think there were two or three hundred thousand dollar contributions to a superPAC supporting the end of the three elections that are\nGoing to do it do them both sides of the aisle and I'm I'm not targeting Republicans on it even though they're the ones who are really\nAbused at the most so for forty two years the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of limiting contributions to candidates\nBut Kavanaugh's ruling provided an easy way around those limits his ruling allowed donors to give millions of dollars to support candidates as long as the money goes through a code independent group um this is\nThis a staggering a and\nIt just you know the fact that\nTapped into this popular outrage about government corruption and the rich holding down the common man and not giving them their due to get elected a vehicle to use that to get elected and then he would be to the very guy Brett Kavanaugh more responsible for the creation\nUh the hidden figures that they get elected and then he elevates the very guy Brett Kavanaugh most responsible for the creation of the super pac which then the Supreme Court for a month later\nThe basis to rule on the Citizens United case so basically McCain Feingold doesn't exist anymore it's been it's been a scrap heap of history and that is why Andy ... when we have\nThis condition is where the tail wag the dog you follow the money the money from Wall street and the money go through a super PAC not to Wall Street we have we have the Koch brothers to\nUh we have a lot of independence rich people out there who try to forward their own interests are donating to candidates who are going to play ball with them\nUm and this is that this is what was not supposed to happen\nSo you get this right so you're saying that this loophole to get these guys these hedge fund managers are all these millions hundreds of millions of dollars\nYou know real scam weight of the words of the president these hedge fund guys runs gamma ... down candidate Trump said as soon as you say you know we haven't heard anything about that you didn't put a new tax bill\nYou see that there is a pretty good chance those hedge fund guys met with him and said hey you are closing a loophole or that's the money we used to go into your campaigns and you're going to be shooting yourself in the food you better think about doing that is that what you're saying\nI'm not think anyone would meet with Trump and have him understand anything of that magnitude you know unless they unless they created some photo flash cards for him to understand\nWhy it's been done that's been done\nI'm [laughter] I'm sure I'm sure\nThey I'm sure Gary Cohn was the guy who took Wall Street uh interest you know to the White House and uh help influence legislation to help his his buddies back in a you know back in Manhattan that have nothing to do with it trumpet trumpet it's just a pen Trump to sign of\nWhatever they give him to sign he's you know he he he doesn't understand the technicality just like you said themselves you know that we'd like to read he does what it gets from Fox and that's about it uh but you know he has his people around him do things the things of that magnitude where where it actually requires\nAn understanding of things like fat that best from strong point he's a he's a he's a gift\nFrom God not not from his brain\nPesky facts are anyway I you know I I I'm Glad you brought this up you did a really good job of filling it out but I just want to see you know this is one of those and I wonder okay we can detect Trump on this but I Wonder if the Democrat was in there and the would shut it down to this has been around for a while isn't it\nOh yeah this look this ... this is not a Republican Democrat\nScientist and I don't want opponent home because I I think\nAnd this is a good time to bring it up born because people are running for office in our congressional district ... years to be a new person so why not bring this up with those candidates in ... how do you feel about carried interest clues that loophole you promised me that\nAnd they give you an answer and hope this comes up in some debates\nWhat candidates who are the hold in the dark money and a superPAC money\nAre not going to turn down that money it puts them in the power I mean why would somebody right I look at it all starts at square one unless we unless we change our political system where the amount of millions of dollars you've raised a is and\nWhat gets you elected your your ideas are supposed to get through elected your qualifications\nAnd and your knowledge is supposed to get through life that's not how much money you raised so people who are people who get a lot of dark super PAC money usually people who are relatively incompetent but they're just they're they're just\nThere as a puppet for the\nYou know the corporate interests that you know that's the puppet master I mean the ... the Koch brothers are not even a shy about this I mean they go ... you know publicly say well we're not going to throw money behind this candidate because he's not doing what we want him to do that shouldn't happen\nNo matter what the different not what democracy is democracy the voice of all the people and every one of the voices supposed to be equal the voice of a billionaire\nShould not squash\nMillions of voices just because we can't donate the money that he is donating to put the Kennedy he he wants to have an office to\nTo forward his own interest is is this is sadly not bright and congressional Republicans however are complicit in this because McCain Feingold tried\nTo eliminate this scenario from getting worse and worse and congressional Republicans and conservatives on the court are the ones who struck down\nThe restrictions of\nMcCain fined gold and instituted a new basically you know a different way of bribery where were these billionaires in multi billion dollar corporations can donate to a superPAC with their money and superPACs and they could elect whoever they they want yeah it is both Republican and Democrat thing because\nIt's inherently and our political system right now political system is flawed our political system is basically beholden to whoever can raise as well as raise the most money\nBut it shouldn't be and McCain find old saw that and they tried to to address that and the congressional Republicans and Republican conservatives on the court who eliminated those restrictions\nAre ultimately the ones who have made this become the wild west\nI mean we're gonna we're gonna break here because I Want it and we're going to switch gears are going to talk about the Marquette law school pool or the ... pool chemo just leader earlier today and we'll do

the reality is NBA raw or for the regular season has to be set Monday afternoon\nIn the in the east coast time and they need to be locked in for opening night on Tuesday and time for your week Wednesday and the walls or did it when you talk to other teams around the we even ones who aren't even remotely involved in trying to trade forgiving father\nNo one can believe that they were going on and more or less than a week from the feet of cutting off\nAnd it really does lend that era of\nWhat the hell is going on around here to the Minnesota symbols but you know gone before a kid's got there wasn't that\nPretty much the the view of Minnesota before he got there like what the hell is going on around here and now that he doesn't really have the support of the owner it's kind of going back to that\nYeah you're absolutely right that we can prove that this single biggest advantage and sports especially MBA or last or size or smaller superstar during that ownership is the single biggest advantage it can happen is\nIf you don't have a good owner you're going to struggle to put together a good team at least for anything beyond you know for birth here and there and the challenges that poor Minnesota was they they went Thirteen Years about making it to the playoffs\nAnd it got and they were kind of that he'll get story with you know is there and he got the veteran butler dragging the kids\nYou know to the playoff they are such great experience and all of a sudden I might have been a wanting Don Reo here because you're not going to be a better team without me by workers just no way\nAnd the reality is they they can not going to start a seat or go on the roster and expect to have any sort of success\nSong would cheat Smith real GM on that day aside dot com inside Lon akita further reports on Jimmy Butler today that\nWill had re engaged the rockets on Jimmy Butler discussions obviously they wanted the Miami deal that deal fell apart now they're kind of revisiting things the rockets\nJimmy bottlers discussions obviously they wanted the Miami deal not deal fell apart now they're kind of revisiting things the rockets they reportedly asked for both Erik Gordon and PJ talker I'm assuming they ask for more than just to get those guys but that those two guys were both asked\nFor uh in in a deal for the bottlers the rockets and know hey look the rockets and know who would be is is you know is down more playing hardball because you know the average [noise]\n[noise] yeah it's good for the hell in for the second part first downward definitely as ... by\nThe probably the bigger answers and that's not something that they're in a position to do ... how important factor is\nTrue that team he's their best to under ... as far as the non big man category kept going to cut power has locked down but but it is PJ Tucker is easily their desk guy to this and you know anybody really saying is for\nOn the roster when even when you're I think the goal is to take down the warriors you need guys like PJ ... Jimmy ... really good\nBut what kind of do the kind of cost you it's going to cost to the extent say the best six man and the way to get as well so maybe that there can replace some of what talk or does but now you're going to be down there as well and not in that not a team that has a lot of stuff you\nKnow unfortunately just where they're sitting right now so that doesn't surprise me all the ... you know turn that down and said no and he can afford to wait here he's not in a position where he corruption you think he's got a pretty good restaurants like that\nDo you think that ultimately a deal will get on with the rockets who do you think there is another team that are either is on it or will be in on Jimmy Butler or with the rockets did not rejecting the most current offer some seniors\nYeah I don't think it'll be the rockets I think it is most likely to be the Miami Heat\nDay going to have close enough that both by the exchange medical information that basically he's a football time not that someone you're you know you've got first and goal you know in fact that the two you're almost there to push on this thing over the line and getting at dawn and Minnesota came\nBack and ask for one more thing and and that's when Miami Boston said no we we were there\nJust move for the like the deal is I think it's more likely that aims to change when you get back to where they live in Maine and now I'm going to sort of bizarre you know we just got to get this thing moving north kept established that we have\nReturned some good players you know and some office down the line and not to move forward around he'll Carl Anthony towns and Andrew when they come out today really gathered and everything is bad is anybody guys and the whole situation so that's a big bigger chunk of why Minnesota has to get this thing down today rouse them later\nNow in the Miami Heat where to acquire butler based on what you know all those discussions and who's going to get move where where does that was the heat in the eastern sons", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "10"}
