Singh infused bourbon\nIt's cost the company twenty five percent of its sales\nAll of the buyers have cold feet now they've said until this gets resolved there not placing an order said Brian coming Cummings cofounder of the distillery which has eleven employees are fifth anniversary is coming up next may and I'm hoping we can make it to them to feel that\nIn Cumberland the town of about twenty two hundred residents in rural northwest Wisconsin artists him incorporated organization\nHas warned us trade officials of the harm that the twenty five percent tariff on Chinese goods could have on his business and the community\nArt is Sam is one of the towns largest employers and over fifty eight years its product line has grown to include hunting and fishing gear garden equipment and yard bird chicken pleasure for home poultry enthusiasts\nIf left in place the tariffs stands to completely eliminate quote unquote the profit on some products according to the company\nPut simply to things could happen the consumer will end up paying the tariff or art of them will just continue selling these products and reduce its workforce accordingly\nAccordingly to adjust the reduction in business company president Michel for ... said in a letter this summer to us trade officials\nUnder either scenario individual Americans will suffer in a town of the size of Cumberland the result of a workforce reduction would have\nA negative impact on the entire community are set set\nThe company added forty two jobs in the last three years in Cumberland whereas about a hundred and forty employees while most of its manufacturing is done in Asia the jobs in Cumberland have a an average wage of fifty two thousand dollars a year\nOr does and says it can't it can't easily sidestepped the tariffs by finding other suppliers for things like electric logs split or is\nThere is currently no large scale manufacturing of these products happening in the United states and the amount of time and resources ... necessary to establish this level of manufacturing would undoubtedly jeopardize the industry as a whole and particularly\nOr all it was all about the terrorists are are affecting us um they they increase their costs by twenty five percent so we have to adjust and increase our prices to our customers and so for the last\nThree you know three months it's been just quite a bit of hard work I'm going into our customers\nAnd ask for the price increases that feeling all the different things they require\nUs to do that put through so it's just it takes a lot of work so\nSo ... and sign contracts before the tariffs came into that problem Steve that uh you're guaranteed some price maybe and now this kind of changes things is that happened\nIn my trade they don't\nDo you know long term pricing contract but what they will do is say that when we don't accept any price changes for a hundred and twenty days something like that that you know your costs as increased immediately so you end up having to fight for that price increase\nAnd that can you get it you know within a hundred and twenty days or so or maybe six\nMonths by the time that goes into effect so you got some money there\nWell I I'm I'm hoping you were one of those guys are says there's no stupid questions because I ask you about I think could be a ... but I sure appreciate your expertise in this but when did these tariffs kick in a ... for you and your company\nOr so the first one was July ... I think most people getting into this call that we've won\nSo the first one was July six that's that I think most of the people getting into this call that wave one and a wave to was\nI think it was August like other on August twenty answer this wave three the most recent one went into effect September twenty four\nOkay and when you see we use are they different tariffs altogether or are they are they different at all\nThey ... they started off with around a goes around Thirteen hundred\nUm harmonize tear codes so let's just say a vault meters that it might be importing from China it has an assigned I'm tear code someone it enters through customs it's always identify\nHim by that tear code and that's how they started was they took\nAround a twelve hundred tariff codes\nAnd they apply the twenty five percent tariff to any of those good with that identification so that was way of one was around twelve hundred items and then we have to I don't remember how many uh it was a similar number and then we have three the one that came through in September was\nA large number I I don't know the number I think those are on twenty five thousand products\nAll right so that was teaching these waves it's what's included All right All right All right we'll see I'm learning something here and I I'm learning to other people are as well so Steve how are you know would it be done to adjust and how long can you deal with this\nWar I don't know I mean that's the kind of the sixty four dollar question was\nHow um you know how far is it's been okay most customers are are they saying and others accepting the price increases so you know that part\nOf it was difficult but it it has happened I think and we're still rolling through some that are supposed to increase January first\nBut um that was kind of my first concern was how what kind of repercussions would we have with the price increases would it be you know ruin some of our customer a you know relations with our our customer base and then\nAfterwards what it\nWas a higher prices have you know a negative effect on on on the sales so let's see if those were the\nTwo main main issues in front of me at the time when they started rolling out\nThe president he ran on ... and uh I was just wondering do you do you understand what he's going\nFor at least I mean you know morals way more than anybody eliciting myself for sure on this but a user name game that you can kinda understand or how do you think about what do you think about this\nSo as the little you know the kind of the bone that I had to pick what this was up to the number you know the costs increase or companies was just you know very tough to deal with and then they rolled it out as a\nUm attempt to address high tech issues such as the um intellectual property those they claimed was being stolen and transferred to China so uh they they addressed the\nItems that they attack or picked you know to Tara initially they were saying we're high tech and some of our products are just not high tech\nFor kind of had a problem with the way that they\nAssigned to the terrorists\nAnd um I felt like some of these items like for example the first wave was a timing light and as an automotive term timing like faith back to the sixties so it may be even before that\nAre so tiny light if everybody knows that his tinkered with cars this isn't the whole tech items so I felt like\nIf they really were at you know going after high tech they were missing the boat on some of their identification of the products\nAnd so my my thing was what to look at all the stuff that comes from China I mean here we are a small company and we're getting hit with twenty five percent tariff what about you know wastepaper basket you know or rooms you know\nSome things you know tear if at all instead of coming after a small number category of products\nYou know like ours I felt like we were singled out at first you know with with regards to\nThe items they selected to terrorists so that was upstate me at first so\nWhen talking to a president of electronic specialties from ... city in Wisconsin and they're talking about the president's\n... are you hearing anything Steve is is there a light at the end of the tunnel I mean obviously you can't go on forever for or in your mind in the story in the U.S see today in the morning Journal Sentinel\nUh you you said that uh you you know I Know that if I were to lead someone off would be a big blown to their ... life have you had to do that you\nKnow ... like I say I think we're still ... with a lot of the people ah we're in a kind of a wait and see you know what the repercussions will would be for higher pricing and then again like how how that's going to go over with your customers that I think the article wrote\nSome things about\nThe other is that um I think the boat company had already seen some\nCancelled orders I haven't seen that so think thank goodness you know that hasn't occurred here I'm Still a lot of us that are affected by it I think are still kind of waiting to see what the the real outcome is going to be to our businesses\nOr the president says his hope for the reason for doing this at least that's what I'm gathering is that his hope is that a ... items that you mentioned\nAre going to be made here is that even in reality\nUsed what could happen could that happen to some of these meters you're talking about ... and getting them from China to make them here Steve\nUm yeah it is possible and you know given the I I started traveling to China over in the late nineties and I'm a probably then they're sixteen times and I've seen a lot of\nChange I mean the places booming it's just it's kind of explosives\nAnd so when you see the changes over the different times that you go there you realize how much\nUm you know what's going on there uh I I sort of bitter you know bitter sweet I kind of agree with some of that sentiment to slow down the amount\nOf of products being imported from China I Do think there's some some uh you know a benefit to that thought and uh you know but we're we're going through right now is\nIs a you know they decided to do with twenty five per se\nBob and uh you know but we're we're going through right now is is a you know they decided to do twenty five percent terrified I may have decided to do it a little differently I might have decided to do\nUm you know smaller tariff on everything as opposed to trying to pinpoint high tech products\nSo that that would have been by my approach alright\nWell but I think that that helps a little bit too for people like us to think about you know do we just important I'd of China or can we do we you know way out the investments to build it here it does help with a motivating factor\nWell I I I have to agree with that and it sounds like a ... ... what you said is that you're looking for some sort of a balance to this and you recognize that he was out of balance before this and you're hoping
