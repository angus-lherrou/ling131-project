Cohen Jordan our word so many different situations when it comes to running backs and still don't have\nA lot of clarity I Want to ask him also about the Sean Watson physical talent is there but it's just still it's not clicking so far for the Texans\nDo you want to tell you Jose that you and I did pick up her fifth consecutive ruin we're now five and one we are now in Seoul possession of first place\nAbsolutely because over the last two weeks he's proven to be indispensable to the Steelers the way that he's run the ball he can catch the ball worked at the goal line be productive for them what is the giving them that levy on bill\nCouldn't give them and sure maybe he's not quite as electric his love beyond bell and he might not be as political past catcher maybe can't lineup chains kind of all over the field like you can't levy on giving them great numbers increase production and he's going to be a huge\nPart of their off for as long as loving on both days away and window comes back and I'm not sure if the Steelers are going to welcome him with open arms and say oh no hard feelings come on and get\nYourself some twenty carry games that's what they did when he came back from suspension the past two seasons now I'm not so sure that he's going to get that kind of he rose welcome upon his return I think you could see these guys mix and match and I think ... to be the one that the Steelers continue the reward\nSo long as he doesn't let them down\nAnd that's going to be dull key if Congress continues to plays well he's been playing averaging full point four years for Kerry getting touchdowns I think the Steelers are gonna stick with them\nAnd when you've got the endorsement of big Ben and the way that if he gets the wind is going to be done like and he can audible into something you've got the support of your quarterback that's pretty much the highest praised that you can get\nImportantly that's probably also the cage for every other player in the Steelers locker room\nBy get hit if Ben's on board which is kind of bring the best running back then everybody would probably feel the same way and you can probably extend that to the coaching staff and the coaches they don't want to make changes to their team if that means uncertainty andme I'm Dave apt to feel good with the consistency\nThat James counter has given them over most of the season or a couple of games there where he didn't get a lot of work in his numbers weren't that great but he's he's worked his way through the offensive line got healthy again and you can tell the steel is often will get it should but the way that we expect\nWork in his numbers weren't that great but he's he's worked his way through the offensive line got healthy again and you can tell the Steelers often will plug it it should but the way that we expected it to work\nHe did Richard from CBS Sports you can follow him on Twitter at Dave Richard I want to switch to Chicago I think a lot of us with Matt now gives off and start that Jordan Howard he's going to be a top five top six running back all these expectations and that our parents\nMade or are we starting to see a change of the guard to to wreak Cohen with the way that ... it seems like he's just he's gaining a lot more bars in what was the last few weeks he's put up some really good numbers\nHe's put up outstanding numbers and obviously the coaching staff there had to recognize that check this out as far as playing time went in the same it's made me throw up their numbers\nHoward played only two more snaps than calling and remember they played\nSeventy snatched total combined with the in the office was on the field for Seventy snapped so they were almost in a fifty fifty split Justin claimed time alone I think\nGames script matters here Chris the fact that the bears didn't go in there and just blow out the dolphins with the run game they had to compete with Miami Miami was pretty points on the board to add to match\nThat put calling on the field a little bit more to make the coaching staff expected and I would think that that's going to continue moving forward at worst a fifty fifty split and maybe at best to recall and start to take a sixty forty share this office the worst part about it all for\nHow it is that he fumbled at the goal line he had a chance to put a touchdown on the board that would win the game and within the first time after ... on the porch with a matter for Chicago or the turnover hurt them and if our can't be reliable there than what the point of having them on the field would call and it's just far more of an electric player and a better guy for the bears often it's which\nFrankly I think it's becoming more of a passing off it's like we're seeing from most other teams around the lake\nYeah I I wanted to ask you about that and then a couple of quarterback there before I let you go and but you you mentioned Jordan Howard not being a a fifth by that often as I kind of started to see that myself so I'm Glad that you mentioned that\nYeah and it it's just unfortunate because Howard was one of those you know you're talking about the running back but let you down Jordan ours was the second round pick who absolutely let people down this year I mean he I think it has a real good chance of continuing it's too bad because he's a very talented player a and and again if the guy that\nWhat are you gonna do with them if you if you treat them you're not going to get anything for 'em because everybody knows that Jordan Howard isn't doing that well so you just have to hold on to him and maybe use them as a as a third running back by we die of blacks option something like that\nWhat is your confidence level and dish on watching right now\nIt's not very high and and I hate saying that because I Love love love drafting them this year took him around five rounds if every week that I could whenever he felt that far I should say but he's banged up\nHis office of wind is in writing shape it's way worse than I thought it would be and I'm just I'm fearful that injury for the shock and on top of that he just he didn't look great last week he's got a tough match up this week so if I had to Shaun what's on my fancy team that I don't have another quarterback I'm going to go find one\nAnd I'm going to probably start\nBack died this week over watching because I'm worried about him having that big time performance that were used to him having against the the jaguars in Jacksonville I it's not going to be a very good match for and it's a tough spot for me it's going to be under a lot of pressure or could be a long tough week for Sean ...\nLast question before I let you go into another quarterback that has been putting up some really good numbers in the ministry of defense has not been on paper at least it's been a lot more fearsome than what we've seen on the field damned Arnold set a couple of really good weeks where is he in terms of being a viable weekly starter\nBy he's up by week option and that's and that's being generous Chris I really don't see than Donald I'm continuing uh doing what he's doing I Know\nLast week it was pretty good two hundred and eighty arts two touchdowns it's nice but I still buy into the Vikings defense being good or bad sugary I'd ever seen Griffin back and there'll be great that might not happen until toward the end of the year when they're making a playoff run a here's the thing\nIt's all been playing fairly well last week great completion percentage there are so many other quarterbacks out there that you can either use on a week to week basis or just go with for the rest of the season and tributes nine touchdowns in his last few games Joe Flaco\nIs a big number bigger may feel that the dreaming is match up on the board against Tampa Bay yeah it is hard to go with Donald in a matchup against Minnesota\nWhen you've got so many other great quarterbacks out there and I only make three there's probably another double shower Watson I just got done trashing him and yes I Would try and trade to try and watch them as I could\nI Would take him over Santa Arnold ten times I've had a match up this week given what they got going against each other\nThese days Richard from CBS fantasy sports you can follow him on Twitter at Dave Richard Dave appreciate the time and this is great let's say let's definitely do it again\nLet's definitely do it again Chris good luck in all of your leak this week I Hope you get everybody want off waivers tonight\nThey're fantastic conversation with Dave Richard
