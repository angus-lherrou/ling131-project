last week and that was kind of a this is a almost a playoff to the playoff games where we're going to get their second last they're gonna find a tough to get in the playoffs later in the season yeah\nYeah you know All right so I'm ... union are they still waiting at all yeah\nOh yeah and and and I don't mind the union is that as a top notch football program they they don't you know there hasn't been the war hawks in Mount union in about a twelve of the last Fifteen or sixteen national championship games because they just beat up on\nThey they have to get through the playoffs too and eventually they play good teams they had a close game earlier this year with John Carroll I Believe it is and uh uh you know they gave them a tough game they I think we lost by eight or nine there was a pickup bumble recovery at the end that did that team in but um\nThere will be some tough teams along the way for all playoff entrance and the hawks right now we're hawks are now ready to fifth in the country union has been number one well and you have to give them that they are the defending national champs okay\nSo uh yeah let me the steak bowl is what the ... that's they're Super Bowl a few minutes right that's right and it it's always he was always in the east or in Virginia\nI was always in Salem, Virginia right outside of Roanoke that's ... that's changed they played it last year in Texas I think it goes one more year in Texas this year and then from what I hear of I understand and I don't pay as much attention to this until it's time to go to one but I'm going to move it around to different sites Salem\nHad it for a bunch of years sure and then they loved it I mean it was great because people were coming in from out of town and if you've got eighty\nSo Salem had it for a bunch of ... and they loved it I mean it was great\nBecause people were coming in from out of town and if you've got eighty football players or Ninety four pop whenever it is on a regime sixty five whatever it is you're going to have family members coming in you're going to have fans coming in um\nThe downtown Roanoke is real happy and when the whitewater war hawks make them that they're they're not as concerned with who wins or loses but they're even happier after war hawks when because the Warhol fans know how to celebrate them\nAnd they buy things downtown they're walking in and out of the stores all the warm up that you know the game is now played on a friday night it was played on Saturdays for a long time but uh or hockey fans not only come in a uh eat and drink they they they walk the stores and buy things they they they write the merchants very happy\nTo like the color purple or in Roanoke and they probably color purple 'cause ...\nIt's purple for pets around union as well that's right you got me on that one and a probably a few people in whitewater and know a first name basis some of the shop owners they're the guy down at the diner\nAnyway or let's say gets caught up is to win the game starts again that's at twelve forty on a Saturday\nOn a neuro Williams Stadium is a ... say that again Donnan nor are Williams Stadium Don I've done I've done both uh we're hockey games and high school games out of that stadium it's a nice stadium it's a little weird though because the grandstand is on one side and on the other side you basically have\nThe benches where the visiting team and that's where the war hawks will be tomorrow and then behind that you have like\nI don't know if it's a tennis court in a baseball diamond and a soccer field and basically a century fence a separate and you and the outside of the stadium asset so it's a little different but the facilities are very nice will have very good broadcast view and facilities and ah\nI'm done a lot of games are probably done about a dozen games or am I between the hawks and some high school stuff and uh\nYou know they'll get they'll get a lot of games here in the next few weeks start will not be going to the playoffs but they'll get some they may get one or two high school playoff games here in the next couple of weeks because of a the turf feel that they have and be you know just the size of the stadium\nAlright and are again twelve forty is at the beginning of the broadcasters Saturday\nA utility whitewater at stowed uncool and it was six point five and ... and another ... a day to keep it in a in the back of your mind he is October thirty first they are the Halloween show of the coaches show from the Tour de one brewer how are you sure says it's not ... ...\nThat's the only Charlotte I\nSure he liked that if we did that uh\nEight forty one brew house and a lot of people come to a to live they sometimes have specials a it's a lot of fun and you get to talk about the war hawks and of course as we get closer and closer to the playoffs the excitement builds and oh yeah the makes them more fun\nOh yeah it does and and again three more weeks of football for the war hawks starting with this Saturday and then we'll be home with Steven's point of a week from this coming Saturday and then we make that lovely trip down the plaque bill and that'll be the final game of the season\nAnd that will be for the ... played for the ... when they play Plath really their home or away and uh\nUh uh George Chris so he's he's the a coach that passed away from their many years ago his wife will be at the middle of the field at the end of the game to handle ... somebody it's pretty nice it's a very touching celebration it's even more touching that I think the last Fifteen Years of war hawks of walked away with the ... so\nWe'll see if they do again yeah once that's a long way down the road the plant and it was all the whole us we're sitting here right now he'd be straggling but yeah I don't see how we're not anywhere past the opening flip the coin this Saturday So right what's up plant will get for a field\nOr they have a pretty nice field they're pretty nice stadium they you know they had some trouble with tornadoes there are a number of years ago a bunch of things got blown out around the buildings windows and whatnot I Can't remember if it was five or six years ago but all the repairs have been done everything's in place the field is pretty nice and a\nAgain a lot of high school games will be played there as the playoffs continue because of the facility

Kevin on the SPA time she had her Kevin appreciate the time\nTo talk to you\nThanks for cheating on me a little bit without like say I appreciate it on the other way around cheating on Alex with me I should say [laughter]\nSo it's a it's a busy weekend and I I'll save until the end how I Would think that the jak is going to be an eagles but let's talk in in your wheel house first and foremost I Know that there are a couple of big names that are off this week but Florida Georgia\nSeems to be one if not the biggest gain that jumps out a lot on the line for Florida they can find a way to beat Georgia how realistic you think that is it the gators can walk away victorious\nBut I think we saw last week I Georgia's not invincible so I don't think there's any reason to suspect that a forward it doesn't belong in the same field you know if they're playing some really good defense this year\nThey probably still has some room to improve but\nYou know there's no rivalry game so you know it's going to be seated and you know it's going to be a highly contested I just wonder though you know after the last of Georgia had last week you know is that going to be a little bit of a wake up call on this so\nI was going to be able to handle that I I'm not sure about that so that's why I really like George chances here to maybe kind of not necessarily blow for the output kind of when this one pretty comfortably could that you think this is a little bit of a bounce back statement opportunity for Georgia\nWho we are very talented team the ... last week a convention or otherwise\nWhat was your initial reaction so you see the last Georgia loses and then you know the schedule coming up so earlier in the week as your opinion changed about this game at all or was that pretty much a man they lose this day and they've got Florida coming up somebody's getting a national up and down in Florida\nYou know it doesn't really changed my outlook at all I think like going back to the fact that Georgia is coming off the last I think they're kind of reflects the focus a little bit not say that they weren't focused in the car before it got a little bit of a problem with that\nI just feel like that where that was last year they kind of set the bar pretty high for themselves and I think last week kind of a gets gets back in the mindset that you still have a lot of opportunity so I had just got to win out the rest of your games pretty much at this point which is not out of the question right now 'cause they're like I said there's just so much talent they're running the ball and\nDefensively what they can do it it's a really good program so that the big test for Kirby Smart because now you've got to have oh he's got to find a way to kind of re set the tone a little bit of needed and you're doing it against Florida in Jacksonville that's like the perfect opportunity I think he has ...\nWho has a more at stake I wore Penn State's big match up three thirty eastern tomorrow what do you think as more at stake as far as winning that football game\nYou know it's interesting because I've been looking at different all week and I think it's obviously a huge for Iowa because of the division that they are in\nTheir in a little bit of a heated race to get that Big Ten and west division so I think if you're talking about changing the way in the Senate clearly more important for Iowa dispense it's pretty much out of it however it Penn State doesn't win this game that still allows for the opportunity to maybe go to one of the big ball games at the end of the year\nMakes it much more realistic of a scenario even though they've gotten challenging games coming up after that so yeah I think um it depends on which way you're talking about you're talking about the big race it's clearly more important for Iowa oh you're talking about just getting back to one of his knee or stick ball game\nI think a Penn State probably has more riding on\nHow bad specifically for James Franklin how important is a game like this\nHuge because the last two games they play it at home as a uh been to losses they wound up or or to leave so I look at this game with ... coming in and in a really good I Would think\nThis is the kind of opportunity workings frankly in Penn State they need to get back to some of the big six to rebuild some of the swagger they they used to have one off that it's kind of gone missing or the last couple of weeks with a couple of games so I think you're getting a chance to come back on home after a sloppy performance\nIndiana I think it's a huge huge opportunity where James Franco and his team me to play the to the ... what they're capable of doing because they haven't been doing that lately who\nDo you have winning that game I Do it then the winning I don't think it's going to be pretty though I think it's going to be ugly ...\nYeah [laughter] I don't think many people will argue with that Kevin McGuire joining me to understand her\nAs a nation radio now I Know following you on Twitter and and following your work you are not in the older reactionary crowd even following Monday morning in which our Philadelphia Eagles take a law so I'm sure that you are not in the Texas is done crowd after that first opening lost to Maryland but\nHow does that kind of hang over Texas who is clearly battled back and looked like a completely different football team taking on Oklahoma State it's still kind of in the backdrop over they played themselves away from that lost\nI think they've played themselves away from it and I think it I\nIt's still kind of a backdrop over Abyei played themselves away from that lost\nI think they've played themselves away from it and I think if I can go back to that week one game I actually saw some signs of improvement or more so in that that can happen and I was actually kind of more encouraged by that foreign than I think a lot of people work but\nYou know certainly they've taken care of business since then they've got a couple of wins against cranking obviously the winner gets Oklahoma's the highlight of the season so far and they put themselves in a really good position to potentially play for the big twelve championship it's all going to be about this November scheduled just get out of this weekend without taking off\nAnd you're in a really good spot 'cause uh the number schedule is going to be pretty fun for the entire big call because there's a lot of good game coming up but yeah I I really feel like ... continue to take some steps forward\nOn not ready to say that they're all the way back just yet because I Do think that I still want to see a little bit more I Want to see them in the big Paul championship game first uh they're they're like I said there any good spot to get that right now so I go out and win a couple of games to make that reality but I I think it's right there for the sake\nWelcome home estate is on fire and clearly not the same caliber of talent that taxes can put out there but that's gotta be some concern right and they're riding a sixth game winning streak right getting into this game so how do you balance that if your taxes knowing that you have a team that you're better than talent lies which still has a ton of momentum\nBut I think protective it's just about slowing things down a little bit as much you can especially on defense uh Oklahoma State been having some issues this year so I think that the team that the right for the taking protected I think the only thing I'm concerned about is you know a road trip is still water is not something that should\nBe taken for granted I think that's a challenging situation and you know I think we're going to find out\nA ... mentally what kind of a state taxes in because this is a game where now all of a sudden they're in the top ten to continue to climb up a little bit or they're going to start reading there with headlines a little bit and start smelling themselves or\nIs this a wakeup call so I that's why I'm curious about that was I Do think that Texas is much more rounded right now I just feel like there are a stronger team overall and they've got a lot more going on in Oklahoma State of\nKevin McGuire joining me explanation radio anytime ... for Patrick ... have been I\nI don't know what you would call Florida State season right I mean it's disappointing when they start out that one in a two and then you know they went a couple and they just they lose to Miami they win ... against wage and I I don't know if anybody has them challenging Clemson but is there something that's changed in your opinion\nWhen is Willie ... with\nWhat's happened down in Florida State and and does that give you any hope whatsoever did they can challenge Clemson\nI think the the\nThe game plan for Florida State is they're just trying to not not overdo it I think early on this year they're trying to do a little too much and that just caught going because they didn't have everything together with the coaching transition and trying to implement new system everything and I think the season's going along they're starting to get a little bit better and get a little bit more comfortable and they're starting to feel a little bit more confident", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "26"}
