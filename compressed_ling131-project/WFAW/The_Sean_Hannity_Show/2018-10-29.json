might get to that and then we might run out of time anyway\nTo kind of a you and I we served in leadership in the state assembly I was the clock is cheer you or the or a ... year and a firm that we became really good friends and ah I when I appreciate you use a you know you're\nYou're part of Wisconsin so different in many ways and in many ways the same as the part that I represented but you would walk me through some of the issues that I just love do you break it down for me and bite sized chunks in may be better understand\nWhat it was that maybe I was missing or just didn't get to among some issues and I got you know one one of the issues it's really being bantered\nTurned into a political football for I Believe in many cases all the wrong reasons\nIs that of immigration and want to be your big issues are true leader on is a legal immigration and uh you know can you just kind of situation for us representative and just kind of you know break down for a little bit\nOf any any effect that even way back my freshman ... eleven is really we find is when a leader but the fact that status together we were ... and\nSo I'm threw out a lot of that some also is a you know a ... up sixty one plus hours Iraq pattern so I really think we bonded back way back when I was asked men yes so many going\nWay back on the immigration a I'm a controversy use we can go to a you know where we had on this a nationally and in our state\nYou know it's unfortunate that immigrants has seemingly popped up locally here and I said they recently with a Walker campaign on the guy and fortunately I Know I Believe what Governor Walker believes that he's losing so\nHe has doubled down on an anti immigrant anti Latino sentiment unfortunately and following the lead of presidents trials and really divide and conquer and the good people Wisconsin we have a long history\nImmigrant history as you know here in the state of Wisconsin is a former German heritage or what's I celebrate with my family and myself by cooking rats in the summer a polish heritage chairman is outside of the city of Milwaukee let the let our just another\nA threat you know in that quilt that is the American history of the great state of Wisconsin and it's unfortunate that political football that sets up and walk continue and continue to make it the the issue here and I said and in the country\nOkay so what are some of the solutions okay so when it comes to immigration you hear people say I represented ... but you know why can't\nPeople just follow the rules\nAnd come here the right way why is it that they have to try and get here illegally uh what's your answer to that\nBut what my answer is that the truth is is that the majority of these folks that are here undocumented unfortunately undocumented immigrants found themselves here not because they call here illegally many of them came here absolutely lawfully and legally they did the right thing and then\nAh their visa expired and they sell end of the broken system if they fell into the crap that is a broken immigration system in this country because it's a immigration tends to be a hot\nButton political issue that frankly over the generations over the years over the decades\nBoth political parties have punted on and so we have a Congress that has left the valor time and time again to finally address comprehensive immigration reform even when the Senate finally passed it when I was I Believe a sophomore\nAnd the state legislature we finally had at the U.S Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform but it it just languished in the house a couple of hours that having that got you know whipping out on an addressing the issue of immigration\nWhat are some of the things that need to be addressed a to a streamlined the system\nTo bring it to a twenty eight teams to meet our challenges when it comes to immigration because as I understand it and I really wish I knew more and that's why I'm so glad you came on is that how are we going to do some of the things to make it a system that's fear and it works well and people don't have to consider\nA coming in the wrong way that the fee to know our system how come it's so hard to get there and what are some of the ways that we could\nAsk if Congress would pass if they had to pass comprehensive\nImmigration reform with a pathway to citizenship\nFrankly there would've been resolution for so many of those folks that are here undocumented what would have happened is they would have gotten into within able to get online and they want to skip that anybody President Obama to save time and time again\nThey get in line behind those folks that are also waiting that are trying to do everything right do everything correctly here legally lawfully who also want us to to achieve the American dream and paying their citizenship and those folks that are documented what say any fines that were required with getting the back of the line behind those folks that are also waiting\nTo gain their citizenship and there would be subtle kind of pathway for these individuals\nOr get so many colonel correctly but then sell it to this broken system because our Congress has left the valor to address this issue and so one of the ways that the president well then President Obama tried to address immigration says Congress again dropped the ball\nOn Capitol comprehensive immigration reform what he says one who did the uh different access house that arrivals DACA\nOr this or that sort of that so it's I Know for some you know some didn't sit well but the truth was it was it was the bare minimum that the president can do could do without with Congress again when the un out and laughing the ballot to address immigration what he did with soccer was allow young people are dreamers\nThose numbers I've stopped you about it and the Germans are young people that were brought here\nThrough our fault of their own yes on ... minutes but if they let certain qualifications I submitted you know ... if they paid the fees uh you know they're in school or in the military or working full time or any ... sense\nThat they could be shielded temporarily field it for two years\nFrom any uh from any threat um deportation on that one of them getting a document as they possibly could again without any real solution for them says Congress when the justices broken immigration system\nGetting that document as they possibly could again without any real solutions to them since Congress well like I said broken immigration system\nRight and and the dreamers is it's interesting to me to hear some folks\nTalk so differently maybe due to a few years ago on a the dreamers situation for instance a governor Mike Huckabee is a good example I listen to him in his words to use the uses today and what do you use ... years ago when he was governor\nAnd he was saying we keep having laws to punish you for the students have your parents and that's exactly what are some people want to do when it comes to the dreamers correct\nYeah and it's unfortunate because like I think what they say you know setting up the paperwork that these ... and I can't remember\nAbout that and again the number is a society being an and making sure that they are in school I have a full titles out or in the military serving our country or any combination of things\nI mean these kids and the fact that they're doing everything they can to the to the law abiding\nCitizens again without the land I Pretend that become foreign citizens because I got to Congress or just to continue to find on the show and and I got to wipe out and I don't think that the rich are far\nMore I said today in a ... you know a few miles away from you in Milwaukee a you know it just down the road and all over here we have uh people are that have a team here and many of them are are you got ... agricultural jobs ... ... ...\nThat's right we have and I am so glad airline we're talking about my coming on the cell and I was happy to hear that you have a lot of folks in the agricultural industry that set listening ourselves argue that listen to radio station on I have had the pleasure the honor\nOf meetings so many ... uh during my time in the legislature never would have thought I Would have have I Would have the relationship with our agricultural industry that you know as a city girl ... outside of Milwaukee or are they have now with these folks and this and this industry at us and\nI'm In a part of Wisconsin ... I've seen the dairy state\nI have to have a relationship with as many folks that area and a stray and many farmers and they employ many of these Latino immigrants that I um I fight for every day in the legislature and farmers are the most pragmatic\nA tape on immigration here in our great state they've been my strongest allies and feels like drivers I focus on documenting immigrants and the like us I greatly appreciate the perspective of some are far less I'm so happy that some of them maybe let's let me let me right now\nI absolutely filing doubling down putting out these horrible anti immigrant anti like you know a ads because he's failing the desperation and feeling like he's losing the three electoral well\nYeah and one of the things the president you know I might have been you know\nCreating some fear on and and and they see this with his is baseless when my opinion because he talks about the caravan what he calls his the caravan I'm going to have you talked about being a second but he says ... and there's a Middle Eastern terrorists and then somebody asked them to give\nSome proof Renee why don't have any proof but it could be I mean come on how do you actually deal with somebody like that I mean you can't have an argument was somebody I can get anywhere if that's you know you don't have any proof and why don't you prove that but it could be\nYou know I could be a millionaire but I'm not sure I mean can you come on so the Caribbean or what is it when you hear him talk like he does what is it that people are missing or maybe the media Mrs when they report on it I just tell us what's going on there\n[noise] I you know honestly I [noise] I don't know what to think either the president I got to push his idea of um you know kids in journalists after putting fake nose\nAnd then he adds that certainly um they get an appetizer or I don't know church at all and I thought it was the goal of the fight in a car crash divide in our communities just like that's like Governor Walker's dealing with this latest political at\nTrying to divide a Latino Wisconsin I some German Wisconsin I some polish Wisconsin I when we were we should be you light it\nUm right now we should be proud of Armageddon\nOh let's see no Wisconsin I from German Wisconsin I some polish Wisconsin I when we when we should be you light is um right now we should be proud of our immigrant heritage and we shouldn't be lifting up the fastest growing demographic in the great state of Wisconsin which has truly what says are Latino community it and we want to be\nA part of you know woman into the fabric of society we want to be a part of this great state or ... just like the are immigrants uh neighbors and family before us so what the president is doing what Governor Walker is doing is that ...\nWell you keep talking about this than I guess I haven't seen it you know what ... what are we seeing in the sand that you don't like [noise]\nOh he refers to uh he um call folks illegal illegal he says\nThat his opponent is given special treatments ... legal\nUm and that he brings up actually a couple of those that I wasn't that I just mentioned gun yourself you're going to go\nBrings up my drivers car as a friend documented them and sell\nA as well as my tuition equity for Wisconsin dreamers those young people brought his fault of their own if they meet\nRequirements and ah can prove that they graduated from one of our last caller and has lived here that they can be in state tuition rates and uh he of course is twisting that twisting ponies a word the route ... words around the those issues and a flooding Wisconsin I said\nUm that Tony supports a as a given special ... legal and the entire thing is especially it offensive to me and you can imagine because those are the killer ... those are those that I authors I get off at ...\nAt least one of those bills is being supported by you you said Wisconsin Farm Bureau right\nOh yeah my driver it's the drivers card\nFront documented immigrants so ah that that has been supported by the de da de ...\nSays the farm bureau the firemen unions are again pragmatic immigration policy that these uh organizations\nAre supporting because it's because it's a public safety measure than the economic measure um it's going to it's it's good for farmers so that they can sustain their operations so\nUm and so it's again pragmatic or immigration policy and it's unfortunate that he's trying to use it to divide and conquer\nAll right well before I let you go and we're gonna have to have you back talk more about immigration I mean I Know that but let's talk a little bit about the elections you live in Milwaukee represent burning Milwaukee huh how do you see this election coming up in a boat a week from tomorrow\nI don't my goodness it's ... it's an exciting time right now I feel his statement in Milwaukee a I'm a little here a lot of ...\nMandela viruses are Democrat running for lieutenant governor we've been doing a lot of early vote rallies and um I feel the excitement but you know and\nI just I think it's close I think no matter I think it's going to be a plus or no matter what\nAnd it's about making sure that we get young people out to vote it's about making sure that uh I get my Latino constituency those folks if you're a U.S citizen I kept telling them you got the right to vote if you're a U.S citizen if you're Eighteen and older you got to head out\nAnd cast your vote and send that message to President Trump's that that you're not going to attack our community without without consequences\nUh and and it's about Mandela it out the African American vote across the great state of Wisconsin and and of course uh getting upset to make sure that Tony I'm In Dallas appeal to to everybody in our state and I I Hope that they will in the end but I think it's going to be closer no matter what\nNo you cannot vice president Joe Biden's coming in Milwaukee you tomorrow and you're going in\nAnd oh I Know that I wanted to attend and I\nI went last last week uh what is this past Friday President Obama was in town and I in Milwaukee and I did go to that one uh and it was great but I think that's a\nWay to stay and we just got how many days here now or are we are in the world yeah so I I Can't\nDo it unfortunately I pass on vice president Biden the fabric\nCome in handy now I'm not coming and going to show to do I get a job but I don't know where is he coming in Milwaukee\nOkay we're becoming in Milwaukee and there were well see we didn't we didn't print for this oh okay\nWhere one of the river Hong Kong local union labor house\nOkay but it's all about creating you know you see in Milwaukee we use do you can view it and that's\nThat's good news you know what I don't care what people were just bowed to what you hear that he said when you hear the constant well we're twenty percent voted ... percent didn't I didn't know what I Would be so happy and it would make everybody feel good if\nWe you know it was in the nineties or even God Forbid a hundred percent people voted least moon you know you have the right we will the people right\nNow what is that the wonderful and what we're trying to do right now Milwaukee is you know there's early loading all across the great state of Wisconsin voter early but in in Milwaukee particularly since\nThis is where my district is we're really trying to push the early voting get folks to early vote yesterday I helped a I spoke at an early vote flats party or in my district here next to one of our like little street library and just trying to get folks to come out and cast your vote early get it out of the way\nSo we're really hoping to get our number is up for a in terms of the early vote which is you know as early technically as early as person absentee voting\nCorrect June to some things you need to know about that if you're going to partake or you can do it in friday's last new you can do it\nI think five o'clock that night but a a ... for people living the township you want to check with your your tone clerk and make sure that you can make arrangements to do it uh but remember if you don't you can't vote in the weekend and you can't vote to Monday prior to the\nUh to the election which I really never understood\nBecause you know takes on a big chunk of money explains a lot of people in sales jobs or jobs where they gonna fly out to be this way and that and sometimes we don't know that they're going to have to until that friday or they get back on Monday and they're going to leave early Tuesday election day and then they came home\nI mean these are you just when you hear people say it's trying to disenfranchise the devoted that's what I'm Talking about\nUm exactly you know it didn't\nUsed to be the ... you know we got to keep the integrity I we get that I Know that you do too much you got to get one of the easy thing to do in this day and age where everybody's so busy\nThat you know you got to be able to find a way to make it happen and I find that most clerks all of them they want that's their mission in life to make sure everybody wants to ... gets a chance to\nShow some of the some of the U.S impartial ...\nSelected a life that we lead and it has been a clerk fairly clerks I'd really appreciate us there ... whatever their political stripes I found that they've always worked hard to adjust\nFairly cracks I really appreciate it they're sensing at whatever their political stripes I found that they are going to work hard to get access to the ballot\nSo did you early vote\nYes oh heck yeah I went with my alderman ah and leave early voted at least a\nYou know put it out on social media and let us know how easy it was that was great to get out of the way in hopes that people follow says\nWell yeah because you hear especially where you come from ... in Milwaukee you hear about long lines and and sometimes a whole set to stay open leaders and eight o'clock on election night and so this is an easy a and a way to to avoid all that right\nDefinitely and I'm always working hard and I guess I sort of ... are there is a hard a lower turnout in the fall and so I'm always working hard to try to set up ... um and it just struck the that's the way that that had to get involved in politics\nYou know they're fun to listen to I think that's my opinion not everybody when you're in um sometimes not so fun but I tell you what [noise] sports you gotta you gotta winner and loser I think you do in debates you got technique\nYou got ... got preparedness
