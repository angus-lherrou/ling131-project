I mean and then they start to speak when I knew they would have happened but of course I kind of antagonize to wear your tips\nAnd Andy that for three weeks without losing right\nAnd one of those losses a that they gave out was to uh they're below the gums right you know\nYeah so I mean listen it happens you know so I\nSpend a lot of second guessing and listen I tell you lose a game it's easier to second guess\nBut to sit here and hem and haw about how the ... should have done a lot of things differently at some point players have to execute and they didn't have enough guys execute the system that that was even police on Saturday to close out that game was the same system the brewers have used for a long time this year\nAnd if you weren't complaining about that as a fan when they're winning all those games I didn't want to hear people complain about it the one time that goes wrong\nYou know there's something that happens to pitchers in the mid major league baseball member like rural ... you started hitting the ball and there's been others too that are hitting the ball well the brewers have had that happened to you got to see it did you explain to see genes that when the pitcher hit that home run that you don't see that every day\nWell you mentioned that Andy because we wouldn't have gotten that bad it and we really weren't sure if he was going to get an app that actually I think that we're we're going to get a first step that uh put his daddy ever came up and we saw that he had a two fifty about eight average did have a home run already this year\nWe were joking about it quite frankly but to see in contact like bad against arguably one of the best pitchers in the national league and ... and it was a new out here\nIt's like it's just scrape the fence and got over the wall and that was a blast said he hit the right center field that was no doubt air and that was pretty cool to see\nYou really want to take that a challenge to end this idea of pitchers hitting home runs around allowed and we finally was he had to ah one was a double A. so he can in a in a single on Saturday or if you get to the world series boy that's really a pack and some punch\nI Hope we can do that a person first tonight to tell us who the starting pitchers earn your thoughts in tonight's game\nYeah your thoughts so you've got to see it on them out for the first day and he'll be going up against a Walker you aware of the Dodgers and it's been a at a really good year this year struggling this first post a postseason experience and that was game three in Atlanta\nBut I think the Dodgers are expected to perform much better day should point out the window is very strong in LA today and his blowing in I don't know if we'll see any home runs tonight at Dodger Stadium\nAnd where would you miss seeing your Dodger Stadium and the the uh have a pretty good crowd to really get into it I mean they've been there are enough is the excitement still there over in Los Angeles when their team makes it a new poll season\nThere there is a special\nUh yeah the Dodgers I think Andy led the major leagues in attendance this year I I Want to be wrong but they were near the top and he lives in the second largest city in the in the usa shouldn't hit a pretty good regular attendance\nBut there is something magical about the Dodgers and LA insured point out it is today I'm not mistaken is the thirty year anniversary\nOf one of the most famous home runs and I take that back\nTwenty five year anniversary today twenty five or thirty of white Kurt gifts and hit his a famous walk off home run against Dennis Eckersley expect to see that highlight tonight while you're watching the game\nNot only that here's my production expect to Kirk Gibson to throw up the first ball what do you think of that has to do [laughter] now you got to see someone special through all the ... first pitch at your game didn't ya\nYeah I'm ... throughout the pitch first pitch on uh on friday night\nI heard him talk about that on Saturday like going to ask me to do it I said yes you know like a you know he wanted to see really again and again but no I wanted to do everything I can for them to win or they live and let them take the Mike and the\nCall some of the game on Saturday on regular TV and it was pretty special I thought um so anyway so tonight uh wins Christian yell at you know to get into gear\nHopefully hopefully tonight you know\nIs it because they're not pitching to a machine or is just that he's a dip in the little on his own or what's the deal\nI think if you look at it that he's had some really good at bats which is styled awful lot of pitches\nHe just hasn't been able to get that big yet and and uh you know guys like that he has been so hot for so long listening took a um a couple of days and and didn't perform at the level he wanted to the first two games in Milwaukee will see only response he'll be in his whole\nWhole you know his his home town ah coming out tonight and the next three nights in a serious setback going again\nChristian yellow just for the Los Angeles area to\nYes those micro stock is as soon as abroad yes correct yeah\nSo let's hope that something happens there that would be nice um if you get to kick it in so anyway well I seen was moved to a PHD one he's a game three uh what do you think about is that a good thing that saved them now for this be a good guy to have when you when you get your personal ... game here\nShane their most consistent pitcher all year long for the brewers Andy pitched a very well in his playoff first playoff game and I have no problem with it a rowing him out I'm again as you noted earlier that Dodger officers very potent\nI have no problem with it and rolling him out again as you noted earlier that Dodger officers very and I you know make its pictures I mean it's cliche is the Appalachian Trail really good team and it's just a matter of um\nOn executing at this point and and the lawyers for the most part of the flames really good baseball they just didn't get in a while and off on Saturday to wrap up that way\nSo do you think we can see the chicken early or what do you\nThink they'll try to get probably seen if they could get through the standing and wouldn't be ideal here tonight\nOkay which totally now or in the manager's going to the news last weekend in your fans are your thoughts on that that was in the Michigan\nShirts you sound like Twitter feed on Saturday and I'm not but I made a reference for his hand all the makings of a\nBig problem for the badgers I'm In Michigan is outstanding defensively and and the managers um because of all injuries on me to be able to control the football\nAnd um and really work the clocks shorten the game the ball came early\nStruggles late and they have the makings of what can be a little while and just for the third time in all Chris or ten years ago she was saying the badgers it was like more than a category\nOh everybody saying oh ah yeah so where do we go from here you got\nSome other big story this morning\nWith casual flying Illinois and homeland Saturday twenty six point favorites um there'll be the last two weeks is the place Wisconsin is really struggled throughout their time\nAnd on top of it a couple of weeks or in about a month or so they're going to travel the kind of very good any lines clock and it's just trying to get some I mean that's the most notably an\nAirplane without starters on Saturday on the events which side of the fall and and that is just not very good right now\nI'm sure they were near the beginning of the nation and I'm like I said\nThis year the badgers right here in the\nFirst plane defensively I'm a football field if you keep putting too much pressure on your office are they happy perfect all the time stopped when a lot of football games are right now the managers are struggling on that even just the football and it's showing\nPackers or at home and I did see a people selling tickets like I've never seen before on social media\nAre and I ... I knew the game was in San Francisco that's a case anyway Packers or at home tonight a game time or is it about six o'clock hour broadcast time is at a five oh three\nAt five o'clock that I can read his five oh three right here on W. F. A. W. and if you're brewers fan and you wonder why I listen to them Bob euchre\nThat's going to be on cool one oh six point five at six o five hour broadcast time starts like first pitches around six thirty thirty five right around in there but that's the way to do it listen to euchre I as a they keep on chugging along sheen sparks ... said that they were lose\nThat was his prediction while I Can't go along with that\nI could do a lot of things but I just can't do that now a couple a times now in the program how we've had an Amber Alert and I want to just tell you a little bit more information about that\nFirst of all I think is one of the neatest things that we can expect those to come across our phones when you're listening to the radio that it does to ... what a great way to use the technology that we have\nI think it goes a long way it's it's so smart\nAnd I tip my hat to all those who are on top of it I don't mind being broken and on for information like that some
