number one back at this point and I'm telling you right now I'm not buying into debt Martin and we'll get into this little bit more in the next segment I'm not buying so much in the Doc Martin because this team\nIn terms of their talent is going the wrong way and I know that they seem to be looking ahead a year or two when they make that track to Vegas and they become the Las Vegas raiders I'm not buying\nThe raiders skilled players going in the right direction this year but there are two raiders this week that I really like and I do like a raiders running back this week don't get me wrong I Do really like a raiders running back but it is not dug Mart I'll tell you that coming up uh in the next segment Sony Michel may have dodged the huge bullet\n\nI Love stone even shell and James White these are two guys that have been like plug in place for me pretty much over the past what James White I Love James White as a flex he is my Ron Popeil he said it and forget it I'm putting him it was a flex especially the the PR there might not be a better\nPPO are focused running back then James White\nThere just I I Know the Christian McCaffrey anti girly and you know David Johnson and there are guys that catch the ball album era he's gotta catch the ball but you're going to put those guys and you're running backs bought in terms of using one if you got one ... a spot or to flex spots\nJames why does the guy that I absolutely love putting them in there but\nSony Michel no structural damage according to the uh the MRI he's considered a week to week James White is going to be the number one back\nIf they make a move for at least the the next couple of weeks I mean it might be can you barter might be the guy that might take a few now he's somebody that I I'm focusing on the waiver why this week he's actually one of my top claims this week just based on that off and they may even take a stab at my Gillis Lee they might bring back my guilt asleep\nIt's very possible that's a that's a

continue to be a big part of that often so the longer that way beyond belt holds out\nThe more I like James counter evil way beyond bill comes back\nI'm not convinced that the Steelers want him to be a big part of that often now he might be the more gifted player but Jane's counter has more than held his own as Pittsburgh to number one running back I'm not scared whatsoever when he gets back James

I Would say get through ... through a week and next week and I think if you can get through those two then you're going to play by ear and that will truly be five weeks and\nSo are we looking at maybe not being as effective as I mean with the way that he runs is this an injury that even if he plays he's going to be limited in some capacity\nA lot of it depends on whether there's actual structural actual integrity issues in the south internal stability if there's anything to do the issues like maybe nothing short of ... but it doesn't mean that he doesn't have some sort of\nIssue to one of the ligaments one of the Fort looking with us around with a nice coat and any time somebody has west ability around and try it can it can be a problem for sure and so he's a guy that relies a lot of strong legs any power back but he also there's a lot of things\nOut of the back of his lungs are catching passes and and that sort of thing so I I Would be a little bit concerned if he's back anywhere in the next two weeks I Would I Would be staying away from playing him and and wait and the kind of at the ... and putting first before you go back in your mind\nAll right let's move to the other side of the country and I feel like San Francisco they are completely snake bitten they last year beginning in the pre season and I feel like when you're a kid you hear that song ... children's season to season shows and shoulders knees into these until I feel like that's what we're talking about with\nMatt Brita because its knees and shoulders it seems like it's a little bit of everything he only played by snaps last week\nIs there any sort of a concern that these are lingering in and I mean is there something that we need to be concerned about I don't want to keep putting them in my line of Ziad if he's only going to get a handful of cherries\nYeah you know I'd be I I I go out in the women's day I think there's definitely some correlation between\nThe issues that he dealt with with his knee earlier in the year and now the ankle thing that you reactivated ankle to actually happen to the week before and the fact that he\nCame out and I'm basically the first series injured I didn't call over again it's not a great find four minutes and it indicates that maybe he's not being honest enough a buyout easily feeling because they they seem to the house you out of hand themselves that that he felt like\nRead it got through the week and you can can recover really well and it looked like during practice and I'm not sure if they just\n... we are wanting to be a warrior and a gamer and get out there and you kind of doing more harm than good at this point I'd be you know I'd be shocked if he plays this me it would not surprise me if it was a multi multi we kind of deal because of the fact that he re aggravated it you've got your body injuries and honestly I\nI challenge that I think he's the guy that we've talked about the most on this ... year so I think it's one of those things where you know stay away from here for now look look to other places and and really make sure that you can actually get back to practice but we'll we'll parts of Beijing and show it they're going to be able to laugh you know again\nIt was funny because it's just a a couple of weeks ago I think it was that game against the Packers that\nWe weren't sure if he was going to be able to plant looked like he came out of that with no problems whatsoever and then\nYou find out that he's struggling against the rams so you had to me I mean Russia the most or has shown a lot of really good promise so

mean they have a big thing yeah go ahead of me [noise]\nDo you think about the clippers so far I mean she she ain't\nBillions Alexander in that play defense like a ... you\nKnow he doesn't use a plane

environmental issues and uh it was sorely missed when he left a and a is a good guy a Spencer Black how ya doing Spencer how does a good night's Andy alright I'm going to have you because\nUh we got some things to talk over a is a candidate for governor Tony Uber's I sat down it looks like with other folks on the street journal and they got to talking about Foxconn and uh he said\nThat he wants to revisit the seat air permits issued to electronics maker Foxconn more it's ten billion dollar manufacturing manufacturing campus near wrists were seen and that goes on to talk about uh that uh there are some folks feel\nThere's a some pollutants that will be going on just from what they know from the outside looking in but is this a good thing\nFor him it should be review the you know I'm Foxconn has potentially a very polluting industry um you know are\nUnder ... walkers DNR is basically given them a path you know Walker has a limited and most of the scientists that are and those two that are there\nGet over written by the political appointees largely the ... with the campaign contributors want so in this case um [noise] they basically didn't really review the pollution adequately that Foxconn will be putting into the air that you and I and all your listeners brave\nWell yeah that's it or or ignore them and not enforce them yeah that's the kind of at Ninety four percent of the time he didn't enforce the water laws and sometimes even when he did um he\nGave his camp if there was a campaign contributor he just gave 'em a slap on the wrist so Abbott did enforce them sometimes when he was enforcement it was very weak\nActually what's happened is Walker has weakened regulations and it's a ... and these algae blooms while it's not the only cause\nHe's made the situation much worse each week and regulations that control shoreline development which leads to increase late contamination he's loud destruction of wetlands which are sort of the natural pollution control we have\nUm he's weakened the stewardship fund which protects the land um watersheds and then not only has he weekend what the states doing but when local governments want to step up and protect the lakes because they love people love the waters around them he has prohibited local government for taking measures to protect the lakes as well\nSo it's a list someone with a bad summer in terms of what a quality and our lakes says it rude some vacations\nAnd some nice days out on the summer and we only have a few of those and a lot of it is because Walker has been either not enforcing the law or getting rid of our water safeguards\nAnd as long as we're talking about this a new change regulations and high capacity well first of all your toes with those are and we're on a balance on those aren't we\nYeah high capacity wells are these wells ... hundred thousand gallons a day a lot of water and um [noise] we're used sometimes for industry sometimes for agriculture\nBut Walker is basically taken all controls off than we used to have some control to make sure that they didn't draw down the aquifer or the groundwater so much that um it would affect wells that it would affect\nRivers and lakes and in the central Sam's especially those that puts relations where they've pumped so much water\nThat works or just dry mean lakes that have been there are people out of the cabins around them they have their you know peers out in the cabinet in their peers out in the lake the only problem is no lake anymore um when I was still in the legislature as chair of the natural Resources Committee I took the committee up to see some of these things and it was\nIt was an incredible sight you know just the typical Wisconsin seen the cabins around the lake and the peers out there\nBut there's a lot harder to be seen and the reason is that because he's a well have pumped so much water\nThey've taken a the groundwater level down below the lake level now the problem now is getting worse and Walker instead of taking some controls has actually weaken the law and said that a state is not going to look at the cumulative impact of all this uh well drilling and letting\nPermits go to some of these big uh\nAnimal feeding operations that are really drawing down the water so much so that people's wells go dry the lakes go dry and even streams and rivers up there since ... things have gone dry\nYeah listen I you know you don't we can just sometimes turns into an argument between these big farms ... farm things like that but you know it's one of the sciences science right Spencer I mean we can't turn or the other we just say oh doesn't exist I don't see anything that's just going to make the problem worse right\nYou know you do for a long time and we had you know our natural resource policies governed by science and that's the way it should be and sometimes science comes to result that may not\nPlease you but you know use science to do a pretty good job of protecting the natural resources wasn't perfect but it was a pretty good job and we actually had national recognition\nAnd a lot of us because we did scientific base but Walker has basically fired all the scientists at the un are limited at the science division with the in our and uh has disregarded their advice that we've seen as a result it shouldn't surprise us and we have more pollution in the state\nThan our lakes are are have blue green algae to the front of lakes at the pump try because Walker\nHas taken the science out of environmental management and we really one of the things Tony ... who is it actually was a science teacher and has a college degree in science wants to do just put the science back in the in our so we can make these decisions about our natural resources and sometimes they're tough decisions\nBased on what the science tells us that what's best for the people the states who want to clean environment\nAll right well you a good segue you mentioned the his opponent\nTuna Uber's let's take a look at some of the polling that just came out from uh\nThe uh um Journal Sentinel in Milwaukee now Democrats are Tony ... and Tammy Baldwin are leaving their opponents in races for governor in US Senate according to a new poll released Wednesday ... has a three point lead over Governor Walker\nAmong likely voters in Baldwin leads a state Senate a senator or leave a nearby Fifteen points according to results reason a\nPoll conducted October twelve through the teeth on behalf of a a Thomson Reuters and the University of Virginia's Center for politics the online poll surveyed about ... living in Wisconsin the sample included about one thousand one hundred and Ninety three likely voters\nWith more democratic likely voters surveyed than Republicans or independents so they pointed out to be fair which meets me can conclude this race is going to be tight isn't it\nThat's absolutely right you know I've seen quite a few public polls I've seen that actually has some access to some private polls that haven't been published but they all say the same thing the thing is real close maybe even has the slightest to lead but it's going to come down to the wire and what it's going to come down to and the reason why these polls differ\nWho they think is going to vote that's really the key and he is you know when you take these polls they try to decide if someone's going to vote what the turnout to going to look like\nAnd um when the turnout is real bus from people get out and vote even has a big a pretty good lead in the polls when they assume that people are not going to get out and vote in large numbers and a Walker has either a slight lead or it's very close\nSo this is going to come out to turn out getting people out puzzles um and that's that's the bottom line it's got to be a close one and it really matters whether people exercise their patriotic American duty to vote or or just sit on their their backside and don't take a stand\nIn the Senate race between a Tammy Baldwin the incumbent and our former colleague in the assembly are in now is state senator who your audience on that one a\nWhile I think that one's not close um [noise] you know in the polls show that a fair it's pretty extreme I and people Wisconsin the kind of in the middle said Tammy Baldwin's you know as the person she's at a good job she's really been a fighter for the interests of the state when she's gone to Washington and uh\nThat'll fate Tammy Baldwin's you know as the person she's at a good job she's really a fight or for the interest of the state when she's gone to Washington\nAnd uh you know I personally likely but she's when it comes to ideology she's really far out there either very clean and that and I don't think people Wisconsin or accepting that and they kept me personally so that one is and close the governor's race I think it's got to be right down to the wire I can Senate race\nUnless something strange happens Tammy Baldwin's gotta win by a good barge\nAll right well the next ... look at in a while we do I want to bring up another aspect is always drove me nuts\nIs that when I take a look at the voting totals ... did the math you see that people would go into the voting booth in just vote for governor or just for president and then not go the rest of the way down the ballot in especially in the assembly races well this next race for attorney general is one of those races that doesn't get a lot of your play into\nA boss was a gentleman and there are are struggling with affect a lot of people don't know who they are uh and then of course is between the incumbent Republican incumbent to bridge ... and a Josh call the Democrat uh what can you tell us about this race of people ah why this is so important\nI think the Internet to get all this important because he's really the person who enforces the law you're talking about environmental laws well forgot to enforce some of the ... the department of natural resources makes a recommendation to the department of justice to go and forth the law\nAnd a and that is true of all I was with the opioid epidemic uh looking after what's happened with rape\nSituations or protecting the environment all these things the attorney general DeWine who it forces a loss for the state\nAnd uh the current attorney general has been very partisan he hasn't done a good job he didn't even adult life his his his agency can even analyze all these rape kits that are essential to finding out who the rapists are interesting from getting them off the street and they just sat in the lab and didn't get looked at\nA brash shovel instead of spending the money on that spend some money on and it's hard to believe he spent the money all these kind of personal items he printed very expensive coins was his name on him he was\nHe a all these kind of what you would call bowling type stuff to promote themselves instead of sending them money enforcing the law and get the rape is off the street and the child molesters off the street\nOr the parents are really good guy Josh call it's a federal prosecutor with the tough guy\nPut 'em gang members and drug dealers behind bars is also did a strong advocate for for voting rights and the right of people to vote he's a very strong um law enforcement guy and I think you can count on him to go in there and clean up the mess as a department of justice so\nYou at a ton of people that were that real happier Bradley Manning Machado and and I will tell you what it was very loud in that building because of that fact a but it was a fantastic out there and fortunately it was the wrong result died on Saturday Night\nWhat was the turning point in that game\nI think really the turning point and it was was the catch by by Taylor\nA in ... the bird at a chance to get the tying run across the board I think it would end up here than in and tailor make the driving cat ... probably what would have had at least the cattle and were tied the game the players sort of bad electric again the pressure goes back and let Dodgers\nAnd in doing that catches made by Taylor\nThe light and the energy that stadium was not exist\nRight has a heck of a catch to it wasn't just your\nCat yeah in a moment\nYou know when that occurred you could feel the editor taken out of the out of the video\nAnd and I was with a large group of people that I knew at the game and I looked at him including my wife and I said well hey we're okay we're okay\nWe hear about Iran and the next step in return we can't allow that momentum for the Dodgers they carry over in the next half any what happened the guy just going to lead off walk a base hit in the outfield ... ... it's a three run Homer on and quite frankly at that point when that occurred\nThere there was no energy left in that stadium I I think the fan who knew the players knew that this has come back at that point was what happened did not\nYou done to catch up ball what's the score than the ones that have changed\nThat has come back at that point was one one did not\nHave you done to catch up ball what's the score then that would change the score that moment in time\n[noise] so\nCheck one to lose you know\nAll right Shane you know ... we're going to do this we'll take a break and we'll be back more red afternoon\nSandy's
