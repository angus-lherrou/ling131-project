your word when you say long story short you are not getting\n... you know how many times I've been I've been asked about that because of how good the past but then the last decade are now are happy to have that down by\nOur ah down pat I see what you did there are people do people accused you of being a bandwagon than\nA hundred percent is not going to hear on the edge are bad and they asked me if I grew up in California that but yeah that the person that comes out of their mouth to make sure I I'm like oh you are white\nYou remember the Godzilla lack days I Do remember the tail end of a thought I was I thought I was going to get you I thought I was going to get you\nAlmost got me it was right around that high but you know what though came about\nOh I thought I was I thought I was going to get you I thought I was going to get you\nYou almost got me it was right around that time but you know what came about and then there's a lot of things are pretty much not as if that at that point\nOh I feel like I feel like Scooby Doo and the mystery machine I would've gotten if it wasn't for those dog gone Scott ... years\nOh let's get into some injuries here because I think going off the entire show it's it's kind of revolves around my being very upset about the lack of usage of running back when it comes to\nA you know a guy like an Alex Collins or can you drink or a Chris Carson and I and that's why I Want to start with Chris Carson he was a very late inactive\nSo we thought that was shot penny was going to be the guy and it ends up being Mike Davis who cares about Twenty one times over a hundred yards and a couple of touchdowns it's going to be a mess when Chris Carson comes back just Chris Carson get back on the field this week\nYeah you know it seemed like he wasn't terribly far off from playing this week but you're you're a hundred percent right it seems like the injury to cars and it'd be so much going to be a detriment at this point it's going to be the fact that they have all of these guys that they seem to like\nA little bit more than maybe they should we we kinda have heard about our city all off season that he was going to be the ... the other guys we're going to be cut up for forty and back then\nAnd then and then my thing is like if that comes out of nowhere and all of a sudden now we have a lot of money to black field so I think we have a pretty good chance of planning this week but I I just don't know if you're going to be able to talk of any of those three guys as even not even a flex option at this point 'cause you just don't know where the kittens are going to go\nYeah let's go to the Atlanta Falcons and a lot of us last volunteering Freeman early in that game and we won the Thursday night game so we lose our first or second round pick\nFor again what we thought was going to be just a couple of weeks it's ended up going on potential for weeks he was closer was an active last week we hear that he's closer again this week are we looking at the Monterey Freeman finally getting back on the field this weekend\nYeah I think there's a lot of positive optimism this week when he didn't set himself but he expects but it'd be back out there this week you know he'll need a little bit of time like you said it's been a few weeks\nLearning from time to get back on the fact that doesn't get back into shape but and you know I ... that going to be on a little bit of a limited now ... early on as well especially considering they have a competent back like Kevin Coleman is what time with him so there's no need for them to Russia\nBut I think why I'm like some of the other guys we're going to talk about it a little bit\nYou know they're making the right approach with him because I think they're thinking long term and I I think it's gonna be one of those things where you minimize the chances of re injury when you approach it but the way they have they've allowed him to take as much as possible to get close to a hundred percent at the can so I think you'll see a very rejuvenated a theme it because I think they did it the right way\nWell let's go to a team that has been criticized for maybe not doing the right way and that's Leonard for now you left that game I Believe it was in the first half with a re aggravation of hamstring strain\nHe's out for it sounds like a minimum of two weeks according to Adam chapters so it's going to be TJ yelled enough hopefully Corey grand 'cause I'm a big Corey Grant guy but how much of a problem is this going to be from Leonard for an ad in the jags not for the next few weeks but for the rest of the season\nI think it's going to be a big lingering issue depending on how they approach it I mean the fact that he was anywhere near you know report in the close to play in the first week after he's turning the hamstring I thought was the wrong and moving the first place I think if if you have any low grade to strain\nOf muscle like the hamstring if that's one of those things where you're not going to be able to play the next week and just doesn't happen that way because the thing about the hamstring is anytime you go into a Mac offspring\nThat required to life than\nA boat and whenever somebody is going into a sprint down at the knee and passionate assaulted strain is already either an over saturated carrying a muscle fibers\nBut just think about taking an area that's already irritated corn over scratch and how to pull and tug on it from both and over and over and over again as you run in ... so I I think I I I'm a comparison would be you know thinking about like a real sprayed\nSome more will vote you have an awful lot of the more it's going to be a little by little point finally gives way so I think this is one of those things where I get stuck with me a ... a week after I don't even think it's going to be two weeks I might get going to be closer to a four to five weeks after if I had to take a shot in the dark at it right now I just think anytime you have a\n[noise] you have a re injury of an area that that was important have the hamstring I think it's one of those things where he's going to be out for a little bit longer than just those two week I'd be shocked that goes back before that\nAre let's go to Minnesota where a lot of people are upset at the way the Galvin cook was used coming back from his hamstring strain for the Minnesota Vikings they had that short weeks he didn't play against buffalo he had a I Believe it was ten to Fifteen snap said he was any look good early on but then he was phased out of the game plan now the Vikings had a week and a half\nBefore they prepare to take on the Philadelphia Eagles delving cook where's he and his hamstring recovery\nHe in the middle East that himself he's not a hundred percent yet um but I think the fact that he didn't suffer any that fact is definitely a plus again I still don't think it's the greatest decision in the world the way through this type of injury but the dogs the bullet you didn't have any ... any reporters stepped back he just didn't really seem to have that same burst after after those those Kerry is actually but he got\nAnd exploit them this is not what we expect to see from him so\nI think a lot of times you're going to see if either some an athlete not going to be able to come to naturally lengthened their hamster and maybe because of pilots are some discomfort or some kinds of unconscious protective mechanism and then they don't want to they they know the down at the body's trying to protect the they don't want to allow us to lengthen the ankles strap on that area and so\nI think as long as he doesn't suffer any setbacks we're going to go each week like this little by little every week that goes by it will get better the more tiny for like you said it we can have\nA good amount of time for the rest of the week and we have probably not going to practice a time till the end of the week but I think it's I mean one of those things will get better every week long ago now except that\nHe's he had to do from the fantasy doctors you can follow him on Twitter at sea underscored digital ...

were guys who were flashes in the proverbial pan\nAnd Larry ... is still a plate so long ago you wonder you know what he would translate to say that people can talk about that\nOr we'll discuss that but basically he played a long time ago he was the only guy on this list though that made them all start teams and these were the greatest players some of the seven greatest players in the history\nAn

on SB Nation radio SB Nation radio\nDot com ... when I watch the Lakers are two things about the first things first let's start with a negative let's get that out of the way this team\nIs going to have to really rely\nOn she fell muggy and LeBron James to rebound and the ball I think to bill McGee is going to have a rather significant role on the team relative to what people were expecting of him coming in I I just don't think the team has enough rebounding outside of James and now the Julius Randall is God\nI just don't think they have enough rebounding to really make the plays that need to be made and I think as a result of al McGee is going to have a significant and important role in this team I don't think he's going to be an afterthought I really don't so\nSeeing Kyle who's ... play center and go with that all through small line up\nI Know it's only one game and I'm not ready to throw in the towel completely yet but I didn't like\nWhat I thought that the bad news the good

control the game a lot tell James where the play even\nAnd James is able to play off the ball and then you also able to put seems back on the ball and James really fed in Roman cruise a few times for

we uh we learned yesterday that um that uh the majority leader US Senator Fitzgerald\nWould be calling the Senate back into extraordinary session next month I'm obviously November twelfth after the election in ... in any event forty one hundred million dollar tax incentive package for Kimberley Clark\nAh you remember the background on this if this bill passed in the assembly way way back in February it part of an effort to retain five hundred jobs at two different plants in the Fox valley Kimberly Clark has indicated that the plants are going to be closed or any way so they are going to vote\nOr presumably will vote on that package in the Senate in November bought\n'em as you're aware there's been a lot of speculation as to whether the numbers where I get I get we're going to add up on this for a for the majority leader right now\nRight now Republicans have an Eighteen to Fifteen majority and the chamber of course those numbers wouldn't change following the elections as a field a lame duck session but\nA state senator\nAnd I want to make sure I have the right the right senator Dave Craig released a statement today\nOn the Kimberley Clark legislation\nAnd it's certainly a\nSounds like he he he opposes it here's a quote the Fox guy and this is getting compared to Foxconn ... are aware that Foxconn incentive package was an outlier in both scope and future opportunity for our state\nA clear bright line should be drawn between the extraordinary statewide impact Foxconn\nAnd future economic development policy if brought to a vote I Would not support the proposed Kimberly Clark tax incentive legislation again that's a state senator Dave Craig that would make him the third\nRepublican state senator to oppose this Kimberly Clark package Republicans have an Eighteen to Fifteen majority in the chamber so as of today\nDoesn't look like the numbers add up\nYeah and those are three are the ones that have publicly said anything uh there are those that are keeping their cards close to the vest and probably if we can help it aren't seeing how they would vote or seeing they haven't made up their mind so he could be more\nClear this is the Republican numbers don't add up right presumably senator Fitzgerald is going to be able to peel off some votes from send a Senate Democrats who uh who want to keep these jobs in Wisconsin\nRight and uh I haven't heard much talk from them either as to who's you know good with this or\nHave some concerns but it's interesting I was talking a little bit about the dynamic Bob I'm doing this after the election there'll be some folks a good chance of it any way that uh will win their reelection bid but they'll still be able to serve during this time of the vote\nIn ... that's a different dynamic to have\nA huge or indeed and that is who you know you lose senator that happens to or or in this case the assembly person because there are some folks that aren't running again I Believe like for instance in the Senate\nA senator Terry Malone he's not running again so he may be asked to or that's an example of someone who would be asked to vote on something like this he's way up\nIn the corner the state you know ... to ... falls or were in the end um so anyway a different dynamic for sure you don't see a lot of things getting scheduled during the time of after an election in to the end of the year before the new people show up in the old ones leave right\nIt's true you do not firing so is it ... this other build stuff that's happening now I have you heard is anybody talking about what those other bills might be a\nWell yesterday the Senate or the minority leader\nOr is she got Jennifer shelling suggestion that the the dark store legislation or should be taken up now I Confess I Am not by any stretch of the imagination an expert on the dark store legislation down I I've I've had it explained to me and I find it kind of confusing but\nA tax loophole right right\nAnd they want to close it ... the city's\nMunicipalities get really hard hit hard ah with this loophole existing I think you'll language from a long long time ago and some good lawyers as well because we're good maybe I don't know that that was the right word but Andy what's that skilled lawyer\nSkilled lawyers yes have found a way to be able to um avoid a paying their fair share in taxes some might say so yeah that's the ... believe me we talked a lot about that too and we get into that but I don't want to do that but that's what she wants to see is part of the package on\nA that was um I the suggest some that are that she put forward yesterday yeah as any other bills I Confess I'm I haven't been able to keep up with a with what other suggestions or have been put forward in terms of other bills that might come up in this uh this lame duck session\nThat might be her suggestion but she's not in control so uh that's all it could turn out to be\nOkay yeah I I just just crossed my email is a statement for homes senators shilling on what she's referring to in this statement as the Republican corporate\nBailout plan who um here's what she has to say about Republicans plants consider additional corporate tax breaks her words after the November sixth election\nQuote workers and the Fox valley and across Wisconsin have suffered as a result of Republican tax give away as both the state and federal level which unfairly benefit of large corporations and the wealthy having already canceled a previously scheduled to vote on the Kimberley Clark\nTax break bills that a president ... leader Fitzgerald are once again leaving workers in the lurch with no guarantee that a vote will ever be held on this bill\nAs Democrats look to protect local jobs and prevent further out sourcing we are committed to commonsense solution to the store tax fairness expand worker opportunities and create a level of economic playing field for all Wisconsin businesses\nSo\nHere's another idea I it's not supposed to work this way but sometimes you have a you know you want my vote for this Kimberly Clark thing I really like this bill here and I'd like to see this you to be in the sun so\nTimes if a you know you want my vote for this Kimberly Clark thing I really like this bill here and I'd like to see this get it to be in the sun so that got his knee in the sun maybe I could be you know come around to your way of thinking and another bill and uh maybe that's why there's a package now\nYeah so um well the I I did this I guess if I if I interpret this correctly leaves the door open for some Democrats joined Republicans in getting this thing pass\nWell according to her press release or the way I read it does she's not in favor of it no\nAnd she's the leader so\nThat you know that's not just your regular or a a a minority senator or so but that doesn't mean that to someone who couldn't vote for it you know and I'm trying to wrap my brain is to folks that serve up there and one of them is a senator Dave Hansen is he is he said how he feels about this\nI have not heard a statement for senator handsome and and you know I mean ... obviously you know and and I know that are more and more we're seeing it here and to what the leadership\nOne on on both so crossing the line is you know becomes less and less common but I'm On something like this I don't know maybe the minority\nLeader is leaving some wiggle room for members of her career members who who may want to see this happening\nYeah into a speaker said something interesting you said\nThe un quote now I Do not want to have these be a rare I Want I Do want to have these be a rare circumstance that should not be something that happens on a regular basis of course I support Foxconn\nBecause I think it's in a transformational a and I supported the Kimberley Clark mail because I Believe that gives the best opportunity to retain an awful lot of good paying jobs and their suppliers so\nYou know he he doesn't want us to be a regular thing but you know if it keeps happening it certainly isn't that the definition of it being a regular thing\nYes that that would make it a regular thing up I guess we'll just have to do so much else and he will just have to wait and see\nYeah All right well ah one thing I'm waiting for is the ... start playing baseball again tomorrow you can hear it on W. W. your thoughts on the brewers making it to to post season play\nI Am a I'm pretty stoke I'm pretty happy\nI really I really am um I was watching um the the tie breaker Graham ... I mean you know I hear I was also I was also working of course but I Oh absolutely I I did have the tie breaker game on here are listening to you do the the the call of the final put out that was a that was gold man that's great stuff\nAnd they definitely don't want to commit before the election because they're hearing around the state they're hearing that people are not happy with the ex con deal so they want to wait till they say\nYou know the answer to the election they won again it they want they don't have to vote for it but so\nThere are there waiting till they say they don't want to become another issue like Fox\nAnd you know they don't know what's gonna happen in the election said it may be they may have sailing after the election so they may not so they don't have to commit right now\nThey just say this you know we might do this and and uh we're planning on doing this and that sounds good it sounds good baby for campaigning for Walker to say I'm going to help Kimberly Clark stay here but\nIt all like it might be kind of limited geographically I don't know\nUh there there are also you don't usually keeping the door crack a both leaders in both houses to pick up other bills or what do you think those bills might be\nSo he had to start thinking it's going to be\nWell it's going to I think that it's going to be perhaps a lot of unpopular things but they think they can get through and nobody's paying attention against people will be so wiped out from from the election but um\nI I think the whole issue of structuring a our health insurance determine whether or not we're going to a cover pre existing condition and whether or not people are going to get any health insurance to Patrick care how we're going to restructure that I I\nI don't know I Am starting to think what else what else\nAnd whether or not people are going to get any health insurance to Patrick care how we're going to settle restructure that I I I don't know I Am starting to think what ... what am I missing 'em they sense so much destruction\nAlready I I'm trying to think what what did they not get through all\nThat yeah I mean I leadership ... news mentioned she'd like to see the dark store legislation be oh very\nGood very good men cynic that because it ... the ... are crying for that to be a a giraffe and said hey Republicans support it and stuff\nYou know that that should have been taken care of I don't know if that's going to see on the agenda because there's big money opposing that bill\nMarr a a let's switch gears only a couple of minutes I wanted to ask you about ah the judge Kavanaugh I'm a confirmation\nHearings the accuser of a sexual misconduct years ago a on a judge cabin on when he was in high school or what are your thoughts on this whole mess trees\nWell I as I said last time we talked about this I Wish people at all with also focus on this or that neither I'm the guy last he you know and he he can't afford to to do that he sees not supposed to uh start crying and blame the other guy blamed the Democrat\nSaid the people are out to get 'em et cetera et cetera up that\nYou know the guy needs to keep his cool I'm\nA you know the what Trump\nHe was speaking to say first of all in his face is the true believers that that\nHave been excusing all of this behavior all along because they they they like his demeanor they like his tough talk\nUm and and then there's the evangelicals who think that he is going to get them certain things that they want to and so they can ignore in you know his\nIndiscretion when it comes to women but\nYou know he's got a sense of entitlement and be that interesting I Can't remember what was said about him in terms of the Miss America pageant that he would walk it the dressing rooms and because he owns the thing he felt he could walk in and he could see them all make it as they changed their cost of\nA an ... you know this guy has a sense of entitlement and we you know the the the Republicans keep supporting it\nThey say they don't like it they can damage remark but they support they support him they keep them propped up they cover up for his mistakes as best they can and stuff you know\nIt's got to he had he doesn't have an attitude that women are deserving a risk that\nFire last duty at a rally owning your school some of the statements he made\nTo just take a he said that the only reason voted Democrat is if you're tired of waiting are you tired of winning trees\nWell you know ah maybe why\nHe once again the cuts that new one um in terms of this understanding of things we you know he's got his new NAFTA or whatever but some of the comments that were made was well we know this guy is crazy and we had to get what we could get\nWe'll work on other things but you know sort of like you don't want to rock the boat with him because you don't know uh what is going to do that for them to present it so\nI ... you know I'm the man is not I'm not in his right mind\nOne more when they get in before we go ah you said this um I Want you to make heads or tails is for me uh I'm not on the ballot but in a certain way I'm On the ballot what's he saying they're\nWell it it he knows that the answer is people are going to live or die ... politicians they're going to live or die by whether that they support Trump and I think a lot of politics\nPoliticians even the was supporting him are very worried about whether that it does help or hurt it might help is part of their district and died and another part so I'm not sure both of them know how to play it\nWell if he has yet because he has up you know he he is I don't know what to say\n[laughter] I Know well and you know the whole idea is I don't know how well how many ... both to tell you were at a time and I don't want him this but I'm going to end this [laughter]\nYeah\nYeah I I think everybody including Republican thing that would happen is going to\nBe a a like you know it is going to tell us what the public really thinks about Donald Trump or anything so it is a referendum on trial and he has been told that I don't think he had to dance that necessarily\nBut he's been told that it is so he's he's kinda he kinda gets it\nAll right kinda very well thanks so much trees thank you very much to talk to you next week not a good weekend barrio by let's\nSee representative three Brazil when we return

there were only six teams in the entire AFC that have over a hundred points for and the north have over a hundred\n\nIn the NFC there are six teams that have over a hundred points three of them are in the NFC South\n\nThe fame the box and the falcons are all over a hundred the bears are over a hundred who would have thought the bears it'd be scoring points\nAt like twenty six again\nThe forty

there are still scoring\nThe bills have a bad off ants of line but they've just got a bad\nTeam or there's not a whole lot they direct\nBut we're seeing more storing in the NFL in in relation to

actually liked defense I liked the hitting\nSo you like the what was it in the nine six titans jaguars game oh no that was that was the game of the week huh\nThat that game was atrocious\nBut I still like to see defense or if you've got to be able to play defense and dies be allowed to make kids you know I like to see sacking the quarterback not be a penalty\n\nYou know I like to see team score on off ants because they're playing great off and it's not because of cheesy penalties or stuff like that\nNot because the other teams defenses ferocious when there were some teams that are so beat up
