I Do think it's funny what everyone's like oh what if all five of these teams go undefeated that's not\nHow we always say every week since that that it never ...\nYeah you're you're better off honestly the better chance of becoming pope then that happened and\nI only have one last teen or five one last teens who can make a legitimate case between the exactly\nLike and just I'll give you a factoid from uh the past college football playoff years every year uh since the playoffs started\nUh there's only been one or ... one undefeated team every year and last year there was no there was one and twenty fourteen or Florida State one and twenty fifth in Clemson one inch waist sixteen Alabama and everybody had a last last year so\nSo you're going to get one if you're lucky to ... times not\nAnd that's why I don't really want and that's why I think to me I was like oh what did they ever comes to Notre Dame all on the table I think than going to happen I think Notre Dame is going to lose at some point I Know you're Notre Dame fan jail but I think\nThey can change the fact that they're not that good\nYeah I think North West think it'd be a tricky game for them as well with the way they put it gets it's not part of that is and\nI Know our phone it broke and it was kind of anti gay and Wisconsin is overrated which is I've been on that train for the longest\nTime he I haven't I believed in them coming in and well as usual they've made a fool out of me\nThey ... they had a week scheduled to see in the daytime west will not great is way improved from last year and a Chinese is still solid so you're seeing them kind of get exposed and remember they didn't play any tough road games last year either like they didn't put any road came with a winning record now yeah it's different when you have to go at Penn State at Michigan\nOr at Northwestern so it's it's not the same cupcake scheduled they had last year a but they are getting back to the point\nIt will be interesting though like\nI think Notre Dame is going to drop one at some point\nIt takes them out of the race because none of their own doing but the way the schedule plays out and they can't afford one wall\nAnd not to sound like you're seeing a couple for something as well you know Ohio said some of their winds won't stack up yeah but a some of the ones could be risen up you know depending on what some of these teams right\nAnd I read a lot of football on the plane beat they have Michigan who was only getting better and the big tent title game which could be a one or two last Iowa team right now is what most looks like\nSo even though some of Ohio state's lost his wings are kind of man they still have some very good games I had himself Notre Dame is like is there and like there's not only are their losses worse but their their schedule going forward\nIs where did you say north western might be the top of the same lot cause us the northwestern Syracuse exactly ...\nI like diving Syracuse can be a dangerous thing we saw what they did against Clemson a blight whichever Lawrence missing some of the time of night game but\nI mean it's possible northwestern with the way past ... has coached them up this year and the quarterback play they're getting that might be the toughest games on because it's not us see on the road we all thought that would be all that that can be a place that's about it they are getting crushed by Arizona State right now and that's another subject and you know can claim to be done stand\nThey could be it could be I Know they're on their

Cooper has fallen off\nIs it fair I guess had a quick glance but I think that it's sincerely needing contacts government as you mentioned it's been a really rough running for everybody in Oakland but last year and a half\nUm but I mean the other shoe was\nI mean the guy who have left to you know though plus four times in the last ten games with a less painful issue um so that ankles and giving them problems or he's had a couple of concussions pages that on a couple of weeks ago here in Seattle He at one week twelve last year against Denver\nUm so I think the context of what could have possibly been giving him problems over the last year and a half as important [noise] um because I think when he's on top of the game he's one of the better received a ... I think here the true number one ah you know when you talk about\nIt given them a threat here in Dallas uh he's had to he had to one hundred yard receiving games last month against the Broncos I'm against the browns that's more than all of Dallas's receivers combined to have happened the last year a and so he's a you know I'll take that all laid off for\nThat you know a\nSort of down slide and talent for a memorial Cooper if it means that I get that type of production at minimum here in Dallas which is something they desperately need right now but\nYeah I think he's going to make things a lot easier for everybody hill command doubled themes um and I think that'll you know free up the box a little bit more ... ah Michael Gallup their third round pick has\nBeen playing a lot better recently he's coming coming into his own they'll give them the chance to just come into his own as the number two rather than the\nThrust into the focus has a number one receiver a cold easily starting to turn it on so I I think that all of a sudden you're looking at ... dies stepping up in the receiver core and then adding I'm Ari Cooper to that\nAnd ... Prescott seemingly starting to get his footing and under him a little bit more in these last few weeks that and I think that the the cowboys are\nIn a good spot with Cooper\nAnd the team pointed out multiple times this week I mean he's you know they they were going to take a receiver with our first round pick your next year so would you rather take a receiver and a bit of a light draft up the top with their first round pick next year just use the first round pick on the twenty four year old with a year and a half of control left who spent the to quote walls already\nVery good point now let me ask you this and and again it do you truly see I'm Ari Cooper as an elite level receiver and a number one receive\nYes absolutely because I mean that's what he he's a guy that I I'm just when he was out of practice on a Wednesday or Tuesday of this week\nUh we got a chance to kind of be out there Tuesday Wednesday watching practice and a on Wednesday I mean when he was out there and and you just saw him going through the simple drills\nHe by far the best looking receiver their practice a I mean just as an ability to\nDrop his weight was caught his change of direction skill or as the middle of the the kind of find soft spot in traffic or he does have some trough but that's usually the amount of him trying to do too much time trying to get up she'll and\nUh you know make a play happen before he brought it all the way in\nThat he he's not the type of you know going to drop attaching you know traffic because you know he's a he's not a\nGood traffic receiver it's about anything like that he he's very good with us under a blanket on and he's very good on\nSlant on you know it curls on doing anything you want to I I I don't know that there's about a receiver in the NFL running the the uh slant and go I I mean he's fantastic at it and uh yeah I mean there's a reason he was the number for all that just four years ago so I I think the cowboys who were\nSincerely considering ... in the first round this past year you know they\nThink he's going to be twenty four at the end of the fear Ridley is\nSo you basically got a guy with for years experience who's only six months older than Ridley uh and it's kind of proven that already now and you're receiving a call\nNow you know ... and ... and let me ask you this and we touched on it a little bit in the earlier question but\nWhat a true no more ... you said you know in your mind is the true number one in elite receiving and what those receivers due\nFor everybody else I guess the best analogy you can make\nHitting a stood closer to a bull pen where everybody's miss cast in their roles in letting them move back a spot\nAny eater huge help to these other receivers with them Ari Cooper handling those doubles teams as you talked about all the sudden colds easily can be the slot receiver and he's in single coverage Michael Gallup can develop\nIts cetera et cetera and all of a sudden these guys just have to go out and when one on one they don't have to deal with double teams and that's where we can deal with that and when very often despite being doubled team in having covered shaded towards him\nYeah which is up and that's been the big complaint from a lot of people here in Dallas\nFor a long time has been that it's not a scheme that you know it's not Sean McVeigh scheme it's not Andy Reid scheme it's not you know developed in order to\nYou know let's take advantage of this formation or or this look let's put this guy in this position and we will scheme ... but not as not Dallas the system at all Dallas's system\nRequires you to simply beat them in front of you and for you know the last year and a half the cowboys really haven't had a lot of guys who can just\nBeat the man in front of them are the only guy who really consistently code was Colby and that's why he had a bit of a down your last year is because they said All right let's stick a linebacker shade of safety over here kind of doubled him up take him away and then there'll be nothing else\nAnd that's why you think a lot of struggles but yeah when they dropped the Michael Gallup he's starting to come and he's on he's the guy who can be single coverage so he's been able to reap the benefits of that a little bit but things have started paying\nDrop to Michael Gallup she's starting to come and he's on he's the guy who can be single coverage so he's been able to reap the benefits of that a little bit but things have started paying him a little bit more tense and that will take that away from him because Cooper ... he died um and then a system that really still is kind of the\nOlder west coast off an awful lot of you know plants and curls and quick heroes and things like that ah I I mean Cooper's a guy who can really impact the game for them from that standpoint here's a guy who can take a slant and go the extra Fifteen twenty yards after that he's not going to\nHave got what they have the same so frequently he's not going to come back home to curl cats and two yards short of a stack and you know be wrapped up there he will fight through he will pick up that first down he'll keep drives alive I mean it's really a game changer for they're often the cowboys\nSpiked I think even the beliefs of some cowboys fans with the cowboys so\nSincerely committed to back press Scott for the long term at this point I I think it was really important to get somebody in here who could be a legitimate weapon for him down the stretch and then into next year\nAll the other guy slide into spots that make them that much\nBetter
