day after the Marquette law school poll comes out and as you may know the law Marquette law school poll is what they refer to as the gold standard when it comes to election polls in the state of Wisconsin\nThat's the one that I feel it gets it right and you hear a lot of people say it's a right leaning outfit or a left leaning outfit I've heard of both which means what tells me that there must be doing a pretty good job so that's a good to be on Thursday Charles Franklin is a delightful guy a real happy guy\nAnd I'm I'm lucky to have 'em and that'll be on Thursday oh back to tomorrow's show of are also going to have a David newbie on David ... was uh the uh\nUh for president of the NFL CIA oh here in Wisconsin and now he uh is a guy who is a a a a a fellow who tracks of the fair trade deals are wants them to be fair you know these trade deals with a World Trade deals like a NAFTA and or\nOthers uh the he he looks at him and uh it takes a look at what's going on and so we better understand the intricacies of what these uh what this summer called fair trade deals are they really so farewell he doesn't seem to think so but he's taken a look\nAt what a President Trump wants to do to NAFTA and us switch things around and I didn't talk to a last week with the\nUnited States senator Tammy Baldwin and she like some of the things\nThat got switched around but the ... and David nobody really gets his hands dirty on this and I'm really excited to talk to him tomorrow maybe on tomorrow's program and he's going to help us better understand what may or may not be in this thing and things you gotta watch out for and trade deals especially with President Trump\nIs he may say some things but they're not written in the deal\nAnd so right there you got to make sure that some of the rhetoric that he uses a if you like it\nShould be in the deal itself and and that doesn't always happen so right away I that's one of the things that I'll be asking a David movie about tomorrow and then on friday let's skip ahead or to friday or I'm going to talk with the speaker of the assembly my former colleague on the Republican side a Robin boss\nThe gentleman from Rochester Wisconsin and we're going to talk about the Marquette law school pool I'm hoping to get a word and hence the leader on the Democratic side on as well and we'll talk to him about the takeaways we don't know whether they are we don't know what they're going to be with no tomorrow\nNo I think this is going to be a revealed over the noon hour tomorrow and so we'll be able to talk about it tomorrow afternoon and then we'll talk to these fellows later on in the week hopefully I Do have a speaker boss already nailed down for a friday show so that's what we're hoping to do and then I have a bug my buddy a\nDamned needles to from channel twelve sports he came on once and then remember if you listen to that I made a heavy asked\nAlmost was uh I'm ashamed of it or to to get him to come on again and ah what we're going to give it a shot and I think we're going to get him to the reason I Want to talk to him they call them rain man because he knows everything about sports\nAny trivia question the guy knows the answer to I mean no matter how obscure it is and then he not only that he'll he'll if you ask him a question about\nAh what was ah you know what was the average of somebody uh you know way back when he'll tell\nYou the date and sometimes the month of when that happened narrows it down who keeps that stuff in there he had a heat us and so hopefully he'll be joining us before the week is out but making headlines today and this does it did come out of nowhere\nAnd I mean it really did a Nikki Haley is resigning as US ambassador to the United nations and the timing it does raise eyebrows reading now from the Washington Post\nAnd you know let's be fair uh you know ... posts come and go and people who hold them in the administration's ... and all presidents just seems like this president had a lot of people that do take off after a certain amount of time and then some of them get a little mouthy after they've left\nAnd they give Gary Cohen who is in the administration for Trump\nAnd ah he's a shooting in their mouth off but uh Nick he's you know a nice city and I said it's awesome clips and you've heard him to at the top the ... in the news but President Trump and Haley held a quickly were arranged a media it'd be a liability Tuesday Morning in the White House shortly after\nThe news was broke of her impending exit Hayley said her resignation was simply about needing a break after six years is South Carolina governor I said North Carolina and I started I was I had a fifty fifty shot South Carolina governor and two at the United nations and Trump inhaling even previewed previewed a desire to leave\nAs long as six months ago\nUh the two were obviously eager to downplay the idea that it was done\nIn haste but if it wasn't that might make the time you have an otter if this was long planned it was apparently one of the best kept secrets in a very leaky White House is worried leaky a word\nI don't know I've never heard of before anyway and the news reported nurture usually talking about pipes when you use that anyway the news reported blindsided those in the foreign policy establishment but White House in even members of Haley\nStaff were caught off guard\nNikki Haley's exit is due to a new at the end of the year which means she'll be around for as much as twelve more weeks but she in the White House chose to announce this four weeks before the twenty Eighteen election but White House is effectively announcing the exit of its most\nPopular cabinet official and I have to agree with that\nShe certainly is very well spoken she knows a thing or two and articulate the stance very well you know some people dance around she seems to be a little more boiled with which how she feels and has in a in a ... at times\nMildly a taken some shots at the president's some criticism extremely rare won or who is strong approval among the Republicans and Democrats\nJust before voters vote apart from perhaps in the defense secretary James Mattis nobody is seen as being such a steady influence in the ... we all bleed administration as Hayley is\nNow the breaking news also comes as Trump and Republicans appear to be on the front foot\nIt comes to the aftermath of Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation Republican enthusiasm is up and a pool late Monday even suggested that independence viewed Democrats action surroundings\nCourt confirmation Republican enthusiasm is up and a pool late Monday even suggested that independence viewed Democrats actions surrounding Kavanaugh are more\nMore dimly than Republicans all the a GOP here to clear interest in keeping things folk to focus on Kavanaugh and yet the White House inserted this uh the morning after Kavanaugh's ceremonial swearing in he is also the first major\nAdministration exit since the anonymous New York times op ed oh here it is\nIn a which are are still unknown senior administration official talked about how officials were working to check Trump's impulses and even undermine him in certain ways\nHaley's name quickly rose to the top when it came to a potential authors of this op ed and giving her well established independence with in the administration but she issued perhaps the strongest rebuke\nOf the author in an op ed or her own\nThe timing is also I had given a headline that popped up just a day before the announcement of Washington walks the watchdog group citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington New one to me\nAnd the acronym his crew oh boy clever uh called for an investigation into her use of private travel [noise]\nOh okay All right on the government's dime\nAnd boy that's been done a lot in this administration is she looks like she was next now we don't know whether there's anything ah going on but resigning so shortly after such a headline drops wouldn't seem to be optimal\nEspecially given that simmer all similar ethics allegations took down cabinet officials such as Tom Price and Scott Pruitt\nNow a couple of ... or ... resignation letter is needed October\nThird which would put it before the above allegations became public but the\nWhite House hasn't always been totally accurate whether it's dates bears noting that up but the date does coincide with when Haley met with Trump in person was also a day after Trump mocked Christine Blasey Ford at a rally though there is no indication that this had anything to do with Haley's departure\nNow representative of Mark Sanford a you know he's the one that got a it was a Republican who voted off the island or early on here because he was criticizing President Trump\nHe read that story and other ideas with MSNBC shortly after he leaves resignation Sanford a fellow former South Carolina Governor who's been allies with Hayley in the past but is now in in administration critic\nSet of the story something doesn't smell right\nSomething is weird\nCan you a lake in this to anything else we've gone through and they're predicting\nSince uh you know back in the nineties when a lot of the Yahoo's and things like that there was a tipping point to all those the Internet to 'em sock say world there is this kind of like then or are not\nWell I Will tell you that I I was trading back in the late nineties and a mid to late nineties and I saw people go bankrupt go broke in front of my very eyes shortening the Japanese Nikkei\nAnd then shorting stocks Qualcomm and Yahoo that we had price to earnings ratio of an affinity\nAnd they're they're only they're only rationale behind doing that was hey it shouldn't be priced it's high it's it's it's the rational well you know there's a thing but Jesse Livermore\nThe market could remain irrational far longer than you can remain liquid so yeah the market can do anything at all in one prices the final arbiter as they say\nSo whatever any whenever any analyst opinion is about where things should be priced or what the proper evaluation it it all means nothing it's a free market and the market dictates where it goes\nWhat we do know is that there are economic cycle that always re assert themselves and we have been in a artificially depressing interest rate environment for the past Twenty years\nAnd this is very very unusual ah that we've had interest rates low for this long and well we may be seeing the result of that is the market is in the economy has heated up and revved up so much really for the two thousand Thirteen on word a vet the fence\nThis is the market is in the economy has heated up and revved up so much relief from two thousand Thirteen on words\nA vast the fed maybe slightly behind the curve at this point and they're a little bit embarrassed to admit it but they're going to keep raising rates at a measured a at a metric pace to try to not fall too far behind the curve\nA lot of people make predictions in the stock market Morgan Stanley ... new book are the ones you need talk you listen\nOutlook all analyst at the same to me you know they're all they're all paid they're all paid henchmen for that company you know they all make the I'll make tons of money they they don't deserve to make because they're not they're not traders ... they don't put their neck on the line every day like I Do all all they do is sit back and look at some charts and\nA crunch the numbers and come up with their opinions that's a great job if anyone's out there listening I Love to have that job or you know everyone's opinion is just added gets their opinion is there's some validity to it yeah I mean Morgan Stanley is a\nIs a is a heavy weight in the business of Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley those those are the biggest names\nUm so you always have to listen to what they say but uh if you go back and look at the success rate of a lot of uh analysts calls they don't they don't have a very good track record so you always have to look at what they say with a grain of salt and your own independent research that that's the one thing I have to stress more than anything\nIs don't listen to your financial advisor one hundred percent do your own independent research\nAnd come to your own conclusions use your financial advisor or you know analysts opinions as a guide but make your own decisions ultimately\nWill let me ask you to get through to near before we see it again and we just use for me this new criticism and we're not we're going to do what would you tell your next door neighbor do you do to prepare for this\nWell I I think one thing that's important to take a look at it at your accounts whether you have four one K. is that you don't look at it very much or you have a\nYou know depending on your investment profile is take a look at what your accounts have done in the past five years six years seven years kind of look at what they're trend has banned and there's nothing wrong you know no one ever went broke taking profits so don't be greedy don't try to get out\nRight at the last minute or when the market tops because there's usually a stampede for the exits and I can assure you you're not going to get out at the top even professionals like myself don't get a get out the top so you have to you have to face out of your property positions\nIf you want to time the market do so judiciously\nTake profits off the table limit your exposure\nTo the markets that twenty six thousand I think we can still go a little bit higher into next year maybe go to twenty eight twenty nine thousand but I think our upside is kept somewhere between twenty eight twenty nine thousand maybe we have another seven percent on the upside it's not worth risking all of the profits that you know accumulated for the past\nEight nine ... years you've been invested don't let those all slip away because they slip away very quickly when the markets or\nMake no mistake you use it to the wall street lakes or maybe even lose our prisons they\n[laughter] they they love the deregulation they they love the fact that at all when Gary Cohn came in with with Donald Trump or they instituted a Wall Street friendly agenda where they ... they rolled back decades of regulations are so all the wall street banks\nCan it's the wild west again a lending regulations were were were scaled down a Glass Steagall I mean is whichever one you want to talk about there are countless regulations that would roll back and they're still attempting to do it and of course in\nThose who've heard us talk about it in the weeks before when the G O P tax bill passed\nThere was about three trillion dollars of corporate profits that were\nUh held overseas or that those international come on international firms want it to repatriate back to the u._s. but they just want to pay the corporate tax rate well you know Trump and company effectively lowered that corporate tax rate on that money down to about eight percent\nSo that's three trillion dollars has been filtering back into their coffers over the past several months\nAnd yeah Wall Street's their bonuses are all time highs\nAre the guys are just rolling around and money it's never been better that's never been better I mean is it there's anyone who tells you that\nAh that Wall Street is not doing as well as a dead it's it's never been doing better than it is today and\nSadly that's about the only segment of the economy that you could look at where you can say wow a you know earnings are up big well there are big at Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley and bank of America ah it's sad that we are sort of gauging the success of our\nNational economy based on what the billionaires are are making in what those multibillion dollar firms are doing and that's not that's not really indicative of what the middle America is experiencing\nReading your writing reading between the lines you're also seeing the Syrians good chance of being a sequel to the movie the big short\n[laughter] well [laughter] you know [laughter] we we all we all do technical research and we all think we're smart with all the you know all the computer programs we have and all of the animal it or the analysis\nThat we throw at it you know we're always trying to be ahead of the curve and there are tens of thousands of\nProprietary hedge funds out there who are running their own software and they have their own programmers and it's kind of spy versus spy everyone's trying to look for the clues that the markets ready to turn well I don't see those clues yes I I still think there's going to be a fuse\nShoes that have to drop first for instance I think there's a lot of untapped equity in people's homes are that they're going to you know that's one sign that I look at towards the end of a trend when\nWhen the personal uh when personal debts goes up to an unsustainable levels and people have tapped into all of them all of the resources and all of the equities that they can I don't think we've seen that happening I think the numbers don't indicated so I'm not worried about\nSomething going catastrophic Lee wrong like we saw in two thousand eight I'm I'm not I don't think the market is going to collapse overnight and and the you know the monetary system is going to need to be bailed out that those were extremely extraordinary times\nAnd I'm really you know when Obama took office and and the people came in the shore up the uh the the monetary system in the Institute is also a lot of rules and regulations and you see the effect of it the the economy has grown at a measured pace\nAnd uh the fundamentals have been very very strong of course Trump is you know the first person to ... the current strength of the economy is due to him I'm not\nSure how anyone with half a mind could could go along with that but hey you know I'm a you know people believe called leaders or the second coming as well so I really I really can't I Can't understand that but all of those regulations now are being you know pulled back are are being repealed so we\nWell so I really I really can't I Can't understand that but all those regulations now are being pulled back or are being repealed so we are going to the excesses develop again it absolutely will because the one inherent thing that the built in into\nHuman nature and not just democracy as human greed and and and the desire to make more and more money and that will never go away so we're going to the wall street you know gorgeous

night Yankees manager Aaron Boone addressed Luis every now and his issues\nJust hoping he could he get some started to get through the bottom of the line up there and then we're going to have when

star you can give any runs but he couldn't make it past four innings only through eighty seven pitches and I had to take them out\n\nAfter starting the year is just phenomenal and at one point Louis February I was Thirteen and too with a one Ninety eighty All right\nYou didn't have a fixed fifty eight he hall re in July four eighty six in August and then nearly four in September and he didn't pitch every fifth day he only made for start being higher month of September\n\nYou know the the dominant horse that he was the first half of the season that guy is being gone\nAnd I was only twenty four but and certainly has a ton of upside\nBut questions certainly abound regarding Louis several Reno last night and the crazy thing is the red Sox scored sixteen runs they only get\nOne Homer

at all\nUh I didn't mean called behind the play are going to be important especially with like the the like the command guy who's going to try to you know at the edges\nThat's what that's like as best as best qualities the pitcher at this stage of his career as he can he can really you know like paint if he needs to so you know if he's getting the calls then I was really good for the Yankees have you back at another\nLike borderline calls and you know who knows what's gonna happen so yeah sure the umpiring could it could have a big role in the game but hopefully it strikes it will be perfect\nUm are you you do realize that hoping his strike zone is perfect is about equivalent to hoping to win the lottery to me\nBy all the pirates right from the perfect I guess so yeah maybe that will win the lottery tonight I don't know [laughter] if you win like three hundred million can I just get one\nYou you have one dollar how 'bout that All right it's like a dollar bill I Will take a ... dollar bill that\nAs long as it has no folds in it because of it nobody seen here that has any alternate won't freaking taken so no folds and that's about all of them\nAre they looking if the if the only series that hasn't wrapped up yet Yankees and Red Sox and the ... really put it on them last night sixteen to one it was I Want to say is the worst postseason lost and Yankees history\nIt it was I mean like whether you think by you know just watching it or even if you like look at numbers I mean this is the most runs they've ever given up in the playoffs the both lopsided score I think\nThe the most a lopsided score for the most lopsided waiting for a pro team ever and a playoff game\nI mean the Yankees though the last time the Yankees gave up that are close to that and then he runs it was ... was a game six thousand one world series when they have a Fifteen to the D. back\nThen that was that was they broke that yesterday so yeah it was crazy to watch\nAs sixteen to one as a buck kicking I'll always say the worst loss and Yankees postseason history was ALCOA skiing seven\nBut oh well yeah I mean that's the aim seven two thousand four that was that was definitely the worst loss or not just for for the runs scored but you know right from it had three nothing too good old Kevin Brown\nAnd hobby Vasquez given up a grand slam and yeah so\nI mean and yet yesterday and often even eliminate that make a serious though you can't can't really be the worst off the the biggest a deficit\nThat being said how did the Yankees come back from that kind of blood taking time\nClimbing I think they could definitely do with it I mean like the Yankees are still like a really good team they still want a hundred something you know under games on the regular season like\nIt's still got to judge you know it's still got all these guys who can really hit and report does not an uncomfortable picture by any means or they have all the is\nMuch better stuff than than record so I mean ... ... so I I say that the chances of Rick poor soul shutting down the Yankees tonight are much lower than they were of Nathan of all these shutting down yesterday I mean now of course all ... all one hit or against the Yankees this year but I mean\nYankee Stadium and the play off as a little different than Fenway Park in the regular season\nSo they I mean it's now could sail going in game five even if the Yankees win today that's a whole different animal because Chris Sale at Fenway or is not about up if you want to face but you know I mean of\nCourse they'll beat them in game one but the Yankees you know did almost come back in that game and the only lost by one so you know it it could be done as well\nIs is there a concern with which down at the end of the year he was barely throw in Ninety One then he comes out in the postseason throw in Ninety six again but is very is very concerned with him and the workload I mean he's he looks like a guy that really needs to eat a hamburger or\nI think there's a lot less of a concern now than there was\nGoing into game one because of how well he pitched in game one I mean he was in you know he still Ninety five Ninety five Ninety six in game one so that's much better than he was not last or the regular season so that that help you know alleviate some of the concerns uh it just made it through a five and something innings a strike out around\nNow I don't think he was as sharp as he had been kind of for his injuries though so I think there's probably still some lingering concerns you had I mean\nIn the summer he was you know throwing a hundred he was drawn Ninety six so\nIf I yeah I think the red Sox would want them to want to see and be able to dial up to the high nineties not just a bit nineties\nSo if I yeah I think the red Sox would want them to want to see and be able to dial up to the high nineties not just the mid nineties but his ... course as a critic could still get big league hitters out at Ninety six [laughter] so it's not that big of a concern\nFor selling cc tonight at the stadium or how do you like this game\nI well I think it's going to be a lot closer than yesterday that's for sure\nProbably a lot lower scoring to there's going to be run you know both sides I think I think I mean I think the eggs that are pretty good shot through with this game I like\nI mean she seems like he's she's you know basically been through it all at this point so am I ... ... requests all has has never been good in the playoffs in his career he's got like the area almost all like five and a half or so close and so\nAnd I think I think kind of a back and forth higher score and like type of game on both sides of it was probably going to favor the Yankees and the and\nAlso they have their they have all their relievers going that they they can use I mean aren't doing so he could have he could have Robert than pretenses Britain Ann Chapman offered to winnings each if he needed to so if you get them to even the slightest sign up trouble they're going to have this huge stream of relievers\nDavid I learn will be ... with us on the bed you sign on to come inside Lon David all the other theories are wrapped up yesterday astro sweep the Indians beat 'em down eleven to three at the ballpark formerly known as the Jake or are you surprised that the Astros just\nDusted the Indians off in three games\nA I Am not that surprised because I think the asteroids are the best team in baseball and they are just\nReally really really good and in every way possible so I thought the Yankees were either Indians were good too I mean they had a they have I mean they have to pry the the other best starting rotation in baseball besides the Astros\nBut I mean I couldn't possibly be surprised that you know an Astros team has the rotation with lander coal title and Martin who didn't even have to use a bullpen where\nThey had to leave off like three relievers from the postseason roster who would have been like among the best relievers on any other team I mean and the line up that is just basically like polo all stars for you know every ... type of hitters so I mean I don't think it's surprising if they win ... games in a row\nNow the Dodgers handled business or against the Braves they take the series three games to one or the Dodgers still considered the best team in the national league or is that now the brewers who swept down the rocks\n[noise] yeah I mean I think it's still probably the Dodgers are considering you know they're perennial\nStrength I mean the fact that they still have all these I mean many of the ... you know finally came up with a huge Homer yesterday you just turn I was always kind of been great in the playoffs and was grades down the stretch",
