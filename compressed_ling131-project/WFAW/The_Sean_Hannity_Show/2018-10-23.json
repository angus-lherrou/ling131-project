F. A. W. dot com you stream it live I'm sure we're going to archive it as well so uh by all means if you can't make it do that it's going to be on the air as well ah that night\nAh so it's a big deal ah so I Hope you can check it out speaking of big deals um [noise] it looks like a we're having some visitors come to our state why I say that I mean the\nPresident and former president I didn't know this but uh upstate a Wisconsin they call it Trump country have you heard this I haven't but I guess it's it's right here so it\nMust be true uh it's been called Trump country a swath of central northern Wisconsin where voters helped launch president Donald Trump to the White House in twenty sixteen and on Wednesday night tomorrow night the GOP is hoping that does in Trump country\nI'm do my air quotes can't see 'em so I got to tell you about um Trump country will get the message to go to the polls for Republicans again on November ...\nThat's my opinion on that I you know I haven't met friends though I don't know how much he is is that district Andy\nAt your relatives have you ever seen them\nI've never met them in I I really haven't you know you're right I get around I have not met him I've met Randy race in the you know I Am a I read the Democrat and former leader the Democratic side and needed\nAssembly but uh and it makes sense but I mean I get around I ran into a Paul Ryan before but I've never met a branch so no I Am not a I'm sure it's gonna it's gonna happen on Monday were part of the debate we're going to um we're sponsoring\nA down in Janesville so it's going to have to happen uh on Monday of next week\nSo uh let me ask you this ah up in your a congressional district what numbers that I have no idea that\nThe ... congressional district and we have a hot\nDown coal Glenn groping for for working people like Glenn grow up\nAnd altered to fill her get rid of over kind as we know what do the work place family like I think that's what it was called um you know quake that he too working people that are going to grow up in a while to get rid of overtime\nIs this something that it's just important to him because he would talk this way when he was a state senator too in a in Madison as you get any traction with others\nWhile I had a working people are not too happy about somebody taking away their overtime anymore in twenty people bought died for\nThe ability to work eight hours on the job site and um I don't see any any work and people that I talk to they're not they're they're not too happy about uh you know somebody tried to take away their overtime so I think the figure your people realizing this and um I don't think he's camp\nIf they're not too happy about uh you know somebody trying to take away their overtime so I think the figure people realizing this and um I don't think he's campaigning that he's the author to build a take away people's over time but they they should be aware of that fact\nAll right well let me ask you to be here I Would then it sounds like you you you like to call his opponent well what I Do use is a he has that you like candy\nSure I mean uh you know uh you know health insurance you know your your issue and the and the building trades we pay a substantial amount higher than off our counterparts in in Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota area so\nUh I think taking federal federal tax dollars for Medicare Medicaid would have been accused the lower the\nLower the cost of health insurance and so so that's that's a big issue for me of that you know uh you know not a you know persecuting the immigrant community you know you know working on a sustainable solutions to have a comprehensive immigration reform bill\nAnd you know just just fairness in the tax code and um you know middle class families are struggling and all we do you make sure everybody's paying their fair share\nAll right well back to the county board I just read a story earlier in my program that you have joined a whole bunch of other counties and putting on your ballot or to close shut the a dark store tax loophole or is this a big thing up in Winnebago County\nThat we are most definitely um is this is just common sense that the state legislature should've\nShould've got done but a politics and Bobby is with special interest that in the way and uh you know at a at a time of the highest income inequality I think it's you know uh everybody should be paying their fair share and um if that burden is going to get put on\nYou know the taxpayers homeowners are that's it's just it's just not fair so I think back again that the bigger issue that people find out about this realizing that doing their research on it than\nMost people average Joe this and\nThat's not fair I don't want to pay any more taxes why is it ... you know the big box stores why aren't they paying more land they're paying their fair share so I think it's um it's bringing us at ten bringing us I'm polite bringing this this position and and uh of these dark stores and I'm making sure everybody educated on it\nNow Tony boards it's always a debate on questions like that you'll have some that will say you know that's not on her police are playing politics categorize it as\nA to put questions like that on the ballot or because you aren't really making any decision about it you're more or less just sending a message where do you fall in that debate easy\nFor a while I I think our mission I think it's our job to have an educated electorate on on what the issues are I don't think we should hide anything from our constituents the citizens of the state I think that we should be open and\nTransparent to what's going on and um you know bring a suit ballot initiative does that so you know more people are going to research this hey what dark store loopholes here where where does that mean for me so I'm absolutely I think we need to bring this to the forefront and yeah we've we heard that a number of times that it's not the\nTonys position to put this on the ballot this state legislature issue but I'm like I said I'm this brings us to to the forefront of gives people the ability to research political for them and I think that's an important role of government as a whole\nI I think you're right and especially the great example is what's on your ballot dark story you know it should be intriguing to people to see you know I mean I don't know what I should on this better do research and I think that use a good thing\nI mean there are I mean obviously or when there's questions before you get your uh your job is a county board supervisor to do your homework\nAnd vote on things when we come stuff like that does affect you but you know not necessarily can ah you know change it yourself and you had to you know you're looking to Madison to do it\nUh you know that's one of the abilities of as a county board to put things like on that on your ballot and and you know maybe do a resolution or whatever and you're hoping that people do a pay attention to check it out\nYeah let's take the temperature of our constituents in our area and find out what their safety that everybody's going to come to a ... for feeding and voice their opinion is I found out in the short time on the county board of like I said we need to get more people engaged and involved in San educated on the decisions that the day to day life so\nUm I if I was I was all for I'm supporting this resolution to put it up on the ballot in November sex\nRight now you are you're a painter and you uh work with men and women who worked for a living work really hard into voting or you know it is always incredible to me that to some people say I'm not going to vote on time or whatever would let me ask you if you take your temperature is to uh\nUh people that work with the Indy ... or is this a an election they're going to partake in or the I'm not so much\nWell I I I Do with those fall off being in the building trades that we've seen ... all the people don't pay attention when people don't votes and um yeah we're losing a lot of work right out of state contractors and that's not\nBenefiting the citizens of the Wisconsin or the taxpayers one single fit so I I think working people are still need awful lot of political so um yeah I I I Do believe that I'm for it and turn the tide here in November\nHumans you know something I was out of the contractors which are obviously it was a\nThe floodgates opened a by the Republicans and I you know you can see ... D talking all the Republicans will are in charge and do they set the agenda and they have the majority of the things they want big yet and one of the things he did was take away a prevailing wage uh in that is I think what you're pointing at a Andy I by doing that\nA that was a Republican idea way back when over Seventy years ago a to a routine or work for a minute and a fair way to keep it local and state for sure and give the managed to our friends and neighbors trainer taxpayers\nAbsolutely ah recently you know a horse out you know the local contractors a local uh men and women in the area that are going to work and it's like I said earlier because offend anybody when workers coming up from Mississippi contractors coming up off the Louisiana doing you know work in Wisconsin at a lower wage\nQuicken their tax dollars that some of them in Mississippi wherever wherever there at\nThat that that doesn't that does is you know the citizens of Wisconsin are start saving any money and you know the the study the effects are out there it's not fake news that's when they did this in Ghana back at\nTwenty Thirteen I Believe a sit in saving the taxpayer dollars so just aimed at eliminating labor unions and fence admission in the middle classes as well as intended to do ...\nThey didn't have any taxpayer dollars so just aimed at eliminating labor unions that ... in the middle class is intended to do\nAll right well ... you are a union painter Glazer into you know you have a training center and a big band a training center in Pittsburgh\nOr you know some people listening may see a training Center for painting or for painters really why is that important why is it important to hire someone who has the training to beat\nWell I'm somebody falls off a ladder somebody falls or laid off you know we don't you know we give you that trains scaffold training a live\nFeed the our first date so when are but I didn't want to go on the jobs that you know they're going to be the safest most productive um pagers leaders right well finish result they're so ... at the end of the day you get what you pay for so we're\n... but also on hazardous communication um were you when you have a girl and a painter especially hazardous political\nHow do they cleaned up that's Phil what kind of a respirator is that they need to when they're spraying apart the all the types of things you just can't you know take somebody off the street with um you know go go a\nAre but you can come on the night of the event but again why not just get it done with them if you're a get your seats [noise] family tickets are free to the U.S aloof [noise] All right so that will be a for the first congressional district debate and that is\nGoing to be moderated by a W whitewater a political science professor a Susan Johnson you've heard her on W.

Rondo is a great patch\n\nRonda was a great passer who has had to really work hard to learn how to shoot threes because he's been a terrible people in shooter most of his career\nBut he was a guy who's really worked at it to become a decent not great but decent three points you\n\nKnow it's it was the one that and it's free throws it and he's not a good foul shooter either which is crazy considering ... through your guard guards are supposed to hit ...\n\nReally everybody should hit Fouche shots in eighty percent clip but if you're a guard and you're sixty percent shooter from the foul line like something's up\nBut the ... love Rhonda\nIt is interesting that he take shots at Chris Paul you know is it fair to say Chris ... is not as good as ... as we know Chris Paul talks mad smack on the court\nHow many times they can cross the line I mean I'm not saying he's going Kevin Garnett you know your wife tastes like hanging on cheerios but I bet Chris Paul goes over the line on on a good number of occasions\n\nRonda is known as a hothead he's known for being thoroughly but he's also a guy that will do anything to win\n\nI don't know if if he purposely spin on them or if he just spit on him because he's wearing a mouthpiece fit accumulated in it\n\nBut if when guys insist on having their faces that close when they're drawn out each other\nHow you're not going to get spit on each other\nYeah unless you that's kind of one of those it's like that happens and I ... ... it's\nThe first argument the very first argument the rockets made was\nThat clip of Chris wiping is safe after the brunt separate them but if someone just punch you in the face your wiping your face whether it's blood or sweat from a fifth sitting in the face so I didn't buy that into the the very last video that came out I think he was he a girl re re right that posted the video\nThat like really them then that the rockets social media took\nThat it's like you get the early ... you can clearly see something escaping as well\nIt wasn't until then that I was kinda like okay you probably didn't mean to do that than\nDrive I don't know if he does it deliberately or not but when you're that close and your Johns fits gonna fly\nBut like if you feel somebody spit at you like your your reaction isn't letting your white my face is let me punk shores so Ron do really good spirits\nLike your your reaction isn't let me write my face it's let me punk shores\n...

I don't think you pick him and this week\nSo there are some you know there is a downside is that mark Cooper was as good as they drafted him be a you know ... Jones\nAnd he wasn't so now they're going to try with another first round lottery pick\nBill is a is there a tranquil Mac and train them or a coup or there's other guys who are important to be on the train block\nIs there a a cultural issue inside the locker room is there a confidence issue inside that locker room when it comes to some of these veterans what's getting done to this team getting taken apart\nI mean there's a report that you know a name veterans are not knowing what's going on here and\nUnhappy with the events yesterday Quil Mac excuse me mark Cooper getting pulled up the practice field when they come back from there by um and then grown and doesn't say anything to do with team and they learn about it from media\nUm you know your shortwave so I think you know come writers and then you know obviously the Mac thing and the one in five that's the biggest deal that is not working on the field um\nSo yeah I think there are a lot of questions but you know I don't know if that matters because I don't ... the guy with the most security in Oakland in John group this is the first ten year contract so the players aren't happy\nYou know I don't think that marriage I mean he's shown he's gonna blow pretty much everybody out\nHe's already changed over thirty players in one ear and that's a pretty high number so this is going to be all his team\nAgain he has a security so it doesn't really matter the players are happy happy unhappy are wondering what the hell's going on because it may or not you know this is David and not there's whether it's right or wrong but that's what's happening in oak\nBelieves in raiders snake pit non complaint in football dot com with us on the back the aside dot com in sideline bill there's a report coming out of the athletic from Marcus Thompson saying then Derek car has lost the locker room\nBasically over a picture that may show him crying from a hit in the game\nNow this was a guy who's overcome an awful lot of injuries while he's been a raider are you buying this idea that somehow\nUh Derek cars teammates things he's not tough enough to be the team's quarterback and that's the team has to move on from him\nWell never questioned other reporters story but you know I Do a podcast every day on my on my Web sites\nQuestion other reporters story but you know\nI Do a podcast every day on my on my website\nAnd when those pictures came out ... you know last week and I'm not talking about the story was talking about the initial\nI thought it was kind of kind of Lindsey has the evidence I mean it's I just got crunch you know ... so we've done a win ... maybe make out it annoys I think that's okay you know it happens I don't think it was the only time a guy's been in agony on the field\nAnd you're right um you know he has proven that he has been tough he's got banged up a lot so you know I don't put a lot of stock in India this the the the general out of that of that subject of that team I I don't really buy it\nWhen did he come back pretty great from a fracture in his back\nYes and it was gonna be a two to six week injury and he came back after one week and he's\nPlayed with broken bones in his hand in his pinky and yeah I mean I I don't think that's an issue I if I was\nPaying the car I worry more about is you know his inconsistencies and it's continued mistakes and continued you know kinda weird interceptions just like why do you do that ball more than his toughness\nThat do you think the team would trade Derek car if they could get you know a specific return [noise] yeah\nAnd I look I mean clearly Mac is still that everything is on the table this is all on the table and and so the the Cooper trade I mean they just they exercises that you hear often it's off season John Bruno the combine said\nThat he's gonna be the focal point of a passing often so anything's possible and I think yesterday's\nTrade even made it more likely that Derrick\nCar gets three I'm not saying that car is going to get to it it increases the chances because\nNow he can do anything he wants in that drafted here right now he's on pace to having the number for the number of ten and the numbers Seventeen that can change you know a little bit either way but the point is he's going to have not only three\nFirst round pick but potentially three in the top sixteen and he might get the number one pick as well as oh\nI'm so even do whatever he wants in that dry and he got two more in the next year so here so much draft parade ammo next year that John ... falls whoever quarterback\nAnd John grew into this had a TV show which he basically fell in love of quarterback say is the end for years right so he made fun of of a quarterback next year\nAnd if he does and he decide I Want to roll this morning Derek coal car and that's been his theme as the coach of the Oakland Raiders so far\nHe can put car or first round in a little bit remembered than Bradford got a first for so Garrett car could get equal that maybe a little better", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "23"}
