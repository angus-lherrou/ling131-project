soon as well maybe even call it a big four\nBut since they moved him a couple of years ago when the Packers head injury issues are running back they moved him back to running back and I think he was a running back back in college if I'm not mistaken he had a few months or games over the past three years but he couldn't stay healthy so they moved him do running back\nHe had just forty one touches forty one touches in seven games I mean you're talking less than six touches per game now from the fantasy perspective a Green Bay\nI think this clears the way more for my guy Aaron Jones and I was a big Aaron Joan ...\nComing in a year Iran Jones I said and I was beginning that Trump Aaron Jones is the ... even though he had a two game suspension Aaron Jones has the highest upside of any Green

Robertson and doesn't feel for the game and I was\nYou know I I think that there is I I disagreed with a lot of decisions he's made and I think a lot of that happened at all it's based\nHealth fate and stuff in the world series this year he tried to be a little bit more than ... based and go buy his ... but the problem is is that if he makes ... look very similar to what he does and it was so I'm not sure if it's just the way he wired and that's how that's how he manages or what but I Do feel like it's a little bit too much and going by the numbers and not enough to friday night when he's\nAll right let's go ahead and go I wanted to I felt like maybe she got that out too that might help to to be therapeutic I Know it always felt that was kind of get it out after after my team blues and you know the Minnesota fan my teams have lost plenty\nWhy it was very cathartic I'd appreciate appreciate that Chris was it was actually able to talk this through Thirty years of misery in baseball but you know at least at least it's not one of those things were into an eighty or Ninety year range at this point I Hope it never gets to that point\nI somehow I think just to that you're going to be okay All right let's go ahead and talked about some of the pain and suffering with some of these injuries Ben Roethlisberger did I hear right the he's fractured finger on Sunday\nYeah he's fractured her finger on his hands on non throwing hand uh it's pretty much going to be a non issue for the most part don't don't put the put something around that to protect it\nAnd they'll have a glove and they'll make sure that he does as much as they can with his right hand the only thing it's only going to affect as a little bit of all the charities and I have to watch out for that might be some pain that he had to deal with but it shouldn't affect the way he throws and the way he performs other than handing the ball off the ball security or something they might have to watch out for come come Sunday\nHow about in in the fall when in the fall when we get into the colder part maybe you know in a month or\nSix weeks if they're not going to let this thing you're like oh imagine we're looking at maybe a a four to six week keeling altogether I mean if he's not going to be able to move but with that somehow affect the ability to to grab the football and you know turn around and be ready to to drift away Susan hand off or am I reading too much into it\nYou know a hundred percent going to affect the ability of him to hand them all off especially like you said as it gets colder mobility goes down you know the thickness of the glove how you know when they have the Kathy if it's split like how to how they're planning on that and you get the day of I think is one of those things where he'll be able to get better and stronger as though we go on despite the cold because you know typically with with fracture\nPhysiologic killing takes roughly six weeks to occur and it's like you want to be able to get that big queen point I mean that you should go so I think it I think he'll he'll be back early on maybe he works on I've seen some quarterback from the past work on\nHand in the fall off backhanded with they're throwing hand instead of doing it with office they have so it's hard to say what kind of the ... how they approach it but I I think he'll be finding like they're much more\nOr less moved to some running backs here and we're going to start with our state birthday\nAnd strength\n\nRookie Ronald Jones who I I think a lot of us started at worst it would be a time share\nIt beginning of the year Peyton Barber all indications where he couldn't do anything with the amount of volume that he was getting in that camp they all sense\nWe saw a little bit of a slash right before the by we got off the Tampa Bay was going to make the change\nFrom Pete and Barbara Toronto Jones during the by you come up Peyton Barber is now your main back again Ronald Jones hurt with that hamstring I'm hearing a few weeks but I don't know what a few weeks means can you give any sort of clarity on that\nAnytime I hear somebody have a soft tissue injury and the initial report right off the bat come out and we're talking about multi week and it makes me think of that it's a pretty significant strain of a muscle 'cause normally if it's just a little pug a little poll and grade one\nOr something like that can be kind of manage drop the course will make they won't instantly give it a multi we type thing so it makes me think that it's going to be like a anywhere from two to six week returned a sport because all the reports that I've seen possibly kind of a middle grade to\nA on a on a great outlet bringing great scale I'm so great to be a moderate level bringing up the hamstring so I expect them to really really have to hire them because again it might be a season where it's going to end up being a throwaway like you said because it's become so long to get involved in an office and the first place\nBut you know at this point in time their end of the themes and they're not going anywhere there's no sense of rushing him back I'd expect this to me at least two to three weeks minimum\nAnd to me if you're in a re draft league I think he's one of those guys at his most definitely drop a ball point\nCapital of the I mean if you're in the dining relief for sure think about keeping him 'cause it seems like they need something and then maybe they will just holding them back I'm not sure I I kind of like the cutter is kind of a day of Robert something the NFL\nIs going to say I was you know I still got baseball my mind but he just doesn't seem like a very good coach and I think it's one of those things where Jones has a lot of a lot of birth and I walk them a lot of us the and he got a lot of talent I just don't know why it's that comes along they got to the bottom dolphins\nRight let's move to a guy that was moving in the right direction in terms of getting a lot of plays on the often suicide and he was labeled as doubtful last Monday Night and thankfully didn't didn't play Sony Michel ... what is the latest on Sony Michel for fantasy owners\nKathleen cracked up on Saturday which is basically the friday before the Monday Night game at let's say a lot of speculation that he might have a chance I'm playing but I don't think there are there any chance he was going to play on Monday I didn't know we're just trying to test and you see where it was that I I think we're going to go into this week with a chance that he played the game it's a primetime game it's again queen based on how much they missed him\nUm they they just did not we're not able to generate anything on the ground against buffalo so I think there's going to be a chance that he plays this week I don't think it's it's April I'm Out quite yet I still lean I err on the side of them holding out for another week or how bad the injury looked initially I Can't imagine he comes back that quickly\nBut again if he leads to a limited part that something we're going to go into the weekend at the time to ... and again it'd be in the late game you need to make sure that you have somebody in the back of just in case but I think that he doesn't mean he's not going to be quite a hundred percent if he does play this week for the re injury refined me a little bit off\nTo me I Love James White I've loved genes white all year but even with Sony Michel Kenyan Barbary is just too much of a journeyman for me and you can't trust Bill Belichick\nNow having Cornell Patterson be you're starting running back to each other and they're just I get the sense that we are running again they're just trying to get by until they can get Sony Michel back\nYeah

Gary aid great to have you avoid and I got to tell you guys something we got a busy busy show we have ...\nComing up later in the program we're going to have a lot of news and notes manager notably it's been announced his jerseys get he retired by the San Antonio spurs that is coming up march twenty eight so you might want to get tickets for that now that's gonna be\nA Thursday night seven thirty PM against the Cavaliers though if you're in the Senate\nTony or area or you want to be in the San Antonio area I Would buy tickets like ten minutes to go because that's going to fill out in a nanosecond the spurs you know hang tough this year\nWe're not the team that they expected to be a little bit while we're a little bit longer to not even because of age on the roster but because of injury to their key to athletic youth in Murray out for the season and in\nThe rookie Loni Walker he's out for probably another month or so um I haven't gotten an official update on that but when the injury first happened it was a\nFour to eight weeks variety so\nAbout a month and the the the now so you know they got at the ballpark so we're going to have rich and Selma talking all kinds of stuff later on he'll give you hated rookie why she's going to give you maybe a couple of games some things going on with the Cavaliers of course the big news story that will get it but a lot of the show today on is the firing of Toronto blue\nEarlier in the week or I should say late last week\nUm ... that was a tough one because if you're a cavalier spend\nIt kind of just feels like why bother on the surface because look beyond that they lost the brown and they're pretty much terrible but if you dive into it a little bit more and we're going to after the break you can see why it happened\nAnd it actually make that and I think which is going to agree with me he'll you'll get his take later on in the program I'll give you my take on the other side of the break off and they give you our games of the week and why the warriors are creating a depression within the league the more the lead try to emulate their style\nThe water the gap between the warriors and the rest of the league s so all that and more coming up on the other side of the break we are like\nUrine SB Nation radio we'll take your calls eight hundred Seventy seven seven to nine zero seven we got tickets for break when we come back coach tight little why he lost his job and why it actually makes sense to the NBA show here destination radio and SB Nation radio dot com\nYou twenty five point he's a Mets again but there is one of those guys you need big time structure big time structure um but that's why Tyler was fired because you have to you as a coach you have to understand who you guys are and what makes them tick and love needs to be kind of\nHave the issue forth with him a little bit just just in the early going to kind of get him in that aggressive mode and then he's fine so\nWe'll see what Coach Dru can do um we know that he was filling in for tie Lou last year because of ... illness and the players seem to respond to them a little bit so we'll see how it goes but I mean so long slag and the the problem so they have is they just don't have no the now have talent\nBut they're saddled with a bunch of your own E S awful contract you're talking core river and myth\nAnd Christian Thompson and George Hill and I believe most of these guys are not expiring so even if you were the trade Kevin Love and maybe offload one of those other contract loves not cheap either he's on the long term deal to\nIt that that might not be the best option is a lot of trade talk about love out there right now I don't think it's going to happen because it's not really advantageous to the cabs because essentially you'd have to if you're in a trade love you'd want to get rid of at least one of those bad contracts but loves contract being what it is to\nYou probably won't be able to do that and just get another team through except fifty million dollars in a trade\n'em when neither a contract is expiring or maybe only one of the two is um I don't think he's gonna be movable not because of his value but because of what the cabs would likely want in return they're kind of stuck with this for the next year or two while they don't have a lot of flexibility they're going to have the the high draft\nPick but they're not going to have any kind of financial flexibility at all um you know\nIt's going to be interesting eight hundred seven seven Seventy nine zero seven the NBA show by the way the brawn James former cavalier pastor and Vicki this week\nOn the all time scoring lift probably for good I'm Dirk of course is not played so far the seeds and he's been injured with a foot injury or should be back relatively soon from what I understand\nBut LeBron is now six full time in the NBA scoring and what a great great thing to have witnessed all these years with what LeBron's done because this guy might retired at top scorer all time he might not in my ... going to be in the top three\nWithout a question basically when he retires at the very minimum um and when you think it will Braun\nHe's not really known as the score he's just so good and so gifted Becky scores kind of by by accident sometimes and you just do physical and so strong going to the basket and he's turned himself into a passable jump shooter over the years\nBut you don't think of liberal and as the score and the way you thought of I mean think of the guys who are above him on that list right now Jordan Coby Kareem Carl Malone one of those guys all have in common\nEvery last one of them\nIf I said name the first thing you think of when you think of any of those guys you're going to say what scoring\nThat that's going to be your answer their scores that's what they're known for certainly they had other traits and they were greeted other things but they were known to be scores\nBut I ask you about LeBron James you will probably get a different answer\nFrom every person you asked that question to three or four different answers depending on who you ask that question and that's the probably the best way to look at LeBron James total mastery of basketball\nIs that there's not one can sense the memory of\nWhat stands out about him everyone has something different because he had so many master level skills if you ask me I Would say in his younger years is a building with just a pay passing lane\nAnd get those chase down blocks and really just disrupt and destroyed games by playing five positions on defense that stood out to me\nIf you ask ... who will have later in the show he might say is passing if you ask because he might say it's going if you ask someone else they might say is rebounding for his position\nI mean that that's what's amazing about what brownies giving the top two or three\nMaybe even higher on the all time scoring list when a treat when it's all said and done still playing in a high level and he's never being just a go to like he'd never been just a score the white Coby was a score Carl Malone Jordan was scores were brunch just kind of scored in the lower the often done it very differently and he he deserves a lot of credit for that [noise]\nAll right so we can take a quick break when we come back we're going to give you a little bit more information about what's going on with our games of the week the warriors and all kinds of other stuff schemes that maybe aren't on national television that we should be watching if you have leaked factor that's coming up next on the NBA show at the nation radio and SB Nation radio dot com\nBubble you also saw a movie that goes up to try to catch a ball you interfered with the band\nCalled back so not a home run for

[noise]\nRight we're back here on the envy aid program thank you very much for tuning in eight hundred and seven seven seven to nine zero seven is the phone number and we have coach Richard double joining us and its\nYou're on the MBA program thank you very much you tuning in the hundreds seven seven Seventy nine years seventies the phone number and we have those Richard ... junior ... weekly by here on the program\nAnd we got a lot of different things to talk about coach of course the big news during the week was the firing of Toronto blue first of all how you doing in welcome back to the show\nUh I'm doing great thanks for having me as always I Want to piggyback off of some things you said okay\nWe are talking about Lou 'cause I was in the other room there at the flagship just eavesdropping on\n[laughter] All right [laughter] and\nUh I agree with a lot of what you said but I Will jump on and say that I think it was the right time\nYeah I don't disagree I agree with you\nAre and there are plenty of reasons you mentioned the obvious want\nThe usage of capital of ... to me as bad as they shot numbers are and they were ridiculous\nFor your best player to be taking that few shots numbers were also low and this man is a great pastor yeah why Lou wasn't using him to initiate the office\nHe run the often to him at all the games shooting like you know I think he should touch the ball and the possession could see the best chance and then had a good question\n[laughter] well let's just short when that whole thing and said he didn't around and off at\nVarious [laughter] he didn't want on one he doesn't have to when he has all abroad but brown ran the office oh yeah\nAnd no one does it better no one sees what the court better\nBut you have to run it off and I didn't see any semblance of an office I just see people taking turns putting up shots\nIn the perfect example of that and I didn't realize it last year I just thought it was someone being a badge that was J Crowder Crowder looked really good and Boston why\nHe was on the team that ran off and he knew his place in that often\nHe was given a defined role and able to play it in Cleveland he was thrown\nOut on the court mhm yep and he looked terrible you didn't know if you watch it and this year in Utah hey whoa Koreans you know I Am an in an office that's right\nOh well coached office and again a player who knows his role there was not a defined role in Cleveland for any player\nYou fall into the habit when you're coaching little abroad because Brian will define what needs to be done on the court but\nYou have to have something when you don't have and they had nothing in place nothing in place at all and I think it was time\nWhat do you think I'm In my own drew as the inter do you think that's the right choice\nWell what's he withdrew as to say about it [laughter]\nAs of now he doesn't want to be called the inter him he just wants to be called the voice he doesn't want to be called the interim until they guarantee him money for next year\n\nDo they want to do that I don't know what if they were locked in I Would understand he's he's finishing off paying Mike Brown he's paying David glass [laughter]\nAnd I think he has another year or two on that deal and he's got Fifteen million more into tie Lou\nMaybe you should stop buying and coaches\nThere's\nI wouldn't give any coach taking that you have a long term deal because that team is not ready to win in the near term let alone along\nYeah I mean I'm ... now you have to they they have all those contracts I mean you know them off the top of your hand I mean none of those contracts are short term\n[noise] the um\nThe point guard George he'll he'll his contract is for what thirty seven million for two years [laughter]\nThere's a buyout in next year's or all costs you the whole thing right okay a J hours contract as a buyout to them next year it'll still cost you but next year those deals won't look as bad\nIf you try to trade one this year it's not going to be easy to do\nAnd so that Thompson contracts to\nYeah\nI think at this point especially without love though you have to have stuff you have zero inside presence\nAnd yeah the general manager said you know we're not really going anywhere instead of giving chanting fried thirty minutes can we give a few minutes yeah we can\nCan we give Sexton more minutes hills not your future\n\nPills jury bits trading peace next year right sex the near future get him in the lineup\nSo you agree with Kobe home and then\nI Do\nI Do granted I also said the coach and have some leeway in it but one he's never been to him and all and never got off\nI'm too that's all on the line with these drafted in traded four players\nObviously Altman gave a love of the deal then gave Larry Nance junior the deal mhm\nHe feels those are two building blocks Sexton is obviously another one that when I hear people say well Sexton hasn't played well it's kinda hard when you play eleven minutes one night than Twenty one the next\nWants to and hills gonna show us at this point\nYeah easy you see sixteen I I completely agree with a with Kobe Altman and you I think that there's no reason not to play 'em like just usually know allow that have nothing to answer that although I Will say Osmond he's urges minutes\nAnd other than those two I don't need to really do damage deeply into my youth because I don't have much of an easy says okay but like\nI I'm okay with just making sure those two guys just a minute how big is the fact that you think that peace agreement was was that the driving force there was this the lack of and all things built around the love the old similarly lead to this firing\n[laughter] it was a combination I talked to a couple of people about this in Cleveland and it was a combination Altman one was not happy with the often he was not happy with the ball distribution and Lou didn't really want to discuss it with him\nThat's\nNot the way to a quote reach out to your boss\nLou didn't really want to discuss it with it that's\nNot the way to a quote reach out to your boss\nSays this is just the mistake of PCs essentially in terms of the front office in the coaching staff\nYeah just the disconnect I'm like you said he tie Lou was never a coup beyond the guy he was basically a liberal and die when you get right down to it right so are you surprised you then you\nGiven that they do these after six games in what they had to know who's going to be a tough season\nThat they didn't make the news in the off season that knowing that it wasn't that relationship there that was really ... the big part in driving the ... so where does it surprise you that maybe they can do this in the off season just say this isn't the right fit for you any more time will be on different direction in hiring permanent coach going into the season\n[laughter] or I hear there would've been\nOkay and then a real quick or your

how I was a trip to Disney World and I had a brand new Chevy after all they edit it died on the way [laughter]\nAnd she was there to save the day with her husband bill was helpful around the swimming pool so when we got there\nAs a legislator I called her several times when I had to have something clarified and you know what no one did it better than a pig loans father\nHe did it in English [laughter] you could actually if you were a layman you knew what she meant yeah\nYeah exactly and uh she I mean this is long after she was our attorney general too she just did this or to uh you know because he'd been there had such ... you know wisdom that you'd acquired and ah yeah and what a speech he could give him at rice\nThat slowly now there's a reason why she is considered one of the best and brightest of elected officials Wisconsin say that's the last fifty years [noise]\nSo if you didn't know that uh he was a Josh calls mom and he's running for attorney general against the branch ... why do you think branching will can't break a forty seven percent\nOr because he may be more conservative that Donald Trump\n[laughter] I really\nOnly if you look at what his what his garden as attorney general he has been completely participated in a position that you're supposed to be a fault the lawyers for the call balls and strikes\nCharacters that\nHe won't even faster Democrat uh he uh spend all his time trying to protect Scott Walker and protecting the five plus million people who happen to live in the state of Wisconsin\nOkay well and looking at the numbers ... eighty nine percent of Republican support one call receives eighty seven percent or support from Democrats independents ... forty two percent and call forty five percent all within the margin of error as you pointed out\nHave no one of the things to look at that whole that's kind of important isn't set that Governor Walker's getting Ninety six percent of self identified Republican\nAnd Tony versus getting Ninety three a similar numbers when it comes to the atheist race Holyoke slightly less Kosovo FAA recognition\nBut what you're seeing is the hardest on this issue of Wisconsin\nAnd when you have a whole has no independent they're all Democrats or Republicans you're going to have a jump off and that's why we got\nSo what does it come down to a sense of this pools and tied in our governor's race or it turned out I guess is what you got to go with right\nAfter it turned out here it's really important model but I'm gonna easy ate a little bit I think they're selection all over the country including Wisconsin actually got to be a referendum on Donald J truck and I think right now is dropping like a rock\nIn Wisconsin or nationwide\nNationwide Wisconsin is just a microcosm of the country is a whole\nOkay well anyway uh so let's go through some ... ... the choice of forty seven percent Democrat Josh call use the choice in forty five percent or so there were that ones and now when you go to Mitt\nRomney yeah I'm going to that see a you know how to me I'm doing that next yes but that raises a really good question because yes she's far ahead of\nHer opponent or a ... uh but uh\nShe how how does that work out or if she's so far ahead ... ... are Democrats\nVoting for her and then voting for Scott Walker since ... that was at forty seven forty seven\nI'd be surprised I Know but then it will what\nWhat's going on there I guess maybe independent I\nI think you should switch to a different way I think that there are a number of people who normally vote Republican are voting for Tammy Baldwin okay not that they're voting for Scott Walker\nAll right that sounds good enough just to get to the numbers are uh she reads a leader who we're about fifty four percent to forty three percent so she is outside the margin of error she's got the going\nGets upset as a set a Democrat or voting for Barbara Walker I'm arguing that Republicans based out what you just said I'm voting for Tammy because what Walker forty seven cameras at fifty four how old are you at Coney neighbors that forty seven\nAnd she's here is that what forty\nThree forty three well woven obviously\nThat split is coming away\nI mean these are people who are voting for one has or if they're voting Walker Baldwin\nNot Walker beer outside of the real partisan\nOkay and then I Want you to address this uh they asked about Walker's job approval fifty percent of registered voters say they approve of how Walker he's doing his job well forty six percent disapprove we read into that\nA lot of the harbor between forty five and fifty\nA big issue with politics and you know that the heavy combat specially one with a hundred percent of the American citizens who can't crack fifty percent of when things\nThat is a ... year mark a mini go buy a into the number one issue out there and you can tell by the ads that are being run by both sides a large majority registered voters this is huge eighty two percent seeing the Affordable CARE Act requirement that pre existing conditions\nThat'd be covered by insurance companies is very important to them how things change ... I mean this was the Republicans are a political football for years they took how many votes or to get rid of the ah a bomb it carries easy uh what do you think\nWell I think over time Obamacare is wearing well people want to know that they have a guaranteed coverage not what they want is for for the full coverage\nAgain Republicans aren't do that and the argument after they voted\nOr for the coverage\nThat Republicans are going to add to the argument after they voted against Saddam time frame to retain all the Affordable CARE Act that party that's going to protect you on preexisting conditions laughable\nDoesn't a branch him live a lawsuit he a man's okay\nYeah see that as a way that the half of the governor right\nThey are together on that one um and so it will take a look at president Donald Trump in the pool or here's a forty seven percent approval rating was fifty percent disapproving in the previous mark ... and October his approval rating was forty six fifty one percent\nOr disapproving so still seeing seeing the same\nSo I wouldn't have seen the old fashioned way worked I don't trust within three points out approval rating on except for this one [laughter] I mean all of them is running between ten and twelve point begging of\nThis year now in early October Seventy percent of Republicans out Seventy four ten Seventy six percent for the Democrats and now it's eighty one were very enthusiastic with fifty nine percent of independents\nTuesday as thick as that time and now she ate all kind of makes sense for a while there you go I think so much for

[laughter]\nI think I think you would have been ... I've been accused of yelling too much\nI I think I think it'd be a immigrants that a candy corn is trash\nWithout a doubt to it and I kind of got that from anyway he's very smart and you can tell that he's researched and stuff that he feels about so for him but just off the hook and be like no I like ... that didn't seem like it\nNow where I'm concerned is where he would stand on the giving out of pop tarts as a candy I think that passes just\nDown the so case they could be worse because candy corn you could be getting an apple\nBut you have a guy who is so stubborn so bull headed who has done it his way and his way minds you had gotten into the NBA\nSo he like other people involved in this conversation don't jump out and don't appear to be the first person in the in the room to sit down and say let's have a logical conversation about that and that's not a false or negative\nIt's just the reality so you've got Jimmy Butler who's got his head down and just wanna fall seeming to them all the time to do was caught in the middle is saying wait a second fire me anyway why would I act but that process Jimmy Butler was traded\nThat's the first real nail in Tom to those cough and if not the final nail\nWhere I wouldn't be shocked at all if the guy got traded a week after a part of me fired a week after they traded him and not wait until the end of the season slow tempo and his stubbornness is in there and then you just have the total lack of base but I think anybody in Minnesota rightfully so has on the front office to get this thing right\nBecause you've got stories that pop out reports that pop out that they turned down for allegedly for for ... from the rocket so you've got a front office right now that look incompetent that looks to be unable to deal with two types of a turtle turmoil aged Jimmy Butler versus the kids\nIt's so hard headed hard nosed Bullhead guy are you going to tell him anything new because he started his way versus call it but he tells and Andrew Wiggins rather be playing Fortnite and being in the gym allegedly of course\nAccording to butler his camp and then you also have time to just take a bunch\nOf just going to sit there and say oh you're going to have to fire me you're going to have to fire me first before we trade Jimmy Butler because I'm going to raise is think about it and he doesn't have all the power by any means especially since he's been more likely than not a mask elated on his way out but it's enough\nIs enough right there to throw a wrench in that situation and caused Minnesota to have to look back and say well what do we do and I love it\nNo I'm not saying so that's why I Love it because every single day even on and off day what's going to happen with butter what's he going to do and you know that if he's out there on the bench and street clothes sitting down watching his team play and you saw washing his team play in golden said watching his team play in Miami\nIs going to be a camera on them they're going to follow him around and they're going to go to his reactions when the wolves are down by fourteen and they're going to go to his reaction when miles Turner throws down and embarrasses call Anthony town now he's not going to jump up and root for the opposition but if you remember\nOlder just before he left Kobe Bryant in which they had shot that you remember that [laughter]\nShe looks like Kobe's last year and he's on the bench and he had to watch flag he paid guys just launched and they would go it was like a planned part of the broadcast just go to go to cold ... yes whenever the Lakers do something so ridiculous that you have no choice but to laugh\nAt next year you get Kobe's reaction that Jimmy ... are now you remember that\nIs vaguely the thing I remember the most was\nHow would it too late to do for Kobe I think the season after retired obviously the Lakers were still trash and he left the game in a third quarter and they're planning to him as he's leaving\nDo you remember that [laughter] had enough and I thought ... I don't think they were tired as Jersey I Can't remember what it was it they were celebrating maybe it was a judge their retirement\nAnd he was he was obviously sitting in front and by the third quarter he was walking out with his with his wife and his daughters\nUnless you're like what what are they going to do to Jimmy bummer find him what are they going to do is just for a game if now that's a great thing you raise I'll sit the over under at\nEight minutes left in the fourth quarter if the walls are getting embarrassed and which Jimmy Butler just goes to the locker room now I I don't know how viable that would be on the road but at home all at home and good luck\nEight minutes might be that might be too long I think I think bitterly or after all [laughter] so yes can you imagine may go to Jim eight\nTo ten minutes left in the fourth quarter the wolves are down Eighteen to Milwaukee Bucks in Minnesota and they panda Jimmy and he's not there is a bomb on the sideline reporters what we're getting word Jimmy ...\nI'll tell you you were closer to that let's be honest you are closer to Jimmy Butler walking off the court as a spectator than with the efforts of the Minnesota timber wolves than you are of him being traded\nI can just imagine like the cameraman panning like in like how they used to ... to people in the office really quickly and suddenly and Jimmy is not there anymore [laughter]\nIt's like it's like the actual office to show in which the cameras moving really fast and it skips over somebody and then it goes right back like wait a second which to me that's a street we asked on Twitter action or show can you give away a package of pop tarts as Halloween candy\nAt real Berg fourteen twenty eight simple answer yes Sean Murphy at cats mad at two eleven yes I Would have loved that as a kid that's why I bring it up\nReal Berg fourteen twenty eight simple answer yes Sean Murphy a cat mad at two eleven yes I Would have loved that as a kid that's why I bring it up\nNow there's time there are a lot of people listening right now that have a couple of hours before the trick or treating really begins you really want to be that mom that bad that gives out the same ... cat ... every year do you really want to be the mom or dad\nThat mind Mr good bar many tall I got something special you want to be the hero you want to be the champion on the block to give out some pop tarts cross to pop tart starts it now at\nMike felt tone Thirteen no that is disgusting and not appropriate art you may not like the taste of a pop star but why is it inappropriate\nInappropriate it may not be the best tasting Katie I didn't say it was better than a ... says you know that was their Reese's peanut butter cup\nI let you should be able to get away with giving a pop tart and not have to worry about your house getting into your car getting blown aid\nCoach Keynes was my favorite one because he mentions\nThis more as a pop tarts are just completely forgot about and those are so good I don't know if you had them\nOf course ... yes coach Cain thirty one only if you give out Morris or brown sugar cinnamon variety not far I ...

Jean thriller beat it\nSome of these older videos that he didn't remember like eighties early nineties when we didn't have so much CGI\nExactly exactly ... you're working with the long enough you know what I'm going on this oh you're going to we're going to get to your Halloween party coming up at a couple of minutes but I did see just want to get to the three winners of the NFL trade deadline in case you forgot that it's okay if you did because I was on last friday\nWe were having a conversation about Halloween and towards the end of the show Jose brought up that he was going to a costume party and wasn't going to wear a costume so we need an update on that because\nPart of me thinks that he might have cave gonna leave it at that I have no idea what happened I purposely told him to not tell me ahead of time I want to react organically like you do the three winners and the NFL trade done later on the East Village dark in reverse order\nDallas Cowboys you hurt Adam sites who covers the NFL for SB Nation on in the first hour and we active they overpaid for Dallas and they did and I agree I'm not going to argue that they did not overpay for Laura Cooper they got a guy that young and that somebody that you can build with in the future the reason the only reason why Dallas is the third biggest winner\nFor the trade deadline and that means leading up and of course that day is because unlike Tim areas Thomas on like Golden Gate or going to get two and a couple of minutes\nThere's still a long play still something that if you will decide I'm Ari Cooper and I can imagine that they would not\nBe the thing moving forward well\nYou've got to fix that hold that you've had your number your true number one on the outside is God not that that was really a true number one\nIn his last year or two but that's the point is this whole thing was sold about ... got his back Prescott that if you move on from back you're still going to need a wide receiver you're still going to need somebody to stretch the field you're still going to be somebody who can put up numbers in a good system when it goes off and\nLike I'm Ari Cooper can do just because it was a train wreck\nIt stretch the field you're still going to be somebody who can put up numbers in a good system when it goes off and like I'm Ari Cooper can do just because it was a train wreck in Oakland shouldn't be a reason to write him off entirely you look back and you say wow you're foolish Jones Family how could you give up\nFirst round pick how could you set the market and the beauty of it if you're laughing and pointing laughing at the cowboys like I was just the market wasn't even that it was a belligerent trade as far as what they gave up and then everybody else looked around and it was like oh okay okay\nThat's like one of these teams in the movie right have everybody just talking mumbling ruined the bar somebody comes in\nYellow something everybody stops looks up\nAnd then goes right back to having their conversation that's what the Dallas Cowboys essentially did in the trade deadline trading for mark Cooper bought the biggest thing is they get to identify who jak Prescott his more importantly they now know that they should should at the very least should have somebody you can build with the kittens number two yeah I can see this\nThat the Washington Redskins already better football team right now and most likely will be a better football team at the end of the year than the Philadelphia Eagles\nThe eagles are dealing with Andrew like they did last year it's not sustainable to expect every year somebody's going to step up next man up that stuff doesn't work here and you're out you might get lucky one year but you can't live in the NFL withhold next man up at some point you're going to be exposed\nBut at the same time we have seen teams that win and play deep into the super bowl mind you that have slow start that are dealing with injuries because guys played so much last year I Can't write them off but the scans are better\nWith their offerings right now being consistent and balanced\nAs much as that might have been in a concern coming into this season\nThe bigger issue that they've solved is now having swear injure and Clinton big back there as your twin safety where you truly can maximize of physical guy and a cover guy now including Dix\nSo you're better equipped to go up against a team like the Philadelphia Eagles who I think in Adam site degree in the first hour one day with the trade with golden tape for even get the Golden State\nThat was the biggest area\nThat the ... needed to shore up in order to remain consistent\nThis was not hey who can we go out and get to put us over the top so now the students are the odds on favorite to be in the super bowl it was who can we bring into a address an issue and be make or even a little better to know that we're not going to take a step back\nHow do we prevent a slide a mid season fly to third ah you know the third quadrant slide if you will that happen to some teams that get out in a hot start I Love what they can't believe I'm saying this but I have to be objective of course I Love what this get instead by bringing in Clinton next to the point at which had a live just a little bit of envy\nWhenever gift giving holiday you celebrate\nWhatever it is that you
