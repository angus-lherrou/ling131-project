friend\nHe's former state senator Joe when a key but he's also the former a chair and the Democratic party in Wisconsin where the key how you doing Joe ...\nJoe I I I Love having you on because you you do and I speak your mind and you break it down into bite sized chunks so everybody can understand there's a lot going on it's like drinking from a fire hose\nAnd ah I I don't even really know where to start but I I let's start with the governor's race your thoughts on that where we are and we got a couple of debates coming up\nYou still sticking with your pick of Tony ...\nOh absolutely but first let's start with a little friendly a challenge to a good Republican lesser of your critics so\nFor you to be a high level marketing marketing the Republican Party that it's okay to go on an orchid show and if you want to go on at the same I've I woke up for debate\nThat would be great radio yes we have a mutual friend and I like brain lot Ryan if you're listening in New York or you can come on my show you know I don't bite\nOr I Want to hear what you have to say a he's a taken some shots 'cause he says they don't stick or you don't I don't I'm not stuck in the middle I I don't know balloons that I I lean left but I like getting things done in the middle that's where the best things happen and you don't know how to Joel right\nSo we're way and you know the thing is when I was in the state legislature Oreo while back ballot before things became\nWhat do you think about that whole ... term\nFor I think a lot of the bulk of family I refused Foxconn and everything else is the government's role is to subsidize the business in a way that they come in and say well if you don't support this we're leaving and the irony\nOf it being a a Kimberly Clark is\nJust rich because I'm old enough to remember that back at night Nineteen eighty five I Believe it was that Darwin said the president is Kimberley Clark or their headquarters for ... for the ash area to\nDallas texas at eight plus they played this game before as now are we going to do it again for me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me\nWhile he says he's optimistic but there's no evidence that he's even talk to the Democrats need ... votes because he's got three Republican senators saying they're not going to vote for this thing no matter what and camping Craig and not seeing news so I really don't know how you can be optimistic when you don't have the votes\nWell I think that's why they're saying we'll do that after the election and we'll go get those box valley a democratic senator effect just cut a tropical I think this is just the way to stop the game beyond the election and pray that they do well in November I mean maybe they will idle how nobody to all\nRight well let's focus in on the governor's race or early on you said Tony Evers is going to when you do feel that we strongly\nOkay or the governor is changing his head seems like weekly you know trying to get a message that works right now it's taxes and we'll see what happens but he he says that you can't afford Tony Uber's can we afford Tony Uber's\nWhile [laughter] yes I think we can but I think we can afford almost anybody but Scott Walker who gave away for a half billion dollars of art ACT Party called Taiwanese billionaire for Foxconn\nI mean let's get real who spend or hear\nWhat other Scott Walker or administration if we if a bankrupt our transportation system we've we've reduced our revenues train to the point we can't find the basic services\nAnd then he gave away four and a half billion dollars of that of that less a threat to the guy weddings billionaire horse the responsible one\nScott Walker the guy who says Tony ... is going to raise the gas tax the pocket gallon come on let's get real [laughter]\nOh gosh well we have to do civil Boehner roads or what would you do if you were was governor Joe when a key\nHow would you ah fix the rural road debacle uh we've got going on I call a debacle now is not just my opinion we're we're the second worst roads and all of the United states out of all fifty states never used to be that this is something we truly are not used to so what would you do was governor when a key on the roads\nWhile I was ... see a candidate for governor in ... see a Democrat ... ah who said I'm just going to fix the dam road [laughter] um and I would do and if I immediately indexing the gas task to get a nickel like Alice\nWas that a mistake me down by a former Democratic governor Jim Doyle when he messed around with that\nI had a lot of respect for you but yes it was a mistake it wasn't what happened there at what\nThe oil and that she ate it uh it was a this year that by the Republicans in the legislature they passed it\nAnd then they they're the governor to be told what they can they can make it a political issue than Jim Doyle size that now in my opinion Jim Doyle maybe it's probably the biggest mistake of his time as governor by getting rid of a stable source of revenue for transfer case that was something that was done by Tony Earl\nI voted for it Nineteen eighty three it was the best thing we've done for transportation and fifty years and it was wildly controversial because it was an automatic gas tax increase well here's the reality Andy\nOn ah the gas tax will go up like seven to ten ... county every year right now the oil companies will raise gas prices twenty cents a day\nAnd then when they reduced that it goes down to south for the time if you haven't noticed [laughter]\nSo they can make more profits fine well\nOne of the things that does Scott Walker our governor I talked to ... you said well you do that and that's not sustainable Joe because a lot of people are driving cars are due to use gas anymore so what do you see them that\nWell he hasn't raised any other evidence for it either yeah psychological world which I frankly don't like watch\nNo adds up to you as an increase registration fees and I think as they've gone up last time I think eight years ago ten years ago and stuff like that I think it was actually I ... I don't think Walker has done any of it but what he's done it a star of the transportation fog\nWhile at time walls costs keep going up to build roads\nAnd revenue keep going down I mean that's an on a sustainable ... a plan that's been led by Governor Scott Walker I mean I mean it's a life or whatever outside interest group that funding they ask what what I call Scott whole foods telling the truth\nYeah Scott whole new term but you're right now he has funded the rules by ... by whipping up the credit card and that's not sustainable lose it\nAll out we went from a weapon the sound of every dollar spent\nOn transportation but you have the oil within a break the twenty three about a dollar under Scott Walker or that doubling and eight years anybody thinks that sustainable is just bullish\nOn a partisan issue it only ... people say older Democrats take about Scott Walker with is the ... about saying hey we can't stop\n[noise] well it's interesting you bring that up because you also were joined by a former or a Republican leader mark godly who has served as a Governor Scott Walker's transportation secretary in any degree with us on that\nOne I think it was from I mean the very conservative guy and he would agree with me [laughter]\nAnd uh he he did something that I really respect and he was asked by the legislature by the governor to put it all out on the table Lulu use that term the Tony ... and he used it by coming up with ideas to ponder rose to come up with sustainable answer\nAndy did in the governor didn't pick one of the ideas\nAnd the front of the way pretty close to what your when you ask the governor when I was going to do it that you raise the gas tax colon index the heat index that you've covered the short term aid that has a long term you build up the far right\nExactly we get back to where we weren't too I I miss the roads being a leader in the roads missiles complements from people from other states saying look great roads we have ever had and\nI I miss the roads being a leader and the roads I miss those complements from people from other states saying look great roads we have\nEver had and uh we want to get back to that and I think we can I think there are some Republicans that are out there uh they're just waiting to be able to take the vote that doesn't make it to the floor right now and uh and in ... it's like they know we should\nHope so but you know goes uh I like the fact that all those guys are valid or those five whatever a\nGuy yeah paid for part of our our road\nWell that's another thing too is you got to remember when you do when you read the gas tax uh it's not just Wisconsin people paying at the pump it's people who are visiting our state or helping to fix or roads well one of the things I Want to ask you about it as we wind down here you mentioned you must have been in the state Senate in Nineteen eighty two and were were you not to\nSound like say the state assembly All right well let's go back to that era because everybody is right now because of the brewers you remember the brewers in a ... I mean so and so tell me how exciting was it back to being the assembly when they made it to World Series back then\nHarvey is all they are afraid to go and we're brought up we had we had picked up as a fast trays of health risks the I'll let you yeah I was a\n... or we traded fiscal Scott On Sunday and like every member for rally thinkers peaceful ... seven and focus headset fingers on Cy Young award for the Milwaukee has\nAn effect part of it was eighty two year I fortunately finger got hurt a playoff but all I remember as well as\nI haven't missed that game I have right now probably in the last month and a half I have a fever and I wanted to focus not vote for Miller Park\nOh you didn't know because I feel like getting caught up in it it was all paid for by the taxpayer you know when the Packers caveman and wanted to fix a lamp all feels first time they got fifty first on health not a hundred percent helping them to the rest of us they paid for by those so\nBad for you to a public private partnership office software but the like is what's half my office a promise that if we didn't give them the money to Mexico\nCity so they could call and the next the Mexico City surveys of\nReally even had a need to do\nA survey that spirit\nOh my gosh I didn't know this well now looking back aren't you glad it happened or well\nYeah I mean here's the thing glad it happened because I feel like the feel like family sold a the franchise the work of Dr whatever it famous\nNow guys that were put out that he put money into the program the fact that he put in resources to make this work that's why the brewers are where they're at today that they got a couple of general manager oh\nA or to get your division championship game that they had to play in Chicago a week ago and now with the Colorado Rockies who who came in with a hot bath or this or that that is playing a nominal baseball as\nI have to admit I didn't know a lot of the Rockies but did they learn yeah do you have a big meat of the line up and in fact a lot of people comparing him to the brewers in saying that uh they had some big bats but uh you know as baseball goes in what you always say it's booze hot at that time and the Rockies just weren't hot\nAnd the other factor is part of the reason why those rocky bats cooled off and it was the fact of her she was dominant for brewers and the Rockies or played I Believe it was\nTwenty eighth inning of baseball or twenty nine innings of baseball in twenty eight of those ending the Rockies did not score they only forty one inning and the short to run in game one and and that was it\nThat's all they did a in this series or the earth were just flat out dominant from beginning to end in this series\nYeah animal and Jefferson was the one who ah let him get a couple of those hits\nA or runs and uh he was a and the yeah the game on I'm writing a he was in their leading the game and they had a bad to finish it off in the final inning and I know it was because he probably told Craig ... let me let me do that because we could have easily a bad someone else bad for him\nAnd he did shut it down to get back on his horse\nHe looked great on struggling for his game greed on friday and the eighth inning and then he shut 'em down a good\nOf course he looked great on a you know he's struggling Thursday's game he pitch grade on friday in the eighth inning and then he shut them down a good in the ninth inning and then he had his staff it yes and uh there was no need at that point still need the the brewers had to go and eat deeper than the gold and\nLed Shaffer is a close this out and we've seen this\nYou know and it's so rare to see what the Milwaukee is doing with their bullpen right now they're not afraid to have multiple guys end apple pie and especially the guy's late in the gay\nIt can be hater it could be Shaffer is a story is your ears the only one guy but here in ... in particular and we've even seen it a bit from Corey in April\nFor all three of those guys can go more than in any rain at a time if need be in a relief effort and and we were the bullpen is right now they have\nThree guys pitching out in the lead levels in Jeffress in hater can naval and they've got two other guys that are really really good right now a lot of the bullpen\nPrimarily in in Cortland burns along with a story that that both in right now for you to lead after the fifth sixth standing or the other teams and major trouble\nLet me ask you do the different William coaching to not be afraid to pull you're starting to get going why not normal why don't a lot of teams do this to nominally\n... this is the new philosophy that the brewers are kind of a bird didn't start it but if you weren't teams are have been tinkering with this\nAnd and as we've heard probably quite council said we really don't have starters we don't ever leaders we have guys out get her we have to get one seven out every game that's our goal we don't care how many times arms we have to use to get it but that's what our job is\nAnd and the bigger reason why handy you're seeing this um and they talk the talk a little bit about this\nIn a couple of the television broadcast lately\nBut the more I batters stays up one picture\nTheir batting average goes up so if you look a lot of times and there was a big jump primarily from what I've ... I've seen a picture in the third at bat so really look at it this way most of the for starters you'll see them go through the oppose they line up twice\nBut rarely when you see them start a third go around because they they've got the relievers and the death behind them to go that way\nAnd and we start to see the the numbers the statistics show that no matter how good the pitcher is when you get to that third go around through the line up\nThat the other team it's more likely to put hit some lines on the board\nSo you think it was just one of the smart things are small market team can do to keep it usually afford in each other big market teams deemed captures is an alternative to lose around\nBut that's a great question and that'll be a better question quite frankly for for David Stern to to to ask him that question\nI don't know if the brewers have come up with this philosophy because of their their payroll structure kinds of at this time forces them to do it um or or they found it's more cheaper urge cheaper and more effective I should say\nTo a defined guys who gave you three four five thirty means maybe and then you fill your your rush here pitching rotation or I should say a pitching bench with with really good relievers they found some magic and and clearly it's working right now\nWell yeah and one of the things I think if you had a starter that to be a part of his last of ego and they're going to agree to do it this way to be successful in some of the personalities it'd be hard to do I would say\nThey have the ... going back to your last point they move towards a really good one\n[laughter] the birds can't afford to go on to shell out huge dollars for a front and start 'em ... named a lot of her fans were hoping for early this year that the rivers was signed up for the agency\nDidn't happen um in in large part because the bird didn't want to spend that type of money\nOr they found a way to get around that data boy the brewers like they have a picture like shake area that you're darn right they would but they're not going to spend that money through from the agency what they're going to do is try to develop those guys who can be topic and stars\nAnd that's what I hear the courtroom burns quite frankly he'll probably be in the starting rotation next year a wardrobe you'll probably see the starting rotation next\nYear we'll see who else the birth could pull up a Peralta will be in that study rotation next year birds are are trying to create those top line top not starters they're just not going to pay for it they're going to develop those started within their minor league organization\nAnd I think one of the most dangerous things to give a team like the brewers use rest and they're getting it right now to whoever the plane coming off five game series the brewers fresh bullpen like that it's dangerous isn't it\n... it is for the bullpen so you know the thing is Andy as much as you like that rest I don't know if that's the only one and a half for four days off before you play\nA tight timing you've got rid of them you just kind of have that flow going and so you're going to see that um come to an end what was interesting though I I Will tell you this\nUm I was curious about the the ... ah for the brewers having to have a a long break\nAfter sleeping\nI'm going to rocky so you know they they will not play\nEven till um friday and so what I found is the two teams the last year that swept the baseball uh uh divisional series or the Rockies if I remember ... or the Dodgers\nAnd the Astros they've all won their divisional series three games to none they had a break and they both came out that and they had no problems\nAre winning their league championship series and both making it to the world series so I'm I'm not saying it's a guarantee that the brewers are going to have that sweet occur um shall take that back last year the Dodgers\nAre swept the Arizona Diamondbacks and individual serious three games to none\nThen they beat the Chicago Cubs for the one in the league championship series so I'm ... I think if you swing the opposing team that delays knocking hurts grew is too much\nThe brewers are a small market team no matter what happens in large market teams is a breeze or the Dodgers who would you like to see comes ... who's next round independent Reese\nWho may hear a entertainment standpoint you want to see the Dodgers\nOkay you know a bad guy claimed her Shaw they've got an outstanding rotation great line up big names the Dodgers they're part of baseball folklore of of chess legends of when you think baseball do you think Yankees think Red Sox the Dodgers\nI think right now the Dodgers are able to play the Dodgers were the [noise] I noticed you didn't see the cubs [laughter]\nBoy your quick today ah wow so you would like to see the Dodgers but strategically would you rather have the Braves\nI think strategically rather clear the parade or their ... and not very good there are very young team uh they had the ... coming into the naturally playoff\nUm you know I think you were like from what he would be easier to beat the two I think he'd rather play the parade\nAll right well we're going to play this game like who would we rather see a inspires folklore and stuff wouldn't it be nice I Know the red Sox are hot right now and the other team to beat but would it be cool to see the Yankees and the brewers in the world series\n[laughter] yeah I mean we're in a spot right now we're here in Houston one earlier today over Cleveland\nSan Francisco's or next opponent ... be a good opponent to get back on the horse\nHe would do a different themes as they lost their starting quarterback Timmy ... below or through an ACL injury I think it was in either me to four weeks\nThree there uh they're not very good they just lost at home to Arizona who is not a very good football team and uh they're they're struggling right now there's one\nMonday Night football All right well thank you very much and we got to go run out of time and maybe we'll have you back later in the week to make a prediction as we enter a more ... came beautiful I think so much sheen sparks\nFormer sport's director I W W good friend of the show and that's it I'm On the program just in the box seats you for listening sharing this show was a friend to check on the podcast\nSharon I'm On social media sharing ways sharing is caring we'll have another big shows ... on a double you if you were going to have a a comedian John ... bears\nFan and he joined us tomorrow bears didn't lose his last week he played either good night by the [noise]\nNine morning do you have any trouble you more now on line at nine forty dollar use on\n\nABC News\nI'm Gary all ... the limousine that crashed in upstate New York and killing twenty failed a state inspection according to officials who are trying to determine exactly what\nHappened and she has to be nor the state police can say what they think may have caused the crash but are calling it a high energy impact of an entire\nEngine block has moved back and basically crushed moves back pass the driver's seat that would indicate there was a lot of force\nNTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt says his investigators will be unseen for the next several days as they look into the vehicle the driver roadway conditions and more ... of ABC News Schenectady New York\nOh hurricane warning now in effect for most of the Gulf Coast is Michael intensifies with eighty mile per hour winds\nMichael's forecast to be the most destructive storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in decades\nFlorida governor Rick Scott says the national guard has been activated as he anticipates Michael bringing up to a foot of rain and flooding in storms\nHarry family must be prepared every family remember we can rebuild your house and rebuild your life taken seriously and keep your family said mandatory\nEvacuations are in effect for parts of Panama City beach after over a week still a President Trump says he's had a nice talk with the deputy attorney general has not\nSaid specifically if President Trump and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein talked about Rosenstein John status when they met for about forty five minutes or an air force one and the flight to Florida Monday the White House officials said they discuss law enforcement issues border security how to address violent crime in Chicago and general Justice Department business\nEarlier Monday the president was asked if you had any plans to fire Rosenstein and he said quote no I don't ...

I Believe four hundred yards and thirty one point mix even notice he said that it's hard to feel like you want a game when the other team scored thirty one point so\nI I don't think LA's youth that team because I don't think all kinds of le they're there and what you're looking for the air but I I think that anybody who can really sort of move the ball or you're going to be able to do it a little bit against Alabama's place at least a little bit of pressure\nDogwood singer ... every day should be Saudi government's college football for SB Nation spends her well we know what I'm asking

exist in Harlem down\nYeah that's it there's there's there's one team that there is one team that out of class as everyone else and they're going to have to have a very very bad day in order for you to have a good day right like there is no we went in there\nAnd we took it to them right now just the wealth of resources and the execution there are so high that you know you're going to need four or five turnovers you're going to need the worst game to talk of the laws\nEver had I guess I should ask where is the next point [noise]\nProbably somewhere around like eight or nine mark like it's very difficult to me to be a really good actor Paul after like five or six but you know if you include like the Ohio State\nClemson and Clinton's right there and some of the house said it's just in terms of how it allows a lot of really big plays on defense and Clinton still working in several aren't the quarterback Clemson next year it's probably on the top flight then you have Notre Dame who is in years to curb this year\nAnd I think does have a pretty good like road to getting into the playoffs if they don't\nUh you know lose their costs but came along the way I'm\nMaybe Washington but but man that's that's so hard because they lost the offered like this is the actual issue right now their team that's going to likely win the conference lost her nephew C team that's having a real bad here it's only gonna get worse to resume wise that looks really bad for them\nUm that that's pretty much your next flight and then maybe maybe Texas in there or or maybe West Virginia but that's getting marginal\nI guess especially after the first week of the season is\nIs this Texas kind of coming together before our eyes or did yesterday thing on Saturday to things just go right for them on Saturday against Oklahoma are we going to see Texas now take that next step or do you expect Texas to have a step back here somewhere\nFor they play really tight games and it's a very dangerous but to assume that anyone's playing like well you know\nConstant stream of one sort games isn't going to drop one along the way because it takes so little to put you you know like to to put you into the L L right it takes so little to lose when you're playing type games that lets you found that out this week Ken Texas might find that out later on\nDown the road on the other hand taxes has gotten better and they're starting to go in different kinds of games and you know they want to shoot out the Oklahoma the closest pretty much everybody which is looked back they think Paul so that that came with the way closer than it should have been but\nI think you're seeing Texas improve every single week\nAnd they're getting very comfortable being in these kind of games and it seemed comfortable being and those kind of game it's a staring at very dangerous team so I Would lean more toward you're seeing improvement and you're seeing them learn to play within themselves and asked them out and do what he's comfortable doing within that game rather than trying to force thing\nYou're saying the more you play within themselves and a half an hour they're doing is comfortable doing within that game rather than trying to force say\nHey that's all the time it's college football for us to be there for that every day should be Saturday follow him on Twitter at ... at the Aspen every day should be

should always have the lives that are Yankee Stadium [laughter] that was the first year Yankee Stadium opened a new one open\nA we had gotten the the clubs seats and they take you into this back room or it's like a buffet and you just pick whatever yeah like I said think up lobster and they're like ... ridiculous thing\nThat would normally be way outside the price range with normal person it's all they eat as much as you want it was the guy next was literally had like eat lobster tails and he just thought that shower and through\nThe that's the half the reason behind build a new ballparks so they could you know the people to the gills and get them to pay for it so uh now this does plenty of tasty food around here and um especially if you can afford it so\n[laughter] it and saying what though there are you know when there aren't a whole lot of baseball teams you walk through and it's like marble pillars in marble floors and like wait a minute you know am I Am I at a baseball stadium or mine Vegas well over here is the steakhouse so maybe I Am in\n[laughter] that's right that's right well it is you know this place is a little bit of a it doesn't have a little bit of a museum feel to it especially um you know especially sort of the out the outside of it or the you know if you're looking at it as you're walking in the street or you know walking down the concourse was outside or\nYou know behind the stands and stuff like that but uh something that's developed fear that um that was not going on the first you know for most of the first decade in this new building was\nA this place started having some real atmosphere here on the post season last year um place was was pretty quiet for the first you know six or seven years at the new Yankee Stadium but a fans really got charged up by this new group and um you know Yankees seven oh in the postseason here the last two\nLeft to October and uh you get you get that rock is crowd again this ballpark that used to get back at the old place that had disappeared for a while to be honest\nI might tonight you got loose Marino and native all day on the bump tonight now a page or on the news had I guess opined the idea that maybe Severino is pitching hurt because of his struggles down the stretch\nOf course he has to deny it but do you think ... might be pitching with some kind of injury which would explain why he's just looks like a different pitcher for the last six weeks\n[laughter] yeah I mean it's certainly possible I mean look you know most most major league starters I N relievers for that matter at this stage of season are are pitching through something um they don't want to talk about it usually I don't want to make excuses especially in the biggest games of the year\nYou know the Yankees publicly uh all along have if you want to call it denying it or just I'm just kind of brushed it off and said you know look he's the velocity is still there um you know sharpness of command\nMaybe came and went especially in the second half but uh you know if he if something was really wrong I don't think the Yankees would have been sending them out there\nUm you know making every start in the second half I think that would have shut 'em down a little bit to get them ready to get them healthy you know he's a picture with\nGreat present and future ahead of them they've got a lot invested in him at the top of the rotation and if there was something really wrong I don't think you would have been out there uh you know making every start in the second half now\nHe's struggle yeah I mean you probably know there was no way he was going to pitch as well and the second half of them the first half a he was in the lights out he was so consistent on the first to have\n'em but I you know I think uh I I think he's he was certainly healthy enough to go out there all along and he's really come back at last you know left you out with a I think he's really regain the confidence the coaching staff and manager are going on the front office by the way he's throwing the ball on you know he gave them\nEven though he didn't last that long in the wild card game or give them for really outstanding innings electric innings um you know worked hard to get out of jams its stuff was very good and um you know she's back out there tonight and I think you know we'll see you know to get knocked around that doesn't mean he wasn't necessarily healthy\nUm or wasn't necessarily you know not healthy but uh I I think I think he's a I think physically he's in good shape we'll just see what kind of started gives them and I think that's a good report in\nAll right if you're Alex Cora does Aaron Judge see a strike tonight\n[laughter] oh sure you have to because the lineup is so deep top to bottom I mean you know that's a nice idea like oh let's just pitch around there and judge for the you know if it can cause damage red hot\nOr you know like he was at times during the season let's just pitch around him but when the Yankees are healthy um you know top to bottom there's too many hitters in there to to be able to work around do you know this guy that guy or you know you just run into another really\nPitch around him but when the Yankees are healthy um you know top to bottom there's too many hitters in there to to be able to work around do you know this guy that guy or you know you just run into another really good hitter behind them um and that's that's the only\nBecome more so with the you know the addition of a guy like little voice who has been a you know it's been a really dangerous hitter not surprisingly so since he arrived here in New York so now that that's one of the great things for the Yankees\nAre one of the biggest strength is the depth of their line of top to bottom that can hurt you from every spot in the order um [noise] they had I think at least you know ten home runs\nA from ... from guys this year they\nI'm Lenny home runs from every spot in the batting order and so you can't just you know it's around this guy that guy even a guy like judge who's getting red hot here you got to try to get them you know get them out with quality strikes if you put them on in the situation where there's you know there's nobody else on this two outs maybe in and go after the next guy okay fine but\nIf you just spend the whole game just walking him four times you know he's got a good I he's not going to go chasing after pitches in the dirt too often and we just put them on four times it's gonna be too much traffic and that'll come back to fight to the Yankee the wind up knocked the guys in\nWhat do you think is the outcome science game there in the Bronx [noise]\nHard to say I mean you know these two teams could go either way I I I tend to think we're probably going to get a five game series here I'm not all that surprised with you know that some of the other division series seven have ended fairly quickly\nUm [noise] those those particular match ups but you know these two teams are due to heavy weights that through the best teams in baseball they play each other all the time\nUm you know I think the Yankees do have a little bit of a home field advantage here over the next few days and the Yankees have a whole and ah that's better equipped to probably to win a short series so I'm even though the red Sox\nHad a better team all year long I think the Yankees' bullpen and the moves that they made\nUm mid season you know before the trade deadline picking up guys like that in fact Britain ... voiced them um [noise] and Jay half that you know the help the rotation you know they they became a deeper team in the middle of the year and I think they're on par with the red Sox at this point and I think um\nYou know I think I'd be very surprised that the Yankees don't win at least one of their home games I'd be a little surprised to know the red Sox lose one if they're not able to bounce back the next day so I think there's a good chance we're you know we're going five games here\nNow which of these two teams do you think is that every quipped to deal with the Houston Astros in a seven game series [laughter]\nYou know that's an excellent question um [laughter] uh nobody wants to play that seeing right now um I wouldn't want to either I think they still have the best team\nOr just like they did last year um the combination of starting pitching a depth in the bullpen that people don't realize you know because they look at the hospitals open and they see some of the feeling that they had last year against the Yankees and the world series but you know they're able to put", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "08"}
