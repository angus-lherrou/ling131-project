goring you're not doing grants\nHey glad to be here and they feel like I've been trapped in a roller coaster for two days straight\nWow are you getting sick\nLook out of the uh the markets definitely traveled a pretty good distance up and down a yesterday and today\nAll right well should we sell or should we buy or you could just start by saying I'm reading a something as soon as the Dow is now on track for its worst month since May of two thousand ten who's a mean\nYeah so\nSo I don't you know I never want to go on\nGo on the air and give my opinion because there's a million other people giving their opinions and wealth is the\nThe point is trying to share your insight into what's happening underneath you\nRead the tea leaves for what's happening underneath the headlines so people couldn't formulate their own to\nEducate opinions on what's going on so here's the thing there is there a lot of different opinions as to why the markets has these like volatile moves and we've seen so many of these volatile move this here where the major indices are they moved by two percent or more\nAnd they're always voices that say we're headed lawyer lower and they post to host of reasons to support\nTheir claim and his voices that say every pull back as a buying opportunity and that's how you make money by buying when everyone else's scared and I went off the selling so the simple truth is the market as I'm processing a lot of new information it doesn't really know the answer to\nThat when there's uncertainty they're selling and there's profit picking and so let's put things in the perspective of the markets had one heck of a run\nSince the bottom it reached in two thousand nine and we're in the tail end of a very active corporate burning season right now and the markets have been a centrally voting on next year's corporate earnings landscape right now it's signaling doubt that companies can deliver\nOn the expected earnings growth of ten percent and revenue growth of Ninety six percent for two thousand Nineteen\nUh why is that well six months ago we had a pretty robust economy\nWith the ... gift of math the corporate tax cuts flashes to regulations and and just the past few weeks we're seeing more attention being paid to things like China's economic slowdown the uncertainty around the tear up and we'll get back to that later\nAnd the president basically scaring the markets about the fed raising rates to aggressively and remember it's everyone the perception that politicians know more about what's going on inside the economy than\nThan the average person does so when someone like the president goes on a tirade about the fed potentially killing the economic growth cycle where it takes a toll on traders minds and traits triggers take profit\nHe my head and what you just sit there how come a senator cannot go into the Senate and the beginning being a hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and then when they retire as the senators or a multi millionaire how does that work\nOh let's go between it's they're holding doors between the public office and the and being a a a a lobbyist my my my friend has been happening for a long time and and always will happen is that what is the slump that was supposed to be drained if you can remember back\nOkay yeah I remember news so you you know the the president does affect the market when he starts shooting his mouth off boats and then he doesn't want you to street so high so what do they get what you so you see they're getting ... ... what are they doing as a result of that\nOkay so let's let's put it this way uh\nSince October first the pay five hundred his last\nSince October first just twenty four days ago at them he's lost over eighty percent of its value not ... not including today's action by the way to today we we we we had a nice broad base rally and lived out his last six and a half percent ... percent to ... in a month and you know what's interesting to me even though there's been a lot of hand wringing and nervousness\nOver the impact of a tariff on corporate earnings and forecast the corporate earnings companies have been really really vague about it\nAnd that's you know the ... the direction of the tariffs are unclear and companies are saying it's too early to tell\nHow the tariffs are going to affect their earnings and or they've been thing yet there's been some impact but they're able to change suppliers they've been able to pass on price increase it to the consumers because personal spending a syllabus so companies are taking all kinds of measures to avoid hits to their margins\nThey knew it was coming back when Trump was elected and they plan to head as a traitor or investor\nThe main question you asked yourself before you deploy any of your capital of the market is do I believe the market price for perfection right now or do I believe there's a lot of bad news baked into cake right now in the market has jitters it's really just turning risk reward presents at any given time and right now is the kind of interesting I'm looking at\nA historical market trend that has the market's\nRising an average of eight percent from mid October to the end of the year during mid term election season\nUh so that's that's the season Audi as they say the ... of of the market is going to be have tail wings now and I think 'cause\nI promised I wouldn't give my opinion but I think the market's going to recover quite buy into the euro and what scares me the most is that Morgan Stanley we've talked about the past few weeks Morgan Stanley came out today and said that they are this is all scary to even read this out loud is is that in Morgan Stanley\nFeels like it's starting to sniff out a Republican sweep during the ... and that\nIf the Republican sweep or both houses of Congress again they would argue that they're going to be more fiscal stimulus\nAnd more funding that would cause rates to spike off of this is Morgan Stanley cheap us equity strategist said that uh so it's kind of interesting how the how the market has been reacting to raise a rising interest rates for really all about all of the October and it really has nothing to do with a a really has nothing to do with the\nCorporate earnings picture as it does ah the thirty year mortgage now flirting with the five percent mark a which it hasn't done for the past eight or ten years\nNow I haven't heard some analysts Gore and say\nThings like this they go well do you go well in this recession happens it's going to happen it wouldn't matter who matter who's the president in other words in President Trump's fault if it should happen it's going to happen anyway and that's just normal that's just the way things are is that true\nWell you know there there are economists basically think there are two things that cause economic attractions and that his interest rates being too high and innocence spike in oil prices so what happened in the past few weeks is really really kinda telling\nAs to what a what Trump and others in a in government are expecting to be easy\nA few weeks is really really kinda telling\nAs to what a what Trump and others in a in government are expecting to be easy to talk of two thousand Nineteen and beyond because Trump has intensified his attacks against the fed chief uh Powell in a Wall Street interview Wall Street journal interview this week the accuses\nPowell threatening economic growth by raising interest rates so quickly and that this would cause the recession with important to note that the Federal Reserve was designed to be independent or being swayed by politicians\nSo the question on every economist mine and traders mind as well the fed act to aggressively and choke the economic expansion or will they be too lax and allow inflation to start hammering consumers you can see they're dangerous to being too aggressive and dangerous to being too passive and the key is finding that Goldilocks approach and every governor\nAnd effort limousine member knows is far better than the rest of the rest of us they monitor the economic numbers every day and data that's released and they have a meeting to discuss the data and they hold their strategy and that said every fed governor wants what's best for the continued healthy growth of our economy none of them are stupid\nUneducated and need flash cards to understand the math behind what they're doing they're all really smart people and I warn anyone trying to glean anything for the Federal Reserve policymakers than public\nBecause they always hold this line and the forward looking things and the cold risks are balance they really have an intermediate to long term approach and doing what's right for the economy Trump on the other hand the\nOnly one of the numbers to keep looking good short term so he can keep taking credit for everything so let me be clear in the interview with the wall Street Journal this week President Clinton Trump clearly stated that quote the biggest threat to his presidency presidency is the Fed's rate hike\nSo he's trying to drop drop on down the\nFad or who has said that they're going to raise one more time this year and three more times in two thousand Nineteen ah tried to keep the economic expansion a going and not cause it was\nAll right so what you see let me just because I'm trying to digest says he's the president gets his way into the feel threatened in the\nLower the interest rates are don't follow through their plan then bringing a recession on earlier as a result was because he just not looking you know he doesn't seem that far out or what what what is what is it\nI I don't think he thinks he well this is not my opinion this this is the way he conducted himself in terms of policy statements he's made publicly here really only looks at the success of his presidency as\nA how good it compares with with his predecessors so he wants he wants the jobless numbers he wants he wants a interest rates to the lower he wants more than\nOn so many words says that's a gift for the Republican Party as we approach election day I'm\nGoing to talk a little bit about what's happening with the caravan and get a little deeper into what we can expect going forward so this is not an isolated event this will be an issue that will be developed nations are going to have to deal with\nContinually and more so in in the years to come I just want to say that very clearly the White House and Congress have absolutely no idea what to do about math migration they have no idea that the Democrats are talking about it because they don't know what to do either but right now\nThe images of how the marchers prepared to storm across our border it's surely\nOnly help all the Republicans I mean Trump Trump using this weapon of where you will to his own political advantage right you can't do anything meaningful to address the caravan capitalize on it\nHe's tried nearly closing the border is try to separate rating children from their parents\nTo more of a thing to do all throughout Mexico the fame in agreement that would require migrant passing through Mexico with the United states and Mexico and we have learned that this is what causes John John Kelly to Heather screaming match outside the office that required Secret Service to break it up\nWithout anyone will come over here in the middle east are Middle Eastern mix to a team leader happy with Mitt that well I Know I have no proof of that I'm just I'm just\nI'm just making noises with it so there's a voter anxiety that you're right that the border\nAnd my my mouth and making noise as with it so they're sticking voter voter anxieties that's the geo picking plant right that they're still working border anxiety because they can't talk about tax cuts could it just helped the corporation and they can't they tried to repeal Obamacare that hurt them all they did was confirmed Trump conservative judges\nThat cleans their evangelical base a and now they're just talking about the uh the care about the caravan so this is the problem is is this okay ... there were massive wealth disparities between nations\nThe attraction of Europe and North America will continue to rise the math migration will only increase because of climate change is making vast areas of the tropics less and less habitable for millions of people refugee resettlement\nAuthorized migration are going to become the most pressing pressing issues in the western politics in the years ahead we've\nAlready seen wealthy developed nations become paralyzed by the reality of billions of poor people in different countries who are going to have the means and motive to move to rich country than in two thousand Fifteen\nJust a moment very loose in the borders in Germany for a few months lead to a million people\nComing a million people and the pressures that every wealthy nations are going to face with refugee and immigration and look at an immigrant migration will only grow in the decades ahead\nThis caravan right now just exposes\nThe vulnerabilities and our current system migrants who get apprehended for entering illegally can claim what the term credible fear of returning home and they see us asylum because their numbers overall overwhelmed the capacity of\nThe authorities and because children may not be detained for more than twenty days the odds are decent than a family will get released into the country while their case works its way through the system and during during those years the children will attend school or maybe born and they will be us citizens making family separation issue\nAnd a deportation order if asylum in the night will take years to enforce so in most cases enforce that will not happen so we make this clear neither political party in the U.S has a solution for this because of the matter is not an isolated one it's something that's going to grow as we have climate refugees as well as political asylum refugees\nAt third world country that grow increasingly unstable in the face of a rapidly progressing as a global climate change but in the meantime boy oh boy the Democrats I'm Sorry the Republican sure scaring the bejesus out of everybody especially when you watch Fox News'\nSean Hannity makes it seem like they're a you know they're all armed and they're going to come here and they're going to or they're going to harm us that it's\nIt's really sad it's a very sad situation but this is one of those scenarios where this is not an isolated event lawmakers have to come together and find a workable solution for this issue building a wall is not an issue arresting these people it's not an issue you have to have some empathy\nYou have to be human you have to find a way to deal with this because this to happen in the years to come not only the United states but every wealthy develop patient around the world\nOh you do such a good job of breaking that down because you you you pointed that the real problem and that is both sides of all of our leaders are Democrats Republicans independents do you do talk about a solution\nIn for whatever reason maybe they just simply don't know the void solution of how we're going to handle\nA immigration in the future knew full well he's going to increase and this wall uh you're right I mean I don't know what you think about the wallet for folks that are listening but unless we get rid of all ladders and airplanes that wall is not going to do anything to a ... problem\nAnd I ... I think I think it's a wall it's symbolic because the law gives us I mean it it's almost it's almost terrifyingly simple isn't it\nYou have this image this image you know\nDoing for like they say doing something is better than nothing right so you have to seem like you you you gave it to you know you addressed it and\nIf the wall fail a tropical blame someone else fourth I think that that's a really sad thing he's not really looking for an answer a and I'm sure that there are a lot of sensible Republicans in Congress who understand the full magnitude of this issue\nAnd they themselves also believes the wall is just lost her it's just all egotistical it's just something for him to pump up his face with a you know when when one guy when he has rallies and people are chanting\nYou know CNN sucks and they're they're attacking Jim Acosta um though those are the people who have seen the needs to please by giving them something to ah to talk about and let's face it the wall and immigration was the main\nMain cornerstone of up Trump's a rise to power a and that means our our own people in this country needs to be educated little better and we need to hold all of our elected officials not just the president's this isn't a problem that the president alone path to solve\nSomething every elected official in this country has to solve because these people are are in our communities\nAnd we have to be we have to address this tentatively\nWe call ourselves to the beacon of hope and democracy for the world to be jealous of it for the world to admire we have to act that way we can't we can't\nAct with threats and meanness and uh we we just can't act the way it's like we we have we have the faith\nWe have the base the entire meaning of of what the United States of America stands for by by taking the approach that we have right now\nAre we going to the final break or what what do you want to talk about when we come back a few minutes I got something in the president's cell phones have you heard about that China's listening in\nAnd he he will not he's relentless on giving that up because if he ah he's talking on anything else other than his personal ...\nYou know gets a T and all that you just want that's who is the result is he's using his personal cell phone in China there's good I guess we get some some knowledge is yeah there are actually listening to all these conversations you have any so we'll do that they will touch on that ... bunch of other stuff right after ... stuck in the middle do go\nWay beyond baseball got stuck in the middle of\nThe latest W W news headlines every morning in your inbox by signing up more than you every W morning museum\nLong under nine forty W.

play first base normally he would have been replaced with Dave Stapleton\nInstead history was made the met would win game seven and become eighty six world champs [noise]\nIf you just look at the box score Carmelo played almost forty minutes\nHe was nine and seven zenia twenty two points he had seven boards and the fifth to steal to assist or stealing a block he was three of a from three you'd say okay well that that wasn't a bad game you know some of the other games that Carmelo has had so far this year\nNine points seven points three of can nine points on three of ten eleven points on three of ten it's almost like a thing for your time periods and for your time then it was pretty before getting nine a Seventeen\nLast night\nAnd say All right well you know what that's that's not a bad game from Carmelo we've had yeah twenty two and seven what's what's wrong with that\nWhat's wrong with that is he supposed\nTo be a guy this team can lean on to get points when they can't lean on hard and when they can't lean on Paul\nAnd that was missing that was missing particularly late\nBecause once you know the rocket had gotten this game it was eighty four Seventy nine\n\nTo ... to hit him with the assist and then from there the rockets go cold hardened comes out of the game\n\nAnd\nThe next time we feed Carmelo score a basket\nIt's Ninety four eighty one of five point game became a Fifteen point game before Carmelo Anthony made a bucket\nWhen harden left the game that's my problem\nThat was the moment like miss was a perfect example this was a moment where the horn coming off the court for Carmelo to step up\nThis was a moment where Carmelo to\nEverybody wrong justify\nHis being in Houston show everybody he can still be that lead dog one he needs to be and what did he do he did the same crap and he's been doing what's next for years he rolled over\n\nFour years ago you know when when Carmelo was good Carmelo would demand the ball and the fourth quarter and Carmelo wouldn't\nMake shots well from eighty four Seventy nine with five fifty five to go and hard and coming out\n\nNext time we\nFeed Carmelo Anthony make a basket\n\nIs not until one fifty remaining it took him four minutes after James Harden left it jumped Carmelo four minutes to score\nAs his team was getting blasted four minutes\nNot only did it take him four minutes to score it took him four minutes shoo shoo ...\nWhat are we what are you in Houston for\nGod Knows your point de Mello\n\nTheir best off as a weapon leaves the game and you decide not to engage Farr\nClassic\nLeadership mellow classic leadership\n\nSo at that point the game is over\nIt's a third team going game where the minute Fifteen or go and then what's the first thing Carmelo does after he makes that Eighteen foot poem jumper commits a foul and puts Donovan Mitchell on the line for two\n\nThen Carmelo makes a a garbage three with nine seconds to go and your final score is one hundred eighty nine when the rockets you did Carmelo Anthony Carmelo Anthony was andme Hi hey\nCole or me surprise\nOr not\nCarmelo Anthony's is bigger reason why they need Jimmy Butler\nOr not\nCarmelo Anthony's as big a reason why they need Jimmy Butler is any\nWhen you need Carmelo to step up and lead Carmelo vanished water surprise maybe you could put his hoodie on next time straight he\nComes in radio networks for his

be in\n... right uh though I mean of course everybody in the crowd is thinking they would love to see him get back in there and scored more points um [noise]\nIt is it is interesting because obviously curious that a lot of fourth quarter in his lawyers career I mean even before Kevin Turan showed up that was somewhat of a norm the oil spill get so far in a way better than than everybody else and that's how they sort of got rest\nFor him and I'm In these fascinating to see\nWhat those numbers would be like with even you know four or five minute some fourth quarter ... because you know had a

quite but\nMan it is it is truly something else there's nobody else in the league that can do it quite like him there's a lot of guys who were copying them don't get me wrong he has created a whole
