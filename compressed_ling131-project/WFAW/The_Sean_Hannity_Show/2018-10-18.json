F. A. W. Bobby euchre making the call course\nYou know one of the last I think that will go after actually just because of the Republican battery\nWe also to point out a lot of things to point out on this or that he is stepping away from a two hundred and eight thousand dollar a year salary job to be able to go and speak freely against Governor Walker and that's just stunning\nIt is starting that's a lot of money to put aside because you believe so and I was hit the police force credibly strongly ah that at your civic duty\nTo come out and try and a lot Tony emerge 'cause he's actually now in stores Tony for governor and I don't know for a fact but I Would be I Would that help through a dollar they never resort to Democrats office before I was yeah\nYeah I Know it's talk a little bit about weed it was supposed to be a public private entity\nTo try and do things differently I mean the concept sounds good on paper but I remember you and I were there when it first got created I remember you were the one that first pointed out he wears your mission statement what do you hope to accomplish and they want you on that then you want to have a mission statement and that was amazing to you right\nWell yeah I mean are dealing with young man that was part of that but you know we've said well what before you start this operation you know you need time for a transition but put together a business plan you couldn't get a woman with autism wise but failed to do that and have a court\nBefore the years especially weren't credible Iraqi with no loans being need people that\nI you know visit any no loans they continue to seek it gets fun for one visit whenever we clarity want the money to pay off is Rodney that\nFire memory and all the good old days well you know now I kind of\nSolve the mystery because I remember Mr ... he always looked so downtrodden and not only was he taking the criticism that we gave but he was also a not having any ideas go anywhere in the in the board or the back room with the governor and sounds like\nWell you know ... his statement was just the whole theory you know he says that basically and and the other cabinet secretaries I mean this is\nThree of them signed a letter ... saying that you know essentially says if the governor of port is political interests ahead of the ... people Wisconsin walls that\nThat's the you know unacceptable I mean obviously I think that is really going to have a very adverse impact on the governor's a prospect for reelection because you know maybe ... or\nYou know my aunt Mary in a you know if you know the area you know people don't like it was political and persuade turned over to the you know after he said he was he lives I\nYou know working to get the outs and\nI'm like any for longer than that and I told a bunch of Iowa off work all the equipment the mayor the mayor Dick or knows\nThat he did it you know because he wanted to win the Iowa primary\nUm yeah I remember that you know and I have driven by then you know you have to you kind of in your mind's eye imagine what it would have looked like had a that going in I Know there are some people are just ... casinos or even a Peter this is um was more of a tourist attraction than anything you want to do all around the world\nAre these hard rock cafe is correct\nWhile that's\nJust the issue I mean a lot of you know first of all it didn't pass a referendum apple pie and by you know the biggest issue and the only person so look when I found it was going to be our priority that\nI work this uprising entirely differently 'cause then I knew you'd have lost acceptable there says Dr ... conference center I said this is the time he said uh and you know I'll never forget I'm Tim Allen who he for law Iraqi call me\nOn the week the Governor Kasich in and if we got it in the bank governor promised us all done deal when he got to find the compact on friday is going to sign a contract only to find out that Wednesday just signed a contract propriety\nYou need all the contract and he got in the ... campaign and but that's what Paul ... than that's the real point here today that people have to understand I don't I I\nI think it would be it'd be hard pressed to find anywhere in the country we've ever had for former cabinet secretaries or governor I\nYou know it'd be so outspoken against them and you know three of whom is actually endorses democratic opponent Republican\nRight and and the force we have to point out you didn't signed a letter and he didn't he didn't uh indoors too many years as of yet he might but he has a New York Mets are former a a colleague on the Republican side of the Republican leader in the state assembly as well\nI went on to be the transportation secretary under Governor Walker a mark got leaving was uh he uh left in twenty Fifteen and what he did a little different than the rest so full disclosure he recently said Walker was\nNot truthful not truthful\nAnd increasingly an accurate in comments about transportation funding so we have to kind of a point that out that's great\nYeah is it a little different track and then the other three but uh I Would have never guessed that Paul gene would have been joining this bunch a ... you you you the same way right\nOr just after the oil is startling I mean and you know one thing to have you know just one of your cabinets are very tall and give it credibility\nThree make it you know just a overwhelming awful I mean they're all essentially they well they all ... all three of them the same thing in a wider at the time today and then before they make is an indoor ... off and and the and the governor's but aren't hurtful\nWell let's talk a little bit about health care that seems to be the hot topic of the polls saying I can talk to your friends and neighbors they sent\nA and I mentioned this earlier with representative walks but uh the governor is really a strong voice now on coverage for pre existing existing conditions ah when did that start to represent an part Marco\nWell you know I'll never forget last year when the house of representatives Republican ... voted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act eventually any pre existing condition\nI'm looking out for every ... voted\nTo repeal the Affordable CARE Act actually any pre existing condition and we're going to get the flexibility July I\nAllow people to raise rates on people with preexisting condition and Governor Walker was the first one in line to take a\nCall that a couple of days later I had my story a written and odd Donnelly have lied and I'm caught\nA couple of days later rethought popular was he said well do you want to do that he wanted to find some other way but let's be clear and a couple things first of all what the Republicans are primarily talking about going back or they have any high risk pool\nWhich were good time because that's all we had an awfully lot of people do ball fine they're very tempted to do\nThat was a governor that it might be willing to go along with protecting preexisting condition as long as people are in the same job\nWell that will power for most people because um I work for the expert how people\nAre going to work for the job five time but French career five times so you know for many people they get laid off others their company shot down\nCompany handle with it because they have family obligations left out in the cold even what the government that\nIs the back with you\nKnow this is not the theme is what we currently have under law which probably\nYou are given dishes worked our what jobs or whatever it might be and they can't raise rates side\nBut we all know the only way this works is if everybody else I'm sure it it could go on top is going to say okay I'll insure you\nWhen you're out some serious disease and I won't do it and that's why the Affordable CARE Act is so essential or something like it that will cover everybody because as we all go anywhere all one serious car accident\nFor one terrible diagnosis ... and the circumstances and I it's just shameful or the Republicans are playing politics with this\nAnd they can see why but he is in court branch shovel\nThe file to ah to any pre existing conditions as you know about the federal government and that's the only true protection we asked so I'll watch he\nHeld Fred shovels don't want to look for a walk through to either change your arm I really want to give the strongest protection for it it's just it's all just rhetoric and I don't believe he's going to do that\nAnd without that is his rhetoric and it means nothing\nStart tomorrow and that was the whole plan but that had nothing to do with why we lost well let's go back to Tuesday nights game major league baseball find many Machado what a jerk\nFor appearing to drag his leg into his dues Aguilar Tuesday night while running to first base and I'm getting the the story or from\nTMZ for in Milwaukee a former major league umpires told today's TMZ for that he believed Machado should have been the jak did\nFrom the game for what's being described by some as a dirty play there were some uh talking heads by the way I'm are saying well I I don't know what what was going I don't know if he ... he meant to do it\nOh my gosh you know and so this is Bruce Fleming a hope I'm seeing is my name right Bruce Fleming of Mac one set I was disappointed to be honest about it you didn't see anything done\nPriming sprint is a whole career traveling across the country is a ... will be a empire he watched on TV as Machado drag just fought in the egg you'll ours ankle\nAfter a routine infield ground ball in the tent and he was obviously away he was showing his frustration I don't care you don't do that you're making millions of dollars\nAnd that's the way you act\nWas flagrant and as an official it's your job to protect the other players he said for trying to hurt another individual you kinda G jak them absolutely\nTo protect the other players he said for trying to hurt another individual you Kenny G jak them absolutely\nMachado scored the winning a run in the thirteenth inning\nTo tie the and I'll see a series to to to of course now they've taken the lead you in there when yesterday the Dodgers Machado was informed by the league's fund front office that he would be find an undisclosed amount of money\nSome brewers fans believe that's letting him off too easily I'm One of those\nMoney to him it doesn't mean much being ejected would've\nAnd would have meant a lot to his manager as well I'm sure so there you go out what do you think do you think you should have been adjusted do you think ah the I'd like to know what the find is\nI think that the why is that undisclosed we should know what are they hiding on that one is that it's not they know that it's not enough to really do much and people would be upset about that or who knows I don't ... it was so just tell us how much he's fine\nBut anyway a game or what are we up to now\nAh I Know\nSix six a game six and do math in my head I stayed up for that game they're talking about the thirteenth ending oh man I was hurting unit the next day ...\nAnd it wasn't worth it because they lost but I just couldn't I knew if I went to bed I wouldnt sleep so and then one by one each other or my family members I'm going to go to bed or

the bad news I like I'm In San Loni covers the Dodgers courtroom blew LA with SB Nation he's Ryan wall gone run [noise]\nBrian [noise] this\nArea is going on but I never go hey what's happening\nSo ah your Dodgers are going on the road up three games to two and a\nHad a couple of games here I got to tell you some of these games the the way that ah that council manages his pitching staff has is kind of wacky or\nDoes how would you like is it a a an issue you see the Dodgers have gotten over this issue of him a with these starting pitchers that go in any more or less\nI think the the biggest mission was that they just fell into the trap\nEarly in the theory of\nGetting their guys you know for the women with early in the game and going to the bench within an ending or two because they've they've ... the starter out I I think they kinda got away from that the last couple of days they put that on the ...\nCody boundary on the line up regardless of the left yesterday which I don't know how much the daughter her really prepared for white Mali to go out there and uh with the ... you know it's been for the first batter and he's really going to wind up to go and change that but\nI think that when you got a guy like ... monthly ... thirty five home runs is they're just gotta let him go out there and doesn't matter who's going to be on the mound when you're better hitter so\nCrazy Pittsburgh has been really to get the advantage and mainly because I don't think they they really have had a a really strong starting pitcher to lean on so he probably council has been doing a really good job with\nA mix of matching is guys in there but uh and you think that after you know five ... now but that Balkan would be kind of a running racket but I still think that the Balkans probably in pretty good shape for the brewers moving for a day off today\nSo it it it's going to be interesting to see how long how long of a leash ... tomorrow and are and what they've got wind that will Josh later\nNow when you know they know that mile is going to pitch games they actually do one batter and you walk through many took 'em out now for game six I mean do you expect ... to go more than what three three innings only allowed to do more than three innings\n[laughter] without question the ah I I think that he probably a probably going to have ... the two times dirty order and let me get into some type of trouble I don't think that a\nCouncil is going to sit back and let him give up on her new so if he gets into a situation where he's going to have you guys on bases loaded maybe early on you might decide to pull the trigger then he's got all those guys rested up\nReady to go in a game six elimination style ... he's going to happen to go to hate or maybe for three or however you define your but which might put a back quite a bit for game seven so\nI but if you count for you can't really think about getting seven at the at the time so if if why wait hardly get any kind of trouble\nBut he's not going to hesitate to go to that ... and early\n... per saw pitched a terrific game\nIn game five yesterday seven innings one earn runs forgotten nine who's done it was exactly the Clayton saw that people expect to see when he goes out on them out but\nHis postseason career is littered with peaks and valleys he has great games and then he's got well not great games\nYou know in game one of the the CS\nHe didn't have a great game ... runs with three innings before that and getting to the you know the U.S against ah Atlanta shutout innings where what game yesterday mean for ... or\nDoes it not mean anything until he pitches like that to insist certainly in a World Series and brings home a title for LA\nYeah well the narratives definitely not going away into\nThey get that monkey off their back in and take care of business in the world series and finally bring back\nA championship after thirty long years of not having one it's going to be there I mean half of his start you got twenty starts in the postseason over his career and eleven of those you could put in the category of really good really great I mean he's got the seven ... seven most\nAll the time of start to ... ... and water under less\nWell he's got all those starts that he's given a five six seven eight run the cardinal killed them early on in the end if you have him Thirteen or some of those years he just got beat up on and a lot of that was where where he had to go on three days rest a lot and you had problems with both in coming in and not [noise]\nOr to some of those years he just got beat up on and a lot of that was was where he had to go on three days rest a lot he had problems with both in coming in and not\nDoing the job for him but there's definitely a part where he struggles mightily and in game one he had problems putting guys away there was a lot of soft contact with a bloopers here and there but which led to a bigger inning and and he just kinda got behind it ... those kinda things will happen but\nA ... and so he can prove that it's going to be consistent I don't think the national there is going to go away everybody in LA kind of an cringes knowing that he's our he's going to be our best but then\nYou know there's always that that thing hanging around like is it going to be one of those really great stars or is it going to be that fifty percent shot of\nHim going out and given up five runs and and I mean three innings was whether the shortest\nStarted his post in career in game one I mean it it just shows you that the difference between how how good he's been in how bad because he goes from eight shutout innings to bringing him where he gets Sheldon and comes out in the fourth\nDo you think it has a big impact on the team when\nHe has a game where he struggles with many has another game where he's he's really and do you think it's it has a a a high and low effect on the whole team\nI think in years past it has I think this you're seen as a little bit deeper and especially uh you know if it's cursed doesn't get it done then they they've got rid of its pitching while they've got fewer who's pitching while even though he didn't\nNecessarily get the job done so far in the postseason but rich you can definitely go out and give you five solid and it's like getting game for\nIt's a lot cheaper of a team where they've got some guys like you know page will buy as for incidents in the in the bullpen and struggled in years past of getting big out in the postseason or even struggle in the last couple of years in the regular season and he's been dominant so they've got some arms in the bullpen that are\nShutting down at the moment and making it a little bit easier on the rest of the theme I I think that seems pretty confident in who they've gone on the roster and they've been saying all year that that\nThey've they've got full confidence no matter who goes out there so in years past they might have been crushed shots are guy and and if he's not doing well then that's two games in the series that might not go your way but\nI think that the debt that they have on the team is really carry them and and they're confident matter who's out there do\nYou think ah regardless of what happens this year\nHe's mentally channel definitely back with the Dodgers or do you think that he's staying with the team may or may not be predicated on whether or not they when the time [noise]\nYeah I don't think that uh the title has anything to do with many Machado coming back or not there's not going to be any uh money restrictions on what the doctors are going to be doing going\nForward after this year I just really don't see the fit\nThere's obviously you've got a ... like that you might want to have a open up a spot for him but see
