September um or better law just\nWalk up to ... those are not good fundamentals for Walker he's got to change that dynamic somehow between now and November ...\nAnd what is ... is doing what what'd you spending money on your is even spending money does even need to does he feel I haven't seen any\nSyrup on TV Now the ... from ... because their calculation is\nThat the market is so jazz up right now for Democrats in general that they don't really need to spend like now now\nThe last two or three weeks we'll see if that changes you know I don't think they want the airwaves totally devoid of a democratic message to the final weeks\nBut for the most part you know he was just trying to hit Walker on things like health care or with the help of the Democratic Governors Association of have their messages as a Walker's not for you or interesting new ad from the DJ last week which has a group called the stronger Wisconsin\nThere can add that both hits Walker on healthcare because you remember the Affordable CARE Act ...\nThere was federal money for the state's expand the Medicaid program Walker and and take that money or get a better way to do it in mind\nThat for the consequences of him as he said that made that decision that that was the wrong one for Democrats for them this ad says Walker to take that money started her his presidential did it seems to be a a to point attack on that\nHealth care of the big issue a Democrat please hit them off they're hitting him on that and to try to remind people walk around for president twice to see what people did not like\nThat on his approval them referred to crater and Wisconsin is a kind of flip back in the way back that seems to be like I said it's who founded ... people have hey feel like this guy for doing this and here's a reminder that he did this\nWe're talking with Ross room with politics dot com have you ever visited that site you should do they keep you all up to date on all the different races in Hunan nurse state legislative races to the governor's race to the ... like about the United States Senate race\nI haven't seen the ads both ways on this one you seem like it's getting a little personal I Know one by a lead them to be here when she got her angry piece on in that one\n... says you know for ... here she is in a position where the tensions elsewhere for our\nStudy what national regular look at like eight or nine race in the head of ours in terms of the editor of other races are all drawn to national attention so we're not getting independent groups spending money heavily here so they're kind of on her own right now to fight the fight now we are seeing signs of\nThe superPAC supporting her spending you know some money here proceed through pack that are funded by you line he's a businessman who spent heavily\nThrough those organizations for Kevin Nicholson the primary obviously comes about what the primary\nThose groups have been pretty quiet sets that what we're seeing those groups doing a little bit of stuff they're starting to do a little bit ... but it's not a pet ... vantage a folder has on the air in terms of\nMoney I mean she's a ball that has been a fundraising machine and had a huge advantage over Leah and Leah's find a way to get breakthrough and her campaign thanks to tell was he a scandal is one of\nThe fall when the biggest one of buildings and the rice and talking to people that is definitely an issue football but the you know she had her at her office at least has its hands as if it's possession this report about the only prescription painkillers\nAt dinner with too much with it so they could have acted sooner and maybe help shed some light on that but there's no really put a lot of money into it we saw the Concerned Veterans for America do an ad in August\n... sorry ... ad hit evolve as well but that kind of ran through with us and nothing big sense that the question I have four we see something big come in the next five weeks because you need to change the dynamic if you're up there and you want to try and win that race\nIn return I think senator Goldman has been taking a shot since then or now state senator or leave ... on the uh the peak chemotherapy\nOr being covered by insurance companies as she was one of just a handful of Republicans voted against that and she's been reminding folks that so it must be sticking to the long way she wouldn't do it but as a senator who doesn't like it does that you do with ...\nHits in a really interesting to me is that Democrats have been on the defensive about health care for really cause two thousand nine ever since President Obama first proposed full of care access that debate began you kind of saw the public turn against Democrats on that issue\nDemocrats will tell you the best in ... right now they have the upper hand in health care they feel like the debate has changed a bit because\nThey're focusing on things like allowing you're kissing her hospital at twenty sick like a protective of additions they're now fighting and they think on their turf what ball was doing his hitting\n... all those things but also going back to her record in the legislature employing out those were in their words she sided with the trust company now there's an argument they made\nThat whenever you add a mandate to anything it tries to cost about the argument from certain segments of the political base or public and they said if you add it mandate hard boiled chemotherapy or they'll pick your requirements that they can work that's for others\nBut it's also fodder for Balboa say well why does why should oppose that you're one of like a hand\nThere are ... or they'll pick your requirements that they could work that's for others\nBut it's also fodder for ball would have said well why why should oppose that you're one of like a handful of votes against it when it came up and if they're paid her somebody who's the mainstream health issues which is for Republicans is baffling because Syria who ... who is a third\nWhat better spoken person on an issue like healthier than a registered nurse but they feel like you know fall was really kind of give a little bit of business about this for on the defensive\nJust over a minute left but I Want to talk about the attorney general reason there is anything going on there and of course ... our attorney general brand ... he's a ... percent reelect Andy's running against a Josh call\nA who is the son of a former agency or ... or anything to zoom brings our intention on that one\nYeah I mean the ... the public and the attorneys general association they didn't give us information about the study of that race is lopsided in favor of civil rights how um I think by just almost two to one between ... before hand or schedule by the Democrats have ... at all yet\nAnd there's a couple of worry that if you let chill out there with his that's his automated that an answer that eventually people reacted early ... back to college and obviously some good half a Democrat south to environment but that started off his right away if you have to have your vote in the water fourth\nOr is that ... what's the wave take advantage of if we're not seeing shovel yes doing all this stuff is is getting out now and doing tours that kinda stuff but what I paid media campaign or the people who question well is that good stuff and oh by the way we've seen a couple of polls one from\nMarquette one from shovel that have have leading even though we're seeing\nAll the the big lead a neighbor's what the the lead over Walker that there's something to worry about that if you're a Democrat that Josh calls out up there are more high profile court that the only people that are paying attention idle after week baby there will be enough but it's a rift there taking\nYeah this is ... comes in third behind the reasons we talked about before and if you're the challenger and that is your challenge is to become um you're as some people know your name in it because they don't write in a lot of cases right now\nAnd the ... come and see card is being played by ... and it's not just call doesn't have money you are right gee are he does he just not spending at the time\nYeah and there's the faith to be had about ... who's paying attention right now how much they stay in touch with and can you break through the clutter of a governor's race you a federally argue better to do that you know a decent statewide\nBy saying you know we like three hundred and fifty four thousand dollars which is a decently could TV do you want it to do with the two weeks a TV three weeks of TV or have like a much lower volume intensity for three or four week it's a fine line that a\nWell you know I I I Can't\nTell you that all the stuff that friday I must\nAlice it back to bite them that the phones and old people sort of security isn't going to when we met with the staff and looked at some of the what the left side with the party I bought it all to kill a because as suicide or Florida or even some of the ... I\nWas going on so what we got out of it but I understand all the old about all the all on all of what we thought is well there was some hard Joel ... on some of the neighbors gathered a the poor little muffled some\nOn those little almost non existent so you can harm longer but if you can also of course well known each other you know when the game itself on and I thought that if there ever was I'm a you know a a lawyers\nAre ... are adoptable it in a little ... you can literally the languages and stuff like the cell phone accept it seemed to mop too on on this per se so it was really really 'cause she\nWanted to follow those ... because her own theory\nOr there's some definitely worse language around pharmaceuticals a while there was some arguments ... ... and others ... forced the marginally better language when it goes out a lot on like that so we're still trying to find out all the winners and losers are\nUm but I you know her son who campaigned on lots of terrible and you can do it\nOh so we're still trying to find out all the winners and losers are I'm such a young person who campaigned on ... completely review it all the sort of like blood just putting a different shade of let's look I think it's still appears to be just lipstick on a ...\nYou know and things like this mark ... isn't it important to realize you is your president that you shouldn't go it alone and things like this I mean I forgive you you mentioned that some of this stuff is not going to be able to be enforced for that to happen and when did have to go to Congress and he has the allies on both sides of the aisle he knows that right\nWell uh how was it was a U.S her graph of investor who is as well as a flip I'm was going to be meeting with the cost of weeks ago he tried to set something up now for November where you know what they're going to some ... ... when I was there are some things will\nPotentially life again and I think after class that that's not enforceable I don't know how much are really ultimately going to like it but what do you like pasta enabling legislation about ... a lot of uh you're going to hospitals to court for a much more full Congress let a lot of Republicans don't even like\nAh some of those little ... didn't lock him so I don't know how this will actually get the president is asking as\nLong as he looked up to a campaign promise but I thought the promise was completely off the again this is a marginal difference of off the phone all the cases even substantially\nA real sort of gets a little longer is there are some improvements are
