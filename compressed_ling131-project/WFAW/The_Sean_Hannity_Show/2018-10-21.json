Cody Kessler and so your own fault your own fault if that's your backup quarterback\nI Know people throw out all the giants should trade Eli man that's not happening\nNot now because much like the ... the giants refused to address their quarterback situation and have nobody to back him up\nSo they're not going to far away now if the giants would have gone on drafted rookie quarterback that yes they could've moved on from Eli in may be any lie to Jacksonville trade would be in the ... in the cards but that's just not happening at this point I don't think the one where they really messed up even after seeing a couple of weeks of Bordeaux this year\nWas the Bridgewater trade that the jets did\nEarlier what right before we go on to the saints and we wondered why is Bridgewater going to be that guy that that takes over after a brief while watching breeze this year\nAnd what he's done with the same you know reasonably did not playing for three four or five more years so\nBridgewater I don't know if it's really going to ever play in New Orleans so to me that was another missed opportunity for the jags and honestly as a possible cause you trade Bridgewater twice in one season because as is with the way you have things there and Jacksonville you're not going to even when the division\nAnd if you are a team in the AFC South you're going to have to win the division to make the ...\nThe AFC South is back to where it was a couple of years ago where nine wins might when you lose ... that's where we're at again and you look at the rest of AFC which will get into later on in the program\nThings about each diminish your vision leaders\nRight patriots we know are gonna end up coming out of the FCC's they win again today very close fish there between the bears will dive into that Hail Mary by true Biscayne company they came one yard short a possibly for forcing an overtime\nAnd then you look in the last the chiefs are there but the chargers looked like a playoff team certainly has achieved loose denied the charges will be tied with Kansas City for first they lose the tie breaker but still they retire reverse\nAnd then you look at the north sure seems like two teams are coming out of that division you're not getting two teams out of the AFC South\nNot happening not happening\nSo you have to wonder division in with the way things are going in that division right now the jags by no means are going to be anywhere near that division cracked if something doesn't change and the problem is what are we expecting to change\nThe defense is not as dominant as it was today defense wasn't a big issue like poodles continues to be the issue but you go to ... what do you do next week and honestly what do you do next week if you're Jacksonville\nBlake portals gets bench so do you go back and you can you start him again next week I mean you gave the contract which you can actually fairly easily\nGet out of after the season the way it was written it's not as daunting as people may think when you hear oh you just got a brand new contract the off season they didn't screw themselves entirely with that were they screwed themselves as they did not exploring other option either via trade or free agency or the draft this past offseason\nThat's it that's the one that kept him through all their window was in the off season it is way too late now and you're saying is look Minnesota has the quarterback you probably should have had you could argue that could have made a deal protected Bridgewater all but they\nMay Alex Smith if you really want to go way back hindsight's twenty twenty but I mean you can go to Alex Smith around and say they should have been the team that was interested in trying for hours but not Washington\nYeah it's it was a bad move and now they're stuck with them and I do think it's interesting we're watching her cousin's just succeed in Minnesota\nOr to put up great stuff and you know\nHave them in that in in the north race and hopefully be able to put them over the top and then you look at what case comes doing in Denver and then you see what Blake borders as do that though and it's almost just complete validation for what everybody was saying that the jak should've gone after him and I think you're seeing it right now I'm fascinated\nTo see what they do next week I mean you know when it comes to the jags because you've been you're starting quarterback your locker room clear leaves them as we already knew this is where things were headed after\nThe last two weeks in the common sailor Ramsey Mr talkative all of a sudden doesn't want to talk to the media anymore because things aren't going well\nI mean we already knew things were were were going to head on this track next for them by the way the jags yesterday I'm next Sunday in London is well that's it you know things aren't going well so what are they going to do they're going to go travel across the you know across the pond and take on the eagles who will get to them as well the eagles or lose today\nBut after that it's the Colts win a ball game but then you have the Steelers bills you\nSay you're winnable than the colds again then the titans and the Redskins the dolphins in ... and the Texans is kind of how the rest of the way goes\nI'm looking at that in quarterback wise next week and gets eagles in London\nI Would expect like ... we'll start again they'll for them to spike ... I I don't think they'll they will go that route a hundred percent from the from the get go they'll probably try to keep it quiet\nBut I mean if you look I mean if you look at the\nPotential is out there for quarterbacks in the middle seats as you said it's it's too late because I don't see you lie manning going anywhere and unless the saints I don't see your best option if you're really trying to be desperate mid season is see of Bridgewater\nWould possibly be tried to New Orleans or everybody keeps bringing up the cap and I think we stop with that and I'm a big ... supporter ugly stop of that because he's got a collusion case it gives the NFL right now\nNobody's going to touch the years like oh it's that yeah nobody nobody's going to touch them I I agree that I I Am one of those believers at that the league has polluted against him and all that but I'm just saying now I understand why teams don't want him he's in the middle of a collusion case against the national football league and I know Eric read as well But Eric read\nSigned with the Panthers era greed was not the face of everything to begin with like half and it was so that's not happening I think the jags are stuck\nThere only ... you know saving grace for them as it is and it's still guard nobody's running away with it but it's like the Texans aren't going all of a sudden run away with that division the jags are going to be and it's really an and luckily the titans lose again today and the titans of questionable decision will get into from Mike rival possibly some say was questionable some say it was the right move\nFor him ... explain exactly that decision a little bit but that's where things stand where that's where I'm staying with the jags where I stand with the Texans and deal with older or says a little bit on on the Texans winning for in a row though given the quarterbacks and opponents they'll play but at this point in time a\nPromoting through foreign three you do to keep your tap

thanks so much Robin with us\nAbsolutely I've got to talk to you again\nYeah you got a I I'm from Kansas City so I Know there's nothing like a primetime game at arrowhead stadium what what what's the the ceiling been like this week following that lost to New England with not only to the fans there in Kansas City\nBut certainly around this football too\nYeah you know certainly a little bit disappointments because you want when every game but I'm the way that that went down that there's not a lot of you know concern here uh the the team feels pretty confident that\nThere could be able to bounce back there continue to be able to do things they want to do especially authentically would love to have that game in hand but I mean that looks like the two best teams in the AFC right now and this fan base pain feel pretty confident that that a rematch can go their way\nYou know I've I've talked on the show a few times this week saying you know while I view the Kansas City this you're certainly is a much different team from year ago I think they're slumped proof because of ... because of this off since we know about the defense of struggles but given the start that they had a year ago where they were five and oh and then ... what they lost five and seven if I'm not mistaken\nHow how big is it and maybe it's more for the fans and these guys but how big is it for them to bounce back tonight just because then people start to get in that conversation about here we go again start off strong and and now they're unable to finish\nYeah I think it's pretty important because you're right I mean this is the kind of game that this should win I mean it's a\nIt's a whole game at night the the fan base turning out and I'm looking at the tailgate it right now the parking lot and\nAnd they're here I mean there should be allowed crowd tonight they should you be able to give them the home field advantage um there's also other similarities between last the last year they lost a ... for a few games an injury they lost much horse for a while it better and now here they are the exact same spot without both those guys again and last year\nYou know two inches long and often the line was just want to pay for them to handle their ... who was a you know very reliable backup laughter that could still end but\nTo injury you know really really flunked it down and they struggled to run the ball on the ... really went into a tailspin there and if that will be so\nTonight I I think it's really important that this off and continues to show that it can harm right along that they can\nThey can survive the few winters on the opposite to grind because if they drop this one and the office doesn't look good tonight that I I think a lot of those ... last year may start Papi back in the people that\nGo in there and she's the rider publisher of chiefs digest dot com you're on SB Nation radio had a Sunday Night Football as Cincinnati heads into Kansas City and you brought up some of the injuries there on the off the line overall we're also are some areas to watch certainly defensively it's nothing new Eric Barry still not practicing\nYeah they are very all these and also with Daniel Schorr and they expect to be there for a second safety\nUm they've had so many injuries and that and that back in the defense of them were still aren't quite sure who will be planted I and I mean a run Parker will be back there but I'm the guy to Eric Murray who has been banged up and he's been there start or most of the season I'm George Lucas has been filling in for him one of those two guys will start tonight but the kind of remains unclear\nUm they've been bank linebacker too you know I probably would not have just in Houston tonight which really takes a bite out of that past rush and that really hurt him last week against their England I mean they do that without having to just use now they're\nEven if he's not productive he is drawing attention and without him there it falls a lot more on the floor who spend balance rangers of his own\nUm he's the one that's going to be able to have to carry the load of this past rush\nWhen you look at the bangles ... and their Ross are besides yes they're often because quite frankly with the chief Stephens every ... can be potentially potent but where do you view that serious matchup advantage if at all for Cincinnati against Kansas City tonight\nFor others to guys that they've gotta they've gotta keep an eye on the jail at if Carlos I'm off on those two guys can wreak havoc up the mental\nUm get some pressure on the homes that can change things and you have a home can can escape and sometimes he does his best work outside the pocket\nUm but if those guys are able to keep them from stepping up in the pocket and plays if they're able to put some pressure on him or you know it's really I to me a lot about trying to keep her home in the pocket without letting him step up into it and if you could bring some pressure from the outside and bring it up to the middle as well\nThat's really probably the best way to attack Patrick moms and and not a lot of teams can do it but just as ... seven is is one that had\nCome more minutes here with not Derek of chiefs digest starch ... seat rider\nAnd publisher there and when it comes to the division\nNow I wanted to get your thoughts on the U.S we see chargers team that's playing really really well and they're only losses are against Kansas City and and the rams was mostly in regard to the top five teams in football what have you seen even from there and hey if if the chiefs lose tonight they would have the tie breaker still but the the chargers we'll be right there it's obvious he was\nYou know I I thought this was going to come down to the chief of the charges before the season and charters are not going away so you know hey their trip later in the season the Kansas City is going to go a long way towards the determining the division\nUm but you know one of the chiefs have done you know since uh you know anti Reid John Dorsey number I reached general manager I've done since they got here is to try and make sure they have a team that can compete in a of the west it really deals with some of the strengths\nAnd taxes of the weaknesses of those teams and that's one reason why they have dominated the if the west over the last two or three seasons um I think good grief I think that when like Seventeen other laugh Eighteen something like that against the west opponents so you know have the chief go six no five and one of the west again they're going to win that division that's where this division will be determined\nI Know there's been talk about Kansas City needed to go out and see what's available to help that defense ... any any anything new on that front and it sounds like after the cardinals lost\nTheir ownership group released publically kind of saying they were not training Patrick Peterson so do you see the chiefs in the coming weeks before the deadline I guess the only have about a week and a half or so left addressing anything\nYou know it seems less and less likely or so ago um they were certainly look for some states the earlier Earl Thomas was definitely a candidate um until his injury but I I think they really feel like you know in that secondary that they're actually starting to get better play ah they they feel like Orlando scanned ... settled in and between him even though\nA Kindle full or they feel like that's pretty good trio I mean you could they could they upgrade one of those spots maybe but I think they feel like at this point when it comes to chemistry and everything else that anything that they can get their hands on probably gonna be a marginal improvements fast\nI'm there might be some you know maybe there was to look at safety mates\nAnd everything else that anything that they can get their hands on probably going to be a marginal improvement pass 'em there might be some you know maybe they're going to look at safety maybe they look at the linebacker help if they needed a but increasingly looked like it here probably going to stay in bed\nBy last week for your ... how do you see the game playing out tonight to Kansas City bounce back or are the Bengals maybe a little bit a statement to the AFC\n[noise] I I think that she's bounce back I mean bottom for both teams are coming up that should motivate them this week I'm hoping that there should be a difference though I'm both these officers that that's where you can live on the chief's office right now is playing better almost

I think they're a good defense but I thought I think people that way way way way way too far ahead of him I think if we're talking about ... a weed defenses I still think Baltimore is the\nBaltimore showing it to the anti by the way as we say that a marriage has got a rushing touched down to ... yeah yeah I guess the same supply and the fourth quarter\n... is that is the thing that's and I think gives it raises a chance to win the S C I think they are but that even that good they are for real they permitted gay men and game out\nEvery ... every every Sunday or Monday or wherever day they play on you know they're the showed a here today was ... was letting them or whether it's Drew Brees or a you know that awful Tennessee office last thing\nThey played consistently well that is that type of the fence I Would love to see go up against a high powered sheep officer patriots office and the ... I think that is a deep and\nThat can really get some teams trouble and I think they're good enough to win the AFC without the events that I don't think I'm over exaggerating saying that\nI won't go that far yet uh I I agree with you there defense is by far the best in football the race and we're getting we're talking with ravens now and they just give up their first touchdown the second half of the season I think about that they just now gave a work week seven they just now getting their first\nTouchdown the second half I I I agree that defense is legit I still question Flaco right I mean we know what he did the year they won the super bowl in the postseason he was incredible it's like after the contract the all the elite conversation that people had for six months or whatever was Joe Flaco they drafted a quarterback behind them now Lamar Jackson who by the way did have a Russian touched down in this game\nThat that will still be the big question for me shape if they continue to play like to see what the defense and they find a way in the postseason they'll still be controlled Flaco when a shootout right there ... is going to slow offices down and it what they're doing so far to the the saints is awfully impressive one of the best option says the league\nBut I'm with you I Want to see if they ever were to match up with the rams are the chiefs or even the patriots just would like to see what they would do against them but that's what I mean that day she was not their defense the issue is can Joe Flaco if they need a score thirty eight points\nRight third even has an off night because it will happen at some point right there there'd be whether it's injuries or whatever at some point is going to have enough night\nCan they keep up because I Will say this defense is at a premium\nNow the national football league right because of the way we're seeing this league go with passing teams and points galore and setting NFL passing and TD record\nSo yes defenses at a premium no doubt about it but at the same time you in order to compete in the NFL in twenty Eighteen I think has to happen often take it's capable of wanting a shootout so while yes there's a balance of hey we're going to have the premium on the defensive the ravens that I also think still offensively you've got to have an office\nSecond to be there and put up thirty plus points a game\nAnd if your defense is having an off that in order to go on a run in the postseason in time will tell but that's that's kinda where I'm at with the ravens but no I I think today is convincing me more than ever that the ravens are legit because I'll be honest heading in the day I had some questions because I saw it last week it shut out the tides congratulations\nRight but they're doing this to a saint ... what is game's not over but it's Seventeen fourteen and this is exactly the type of game Baltimore wants to be an ... point lead and they've held the saints to to fourteen points Drew Brees just a hundred and forty six yards through the air\nHow about that I mean those are the type of games that you don't need your office to go crazy if you're a deep and is able to perform at this kind of left let's say quick break we'll get seen it up they chew on these late afternoon gays and go back to the one o'clock when I Want to talk of Carolina in Philly next\nMoral ... can cause complications TV family did remind you to do your homework and what complications can develop before you get an oral piercing the possibilities in food allergic reactions cruising swelling standard is simply to increase placard calculus can occur over time jewelry can also cause who's a ...

Michael Thomas five yard touchdown pass from Drew Brees that's touchdown pass five hundred and one\nAnd breezes career so we'll see if the same events can get a stop more aggressive play calling from Sean Payton we saw in the first privately to points of the game but there he goes on for down [noise] as well go to keep the field goal decides to go forward\nAnd in the game like this and this is why we had our discussion about the ravens in their defense in a while yet they're deep and just one of the best in football now\nNow the question ... give an opportunity right here your deepest capture the football game you're down for\nKen your often lead you down to a victory\nYou you've got it set up here with Joe Flaco to have a chance to do that also fourth quarter eleven Fifteen to go Washington settled for that steel goes so to Thirteen to seven Washington on top of Dallas and the cowboys do have the football all kinds of time still in that one or the big story that ... been unable to get going\nToday for the cowboys meanwhile you drink Peterson Ninety four yards on the ground but see just Thirteen carries for twenty five yards had Thirteen in the first half not much better\nAh here in the second half so yeah that's been a big problem for Dallas today running the football and they all I think game plan wise you're washing say make make them beat us through the air with Prescott and that's been the story so far is that they have not allowed to beat them makes them back you're going to have to throw to beat us in to this point in time\nThat game plan has worked out very nicely author down an upcoming for the Dallas\nCowboys and earlier today\nOne o'clock window another game one of the focus on\nThe ground in the book so the browns lose this one twenty six twenty three and over time of course it was over time it's the browns course was overtime they're forced overtime game the seventh straight week all seven weeks this year by the way\nThe NFL has had an overtime will see can we make it eight next week we'll find out every every week with a new NFL rush we've been talking about an overtime game twenty six to twenty three the browns come from behind the force overtime for score fourteen point\nIn the fourth quarter Baker may feel twenty three at thirty for two hundred and Fifteen yards two touchdowns number is the first game that Nick Chubb was basically the starting running back after Carlos Hyde was traded not a bad day for him I think you like that that's certainly a positive Eighteen carries eighty yards did have a touchdown\nOn the other hand the bucks it everything possible to end this game to the brown says mentioned the fourteen point to the fourth quarter\nBut the bucks get eight fifty nine yards Chandler patterns are all field goal the nine yards to win the game in overtime with one fifty five to go if he doesn't get it it's a short field for Baker Mayfield a company but also you know maybe we'd be in a situation talking about a tie game\nHere's how I view it and we'll get to huge actions both skating palace but a shame and this is the browns who while everybody's\nAll excited that they're being competitive and Baker Mayfield show signs again today that he can be that guy\nWho they are when it comes to crucial moments they make mistakes whether it's with penalties whether it's with play calling the brown still are acting like the brown that's my problem with it like the founder quarterback I really do believe that\nAnd they have positive each week more than ever and they're in football games but at some point when you go to four times and you're struggling a windows and your ... going to for overtime but\nYou've got to find ways to pull out victories in type games or you're still bad football team and they are still a bad football team\nI don't think there are bad but walking I think they're probably like an average football team but the record would say they're not average I mean they ... they could have what I ...\nYeah but I Wish you shape but how long are we going to do that we can say I mean\nI don't I don't think there are bad football there there are an average football team is probably gonna finish with six or seven winds maybe five or six or seven I don't know about that [noise] well see I don't know I'm not I'm not trying to stay there is a great team I just think they're\nFair no and then they're poorly coach there is a marine\nHow little they are I think what that means you're about football team as well if you're like oh I guess what is our definition of a football team is different like I think the Buffalo Bills or a bad but yeah I don't think the Cleveland Browns and the Buffalo Bills are the same type of thing that's just me though I think you know I mean I Would say the bills are terrible football team I don't think the browser I think there\nMay be a slightly below average team will kind of thing but I don't think they're all bad football team I think a lot to do with coaching I think you can just does not know how to manage games for one to\nThey don't really know how to win yet and I think that's part of it I think they're learning this year which this was going to be good for them and yet\nThese type of law says you know going through the scribe debate every game and these type of losses I think they're going to help 'em long term when I was just raw helps make or break time I agree that this roster continues to grow and refused Jackson's not gonna be the cook you\nKnow I Know you're you're getting the uh the way it's fine you know the expectations were low anyway I think most browns fans no he's not the guy and I think in in and tell that happens they just kind of going to be in this\nFine you know the expectations are low anyway I think most browns fans no he's not the guy and I think until that happens they just kind of going to be in the same\nType of spot but again it's hard to go from sixteen to seven or eight wins and even though they're count levels probably around what the what that is they're not going to win that many games is that many games this year because hey inexperienced I really don't know when they're like I said\nSo I think we I think we agree for the most part I guess my my point I totally agree with you on huge accident because yeah that guy\nClearly clearly has had more than enough opportunities\nDoses players and the boss is never his correct no you and I were pressed yeah we're going to get through his comments at a second you won one two years just stopped talking\nTo yeah we're going to get to college at a second I agree I my my thought is just that again\nAt some point when you're in games that are disclosing I yes a lot of it is coaching but at some point\nYou you've got you got to stop saying that all that you know they say one two games but they could be this like no there's a reason why they haven't won that I I get early in the season we want to continue to say oh well it's\nA very easily could be you know I'm not saying you're saying there that I'm just this complete hypothetical or they they could be five in water or something I'm not saying you're saying that but my point being that like at some point you or what you are\nAnd they're still not a very good football team a lot of it yes just coaching but there are mental mistakes that we see each and every game as well no this round watching\nWhich is the same stuff over and over nothing gets corrected ... at some point you got to hold the coaches accountable when none of\nThat well I think to me I don't ... I mean I think it's just to know I think that's a given with your ... when you Jack was the coach I think we all realize that he has no business being the head coach ...\nToday about who he threw under the bus me tightly is probably pretty pissed off right now because of his post game press conference to Jackson said uh when when it comes to the office\nThis week he's going to take more control over quote I Want to it's what I Know I Need to be a little more involved a ... I'm sure I'm sure taught Haley's not going to be pleased with that\nBecause that's kind of his way of putting some blame on Todd Haley for the struggles when a you know I get it if you're a coach and\nYou're off into mind and things aren't going well you know you're going to get fired if you're Jackson you might as well start taking more control and say if I'm going to go down I'm going down within my way but if you're taught Haley who likely would be the interim head coach by the way a few Jackson gets fired Utah daily has had coaching experience even though he was a disaster in Kansas City trust me I was there for it I'm\nTodd Haley probably is pissed off right now is hearing about those posting comments from his head coach\nYeah and and that's and that's my point about problem it's never on him like do you what one game and two years and the only reason you're kind of this issue 'cause you finally have a quarterback you have a real offers of coordinator and the GM who's you know not trying to think like I I I just I'm done with the Jackson like\nThey put John Dorsey put so much talent compared to where they were and if you get is a great talent value waiter you Jay Leno he's not at the coach next year I I think he'll he'll finish out the season now just because they have been more competitive and the games I think he does get they're not going to fire Mississippi's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "21"}
