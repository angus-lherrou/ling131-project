bit of a ... with the Los Angeles Lakers but in this hour it's gonna be wall to wall college football and there is a lot of college football let's talk about\nSome undefeated teams that were destined and on their way to the college football playoffs are making their stand in the first pet and\nYou know I was talking with Nick earlier shaggy about how\n[noise] Alabama and Tennessee is already over and it still remains the case there up twenty eight seven and they're driving as their deep as they're approaching the red zone in Tennessee territory I think the only question in that game is how soon do we see genuine hurts and I say we see him at the start of the third quarter\nAnd boy is confident making a statement on their way to being up twenty eight nothing\nAnd I you know I think that\nThey're making sure to get out of the way they're only road blocks [noise]\nYou know again this upcoming a easy way for them and\nSome twenty five college football for board up and then I'll get your reaction to some of the things we're seeing it's all back here on SB Nation radio during the conversation at eight hundred Seventy seven forty nine of\nRight there I said this is over there was their chance to cut into this lead into this lead\nMake them play and maybe battle once they did that then I ended up punting I said this is over right there in twenty four nothing at half time this is over and you are right and the state is a fraud we knew they weren't in a class of Clemson you know them being an undefeated\nRanked team it was like Colorado being an undefeated writing team it was like Cincinnati being an undefeated ranked team\nTo a lesser degree central Florida these are all teams that are not the classes of the Alabama as the climate sins\nAnd the Ohio State and some of the other teams that are battling for the college football playoff and Clemson has been exposed as confidence exposed North Carolina as just that North Carolina state I should say as a fraud and they've shown that they don't belong in any kind of discussion\nYeah and then I think that's the thing you have to teach them things in mind too I mean again I don't want to be the guy friends on the plane I was never a believer and NC State now will say this\nThey have Clemson should've last year they won the national title and they should have ... they didn't ... and the state play them tough last year only lost by touchdown so this is not exactly the same Clemson is dominated as of recent so that come out here and dominate a is a is a good sign a\nSee something of a statement here it's like hey we're going to take care of our business and we're basically saying the only thing that can stop us is sauce and when you look at their schedule the only thing that can stop Clemson his Clemson because I don't see\nFlorida State Louisville vc Duke South Carolina or Virginia Tech getting airway\nYeah and I think also I mean I'm impressed by what they're doing a but again\nIt's it's early on or so and the one thing I'm interested to see like how much they're starting to schedule it because I think the ACC is brutal\nI think the AC marvel at the worst everybody talks about the Big Ten is\nThis is much worse because you know he ... his Clemson and nobody else\nAnd you could argue that the tens of second best conference in college football I mean you can't say the pack twelve is you can't say the ACC is big twelve has some that's what I think you take all three of those teams at the top of the big turnover anyone the big twelve right and I mean he will you go through the list and I love it probably has a little bit more depth but and I'm not saying that I'm not\nGonna sit here and tell you the big tens of great or anything I just think\nYou know they struggled early on but I think you've seen some teams and merge that are solid and even like some of these teams at the bottom of the big town I think they're terrible like I'm In Indiana is always game I'm not trying to say they're a good team but you know they play pen said Tibet ... Ohio State tough\nThey they're solid team you know you got into my produce suddenly become dangerous once they figured out that quarterback situation so it's a big cat has a nice a round to death I'm not saying it's a great compost I'm I think it's a slightly above average conference\nI mean I think the SEC is foreign shoulders ahead of everyone out do although and I am a little bit disappointed with some of the teams and the bottom of the SEC west this year I thought they'd be better but outside of that can't really ... take\nNow Michigan Michigan State that those other game I was impressed Michigan took care of business they now part of this yeah I didn't get to keep in mind\nThere's some things I'm Still concerned Michigan about I don't like they still show the run the ball consistently they're still struggling to protect shape Patterson they made enough plays they ended up big chunk place where it didn't matter and plus you know prime Milwaukee is so accurate said no one ever\n[laughter] but I find a way to ... seats\nTo I'm not that Michigan has Michigan is as good as advertised on defense they have a\nElite level of defense or so up some of the reason why is because those windows are small but some of those do it it's not like there was one time where you have he he beat the Michigan slot corner whoever's coming I'm wide open on a on a basic goals or many skinny post and literally like he's wide open and he just inaccurate you know\nThere was no way I saw the play it was just like it's like\nWhy how did you miss that I mean I ... he walked over and handed\nAnd some of those you know they're they're actually doing an okay job of designing some out routes you know and I looked missions corners of great but you out they play a lot of men coverage and super super aggressive by leaving the corners all along\nHe got to take some chances if you do it some picks that's fine as long as you're pushing the ball down field but\nI mean they're they're throwing these little out routes to the sideline they're like you know you don't even give your money for the giants off and you don't get what you mean they're they're actually there to make a play you know Michigan is gonna win their fair share to their circle and defense but it got to give your corner a chance that you know go out and make a play or you receive or I mean and\nLike some of these shows it's just like the way out of bounds or air mailing I mean come on like\n... ... and he's so an actor but\nBesides the point I there was some current concerns about Michigan passing game I don't know\nIf it is enough to you know maybe that's the one that they can I'm not sure it's enough to win a peer ... with the all the others the Clintons and whoever else comes out\nBut I Am impressed because they shut down Michigan State and they cover the spread and I know that sounds silly but they dominant in this game Michigan ... by the yard and even that Michigan was impressive on often but they struggle with Michigan State pension strength covers for party they this\nHas been a federal ... that means are known to exist you know does it straight covers a team from ten years ago I don't know the on it that was on this\nTeen idol but nothing but so they've been a thorn in their side they underperform in this game they took care of business today you know I saw some concerns but you need to give them credit for being good today\nTo tie up all around the thoughts on the Michigan Michigan ... ultimately the Michigan office was far from great the mission both the fences with tremendous in the first half partner who is both officers were ... the realities are the Michigan said on the office continue to be so bad\nThat eventually the Michigan State defense just broke\nMichigan made some some place did a good job in the second half on third down and staying on the field and they managed to cobble together Twenty one points where they impressive no\nBut they did enough on often Michigan State on our fence was awful eleventh first towns over twelve on third down from one on fourth down and total yards of Ninety four total yard that's embarrassing fifty a\nFifteen Russia's Fifteen rushing yards on twenty three attempt that is a future in Michigan said often Michigan did enough on our fence which grade on defense they are very very good\nI don't know

Kelly and mark Cal stretch but it was more the tempo that was the thing and and I and\nThe hot that two minutes or less scoring drafts Mario is more of a screen that tackles\nA ten twelve fourteen play Dr type of person I'm In Washington they did a great job of playing to keep the way they ran on first down almost every possession and obviously with the game on the line and over time it was a six year run on certain goal to win the game so\nUh that's different American now for the quarterback play with Herbert Mario than others but um they've always run the ball there's been a little bit differently on between the tackled Alabama style\n[laughter] I guess I should clarify that it was that they were never committed to the run it was a pass first group and a lot more they're runs were on the age now it's a lot more inside runs ... and it's a lot more of a balanced attack fences lead\nAnd I've also noticed defensively and there's a lot more physicality than in years past you know Oregon defenses could be run over by some of the bigger groups around the country most notably you know over the years Stanford used this theme roll them with their physicality\nThat's really the case anymore they're a lot more aggressive and a lot more physical and a lot more attacking on defense as well\n[laughter] yeah I mean\nJim love it is in his second year at the defensive coordinator that a great job at Colorado before that turning their defense around\nI'm Still working it's gone from you know being the worst power five cents and twenty sixteen to you know ... respectable enough in the packed twelve where they're in the hunt for the championship so he's done a great job and they have some really good players I sent\nA choice died the linebacker as one of the players in the tech twelve Dustin ... stored on Scott is a formidable defensive fun\nOn sort of interesting because they have fallen on the back in but they've never faced a an office like this this season the ... so um they'll have to have more teeth he's out there and I will be interesting to see how they handle\nAnd you know you mentioned Gardner men chew and is a Washington and the Washington state cougars fence the numbers have been in price to talk about not having balance they throw it all the time they don't run the football very much there's not much of a commitment to the run game here\nAnd the realities are they really haven't played any body their best opponent does far has been USC and that's again they lost\nAt the Los Angeles coliseum so take us through this a little bit and what you've seen from Washington state\nAgainst inferior competition and a federal stack up well against the Oregon ... the the Oregon against the Oregon Ducks and you know the level of competition they bring to this match\nYeah it's interesting because you know obviously they who looks like they had the tragedy um during the off season and no one really knew the quarterback is going to be and saw\nA Mike Leach marched Gardner venture out for the first game um and he looked really good to a he has a a Baker Mayfield type of moxie ... um\nAnd you know he he was going to go to Alabama and just learn how to be a coach but leach offered him to be a grad transfer here and and leave\nWashington state and the nation in passing so ah he's just terrific and given them a chance to have like ... like a a tough season the maybe a\nPack twelve north division championship season so it's really a great story in the past twelve because with them in their defense coordinator in the quarterback situation and ah\n[noise] some of their best to fit the players also leaving\nA lot of people didn't think they were going to go to a ball game and now they're in the thick of the north ... again\nIt is in practice but I mean the tough upon their schedule was upcoming and it starts right here yeah this is the level of competition this year that the Washington state cougars had been seen yet I Do you do you think that ends up posing some problems that Washington state hasn't had that had to deal with yeah [laughter]\nWell they're going to have a great home field advantage and they always do that with game day here I mean the spice is going to be electric um\nAnd you see is Nineteen and now I think at home I dare say hell and they really should have won that game which that's kind of another layer this game with my college uh giving his text messages with Larry Scott and others\nOr to the Yahoo and kind of hope that can can of worms still upset about the targeting whole night game which I don't know if that call does the right way to get a chance Washington state wins that game so\nIt'll be see I don't think that'll affect the cougar players but that is a huge story in college football that let's just let loose by leach last night\n[noise] and we're joined by four burned from Eugene register here on SB Nation radio in our ... dot com in ... previewing Oregon versus Washington\nState I Want to go to the ducks a little bit and just at Harvard I mean the growth in this in this quarterback who came there is not\nHighly recruited there weren't many greed offers form\nThe last minute Oregon steps up and he's ... and that's where he ended up going and we've seen growing year after year for her but at some point the growth this year that we've seen with Justin Herbert has been incredible he seems to be to me to be making a lot of Sunday throws\nHe's really got a great mastery this off and your your son Justin urban exactly what you're seeing from this very very talented and be framed quarterback\nYeah he he\nPlays to my style I mean they you mentioned uh the rushing earlier and a lot of the Russian yeah you see a ... yard touchdown run and stuff like that they really don't run Justin that much because it's more of the play action in the NFL type of throws like you mentioned and\nYou know he now six foot six children forty pounds and it's not just the physical presence she has an air about him now where he was kind of shy of standoff there shouldn't just you know being in the spotlight as the guy who grew up in Eugene\nFollowing my scenario it in the in the big fan of Marietta but now he's kind of come to terms with the position than in a different confidence about him and I think that shows this team was following him um throughout this saga where they lose health French they lose ...\nAbout him and I think that shows this team was following him\nUm throughout this saga where they lose health Fritz they lose Willie tiger now their third coach in the years but Mario ... your heritage great situation with the quarterback and and obviously they're taken advantage of it so far\nHow do you think the a quarterback skills and just an urban are going to translate to some days going forward as he's most likely to answer the NFL Draft and she's going to be an early first round pick you think this is the guy can have big success on Sunday\nI I Do like the fact that some of the organizations that need quarterbacks now are like the Denver Broncos your giants are traditionally good organizations I mean it's all about where you go right I mean\nJosh Allen as all the town in the world but at buffalo that's going to be tough for him famous Josh Rosen at Arizona for a while so um yeah I think he could definitely thrive if he's in a situation with like Sam's Arnold where you have from support around you and on and the coach that understands how to develop quarterbacks but\nYou know if he were to go to you know\nAnd Washington number here at the end of the third quarter Vera seventeenth Thirteen on Colorado\nI'm with the ball deep\nIn Colorado territories they're driving in the red zone first than ten at the Colorado fourteen at the start of the fourth quarter in that one so that was a kind of you're in progress top twenty five\nAgain Alabama making their statement they just put another one in the end zone it's fifty one fourteen to attack by Tego viola is nineteenth for twenty nine three oh six and four touchdown I think he can sit now Shay\nAnd I think we'll see jailing hurts the rest of the way so basically I happened to her and and\nA half for jailing his how this one's going to shake out as Alabama's all over Tennessee fifty one fourteen\nAnd more work than like match up again climbs to taking care of their business twenty four nothing

[noise]\nSo you are my ... my behind in this already went in\nA nearby I didn't want to hold on I think they rolled it or not at school and then they they rule that and then they came back to school next but\nOh okay All right so boy my behind and I don't understand why but it's the nature of the beach uh\nIt's also really consume goes into score and it's thirty one nothing no looking back for\nTheir heritage and that now I'm going to get the score but the catch puts it at the one yard line in the ... tribe is at the end takes care of business and takes it in from one yard out thirty one nothing Clemson all over and the state\nAnd you know to the top three teams in America making a statement I'm Wondering if Ohio state's going to make the same kind of statement\nTonight in West Lafayette, Indiana I somehow I somehow a funny feeling they're going to go get to that as we move through the program truly a mixed bag to in this final our world try and get to a court preview of game seven and I'll see yes we're going to talk of forty after this hour Trevor Wayne\nRama the lake or nation blog about what bronze debut\nAs a member of the Los Angeles Lakers so we're pretty much gonna be a mixed bag will baseball will Lakers talk Lula Bronx talk and of course plenty of college football talk as we gate in college\nAn on off since they look last last far in the early going\nBut ... or as that game is moving along so the realities are well some of this can be blamed on injuries some of it can be blamed on grand piano\nSome of it is and we've seen this before in Columbus there seems to be sometimes\nThey lack of focus in moments and they sometimes think that they throw their jerseys on the field they can win because they're better than their opponent than in most cases they are and I'm starting to see some of that is worrisome\nTo me quick update I get all your points cooked up they do any of that goes ahead\nTwenty one twenty uh but then Penn State just returned to kick off for a touchdown [laughter]\nI don't know I don't I don't know if they're\nI think it looks like they might have said he stepped out inside the five I don't know what's going on wow a better count on it it isn't it James Franklin just standing there you know man on him or live you know the by the way not\nI don't know what's going on uh yeah it looks I don't know if he was out a but he's in the ... regardless well\nBut I don't want to be I mean does it now and that's James Franco well\nTricks or just sort of touched down a so instead they didn't even review it they just don't drive through the line and he took it in for five yards at\nPenn State twenty six in the end of Twenty one so let's get back to Ohio State produce sorry about that want to get the\nYou know I like when we have those up you've got more TVs on it's not one of the games I have on I still for some reason I've Alabama and Tennessee on a long way of saying well he's not a a Washington and Colorado\nThose are the three games I have on right now to a game I don't want us to Penn State Indiana game but I think I'll change that\nSo um I Do think that uh\nYou get to keep a couple of things in mind that that are so they create those negative places and you know again part of it was their banged up but I Do think there's a concern that the ... the corners are pretty good I wouldn't say they're great like they have been in past with guys like warning bottom\nWhy they can't sell water stands out one of the talented for the short corner all day long and they make mistakes\nAll the corners actually are the are the least of our concern outside of the defensive lines really been the linebackers into safety's uh and you know they're young over there and outside of Jordan fuller Emily Harris and they're cheaper inexperienced but\nUm I Do think they're still trying to figure it out and what works best and the problem is they play a very aggressive schemes so sometimes\nThey may need to make some stuff up and part of that's on she auto and\nYou know you really have to bring the house slamming the hang up and even without and make by cell and I asked one of the most talented front porch and all the college football how many people do you need to bring\nI don't know and that's and that's part of the issue that I think they do need to make some adjustments um oh what\nA cut he doesn't make any it's the same defense every week exactly the same exact things every week whether it works or not they just do the same things every week now the one thing to be fair if\nWe're going to be completely fair as well they have really been a great much better team in the second half so they have\nThey are ... and trouble they get bored and then they take care of business in the second ...\nYeah and also another thing to keep in mind as well they act they haven't been giving up a ton of points like they don't mean he's he's the only team scored more than twenty six\nMinutes sometimes the stuff that you know defensively they give up the plays and then you must points and they don't get off the field against teams you said just get off the field already what are you doing but I certainly sometimes they get off disease slow starts and they're sluggish\nAnd all of a sudden this on Dwayne asking to kind of elevated everything and you know to me\nHe is the one constant for them he he shows up each and every week\nFor each and every half even when there's moments of struggle he is the constant he's the guy who always shows up and I really not only like his skills in his production I Love his character to me that the guy you can win with and he's the biggest\nReason that Ohio State has had the success they've had this year yes Aaron ... talent ... I agree\nIf they focus they win this game easily and so if they continue to be inconsistent they're going to struggle\n... so getting back to the game I'll just go and so the defense definitely have some concerns are just some things to keep in mind uh I think it's a slightly below average defense right now that's potential to be a good defense is is they are better personnel and they're playing right now that they make a dean ... they need to make a judgment stopping said\nI Do think is interesting in this game um\nA lot of people are like say oh producer on a produce going to make it a game pretty upset special I think this game going at it and all this game being at night and not the June ... eleven AM or two thirty game or is like you know he was kind of playing under the radar because a lot of people are saying this can be dangerous 'cause of produce\nOff and I think Ohio State is going to be up for this game they've got the by next week so they can put extra amount of motivation into this game or to get healthy after the ... after this week and then ended up by I think\nThey want to have some momentum going into ... so and I think also producers not exactly have a great track record and it's funny you know you can read a lot of good stuff on college football and get a judge of a fan base for your fans on their really you know\nThey they they think they can hang in the same but they do have this new to of we have not\nOr out of college football and get a judge of a fan base but your fans on their really you know ... they they they think they can hang in the same but they do have this new to of we have not played well in primetime night games historically and I know ...\nAnd prime time night game for a long time if you're one of these kids have planes that are on time night game so I don't think that's material back\nI I I'm just saying in general it's almost better for Ohio State for this is a night game 'cause there's so much attention her being there I think\nIt's right into their hands there used\nTo this better than it big it'll ever they ever to thirty on ... but that one reason\nWhy they might show up and sleep walk their way through it and find a way to win much like they did against Minnesota last\nYear and the one reason why can't I can see this game being under the spread and produce hanging around for a bit depending on how it goes the one reason I Can't take producing this team to win outright as 'cause there'll be a hundred lines right past events like Purdue outlay or and they will times but\nYou're not solving Twain Hoskins with no passion the hundred nine to pass the fence\nAnd you know even though all ... states defense has its concerns you they're going to get more stops them pretty well they have better athletes I think there'll be some point score but\nThe bottom line is you're not what it would be a hundred nine throwing past events against ... joined Haskins and one of the best receiving corps in the country I think Ohio State was this game high scoring ah I I think probably around with the spread is I just can't see that now is a statement for Ohio State in the sense that they can come out and play better in this game\nI think it'll have them a little bit in a more comfortable spot going into the bar week\nI'll say like this and that we got we got to step out and we'll get to some we'll get to LSU in Mississippi State in the next segment along with a game seven or else the s preview\nBut for me you know focused\nOhio State runs away and hide in the second half a fence evacuated Purdue keep around for a while and focused we got a ballgame\nOhio state's winning either way as you said joining asking will be the difference but there's some things I'd like to see out of Ohio State\nI'd like to see big stops I'd like to see them when the battle of turnovers and I'd like to see balance on office I Want to see him get back to run the football I think like ... like Alabama and white Clemson\nHere's a chance for Ohio State to make a statement I have a funny feeling they're going to and I think by very early in the second half this one is all Ohio State\nMy thoughts on it time will tell it starts seven thirty eastern time it's on ABC when we get fat\nWe're going to get into LSU\nAnd Mississippi State that quick preview of game seven\nOf the N.

Rondo starting in the back\nAt the point guard over Alonzo bowl a veil muggy starting center perhaps instead of using three followers and having Carl coups must start who's coming off the bench\nI just talk to us a little bit about this line of the complexities of the team who looks like they're going to play minutes in who looks like they're not gonna play minute [noise]\nSure I mean this this roster was set up obviously with some some question marks I mean they the plan going forward with\nLeBron James what team has always been that shooting around them but spider shooters I let him create or the Lakers team was built with the idea of putting claim acres around him so that's why you see rage on Ron do when they were sending guys like that that were brought in during the off season\nSo it serves the plane kind yeah we use the Rhonda right now as the starter is that going to last season I don't know I'd be I'd be kind of skeptical I think that at some point bonds up all will take over the starter but he's still coming back from injury so that that really kind of made the decision for the Lakers or coach blue wall\nIn terms of who was going to start a point guard because well good well it's been quite a hundred percent just yeah he's still ramping up after after surgery kept the boat out most of the summer so\nLong ago stole certainly in the mix that I wouldn't be surprised if the starting point guard or the end of the season but right now it's Rondo and it's kind of wrong to abide by default\nAnd of course we've been hearing some great things about him he had a nice night against the trailblazers the other night\nBut ah but for now he'll be the starting point guard point guard have you been able to get is actually done a phenomenal job for a guy who get\nA ton of work for the shock of cool stuff that he's been involved with in the past and\nAnd everything he's actually done really really well for the Lakers so far it's done a good job protecting the pain and he runs or well that's a that's critical for things that really wants to get out and pushed the pays the Lakers and the blazers right now\nAre tied for having the fastest pace in the NBA at the state although obviously super early so yeah I mean the the roster constructing construction is and what a lot of people thought it was going to be\nBut the Lakers have a different plan in place now they're sticking with it they're not married to it in any way because a lot of these guys are on your deals and we know that they're going to be chasing major for each summer but for now they're going to be going with this with this plan of putting play makers around the ... Oregon and then and then running\nYou know it's interesting you mentioned your mail muggy and he's the guy was I've always thought as a physical talent was amongst the best centers in the league I I thought there was definitely skills they're obviously what goes on between his ears on that lumped about Eighteen Inches above his rear end has not always been up to elite\nLevel status but certainly when you look at what will Braun wanted a center if he's not a guy that can stretch the floor he wants to a guy that can protect the room\nBut also it doesn't seem like his feeder instrument if there's anything wrong to hate the hate so centers that slowed down the office and he likes those guys off the floor so\nMuggy while he can stretch the floor like LeBron likes from every position what he can do is protect some room and he can get up and down\nIn till abroad that's vital for their success he doesn't like plotting centers and I think that's important as to why McGee is going to get minutes and why he may be successful here\nYeah absolutely that's that's a hundred percent on the money to bail me he is doing a real nice job getting up and down the poor and the Lakers are really keep it simple or they're not out in the mid range jumpers or anything it's just a real hard for him all the fences with you and if you're open will will or you are\nOr you got to do with catching finish and they're really that they're that his his responsibility catching fish on the on the bed and then make the right reading on the defense spending be that that room protector for them so\nBut yeah I mean he's ah his job is it's kept as simple as possible and ah and so far he's been stuff for it\nYou know something about Josh harm young rookie twenty\nStep as simple as possible and ah and so far he's been successful at it\nKnow something about Josh harm young rookie twenty seven minutes twenty points for ... and an assist in the opener is the guy that could eventually take Caldwell poll she objects Caldwell pope doesn't start hitting some three seasons stretching a floor a little bit\nOh let me tell you there are already people calling or Josh heart to be in the starting lineup hashtags start heart is a thing on Twitter right now\nThere are a lot of people that are expecting Josh heart to become\nThe starting shooting guard or the Lakers I mean he was the summer league MBP the summer I had a really nice here last year and he looks like he is ready to have an update here and to see if he was a continuous Caldwell pope was for all intents and purposes you it's kind of invisible\nAnd he's been doing that quite a bit during preseason as well during this game against the blazers\nSo there's going to be pressure there from from heart he's certainly not going to take this lying down and I think he's going to be pushing for that starting role\nHe uh he's quickly and starting his name as one of the guys just part of the young core we've been talking so much about how Cruz when Brandon in Rome and lungs of all those three things to Laker young causes they're building round but heart has been so good that I think we now have to have to include him and not list as well\nYou mentioned ... and ... and I kind of tacky I kind of put them together because they were the on line from last year's team in the thoughts on these sue and the prominent roles if they will or won't play this year and beyond\nYeah I mean Ingram is if there's anybody that's going to step up and be become the Bronx second settle\nThis summer or this season it's going to be branding room he's he is prime for a break out campaign\nHe showed some really great flashes last year and it seems like the brown is going out of his way to really find him in in advantageous position and the reason he's looking for 'em out there on the floor in group is doing a great job cutting and slashing and\nYou know he's still has plenty to improve upon but he looked at the the physical skills that he has been credible wingspan and the size and the ball handling ability and the passing ability\nAll these things that he can do out there on the or that would suggest that he's going to be a great sit\nNext to LeBron James so I Would look to him to make a major leap this season\nHow coups seems to be having a little bit of trouble adopting they're asking him to play the center position the backup five for the Lakers and he's really not that if anything I think he's more of a free\nIf he's going to move a position of where you from that power forward spot but they are asking him to ask him to play small bomb placed center and that's been a bit of a learning curve yeah it's kind of figuring that out as we go so he's had some struggles there's only one that's seven for free and their their season opener\nAnd it's been kind of work in progress for him so are you still has a ton of talent we do he put it in a ton of work in the off season and and he's really talented player that can do a lot of things out there on the order so\nIt just may take a little bit for him to really get up to speed and get used to this new role the Lakers have asked them to play but both in agreement and crews are intriguing prospects moving forward and uh we'll see if they wind up sticking with the team or not because we know that big changes could become if the Lakers do find themselves in the
