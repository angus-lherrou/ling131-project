Oregon Senate former state legislator eighty Jorgensen we're talking to one of my former colleagues and the leader in the\nWisconsin state assembly on the Democratic side Gordon hints from Oshkosh and you mentioned that nearest pool and and so did the Charles Franklin talking last summer he said it was coming out at around four o'clock and it's out in in that ten point lead my Tony ... wow\nYeah and again you know those of us that have been through a path cycles I I Would expect it to be tighter of that\nBut uh you know even if it's half of that is it you know I think definitely um shows that the enthusiasm and is on our side I think a\n... continues to win independence I think there are still do undecided voters or you know at this point and you know I think there's a path for him or\nYou know so many ways Tony ... is a great candidate for the time that we're in right now he's sort of the anti politician Scott Walker wants to be president you know Tony ... wants to restore the priorities of our day\nWhether that funding as the case and protecting our natural resources and investing our infrastructure and in your W system I mean those are pillar that Wisconsin at that for you know that in ... you know Republicans and Democrats recognize that that we really lost over the last eight years\nYou know it was funny I a vice president Pence came to town for a Governor Walker for one of his rallies yesterday and uh I caught one of the soundbites from it and he was talking to your ... has been a a bureaucrat and government bureaucrat all his life\nAnd he is a you know and it was like wait a minute no he hasn't even the superintendent and the teacher or do you want to describe someone that way wouldn't you describe Governor Walker that way uh Gordon\nYeah I mean I mean really bizarro world Glenn growth men's attacking his opponent who's never held office before as a pilot career politicians\nThough as being the governor is running on education you know the ah ah yeah there highlighting that they're trying to think Tony ... you know I mean you're talking about Scott Walker\nHas been you know feeding off the public as a a pro business pack you know for the last Thirty years\nOh well one of the things that happened under Governor Walker's watches the Lincoln Hills scandal and they asked the question about up prisons in yesterday's market pool and\nAmong registered voters Eighteen percent say that Walker has done all he should do address inmate abuse issues at the Lincoln Hills copper lake juvenile\nUh prisons while uh thirty two percent say that he has not paid enough attention to this issue however fifty percent said that they haven't heard enough about the issue and to have an opinion\nAnd these results are little changed since the last time the question was asked in August a win twelve percent said Walker has done all he should\nThirty five percent said he has not paid enough attention and fifty three percent at that time they hadn't heard enough it does this come up on the campaign trail much out there and Gordon\n[noise] well I think among people who have been following it certainly among stayed with ...\nOr they you know they follow it I mean the reality is the governor was notified as early as ... eleven of the concern about the risk being a Human Services director who refused to than get there\nHe said he never received a letter but you know I don't know that I've ever I mean I have never lost a letter in my legislative office\nIf it was a priority I think they would've addressed it and of course at Wal it's come out that that is attempt to intervene and do things in the Lincoln Hills situation where a rip off by the governor who didn't want any negative press\nUm I went to Lincoln Hills last November and there are good people working there the administrator want to do the right thing\nThe educators there are a member of the school or the correction officers they you know they they want to do the right thing the mental health professional there's just not enough people you know there what happened you know they they did act then all of the most experienced people that work there retired they left they were done\nThan I had some really difficult kids really need an intervention or right the ship and they ended up uh you know being you know couldn't deal with them were forced to do a ton of overtime and it was a dangerous place and it remains a dangerous place for both kids and fast because they simply don't have the bodies\nThey don't have the experience uh to deal with it and even under the reforms that we did that I'm hopeful for um if we're not willing to pay recruit you know to compensate what it's going to take the ... job nothing is going to change\nAll right and finally the poll looked at to enthusiasm for boating maybe this is very important ... both sides talk about this and overall sixty seven percent of registered voters say they are very enthusiastic about voting in this year's midterm elections with twenty two percent\nSomeone enthusiastic in ten percent are either not very or not at all to Z as strict among Republicans Seventy percent are very enthusiastic well among Democrats Seventy six percent art\nAnd among independents and this is key you brought it up a couple of times fifty nine percent say they are very enthusiastic about voting this year a year message board and is it reaching do you feel uh those independents\n[noise] then we lose you know I'm here but\nI mean uh you know you know look those are all really\nGood indicators are traditionally what you see he was successful campaigns\nUm you know the governor is runs twenty six different commercial so far as I understand that you spent more than ten million dollars attacking\nA Tony ... and you know it doesn't look like if it's working I think people have figured this guy out and the reality is you know he's got four weeks or to take people that are going to vote for Tony ... you know and try to get them back in you know Governor Walker camp there still undecided voters\nThat are going to vote for ... you know and try to get them back and you know Governor Walker Panthers undecided voters\nAnd he can try to say is going to pay for school you can try to say finally going to fix transportation\nYou know he can finally say wages are going to go up you can play the ... the man but I mean at some point people realize that an empty promises he's had his time to serve and it's time that we were both or you know what causes tradition and reinvest and are they\nWere gonna wind things up by I talk a little baseball I Know you're a big Milwaukee Brewers fan as I Am and we all have those uh recollections of where we were and how great it was in Nineteen eighty two you'd need to have a team make this bar or the ... going to make it to the world series this year Gordon hands\nI think they are I mean I got it feels like destiny if you can go to St Louis oh wait and go to Chicago and when and then I mean I don't think I've ever watched the comfortable theories I mean the game it's got a little high in Colorado but\nWe ... them or I could barely walk to inform the eleven and I went to some of those games because of the stress but\nYou know look it's a good locker room I think Craig council ... the manager of the year and these guys are playing loose we've got nothing to lose and if they you know I think the ... got to pick it up a little bit it'd be tough to see the thing against that light up there was well we're going to have to score runs but um I like our chances\nGoing last question or the ... family usually gets into a Halloween more so than most families are you ah do a great job of picking your costumes for instance last year when did you go as your whole family\nYeah I was a rowdy by for my wife was a macho man than my a one year old daughter was hulk Hogan always appreciate that so we're still in negotiations as a family or one of them involving a group of artists and which I was Andy Warhol I wanted to\nGo to the eighties and uh I wanted to be the Perry from the journey separate wave video phone we we haven't quite figured out we want to keep it together the medically but we're running up against the radar or the deadline here 'cause we got to come up with a\nBar or if you're going to be Steve Perry I mean what are we doing with your wife than what is she going to be a ... an easy one with the leg warmers\nSet aside a bad idea Saddam excited about it I mean I think he was a little better next to\nThan just the broad eighties category so we'll see probably ... my daughter lives then and then it will be the you know five six\nWell she can be ... to leg warmers on a on a a little girl like that and the band I\nKnow there's no shortage of eighties singers that my daughter\n... city law only our and go on a ... yeah I mean she\nAnd ethanol out came the flag [noise]\nSo that's what targeting is on\nThere that you're at it and then by the way that that was costing the game it was it was a jak that right there in there\nAnd and ah it sounds like rightfully so to huh already\nOr if it's ... it's it's almost attempt to end or someone and you're not supposed to do that\nNo for good reason All right well let's move on Saturday twelve forty years in the time of a mystery to your broadcast or it's going out you're going up to old Clara you W a clear ah what do we know about all clear\nThat very strong team or the last couple of years through four years actually\nThere are a little bit better this year they they lost last weekend LA last uh two Steven's point I Believe a score was lied or three do field goals and that was a lot a lot of great off as to watch but\nUh I Do walk solving pi won't be ready of course you can call list you're trapped and I don't see it that way I think the war hawks war when us want to win an adult because\nThey are much higher playing right now certainly after this went over the last show I think I think dogs are going to go up there and I think they're going to win a handle it\nWell you've been talking skies for quite a while now and now that one's in the books and and it looks like a clear is going to be another W but ah who else is a real strong and the and the conferences year\nOff their\n... who else is a strong in the conference this year uh besides the war hawks of course\nLook gotta go\nToday there oh what what else is a strong in the conference this year uh besides ... of course\nI got to go to Marie manning that they got to get a week by week I Know me and saying this is gonna be a little push it gives you do you have to play a little better this year they have a couple of wins this year that I think they were when I was two years and maybe one or two last year in total but a\nMuch better to a team is coming down the road you're going to we're coming into ... whitewater you also got good friends from Stevens Point\nAnd then he got a couple of games you're going to have to go to St out and you're going to happen to go to\nA private burial at the end of the things that that won't be a tough game ... all of the very formidable opponent they score a lot of points to watch that seemed to have a number each and every year they they play for a pet that's what they're planning for that game and that will be the final game of the that\nWe had a lot of stuff in between now and the final game of the season I Know the coaching staff but white water is not going to let that fall aside before we get to\nWork hard every week they have they been doing it right up to six eight ... by about a guy that I write songs but\nThey have moved up at one time they were fair game sixteenth or whatever it was a slowly climbed a ladder here at is how to put up here
