enjoy the excitement of the day I don't know what the excitement is of a someone at a table of filing through some pages find your name and then giving you a ballot or it's not exciting to me but uh some people like it is\nOh I think that's very true I especially in a small song you have volunteers or on your may not have seen a while who are working those fables so it was a little bit of a social ... yeah I like to make sure I get my vote out in case you're wrong over by a truck before elections [laughter]\nAll right well let's talk about what are you in the county board of decided to put on the ballot and Jefferson County or it's a question about dark store legislation or tell us what do you know about dark store legislation\nWhat from there there's a little gun law\nSo what do you know about dark store legislation that\nComes from there there's a loophole in Wisconsin law and the big box stores of course they have good attorneys and their job is to minimize the tax bill for these corporations and\nThey found that they can challenge\nTheir assessment so we all get on our property so many cents per thousands of um assessed value what is a large ... big box companies\nAre doing is arguing that they should not be tax on the value of the cities and villages a spouse or property that they should be taxed as their that building was on the park dark so\nWhat happens on how calm within that one of the ... have a certain amount of taxing authority and when they're not paying their full sure the big box\nStores that can spread out among everyone else in the ...\n[noise] no yeah yeah so is this happened in Jefferson County or is a potential there for it to\nI Know we talked earlier and I was doing some research on and I recall it on there was a challenge in Watertown but I was not able to verify that that is so\nSmall a city of Janesville not too far from here but in different counties which are in rock county or they have a a a handed over hundreds of thousands of dollars a beat it to not go to court on this because of the new ... view of how to do this and\nWhat I've learned is that uh there are lawyers that kind of just go through the phone book if you will to find out\nA phone numbers for the owners of these big big box stores and saying hey uh you know I don't know if you knew this but we take this to whatever community here in and tell them we're going to take into court they'll pay us some money\nAnd not to go there and a un and ah we talked to the representative Todd I'm Stan ... yesterday from could OSHA and he said that he like in them to a ambulance chief see no lawyers\nI guess you could say the corporate version of ambulances [laughter] so\nHere's the question that you're going to have on there I'll just read it\nI always like when people are kind of give me a ... what's going to be there\nUh it says a shooting the state legislature enact proposed legislation that closes the dark store loopholes which is currently which currently allow a commercial retail properties to significantly reduce the assessed evaluation and property taxes\nOf such properties resulting in a substantial shift in taxes levied against other tax paying entities such as ... residential homeowners and or\nCuts to an essential services provided by and affected municipality so uh what was the discussion before you put this on the ballot with your your colleagues on the ... percent\nFollowing the discussion I heard was pretty much yeah that's a no brainer down put it on the ballot has full ... say that our four guys for the most part and myself\nWe're not real big on putting advisory referendum or a size or a resolution virus joined us I Know a lot of counties or sue that'll last\nFall five view is that that time that we see is founding making sure that the titles are filled and so on and so forth all our other responsibilities\nAnd calling and government but this one was a ... on the county's association asked us take it on and that's really on the half of them and that's the ... most of these big box stores are in cities or colleges and says hurry up as you sat in Janesville on that later\nComes knocking on your door and if you don't want to engage and really expensive litigation certain goal shared and giving some of that money back though on land that gets spread out among all other property tax payers or your costs services\nAnd it's not just jump proceed Coney rock Tony's doing dean Tony's got this question to a bunch\nHave it on a this election cycle a survey of two hundred and Fifteen Wisconsin communities conducted by Wisconsin policy forum bound Seventy nine had dark store appeals in twenty Seventeen and that's up from sixty three in twenty sixteen\nSo it's a trend that you ... you and your colleagues looked at and didn't like I'm pretty sure\nThat yeah we'd all like that like a fair taxation we think that this is just taking advantage of a little falls through all boys than your fair share\nAll right so that is on the ballot or on a a November six weeks from today uh what else is happening in in Jefferson County what are you guys working at\nSo when we want to do is is just sit down with these people and and they have indicated that they are more than I mean of all the sitting down with us and having conversations about how we would like this law\nSo uh let me just back up and see where her to write a if you're saying that the state because this is somewhat brand new I guess you could say or they don't have any um language on the books or to regulate something like this so\nUh technically a of a solar farm or could just be you know there's no regulations just put it up they want to but it sounds like a year or solar farmers are wanting to do with the right way and they want to work it out prior to ah doing that\nThey do and at at a county reading or\nOne of the truth I'm company's paying and gave a lengthy presentation and answer some of the concerns\nThat neighbors have on the other one was in the audience or did not speak and we also had a if his name as recognizable the anti with an attorney named Matthew Franck Matthew Franck\nWho explains the state of current law with regards to installations such as a prank or you may remember was at one time secretary of Wisconsin to see in our\nOwn K. sure uh yeah [noise] yeah I would've bug me if you wouldn't have solved the mystery so and he's this electricity being so back to the electric company is that what's going on here\nThat's correct and you know I've I've been following this technology for a couple of years now and and really this is going to pay for next that foreign battery technology\n... found that I understand that they're not that far off and that'll solve the problem of what are you still with excess capacity during the hours of sunlight so that you have power during the nighttime hours and it sounds to me like the AR perfecting battery technology\nThat will allow them through that that will really revolutionize industry\nI'm not a neighbor living next to it but uh so I Am from point that out but I think it's kind of exciting and here's why because it is so brand new and ah you know I think we're going to whether people like it or not some\nOr we're going to get into other areas of renewable energy and ah I for you is the ... board chair\nAnd I'm sure you are you know you're looking at the fact that you could be the leader in this and uh there's a lot of advantages to do that\n[noise] that what we want to be respectful and sensitive to to those who have concerns but I wouldn't mind having Jefferson County be known as this solar farm call and I would not\nMind having our farmers having a stable source of income for a minimum of twenty five years if everything works out right\nNow and to me I mean my mind is really going all over the place\nAnd so what does it look like or the opportunity that's before you uh you know and of course you want to get it right in that started sometimes with with concern and there's nothing wrong with that and uh you but as long as everyone knows where everybody stands no surprises\nAnd hopefully some pointers boat taken uh that uh you can respect and understand as well\nUh that's the way things are done in your world or a gym\nThat what we want to be sensitive to when it concerns are brought up\nBut we want the debate back ...\nAnd ... as you know sometimes when when people say something and they see it as a threat to their way of life um they get a little bombastic and sometimes they stretch the truth a little bit and I wish I wanted to ask because\nI'm getting better off just by sticking to the fact that they have these are my concern what can you do to address right\nThat's uh that's how you work it out and I hope that's what everybody likes to do\nSo well good luck with that uh and so let me ask you this oh the one the solar farm this proposed ... before you that it doesn't have any conflict is that going to take a different road that will happen under a well or the lack of rules and everything or are they kind of in the same bunch\nWell I I think that has a fork in right now for the one on the west Sam that doesn't seem to have so many neighbors are out\nThey're not going to have a hard time with the public service commission because the public service commission is supposed to take into account the concerns of those who live around the solar project okay\nWhy I'd like to see that some time uh have you visited any solar farms Jim\nI haven't been any large one there was a similar size won a last too long ago built\nIn Iowa and that's going to lay on my radar to go take a look at that talk to neighbors a\nBright and talk to the neighbors around and see what they are exactly and I see your good leader that's what you want to do is I see what they think I'm maybe even take some of the neighbors with you if you can\nMake you\nYou know and that's how we work it out both good luck with that how exciting you know I was planning and just talking to you about dark stores you know that and here we are talking about solar farms as something that has a kid we uh we saw in buck Rogers movies so wow\nAnyway SARS SARS on solar life [laughter]\n\nA good one might well back to another matter at hand the dark story legislation\nIs on the Jefferson County a ballot a it's a ... or are you guys on one side of the other ballot did anything you have to go on the other side\nA knobs I haven't seen a sample ballot\nSo I don't like this or are there may be some score from them just seems like there is um every election term but um you know as far as protests that offices we have the the big ones the governor's race in the legislature and Congress\nJim you and I've been friends a long time and uh you've a run into people too and they I I don't know why they do this but the people you meet the mistake they say I'm not voting my vote doesn't matter uh Jim what are you seeing those people\n[noise] well I happen to agree the poster child for every ... matters a decade through following six I ran for mayor of drop is lost by one vote so you're\nMatters a lot by one\nYou lost by one vote ouch that man how but a look at you know how long you been a county board chair\nIs my fourth or\nBad you know uh you know I haven't been in the legislature uh that's Republicans Democrats we even had an independent at night time to time but you are nonpartisan do you like that\nLike is alive and uh we have\nFrom all across the political spectrum on our fours worth it to other leaders Mattis while she's fine without all of\nThat goes on in Madison ...\nWe don't have time for a year but a Jimmy you and I have been friends for a long time and uh I like the fact that you talk about your colleagues when they first got elected you didn't know well now you call most of them if not all your friends\nWill all\nOne of our um last as long\nAs we're all we're All

again I'm going to read the question for you\nAnd there isn't one of those where there are that you know next to you and your questions on there will now remember when you answer this question yes means no no we just not on this one\nAlthough it is a little convoluted I have seen that but the the I think you get the\nGist of it should the state legislature enact\nPropose legislation that closes the dark store loopholes which currently allow commercial retail properties\nTo significantly reduce the assessed evaluation and property taxes of such properties resulting in a substantial shift in taxes levied against other tax paying entities\nSuch as residential homeowners indoor cuts in essential services\nProvided by and infected municipality question mark\nAll right there you go and uh

for more years then you know is legit\n\nWell that's fine if you want to have those non guaranteed years so you could stretch the bonuses out\nI Won out clause that I can get out to\n\nI think they're gonna have to give Jay Jay water new deal\n\nAnd I think that's why they don't want to give JD cloudy a new deal because they want to see how much are they going to have to pay for Jay Jay before they allocate how much are they going to lock in long term but JD and that's why ... going to get franchise\nTo act and he's not going to be happy about it but it's going to get franchise steak\n\nAnd that's you know the Texans with with the marathon is if I'm the various Thomas I got fourteen million dollars non guaranteed\nI'm probably not going to see it so give me a new deal unless the Marius Thomas comes in and just lights the world on fire\nAnd even then I don't think the taxes are gonna pay fourteen million dollars it doesn't matter the Texans have a zillion dollars next Texans have something like Seventy million dollars fracture at least at least it might be more\nBut the idea of\nThe Texans paying out fourteen million dollars for thirty one year old receiver it's not going to happen the Texans right now have approximately sixty seven and a half million dollars in cash space for next year\n\nThat's before they figure out whatever they're going to do now keep in mind Jay Jay has a\nNon guaranteed deal for Thirteen million dumb areas Thomas's non guaranteed for fourteen million Kevin Johnson is non guaranteed for nine months\nYeah it's a non guaranteed deal for Thirteen million dumb areas Thomas's non guaranteed for fourteen million Kevin Johnson is non guaranteed for nine million\nDollar Kevin [noise] why even have never plays by ... always her Ryan Griffin non guaranteed to seven five\n\nOr ... non guaranteed three seven five Jay Joe's non guaranteed for four and a half million but\nAt four and a half million dollars I think Jay Joe was talking about it it's still a viable bargain you got a guy who could be just starting quarterback for four and a half million dollars I Know he's not as good as it used to be it's four and a half million dollars for a starting point\nI'll I'll take that\nYou know Lamar Miller's got a seven point three million dollar cap it next year he's only on a million dollars in debt cap is a million\nBucks that they can save six million dollars right there so there\nThere are guys who are going to they're going to be some kept casualties next year going to get rid of\nA a little more mellow they got us and let them do I would say I love you know my sources have confirmed a lady on bill will be he's insects and next year and Bryce Harper Lee He's an extra\n... that's definitely not happening I Wish it was but it's definitely not happening which wasn't that Bryce Harper is coming so that's just that's at the Houston Astros way are you doubting my sources Patrick I'm doubting your sources okay and\nThe reason I'm doubting your sources from direct conversations I've had with Jeff Luna regarding his philosophy they don't want to pay for bats they want to pay for arms they want to develop back and buy arms\nOtherwise I wouldn't necessarily doubt your your source but that's their philosophy\nYou think they'll buy my arm I don't know that gives him a throw Ninety six I could throw that six yeah probably not buying your arm up but not for more than a dollar I take that may be looking at like the first pitch I'll take that back for a dollar I'm Down [laughter]\nSo uh that's that's pretty much you know the Texans situation\n\nI don't understand how the giants don't make any most that makes no sense to me will get into that next because boy did they screwed up porch on this trade deadline\n[noise]\nFrom Wisconsin radio networks for his title down right\nNow with the latest from land both fears real\nTime Montgomery has been accused of this plane is coaches who killed them to not bring the kick off by the end zone near the end of the game on Sunday and online media reports said Montgomery did his own thing after he was seen throwing a tantrum on the sidelines after being pulled out of Sunday's game\n... frustrated I'm not done the players but frustrated I've never found anyone in the sideline I've never cursed out my team they don't curse out coaches that's not what I Do however I got a little frustrated I wanted to make a play I wasn't I wasn't planning very much and I wasn't able to make a play and I was frustrated about that I don't fully understand what my role is right\nNow Montgomery didn't talk after the game but he had plenty to say yesterday he and his family received social media threads he'd like to hear from his teammates that made anonymous comments about him but he's not going to seek them out he said and\nHonestly if they wanted to be known they would have said they would have made it clear I personally don't buy into that we talk about being brothers even things and how is that any other and that's not what happened I don't know maybe that's what they do in their family that's not what I Do a mind no one ever said anything to me so I'm thoroughly disappointed in the speculation\nI'll have more from titled town after this here's farmer and landowners John Bruno\nWe purchased slammed about three years ago and there was a whole farm

I don't believe any veteran player wants to come to camp on a non guaranteed deal\nI also don't think the Texans want to paint fourteen million but do you think the Texans try to work out a deal with him to keep them around after this year or you know fourth round pick are they looking at it as well because I Want to lose ... whatever\nThe earlier just how that will increase going to be I don't know the answer that question\nJust yet because the poor it has an injury you know anything about the I pay for them this year they were counting on the opposite form and then things linger in the middle of the season here for him\nWithin the injury nice yelled shark nearly as bad as it grew but\nWhile for el likelihood is not going to be ready when next season starts and if he is well then you've got to be careful with him I just don't know because it's for maybe more experience on the inside or comments could have played more on the inside I think you people both maybe\nDon't know because if for maybe had more experience on the inside or Thomas could've played more on the inside I think you keep them both and maybe you work something out with them areas promise lower the overall number but make sure he gets a lot more money\nNobody's gonna get guaranteed on that contract but I don't think the Texas it's going to be a way the approach and the off season I Will say this though\nI Do think they've got to target somebody\nWho can have a little bit more ... maybe a little inside little outside in the future to be behind this group because as you mentioned he keeps you see that's the main thing here in the NFL already\nAnd will force that injury from here in the NFL is well this one's his first big time season ending injury where he was contributing at a great degree um\nSo you gotta you gotta have some sort of yeah I'm not opposed to keeping Thomas I Am opposed the comics that that number when you theoretically have a lot of money to spend on the off season on today than clowning on current Matthew and stuff like that\nSo does this covers the Houston Texans for ESPN Ninety some vibes Houston will just on the back the Sinai come inside line going to take some ... monologue suing the seven million dollars\nAvailable to next year but like you said you know are they going to bring back Tyrone match or are they gonna have to you know are they gonna\nFranchise shady are they going to be going to do something with ... whenever there's going to cost a lot of money\nYou know is is Jay Jay ... going to need a new contract because\nHe's got three years on his deal with on non guaranteed money and I got a hard time believing his agent with all the injuries to Jay Jay has gone to the last couple of years and he's Asian is going to say yeah Jesuit why don't you go ahead and go to camp and if you get hurt and they cut you and you get nothing in no big deal he's going to try to protect his his his player in his investments\nSo I Would think that's probably another deal that's gotta get written\nA ... with all\nThose things together you know like you said you've ... Thomas might be a deal they got to write a what do you think of some other pieces that that they need to find\n[noise] do the thing with Jamie ... I asked you this tiring that he was a guy that probably is going to end up playing well enough to deserve a top contracts for things you can pay that because well\nHe's just don't make a ton of money I'll tell you this right now Patrick if they franchise today being cloudy and comedy is not going to show up\nTo play under the franchise tack effects will be dealing with a lady on bell situation if they franchise the they'd be cloudy he didn't them a favor by not treating them like ... predicts the raiders he's playing on that fits your options now Mack have a lot more\nLeverage in the situation but comedy show up for the parents they gotta be careful with how they interact with state and county and if they paid you have an economy\nThen they look right over across locker room and they see Ninety nine I see your at your watch if you mentioned the contract situation that kind of worried about that too they've got a lot of money\nSo they need to take care of their thighs first their organization that's always take care of their guy first\nAnd then you've got to go see what's out there you need to improve it tackle or you're going to go find maybe a fence or that you want to improve or is there an element of depth here or there at a certain position on the fence or to go try to find a lot of money to play with but they may have a lot less money to play with if they take care of their own guys like they should and like they usually do\nJody I thought it was the reason I really like just deals with the Texas ... songs I thought it shows a commitment to this season\nAnd maybe if if other parts of the of of their mother she weren't working as well but they're on a five game winning streak the office of one is bad but it's been better\nThan the you know absolute train wreck that it was oh they they moved from these around they put them back on the left side got tend to land on the run [noise] you know which will just moved they had to make because they needed ... couldn't work on the right side and ranking wasn't ready to play left tackle\nA great man says in a ... right guard because of injury\nAnd this line scenes you know less to leave this list machinations seems to be better than the previous generation on the line this year is that something that you think is a short term anomaly or is this line as constituted in improving lot\nSo I don't think they're near as bad as there that there are worse this season but I also don't think you're going to get the dolphins performance game after game where they allow one quarter back here no stacks and to try and watch and has as much time as he needed to make some of those place I think there's somewhere between here that's often said wind turned into an average offered survive I'm Talking\nAnywhere from Fifteen to twenty of fast often said wind and football\nIt's actually have a chance to do almost anything they want or off if there are a lot of average they're going to be able to do those dynamite numbers that you saw last season from the shot and watch the finger lacrosse fall even playing well and they're going to be a tough team be\nDown the stretch and we're going to be an annoying out for a really good teams in the play offs but it all hinges on and off into line they're rushing attack has been fantastic for little league football Miller for the first time ever the huge tax and attacked the backyard in fact that game's over one hundred yards rushing so", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "30"}
