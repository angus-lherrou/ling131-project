F. A. W.\nA month ago our county administrator Josh Smith said or has notified the sheriff's department of ah\nTheir intent to classify the correctional officers in the rock county jail and a request to find them from protective service to general service\nOr it would do a couple of different things that take away early retirement from people working in a correctional facilities and that\nThat would also affect their pension and um he did it under the letter of the law and order act had and he said it was his right to to do so that a few other colleagues had done so in the past\nUm he brought up a court case up in a Chippewa county and decided that his his reason for being able to do is so\nUm we\nHeard from the public two weeks ago or three weeks ago now all we heard from the public uh many people came and spoke out about keeping our correctional officers in protective service or we weren't able to speak on the issue three weeks ago however last Thursday we were\nAh we did hear from more public people or people in the public correctional officers themselves\nA lot of scary stuff from the correctional officers and things that they've dealt with\nAnd they've had this protective status for the last forty five years or so so um it was finally are turned asked questions ... county administrator Josh and ask questions and feel why he thought this was\nTurn to ask questions falls county administrator Josh and\nAsk questions and feel why he thought this was necessary and what his thought behind it was in one thing that stuck out to me that he said in his eyes the correctional officers rock counted do not meet the legal definition of law enforcement\nAnd he explained that there's three parts to law enforcement a definition in is to detect crime to prevent crime and to make an arrest so\nMy question to him was a correctional facilities I'm pretty sure every day the correctional officers\nDetect when things aren't right and they might observe contraband or they might observe in may a intending to do harm to another in may so\nThat was my observation on detecting a crime um the next part was to prevent crime so my question is supervisor Smith was or to a ministry or ... or\nIf we removed all the correctional officers out of the rock county jail would there be no crime inside the jail with day\nNot cause bodily harm to each other would there not be a new drug use which we know happens sometimes even with our great correctional staff there still contraband inside the or the facilities and he didn't\nHe didn't have a good answer for that and then um\nThe third part was to detain a maid or making a rest so my other question was if there was a crime committed inside of the jail the correctional officers would be the ones detaining said inmates and then there's also compounding\nCharges brought against these inmates while they're in the correctional facility what there is a crime committed so\nIn my opinion that these individuals working as a correctional facility absolutely me definition of law enforcement\nAnd we just change what's your understanding of supervisor Potter does this take away their bargaining rights to\nYeah it's uh it definitely affects their collective bargaining rights under act ten and a that was brought up at the county board meeting from another supervisor that it does so and um I was just more worry you know I wasn't quite worried about that I was just worried about the safety\nAnd not just the safety of the correctional officers who ... their the correctional officers are just working in the jails they're also part of the SWAT Team they're also part of the dice team in ... county if there's a water emergency they participate in that they\nThey they participate in all these other things\nThat's not my only concern my own mother concern is that it makes themselves there's people inside the rock county jail right now\nWho are innocent of crimes waiting waiting for their time\nTo have their day in court okay and then we also have some pretty dangerous individuals inside of the jail those correctional officers protect each and every one of us is having forbid if I was ever found inside\nIraq county facility I Would walk down protecting me from those looking to do on me so\nIt's it was my opinion that these individuals\nAre definitely in law enforcement and then he said that they didn't meet it fifty one percent of the time that they don't do those services fifty one percent of the time in my opinion is they do that one hundred percent of the time so\nSo uh when he says other ... are doing and there's one Tony not too long ago could have been this week earlier I was a door to door county and they took a vote on this and uh ... what happened\nCorrect that is true a door county voted last week to maintain protective status for their correctional officers\nAnd I'm supervisor Smith brought up by I Want to believe it was ... county decided them as removing protective status from their correctional officers and then somebody\nPointed out that they only have like twenty eight inmates and their county jail\nHow many do we have on average\nOr an average five hundred\nOr there's a little bit difference between the twenty eight and a five hundred and I'm I'm pretty sure the crimes up in Chippewa are a little bit different than those in rock county so\nI Would imagine where we go from here what happened this send to communities that rain and they did they vote on it\nBut yeah you got censorship committee than it needed to get out of a committee for uh the county board to vote on it next week\nOctober eleventh at the regular scheduled county board meetings and last night I'm happy to say it did get out of public safety it got recommended that the um the full county board vote on\nKeeping protective status for the correctional officers so we will be voting on that next week Thursday October eleventh or didn't make it out of the public safety committee last night\nWas a unanimous assessment of I\nI Believe so I Can't speak for game ... in the room but there I Do know for a fact that there wasn't a place to stand at this public here at this public meetings so I Do know for a fact that the the room was packed so\nOnce again we are for more more of the people that we represent that this is something that they're taking very seriously so and I myself\nHave three different emails and phone calls from individuals in my district who reached out to me I'm asking me questions and then I explained what what I knew what was going on and all three of them agree that this is something that we should maintain the protective status of our correctional officers\nWell that's how it works if you will be one way or the other you should be getting older you're a supervisor in rock county and let them know especially now since it's a schedule provoked when does it again Bob\nThat's next week October eleventh our general meeting is at six\nSix PM so we we welcome the public's opinion and I mean it it's the same thing that we um the reason we put a marijuana and the referendum we want to hear from the public I mean I understand we're elected officials and\nYou know the public has elected us to represent them but in some situations\nIt's more than the twenty nine or thirty of us that should be making the decision we want to hear from the public we want to know what they think\nThen once the best for our county [noise]\nAll right we're going to take a break we'll be back with more right after this double us\nYou're listening to start in the

accurate advertisers only care how many clicks did we get\n\n... and that's why this model or while we're starting to see new models come out like the athletic uh John Clayton football just just started\nSites that are real reporters with real information that have a monthly subscription fee as opposed to a you know all the the banner\nAds and click ads and things like that because you can't necessarily always get reliable information from\nCompanies that rely on banners and click ads et cetera because they're they're not holding to the troops there holding to the click\nYou know there's

game and you're cheering your face off that is exactly what an eight year old is supposed to do much some rotten bitch sitting in front of her decided to tell her to stop sharing\n\nKnow aside from the fact that there's a special place in hell for someone who dares to speak to somebody else's child number one number two tells an eight year old and a baseball game to stop cheering\nHonestly this woman deserves to be punched in the face by every single person in the city of Houston ended up set the poor little eight year old girl\nWho then wouldn't cheer for the rest of the game because this rotten pitch in front of her intimidated her and it upset her that much\nFortunately it was caught on video and then it was posted a and then it was on Fox twenty six and a lot of buddies over at Fox twenty six I'm On there every now and then oh yeah it got out it got to the Astros\nSo eight year old ... who was a massive Astros fan\n... send me a lot of the players today at the to the team had closed work out but they invited Chloe and Chloe got to meet all the players she got her Jose all through the shirt she got a ton autographs she got an official twenty Eighteen baseball\nThe Astros
