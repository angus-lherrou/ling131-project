before a but tonight\nWe got through starting pitchers real quickly I wanted to go over a million of on invite you to listen to the game on a WFL W ... the way to go seven thirty five tonight is a higher and beginning of our broadcast and of course it's a\nThat you know books traders are spokesman investors investors get jitters or you know on the flip side investors shrug off the bad news and solve this silly or trying to rationalize why the market does what it does well\nThe the markets last week the the official storyline was when the you know when the ten year treasury knows when the yield of that started to spike up words up above three percent a three point one four percent that was this inflection point that the\nTraders were watching a that started to be with that to symbolize a dangerous sign for for future growth a and a well you had a broad based sell off really an American and also other international markets so the data lost about Thirteen hundred points\nYou know over the course of a couple of days um I think they recovered some of that towards towards the end but whatever the case the market loves to shake out complacency and loves to get people on the edge of their seats\nMarket never really gives you a free ride it makes you earn your money if you're if you're an individual investors so now we see this week and guess what our old friends were in the news this morning Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley\nNo blew the roof off or anything surprise surprise and the market rejoice and you know these traders who are being interviewed I sing while the markets focusing back on fundamental now and you know the corporate earnings\nLandscape is still extremely good and we still have the tax stimulus um\nThat's working its way through the system so were\nYou know we're we're confident that the uh that the landscape for corporate earnings is going to continue to be a good through the fourth quarter of course that's true I mean the wall street has been rolling in money a for a for quite a few years now and I don't I don't see it stopping anytime soon even though bond yields\nAh went up to three point two five another back down to three points one for which you know gave everybody because he's their fear is a bit\nBut if if you know if you're the person who is you have four O. one K. is or you have mutual funds and you're you're hearing about these things and then use you start thinking to yourself gosh you know am I Am I in trouble with my investments are going to be a a you know the joy is do I need to start redeeming my mutual funds because uh you know bond rates are going up so\n[laughter] there's there's there's so many ways of looking at it but but the bottom line is the the fundamental framework of why the market has been going up for quite a few years now it's still in place\nAnd uh with the corporate tax cuts we had at the end of last year it just really bad at the field so that fire so uh you know nothing to see here the market is back in in happy land this morning and ah you know everything is everything is good again\nSo when I hear my president call a porn star wars fees I shouldn't use money around my mutual funds\nWell you're really depends on what you're going to focus on that day in terms of his his tweets right so he he he came out and attack if you remember Gary Cohn his former economic advisor\nOr who is a Goldman Sachs man uh he he attacked him and basically publicly blackmailed him by saying or\n... you know I can tell you things about Gary Cohn that you wouldn't believe of course he didn't elaborate but uh you know the the White House is in the midst of this major security sweep to find out who they are true loyalists are and who could be the source of these leaks that have come out the cause of embarrassments\nSo I you know I mean just just today in general there were several on the hinge ran I mean going between Jeff Sessions the Russia probe Elizabeth Warren\nEveryone just pretty much could I say shrugs it off because ah is this is coming you know everyone says consider the source so uh you know I I wanted to also introduce a segment today I'm\nI I think is really important that we get a little comic relief from the news cycle right I mean even William Shakespeare included a little comic relief in his most tragic works okay I'd like to introduce a segment called great moments in American political discourse and it's just that today's Twitter exchange between our presidents\nFloating over the Stormy Daniels defamation lawsuit yesterday getting dismissed because the judge basically said now you know Trump the sultan Daniels on Twitter and when she called her a con job at a liar while that's protected under his First Amendment rights and well Trump's tweets were considered you know normal\nA hyperbole and bluster and of course Trump comes out this morning and floats and says you know quote\nFederal by the way should I go to the Trump pointed to keep my own way\nOffensive to you you you just one [laughter] we all have one that federal judge\nThrows out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump Trump is entitled the full legal fees great now I can go after horse face and her third rate lawyer and the great state of Texas\nShe will conform to let her she signed where she said she denied the affair\nShe knows nothing about me a total con and of course Michael having that have an ... he gets in in into the a Twitter war and says that\nThe president is a quote disgusting massaging as an embarrassment to the United states and he says bring everything you have because we're going to demonstrate to the world what a complete shy around liar you are having a ... he wrote and he also said\nHow many other woman women did you cheat on your wife with while you had a baby got home\nThis is this is again an exchange now with the president of the United states\nAnd a lawyer representing a porn star I\nThought you were getting it from the Jerry Springer show I'm Sorry\nI'm not sure Syria Springer have anything on the Trump show I think I think the Trump show it get better ratings\nStormy Daniels hits back and says and she I mean the time of war and you're right here there there's a low ball coming through me Daniel sweet because no no man really wants to hear this Stormy Daniels says ladies and gentlemen may I present your president\nIn addition to his um shortcomings\nHe has demonstrated his incompetence hatred of women and lack of self control on Twitter again and perhaps a pen shop for ... of course referring to him calling her horse\nGame on tiny oh of course is a reference to Stormy Daniels providing a detailed description of the president of the United states Jenna Talia in her recently released book so that was that was my first installment in great moments in American political discourse Andy\nWhy he thinks he's a bit you know it makes me wonder let's see somebody we are going to get another president going to happen and if the president wants to put some restrictions or\nSome things to the right thing to do on on Wall street\nWall Street out on the president will the kind of tighten up and I did do you do need\nTo punish someone who wants to do the right thing you know what's what's regulations on them and to make things work better what will happen during I mean I can you predict the future the ability to do that\nJohn I'm In and make things work better ah what was that happened during the ... minutes can you predict the future but do they have the ability to do that\n[noise] so what they do have the ability to do is at Wall Street plays kingmaker right we talked last time I was on the show we talked about pac superPAC\nAnd how they have um how they have really dominated the political landscape\nReally sense in the past four years so for example I looked at those statistics about who the biggest donors were in some of these packs a superPAC so\nRight now in the two thousand Eighteen election cycle and there are more than five hundred superPACs that have contributed\nThree hundred million dollars she nearly twice as much that the owners have to be the group shift into without for fourteen\nAnd remembers superPACs can raise and expand on limited amounts of money for virtually any sort to influence elections um one really really scary fact I was looking at\nA news release about President Trump's twenty twenty reelection campaign\nHe said that he's raised Eighteen million dollars in the past three months and that means that he has already raised one hundred and sixty million dollars for a race that two years away that just by way of comparison in the second year of office rock Obama\nRaised four million dollars George W. Bush\nIn the first two years of office raised three point two million three point to and for Trump is up to a hundred million dollars that downing that's totally unprecedented the amount of money\nA sitting president collect in less than two years of his first term right\nAnd I'll get into that about ... shrimp their political reasons why president doesn't do that and then there's you know there's some valid reasons past presidents don't\nRaise money in their first two years because they want to send the signal that the campaign is over there the president of all the people\nThat are focused on getting the job done that they were elected to get done and they're not worried about reelection of immediately in other words the hyper campaigning in at a time for governing well Trump has never played by these rules Trump has been a non stop political fundraisers and political rallies since he's taken office it's\nDowning so yeah we talked last week that there is unfortunately the fact that this super PAC pacman he has taken over our entire political system it's taken a hostage\nAnd that is you know our our political system isn't a game it's not just a two party fight for what the way every person in this country the government and how we function and co exist as a civilization and guess what Wall Street and these rich\nI not only think that the tax cut in ... I don't think it would create but that but that I think it will be beyond revenue neutral so he said I think it will produce more than enough to fill that gap trying to sell the tax cut as being the thing that would be good for the for the ... well it's not it's not and you don't make no mistake\nThat the Republicans are after what they call entitlement reform\nAnd in title of reform and they make it sound like people you know that we've got to go after these people who were free loading off your hard earned dollars well it's not freeloaders basically it's your mom and grandma medical care and it's your Social Security and shrinking Medicare Medicaid and Social Security\nEither by reducing benefits or raising the retirement age\nYou know McConnell's that without a bipartisan deal to do that the political backlash would be like like no other now remember Trump promised during his campaign that he would not cut Social Security he would not cut Medicare and he would not cut Medicaid\nEven though his budget proposal we see now have included trends to all three program and we know that our new Wisconsin congressional retiree\nPaul Ryan has been targeting everyone's Social Security and Medicare for a long time and energy and by the way on the other end closer to Paul Ryan's retirement\nWhich he said he wants to spend more time with the teenage kids and I think they're aged fourteen and sixteen isn't that when your kids want to spend the least amount of time with the with five at all\nThat's what I found yeah yeah yeah so so\nSo in the news today you know Chuck Schumer comes out and says you know McConnell and other Republican ... who trillion dollar hole in the federal deficit to fund a tax cut for the rich and now they're just cutting\nWell and other Republicans blue with two trillion dollar hole in the federal deficit to fund the tax cuts for the rich\nAnd now they're suggesting that cutting earned middle class programs like Medicare Social security Medicaid is the only fiscally responsible solutions to solve the problem that's absurd\nThan the policy of course comes out and said onto this twisted GOP agenda we can afford tax cuts for millionaires but not the benefits are seniors have er and\nYou know that's the thing that Speaker Ryan does a lot he refers to Social Security is a title moon program this is something that we all he used to when we start working in a you know it's\nA it's not that you get it back in the er at the time of your retirement you are when you are going to uh start taking it a ... it's the fact that you're the people need to in the same time\nYou're going to be taking from that as well they'll be taking them from the people who will be paying you do it at that time but in title meant is ... ... that's not what I my parents told me that was the definition and that word\nNo\nThey're they're they're they're trying to link there trying to link things like Medicare Social security to things like welfare rights because everyone you know everyone has a has a knee jerk negative you know these welfare recipient of recipients are cheating the system in these food stamp people are milking the system and they're trying to tie that\nAnger over those things towards the Medicare Medicaid and Social Security I mean we\nHow in the world how can we consider ourselves and advanced civilization and a a beacon of democracy for the rest of the world if we\nAre continually taking away the rights of our citizens and continually take away the burn benefits of our citizens and continue to treat our senior citizens like they are aren't important in a while I think this is a you know this is a\nI I hate to quote you know Trump ex lawyer Michael Cohen this might be the most important election of heart lifetime [laughter] 'cause these these guys are\nComing for your Social Security they're coming for your Medicare or ... and and they uh you know and they have an army of people who just don't understand the issue a behind them\nRight you know I was reading from the u._s._a. today and uh how would you describe using ... it's not a a left leaning you're right leaning you please the middle of the road ...\nOh yeah yeah of course it that's\nAll right good guy I mean 'cause you know everybody wants to leave all newspapers you know you I haven't really heard you go after the u._s._a. today's when someone has a pretty good source and it comes from a guy named stand a calendar and opinion contributor\nAnd he said it wasn't directly of course but the U.S treasury so there's a source that\nJust the facts ma'am officially reported something Monday yesterday that depending on your political party of choice either long suspected would happen refused to admit it was possible but last year's big tax cut bill significantly increase the federal budget deficit\nAnd according to the monthly treasury statements again the facts are fiscal twenty Eighteen\nYears that just ended September thirtieth the deficit was seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars\nYou one hundred and Thirteen billion dollar\nA balloon and Seventeen percent increase over six hundred and sixty six billion deficit dollar deficit recorded last year that was the biggest one year increase the deficit since two thousand nine of course two thousand nine that wasn't during good times right Gordon\nYes and and we're and we were told hey just you know we know what we're doing we're going to pass the tax cuts because it's\nYou know it's it's the tax reform of a generation and where you know or and Americans are going to see how great it's going to be and we're going to put money in your pocket or we're going to stimulate the economy and guess what it didn't happen\nIt was it was really all just a lie because every Republican who's running for election in the mid term no one's talking about the tax plan no one's talking about how great the tax plan of worked up even though it was their intention to do so they now realize oh wow it really turned into a big\nDug for the average American taxpayer for middle class even upper middle class America it didn't work out too well for them it's worked out really good for the billion dollar corporations worked out really good for the billionaires that's why you have guys\nWho are billionaire you know casino magnate and ah who and and and the Koch brothers who who who are who are benefiting from that tax plan\nWell let me ask you know we're we're hearing this statistic sure the vaccine you know jobs were adding to jobs who isn't that what the tax plan was supposed to do was to increase jobs ... middle America\n[laughter] okay so so there's no there's a lot of ways you can manipulate\n[laughter] as jobs numbers right there there is there's been talked about quite extensively\nAnd the jobs are being created are very low end entry level non training or non trainee\nVery low paying jobs wages are not increasing people not people are not seeing their take home pay go up or I mean you know what I mean this this might be a time as soon as they look like Ronald Reagan said when when Trump is up for re election to argue better off today than you were four years ago and I think the answer is going to be no we're still you know we're\nPaying three dollars and thirty cents for for premium gas now two dollars and Ninety cents for regular ah costs are going up real estate costs are going up rents are going up\nFood's going up the tariffs are going to uh raise the cost of doing just about anything I'm I'm remodeling my whole right now when I got a call from my carpet supplier for my final flooring supplier saying hey you needed the police are border by October Fifteen because of\nThe tariffs are going into effect and that carpet you wanted to buy and that foreign you wanted to buy is going up by twenty percent so I think people are going to see their their the money that they ultimately have at the end of the year is shrinking because of the Israeli air and\nEconomic policies that Trump has has her has really a unleashed out of the tax plan to help\nThey can point to a couple of job for the faint look we were wearing you know more people are getting jobs that that's not that's absurd wages aren't going up people aren't taking hold on more money if it was nothing but an absolute they they broke our our uh uh they broke the budget\nTo put more money in the pockets of the billionaire it's simple as that that's not a political statement that's legitimately true about Sarah Sanders was on the line with us she would find a way to tell me that was wrong and completely with some type of Mr with a misrepresentation uh I mean\nPaul Ryan himself said that if you remember there was a tweet by by I think it was a teacher with that I think I'm going to make about sixty dollars extra ... a year from the tax plan of Paul Ryan said hey that's greatly that'll pay fare Cosco membership\nSo that that that's the way the Republicans look at the middle class hey you know you're not important but we're gonna you know working its way to sell you down we're going to sell you down the river so or through our billionaire corporate uh you know puppet master\nHey you're not important but we're going to you know we're going to sell you down here to tell you down the river for through our billionaire corporate uh you know puppet master can can take the money [laughter]\nSo blue and finally I and how it affects Wall Street is worried like to go with this but ah the news about what happened in Saudi Arabia and a New York times reporter I went in didn't come back out\nA or a president started to go with a ... story about ruled killers but doesn't sound like he really he says he wants to get to the bottom of it but I'm not so sure he does\nYou know is it different rules and what does the wall street or does\nThis mean see when they're talking about Saudi Arabia because when I started ... in oil pleased big part on the stock market so uh what do you make all this\nThat's a very good point you can you make several Saudi Arabia is a [laughter] we don't have to go back to the seventies and the oil embargo right so that every every a traitor knows about that about what that that to the economy or Saudi Arabia\nOr there was a little luncheon today with legislative leaders from the Wisconsin state\nSenate and\nI guess there were some snarky\nComments from both leaders can't wait to hear about that\n[noise] so that's going to happen\nOn Thursday but we'll have other guests as well join me

[noise]\nTurn a hit into a now\nI honestly don't know why Tony camp doesn't start in left field every day\nEspecially a minute maid\nHe is extremely superior defensively to anyone else St play in left field\nWhen when you consider the the regular line of sheer Springer some center and read and write off and simply he's a solid bat defensively he's tremendous\nI Know they want to get ... bad in there too but and I have no problem with ... being and maybe because it's always been a big part of of they're often\n\nYou know if you have to then uh I mean like look at today I'll to base the aging today so Marlins playing second\n\nBut you got to find ways to keep Tony camp in the outfield if that means you know Marlins got to the age if that means Marlins got to play short I'm hoping that crawls Korea's back is starting to feel a little better but I doubt it\nAin't looking like it I Hope that you know they're able to give him some you know some injections to make his back feel better but if they haven't worked for two and a half months I don't know why they're suddenly going to work now\n\nI'm I'm looking that if you don't ... has either got to start heading or maybe you got to take them out of line up like legit because you know what bribing to play short Marlene can play short Lauren can play third\nThat would mean Tyler White would be playing ... what would you gauge\nIt means there's so many guys who are who are interchangeable there with the Astros cause brain can play third right wing can play short Moran can play short or third you only can play first or third Tyler why can only play first but he's not very good at it is not I would really like to keep power white in the ... position\nSo the idea to me is if if Korea\nIs unable to play it at you know enough of a level that you have to consider bantering him either a Marlins do on a short or breakfast on a short moments going sir\n\nI just don't see I don't see it in his doing embedding him I said it if he goes to one of those over twelve stretches\nI mean the only hit he had in the first series with the home run the last game was only hit he had\nYeah I think he's got one here so far and he gets to you have to hit the Syrian speak so\nAnd they're all singles\nI Hope Korea can head because I don't know anybody who doesn't want to root for cause grave for his whole but if if you can't hit\nThat's got to be a consideration it sucks but it's got to be a consideration\nSo they both are will go to the NFL he will forget the rest of the season he'll forget whatever bowl game possible national
