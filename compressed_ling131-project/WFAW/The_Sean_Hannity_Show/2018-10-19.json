I think that would be the the earliest he would come back at me right after the bodies hamstring injury seems to be pretty significant\nThat would be weak eleven\nThe jags wrong by week ten they if anything he won't be back until after the virus about week eleven they had to make a move because the only back they've got right now to jail and he's been good but you can't risky we won back\nSo for net and and I think everybody thinks for net is a terrific player but this is two years in a row for and it hasn't been able to stay healthy\nAnd the other thing is when it does come back he's probably looking at a time share recall aside now\nIt wouldn't be the worst thing though would it because he's coming back from Miami is it ... or his\nAbility to stay on the field and know that would be good for his ego for his production uh for anybody who owns them in fantasy that would be bad\nNow the the real impact on Carlos ... no ... on the top twenty back I use rush for three hundred and eighty two yards and five touchdowns so you can probably expect him to be the focal point of the rushing attack from the jags\nAnd probably be the you know the guy who gets to touchdown carries you know when they get into the red zone the biggest the carriers\nBut the bigger\nImpact on this is for the browns the browns just traded their top running back a ... I Would think that Nick Chubb now offends two primary ball carrier\nI don't I don't think the browns view do junction as a primary ball carrier or they may look at him as a third down guy change of pace guy so this elevates Nick Chubb\nTwo primary ball carrier if he's available in your lead you should be grabbing him now\nAnd the other thing is that a Baker and a job\nThey think a lot of people seem to think shove we'll wind up being a top twenty back going forward\nOr other interesting stuff the raiders\nApparently are concerned about marks on Lynch's injured growing\nAnd if Lynch needs surgery on his growing he'll miss it at least a month the raiders are already a disaster\n\nOkay I'm update from what I just said the the jags by is not is not we can they come back from the ... so far and that would be back for week ten that's the that's the speculation\nLearn more dot com slash well he brokered services number ...

know every week should be a fun sold week of college football or how would you like to be eleven years old and getting a scholarship also\nI think that would be a panic I mean it's not the first time we've heard someone that you're getting what offered definitely not coming from LinkedIn but I think\nThat that would\nBe an incredible uh things to get out whether he sticks to stick to the opera I think it'd be interesting to see\nYet well who knows where the heck Lincoln will be coaching or disease coaching a when we get to what seven years from now when he will to play college ball but ah yeah\nFor sure targeting that line it's not a not a bad idea\nNo if you're going to get somebody less than you you want to get somebody who's got some experience\nBy you know what I was able to you in college uh you know most of the time I'm sure that the good pedigree so that you know that that should be able to help them I'm sure that blanket that like I mentioned is the first time that he reached out and get a scholarship offers\nTo a middle school kids you know even though I think it's maybe the the earliest but again he likes to say hey I'm going to be there for a while so when you when you're eligible or look me up\nMatt now trying to find you know one of the one of the the the rank games where we have games that involve multiple rank teams we can actually hopefully get\nYou know a a a tough game la ACC and Clemson are taking on NC State this week and a lot of people seem to think that is Clemson is going to stumble this is the game where they're going to stumble uh what do you think about in the state in ... and this week\nI think it was a huge game for both programs I mean listen the ACC has it been nearly as strong as bad in the past couple of years so this is probably the most\nYou know are the key match up right now for both these two teams and you know for clubs and you know they're they didn't burn down and the AP rankings you know they need to wait overact opponent because the rest of the remainder of their regular season schedule isn't that tough you know probably will face another way to\nUntil they get into a you know the the chairmanship that the ... will have kind of struggled a little bit with Miami\nYou know losing last weekend so you know they need to get away at your clients them because you want to continue to showcase what you're trying to do and the state looking to to continue its great start wide Stanley obviously the the other one pack quarterback has done a good job he is the biggest challenges one law higher they get the chance to try to beat clumps of\nEvents so close last couple of years but to me that the game right now the ... the parents have been ... coffee the mob\nMatt LSU is now back up to five you know this was you know do we believe in LSU coach oh finally got things or the way that he wanted them to spank ... then they lost the Florida Nice bank Georgia now they got\nIn Mississippi State at home and ended up by week before they host Alabama or is this going to be a difficult game for them because Mississippi State as a quality opponent\nOr is it a difficult game for them because they might be looking ahead to Alabama\nI get a little bit of both you know I think also in Mississippi State had to buy week coming into this game so that could be a little bit rough and ready to go you know listen to LSU best hopes are are going to be one here in Baton Rouge you know they they in Georgia last week that they they look to beat\nMississippi State and as you mentioned that in two weeks that got Alabama so they can somehow pull out the trifecta in what all three game show they would set themselves up and the ... uh to me they have to do exactly what they did against Georgia they have to be physical but\nThey have to be dominated on the ... has decided the football they have to get to the quarter back there to get to ... make sure he doesn't get comfortable in the pocket it off that suddenly they any job or to play\nA you know a solid turnover free type of game I mean what he looks good he's good but when he look bad it looks like the joke world\nThat we saw against Florida that you know the gators are able to pull off the win so for our shoot this is a huge game for them they can't look too far ahead but you know obviously there's going to be some people are turning their heads towards out without a game\nThat emerged of euro land will send only covers college football where there's only about the aside Tom in San ... or ... you know some people seem to think this might be Jim ... Michigan team or they're going to take on Michigan State in ...\nIs is this the game that Michigan handles pretty easily years you know this is the old time rivalry game is is it going to be that type of games where you know the maybe the weaker team just he's able to rise up because it's a rivalry game\nYou know I I don't think that was going to be a blow out by any stretch of the imagination I mean this game has always been close to the last couple of years there is like you mentioned it to a rival that loved to play\nGood to be a blow out by any stretch of the imagination I mean this game has always been close to the last couple of years there is like you mentioned\nThis to a rival that loved to play it closed even if you're a ... your big underdog you know I think Michigan State will come out and play a really hard to me what's been impressive about Michigan so far as ever since that lost the dirty and the season opener they really kind of reinvented the stuff we knew they had a really solid defense\nYou know Don brown the sense of quarters does an amazing job you know there were suffocating type defense but they rarely off the side of the football they really went back to basics they started running the football you're seeing shape Patterson getting more comfortable at the quarterback position she's been able to run the football as well I think there are averaging over two hundred and Seventy yards\nPer game this reminds me this team sort of like a little bit of the Stanford teams that he had that Jim horrible had back in the day you know that went to the Orange Bowl with with ah Andrew Luck you know this is a very solid performing team if they can get that went over Michigan State get over that hump again you know I think then they kind of continues to move forward\nEdging towards that you know Penn State game and then eventually go house which could determine who wins the ah the Big East\nOh and then you've got a Oregon fresh off of you know a close win over Washington now they'll hand on the home and and take on wants to do\nIs is this again I'm Mike Lee just had some teams they may sound a lot of teams that ... that kind of hung around the back of the of the other rankings\nAre they good enough to rise up here against Oregon oh can Oregon maintain you know the high after getting the big victory over Washington\nYeah you know they're going to happen if they're going to do that we're going to have to you know really kind of get itself right at all when it comes to passing the fence you know because of Washington state's window with white college teams and they're going to throw the football and their quarterback garden and then she has the average over four hundred yards per game I mean she just throws a football around\nI'm I'm sure they're gonna try to do that as well if you're Oregon listen you're you're pretty much the best chance the pack twelve has possibly of getting a team into the play offs but you're going to need to continue to go you know to keep playing these big game this again is probably the last game they'll face\nI guess the quality opponent so they're going to need to win at least until they get the if they get to the ... world championship so they need to keep you know winning these type of games you hope that maybe they won't get that led down after that big whatever Washington\nBut you know again this is done defensively to swear I expect them to stand up and try to stop you know guard I mentioned make sure he doesn't kind of throw the ball over the place because this Timmy can be one of those trapped games that you mentioned coming off that emotional whenever Washington that maybe somebody can slip up if you're walking you can't let that happen\nIn temperature ... civil for a long time ... with us on the outcome in sun line ... who is the who is the best team in the big twelve is the Texas is Oklahoma who's the best\nYou know I think at this moment I think you've got to states Texas was that was the best football right now based on what's going on I mean they've kind of gone back to basics a little bit uh you know running the football well not trained to football over um I think Oklahoma it", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "19"}
