Scott\nUh the uh executive director of the rock or free clinic Kristin Wallace and the presidency you know for the health care or Mike Wallace scratched than I interrupted you\nOf ... there are so many communities that don't have anything like that\nRight in back in two thousand three when our free clinic started there were were even quite a few less free clinics yes but our big change was in two thousand eleven when I think the folks around this table that we're sitting here west really wanted to do a step better than a one\nAfternoon evening a week but why can't we have a free clinic that's open fulltime so that would do the very best to serve folks in our community without health insurance and see that in an era we are\nPeople with insurance\nAt last count 'em Jefferson County had about five thousand\nOf our citizens without health insurance that that's more than I thought yeah so um anyway we still have that great gap and it is because we have the community partners that we have full time coverage\nTo take care of of that gap so hopefully it's a temporary gap for people they find their without health insurance because their new employer doesn't offer health insurance or they're waiting for that health insurance to kick in or they're waiting to get on the market place during the time frame\nThat they need to do so or in in many cases were able to show them that they are um [noise]\nThey qualify for badger care which is\nYeah and I've talked to people but in many cases they when they go there they find out yeah you've got health care available they just had no idea\nRight and that's one of our goals is to get folks on to the very best coverage you know that we can sell\nBut I guess in the spirit of this conversation we feel we're part of the continuum and we're we're here because of our partners and we continue to be here because of our partners so I I'm very grateful that that we could be an example of what our community does when we see that there's a need\nAmazing and the same goes for ah the county health services\nIs that there's a need amazing\nAnd the same goes for a Tony health services department for people to call you want to I don't know where you can get this but they will or senior benefit specials ... directed a lot of people to the crew would probably hit me for\n[laughter] no they don't read by giving a very busy just movies we\nDo have for a health department for ... ... we do have some really great programs and one of the initiatives that we didn't write for in a this healthy communities designation is our new talk read play initiatives\nAnd um they uh are of a\nA cooperative initiative with a greater Watertown community health foundation and we also work with dodge county and uh the city of Watertown and all of our staff or all of our public health nurses are trained in the parents as teachers program\nAnd we also have a\nReally nice prenatal care coordination program and that the goal is to kind of morphed them together and some days\nWe should have a discussion on on that whole initiatives and we're really looking at the younger children and starting out early to prevent any issues\nUm the parents of teachers there's a wonderful program that teaches parents [noise]\nUm and and I wish I could have taken it when I was beginning a parent but teaches them that their their child's greatest teacher\nAnd um it's just a really great evidence space program\nAnd uh we um have other services and other uh things that are going on and one of the things I wanted to mention with rock river free clinic has set the state came to us and asked us to do a pilot program in offering immunizations to uninsured people\nAnd they specifically asked us to do it because we had rock river free clinic and the community dental clinic and they felt that we would have a captive audience so to speak that we could offer all adult immunizations a free of charge\nAnd the state at a gave us the vaccine and we're having a special clinic on this Friday\nOr at the health department on ... and Jeff her son from eight to for anybody who's uninsured can come in and get free vaccines and it'll be an are lower level clinic area\nAnd also through December fourteenth or any time during rock river free clinics\nWe can offer the free vaccines and it's just a really cool ah initiative and a way that the state has recognized that the health department and the free clinic have a great relationship and gives us an opportunity to make sure that people are fully immunized\nAnd what's really neat is we are actually being very proactive on this so everyday we will take a look at our patient schedule and one of the public health nurses will review it in the state um immunization record system and proactively\nNotify the patient and say hey listen looks like you need this immunization and then we will do sell so we're not just looking to the patient that comes out and say I think I'm needing something we will be proactive with our patients schedule\nAnd that's another unique a thing that a partnership is that for health care\nWas one of the first up\nHealth care systems too I have all their clinics and doctors put immunizations into the Wisconsin immunization registry\nAnd that allows for us to know that people have been vaccinated and it saved from people getting too many vaccines or not the right facts scenes and um it is a great system I'm now years and years later most health care providers up\nInput into that system\nI'm I recently had to call the state of Georgia for a vaccine record and realize that they don't really have the same type of system and ah it was kind of amazing ah wow you don't have this because you know it's just a great system and I remember\nA having one of our doctors who was really into this system go and talk to the Ford healthcare doctors and pretty soon they were all on board and uh again\nAnd just acknowledging the people that mental health issues are part of your health issues and seek health of a help and and don't hide it\nYou know talk about it and get help 'em before it you know it it's too late and and\nWe have issues that we don't want to hear about\nUm I think another great initiative in our county and again we didn't write for it\nIn this ah application because there were just too many we would have been a five hundred page application\nBut his serves zero suicide coalition and again working with a very a multi disciplinary group and really looking at trying to prevent suicides and unfortunately\nA throughout the state and in Jefferson County suicides are up um and we were never you wear and um you know we really really want to work with people\nAnd let them know there's help and there's hope and you know seek out the help and and you know the whole you know for many people\nIt's a decision that's made and and then if it's as\nWe said not successful um they often say I'm so glad that I made it to the other side and that I'm Still here so we want to get that message out and there's a lot of\nReally needed initiatives and a there is a a person at Fort healthcare that has really been working hard on it with a group and her name is Katie ... and she's also been working really well with the health department and just trying\nTo um make sure that people know that there's help\nUm another uh initiative that I wanted to talk about because it is part of our community health assessment is our drug free communities coalition [noise]\nAnd um I have is a staff nurse I Want to get to give a shout out to her her name is Emily Reiner an Emmy spent here on your soul and my son's yes an Emmy is just a phenomenal um she is a master's prepared public health nurse and she has\nThis uh just consuming\nPassion for a prevention of drug and alcohol use and and\nUh really has been out active member in the community and the county and has resurrected the drug free coalition and has really it's really being successful and they have written for several grants at the state level and have obtained them\nAnd a couple of their their initiatives this going out and teaching people\nHow to use now or can\nAnd actually giving a dose of ... to people especially people who may be family or friends of somebody who's using a drugs and ... it may be in danger of an overdose\nUm they also have ... D activation kits available where people can put their drugs into these kits and it makes them a so that they they're just ... you can't get any effects from them anymore\nUm they have an initiative to get information out through different community education events\nAnd um they also have another initiative that uh they're working they're going to try to work with realtors believe it or not um when people show houses\nThere could be drug sitting out and they want to make sure that ... said the people you know when we have an open house or I show your house makes sure that your drug fire locked up or you take her with you\nI'm so and then another big initiative that they did was to get a drug drop off box at the Johnson creek police department which now means that all of our family that he is\nEvery tone than those grown and\nYeah and that was an initiative um started by um [noise] that solid waste folks in the county we were one of the first counties to have big drug drop offs at our clean sweeps and\nThere were barriers and we said we don't care about the barriers we are going to make this work and our county sheriff was like I'll do whatever it takes and in the beginning he was that every single clean sweep as one side\nAnd I'm working shoulder to shoulder and making sure we get the the drugs out of our community and out of our water\nUm as you know you know drugs show up in the water and um we wanted to make sure that we were environmentally conscious and making sure that the drugs we're just suppose than a Safeway\nAnd eventually that county prevailed and now it is a common thing I thought we again we're cutting edge and fighting for no we're going to do this\nAnd we're going to make our communities safer\nSo just uh it's I can add a lot of his and yeah I Can't emphasize enough how progress of this a county as and working together for help the health of the citizens\nYou mentioned I mean but I talked to a lot of health care workers on the show for different reasons you have the\nFrosty fibers simply going a roast it yes that's where you do a lot of things like that but I'm frequently to uh just um people in a specific to part of a have a new way of doing things or something like that and they'll come in and\nThen to every one of them loves their work\nAre excited about their work there and he's the interview [laughter]\nSometimes you just said hello [laughter] than having all these news rugs and but the there I think quite unique and the the teachers are somewhat the same way but\nA bitter I'm doing very different things I mean the the love the field they love the job and they love talking about\nThe Emmys not afraid to take kind of challenges that's for sure and she's just done some great work and not alone again like Mike Wallace said we can't do this alone she's done it with Human Services department has done a great partner\nAs ah the schools have come on board for health care is on board um community members and all looking at what can we do to prevent drug deaths and I'm In our community and also make it\nAsked for help you know don't be afraid to ask for help don't let the stigma stop you you know we were here were really here to help\nThat opioids a forum what was that was the first one I think", "show_name": "WFAW Morning Magazine", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "11"}
