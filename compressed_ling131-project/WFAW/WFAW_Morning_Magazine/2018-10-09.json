write this book\n\nOr with that one or two and a lot by education on a on a out of the liberal arts\nUh American culture and literature but I've worked with a business people and I'm a geologist and um\nI come into the um\nIt's a technology and this is a law that big of a quick question the Harvard professor\nWho wrote a book called in the law [noise] knowledge cause great fail who coined innovation\nTo describe but something that will ... will our relationship over\nPhilosophical revolutions\nIn art and literature um I Would uh choose Walt Whitman who\nCreated a literary forms\nThat ah was ruining the in uh the most ancient kinds of literature and as the bar that literature duty I'm a poetry the forces even down to\nSimply that claimed by the likes the Homer and and so on and he rooted his poetry and that but took it to a point at which\nThey form the poetry to form of his expressions was just this to a\nA knock at his personality but almost his physiology you can hear his black\nIn watching the light and uh he he found a form that really express democracy I in every\nUh every facet of this dimension in science or I Would um uh lately to a certain extent out of a a sure ...\nI Would concentrate on Gregor Mendel I said well mom are quite obscure in his own time who turn\nTo a very simple plant the peace plan a looked at his peas in a pond and created from this basis\nOr the foundation of a modern genetic a genetic inherit a through the simplest of things that he was the one man looking asking one small aspect of nature and leveraging that to create\nA ... conclusion uh uh absolutely amazing to me I'm\nAmong the technology is um I Would uh I I tend to gravitate towards ... coli because ah with the radio a team really\nPut me a demonstrated a um a A R says Clarke science fiction writer or he calls his his third law which was a bad any technology sufficiently developed ... magic\nBecomes the equivalent to magic and this is what the rainy or was it was transmission\nOf I'm a communications over that distance those and without wires without any obvious physical connection between point day and point the it was\nA one of the first instances of truly the remote control and that uh at that point in human development\nSeemed to me the essence of magic and that combined that steps elevated technology to the realm of last year in enterprise I Would go with Jeff Bezos\nFor or eliminating a wall between\nThe virtual world of digital a reality and the real world analog world the physical world uh with the Amazon or in a big six category and

everyone who can lay his hands on a book\nYou know I just want to be there for a second do you do strikes me that you could put him in society\nBecause the you mentioned in such an impact in more in the political and religious world because some people can bibles in their homes and just the whole aspect to\nCorrect and and let me ask you and I have to show you the the inclusion of the arbitrary ends of this book a key is one of the disruptor is and it's it's a great ... great attribute up a disruptor\nThat is very difficult to categorize\nSo ah ah I looked at the book and thought I could use\nAnother figure under edging in that trial for them\nBut yes in fact now if you need to sit in a a culture reconsidering society um books obviously our foundation has to go out every\nI'm In a society are certainly mark a uh\nThat's right I'm In a lark\nA contender but God mhm a way to stop for rain\nTo change a world Los ... kind of strategy and you know you can think of a you know it worked for a um a cruel to think it could work in\nA modern context mirror more a lot of course was the man who uh I I that that it was almost impossible for him to all the ... in this world where they are popular culture\nLet me stop you there are a second I Know a guy under society I just wanted to ask you why not Thomas Jefferson and we don't tend to see politicians\nAre but Jefferson was uh the declaration of independence and those words was really disrupt you of a society in in a throughout the world because of the declaration of all men are created equal\nYeah ah and you're right and he's another one who could have been included um I live in a laugh out politicians because I thought that was taken down on a uh\nYeah how do you have the whole ... around the world that would\nBe a ... that would be a first of all the metaphor that I Would never put in the book but um that was a that would become a kind of um distraction or in this book in a ...\nArgument but you certainly could justify I absolutely a declaration of independence or on the other hand I'm\nA ... what we call it ... the wide uh it certainly is rooted in an earlier thinker and John Locke that's right um so I'm a\nLittle bit qualify for 'em to me a shepherd is the by far the most disruptive positive or negative way up the mountain fathers\nAnd make the most challenging you as an unpopular cultures yeah\nI I

I I guess they\nProbably took ... we had him for quite a bit longer than we were supposed to we're we're known for achieving this doesn't happen occasionally not our fault\nIt could have been a it actually took place in Seventeen Ninety two they weren't Italian and while they may have been some of the title area but uh uh my guess is they're probably Catholics yeah and ah it took place in New York City and the ... society and Seventeen Ninety two\nDeclared a celebration of the three hundredth anniversary of Columbus discovery in America\nInteresting data St Patrick's Day celebration about that time\nAnd I you know in New York City was known for two things businesses business and partying and yeah and they could do it so you know it it it really goes back a long ways and as we've noted Benjamin Harrison\nOr as president was the one who declared a special celebration for the for hundredth anniversary\nIn Eighteen Ninety two and then FDR declared a holiday for the federal government in Nineteen thirty for giving the federal workers the day off and that's still true today you know I hear in Wisconsin the only thing we seem to notice about Columbus days we don't get mail\n[laughter] but I did notice that 'til I got home and that it was empty\nThat's right and I I Know Illinois I think\nThe schools don't uh are are closed down and so I you know ... up here a year ago white water or we always have had a lot of Illinois students and their families visiting on Columbus Day it was a it's a great day for them to come up and the more the campus interesting yeah\nYeah the children of an hour long enough so they know the way around you know so on the Eighteenth nineteenth century ... century\nAnd a for most of the twenty century it was just considered a appropriate holiday and let's honor Columbus who kind of got the whole European\nMigration started and changed the world\nIn ... in many many ways\nSome of them not so marvelous a Michael a book that we've talked about in the past in fact there are two books one is called fourteen Ninety One and it's new revelations of the Americas before Columbus\nThe second book is called fourteen Ninety three uncovering the new world Columbus created and so interesting that both of these are by Charles man one came out in two thousand six the other two thousand twelve we focus on the fourteen Ninety One book\nAnd man brings together all the work going on in our ... archeology and uh you know the difference uh sciences that are helping us to better understand what was the America's like\nPrior to Columbus and fourteen Ninety two of making the European connection because once Columbus discovers the America so to speak and then a pipeline starts of a explorers\nAnd missionaries and you know ... ... migrants\nSo old and gone to where the ... one of my history teachers use there you go\nFor the the original people who came\nTo me because you know this was looking for spice it seems like yeah he did when he was trying to get to India right and he wanted a shorter route to India guy he ran into to a continent he wasn't expecting indeed uh but you know it's interesting and I think that golden God you know the but it's also a way for Europe to\nA deal with overpopulation a and that would be a lot of the migrants coming in you know but it's interesting because we we really didn't\nFocus during our education much on what the Americans were like prior to Columbus and men as a marvelous job of um [noise]\nHighlighting the research is going on especially in terms of the societies that existed before Columbus found America and in the ass pick which were aware of the Incas some\nAre quite young adults acts in the end 'cause they were a culturally artistically a very advanced yes where they weren't was military they were still in the stone ages were as that goes\nThey ... they were ... you know strong in terms of what was happening on these continents you know a ... and when you read his book fourteen Ninety One you begin to get a better understanding that they were probably was a much larger population mhm ah that would later be decimated\nBy disease yeah and one of the a unintended and detrimental consequences of the discovery of the Americas by Columbus and it was going to happen one way or the other but of the eventual interaction of these two different parts of the world\nWould be the spread of diseases that the inhabitants of the Americas did not have any immunity to\nAnd the same thing what happened to the Europeans yeah because they you know the one he believes one of the big diseases they went the other direction with syphilis or bought the audio of smallpox and other diseases that would\nAh really devastate the populations there of the cars and they asked to X\nAnd began to radically change these societies\nAre you know so that that's a part of this and and you have you know we would like to say what Columbus discovered America well that's not quite correct or you know fought one uh there are some Norwegians who think they were there there are guy got there sooner\nYeah and there is evidence of that that's where I Am I have read that as a\nBook I read along or go the winds of change I think it was about global warming global cooling and but one thousand a day we started a mini I say in that\nA late fabrics and uh and Eric the red they had outposts in Greenland and Iceland where they grew crops and and uh and that was the as the Vikings weren't quite the feel is seeming they are\nDepicted as they didn't like to get far from shore cheer and that's the way they went\nTo North America but a global cooling apparently happens a lot faster than global warming and within ten years they could no longer grow crops and ... ... well that ended North America for them to\nYou know and so\nAh ... you\nWe we celebrate Columbus Day or I you know I I remember you know my father growing up Catholic my father was in the knights of Columbus I never really fully understood why they were called that\nUntil later you know and and it and of course Columbus was Catholic\nAnd ah you know he was born a Taliban buddy was the Spanish king and queen spanking going that that you know a financed his trips\nHe was a you know he ... he was not only and explore but he was also a columnist mhm uh and uh you know he ... essentially was a you know doing the work of what would become the great ...\nMhm uh and uh you know he\n... essentially was a you know doing the work of what would become the great colonization process in the Americas and in Africa so are you know ... you can begin when you think about it and you look at\nMan's work to see why for some people in the Americas they may not be real excited about celebrating Columbus Day\nThat it helped the they don't see it as a positive because if their heritage takes them back you know or to the native peoples of Mexico\nOr Brazil or Ecuador\nColumbus Columbia you know all the different countries and it's a deadly the focus early on is not on North America\nYou know it was kind of cold up here yeah ah we know that a a an early you know a exploration by Native Americans coming out of probably Mexico got all the way up here to Jefferson area [laughter] but uh and and we're there for a while but you know that's\nYeah kind of the far they say God they didn't realize the door county it was going to be any place to visit had no idea hey there were ... eventually you know Native American\nTribes all all over the place but we know more of what they were like after yeah uh that time and certainly after the American revolution are not as much before okay so you know you'll go back and you look at a man's book called fourteen Ninety three\nAnd one of the things he argues in that book is that\nWhat Columbus did and then those who followed focused a lot more on South America and Latin America lesson North America\nAnd for a couple of hundred years after Columbus Mexico City would become the most important city in the world\nBecause everything would kind of go through Mexico City and they were beginning to develop a new European presence in the Americas now\nThe pilgrims sixteen twenty there really first a northern that's right settlements in in what is now the United states\nBut you're saying Augustine comes earlier and of course the adventures into I think Mexico way down South America probably come earlier on a ... you know and so you ...\nAnd you have those two elements you know the the gold the riches whether it's spices or goals or other things that they were discoverer we're over here that we're not in\nEurope but also ah the\nReligious fervor the missionaries coming uh especially the Catholic missionaries and think about their presence in Mexico and then in in California are you know and you know individual conflicts we're talking about Martin Luther earlier between the Protestants and Catholics and and the exploration", "show_name": "WFAW Morning Magazine", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "09"}
