Jason's with us in Detroit Michigan Jason welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you doing today better than I deserve what's up\nUh we'll just wanted to give you a little back story my uh my wife and I just moved from Illinois to Michigan a kind of be closer to all her family up here so uh you know a place but I kind of getting used to everything\nBut uh uh I'm currently unemployed I was just like go\nIn the past couple of months and I'm looking for a job now\nI I'm an accountant and my wife is a teacher she teaches special education [noise] um so she currently has a job um my question is we're living with her parents [noise] um for the time being until\nProbably maybe next summer so until we come by our own house um we've got about eleven thousand dollars of student that left between both of us and we've got about that it that much in our bank account right now\nI'm I wasn't sure obviously once I find a job if the best strategy would be to try to knock that did out as soon as possible and then from there started to stay for a house or what my wife kind of want to do is just put everything we can\nToward a down payment to try to you know\nHopefully not pay for your mind get close to the twenty percent of course I didn't know what your take was in I mean it seems like we should still be able to have some sort of decent downpayment either way I just didn't know um how you feel about that\nOkay I don't recommend that people buying a home when they're broke\nBecause you know make your broker that's why they call a mortgage brokers homeless not a blessing when you're broke its curse and when you have debt and do not have an emergency fund you're broke\nBy definition so um my advice to folks as always ban and it's not real popular advice and your wife's not like it so you might not do it but my my strong advice to you is to pay off the debt\n\nNow these customers can tells you after seven point two million dollars in refund thanks to an FTC settlements the company behind the famous as seen on TV fleece blanket as being forced to pay its customers that amount\nIn refunds FCC allege that all star marketing group misrepresented indices customers with it that settlement sites unauthorized charges and failure to adequately disclose material terms of the offer [noise]\nThis is the day Ramsey show we're glad you're with us and thank you for joining us I'm Talking with the break I was talking with Sharon in Sarasota, Florida\nAnd a sixty eight years old Twenty years ago they bought a universal life policy which is a type of cash value policy\nA portion of your premium folks when you're having universal policy goes to pay the insurance costs and the insurance is cost goes up every single year because it's based on annual renewable term rage and so more and more is going to insurance cost us the policy gets older less and less is going to the investment\nTo the point that they they cross the line a few years ago and contacted Sharon and her husband and said oh now their premium that you're paying one hundred percent of it won't cover the insurance costs so now if you want to keep the insurance not only is zero going to investments\nBut now even more has to be paid to keep the insurance active and that's how far we got in the discussion is what I just said all correct Sharon\nYeah yeah okay and what is going to face amount of this policy eighty thousand eighty thousand dollars and how much money do you all have\nHow much money that we have from\nYou how much you and your four one K. isn't here now they're always\nWhen we did have a retirement account how much they pay total eighty four thousand mhm\nUm\nWe have a ten thousand dollar to find we are dead prey our house is paid for good\nYou know kind of like\nSo you don't have how much is cash value is in this house right now to six thousand okay so and when you have a pension plans as well\nYeah okay\nAnd so you're living on Social Security and eighty thousand dollars worth of for my husband\nStill works here I have um have thirty six thousand in income ... and he brings in Twenty one thousand in Social Security\nOkay and that's all I I don't want to get you in the face of amount of this policy you said was eighty thousand dollar\nCar and we did look into term insurance for him but number one it's really a lot more than ... his age but number two he has battled cancer a couple of times yeah\nNon Hodgkin's lymphoma and so basically you know but they were like yeah very difficult very difficult and we don't know we we can lower the death benefit\nSo what is the premium how much is that a year if I don't know how much you\nHave any having a month yeah okay\nWell let's say eight hundred a year and you make thirty six thousand dollars a year\n[noise] um\nWell here's a here's the equation and here's the way it works in your mind okay what's the purpose of this is to give you an extra eighty thousand dollars\nIf he dies before you do okay\nAnd so is that war is eight hundred bucks at this stage it's there's no investment value whatsoever so we're not the only question is you know you you don't have a huge mistake\nOr that you you've got a small mistake and the show to double it basically if he were to die would be very helpful mhm and so keeping the insurance sounds really good with that in mind\nYeah they they told us that would only last three or four years anyway and they sent me wonder if that makes it\nOkay and they're going to make you stop any way they are going to pull the plug on yeah oh yeah okay and at that point you would catch it out and whatever cash value isn't there a band and [laughter] I have met would like to get it out now you know where to get out and all the way to get out now as close a policy down right which\nWould which means that you would you know if he passes away you'd have the four oh one K. money it paid for how somebody living on Social Security right yeah what you probably can make it 'cause I gotta feeling you guys are frugal people oh yeah and she probably could make it on that but it's not going to be a dream come true um\n[noise] so they have given you notice that at I'm\nSixty two are are are I'm sure are Seventy three or whatever Seventy years old they're going to shut the policy down regardless\nYeah well I ... well no I guess if we can keep paying enough that it would be over two hundred a month I think we could keep it going okay right or are we\nReally could lower than that benefit and and keep it going they felt if we can do that which is what I wanted to do it when the cash it out than them that we're doing nothing\nYeah there there's not a great answer\nOkay that's where I'm him and hauling a little bit I'm trying to think through it um\nI don't know if I were doing nothing\nYeah there there's not a great answer okay that's where I'm him and hauling a little bit on trying to think through it um uh\nMy tendency is at eight hundred bucks a year right now to keep it for a while mhm\nOkay I'm Seventy seven dollars a month even if you use the cash value you can have the cash value and began to pay the premium\n... and ... you know it's going to do it's going to use up some of the eight thousand dollars I'm probably going to do that\nAnd let the eight thousand dollars pay the premiums starting today and I'm probably going to leave it in place a couple of years when it starts being two hundred a month instead of Seventy seven months at that point I'm probably going to join his tribe and say let's cash it out\nAnd close it down\nBut I don't think it's going to make sense to keep this long for a long long time we're probably gonna keep a couple more years houses help\nBut then I was his health\nOh I'm the kind of like if they can for free for five years and that kind of think cancer free for two years good so I mean he could go and get a kick and every every six months of how to make sure it's not coming back of a graph of\nGood good I'm Glad to hear that ... ... ... ... I'm gonna I'm gonna let the a cash value pay the premiums for the next two years and keep it open uh-huh okay if a ... and I'm going to check on his health at that time it let's say that he's got another episode with cancer going of that time\nThen you pay the premium no matter what it costs and you keep it open and if he if he's the cancers come back at any stage right you keep you keep putting open at that point but if he's doing really really good and everything's clean and two years from now you haven't seen a spot nothing's no problems anywhere I'm I'm probably drop and at that point\nOkay that makes sense to\nMe it wouldn't have to be insured so\nYeah you know but I'm not you but but you're also not paying you know\nThree thousand two thousand dollars a year which is what is going to be at that point yeah which is starting to be ridiculous with that kind of money you can throw money into a investments to start having some money\nAnd um but but at this stage I I'm\nI'm hesitant to cancel it it's it's obviously a bad policy so obviously had thing but it's your only option you're stuck with them so that makes it hard to discuss and hard to think about but I'm going to hold it two years about the cash value pay at at the end of that time if he's healthy or instill cancer free I'm dropping it\nOtherwise I'm going to keep it if it's if it's got a health issue at that time so good question thank you for calling in and I'm Sorry you\nHad this problem\nFolks you hear me yell and scream about cash value life insurance whole life life insurance universal library but life is rip off\nYou just experienced it usually comparing to the back end what happened\nTo see if you buy one of those pieces of crap policy\nAnd you're sixty eight years old this is what happens is because the money they put into that stupid but policy will be three hundred grand right now in mutual funds if you put it into that in a good investment instead of getting ripped off by this insurance company\nAnd if she was sitting there were three hundred grand plus the other four one K. of about four hundred thousand bucks plus\nTheir house is paid for she wouldn't even called\nMe but instead guess who's fat sassy instead of her insurance company\nSo when your whole life agency is I don't really agree with Dave Ramsey because your whole life I just trying to rip you off\nThat's why your whole life agency and that and there's only two kinds of whole life agents ignorant and crooked because if you understand these numbers and that story right there and then you still sell this stuff that makes you crooked\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself and if you don't understand these numbers and you're still selling that stuff that makes you a ignorant and you shouldn't be selling their stuff and by the white folks in case you didn't know you'll get screwed ... way more often by and then there's the egg enthusiastic ignoramus than you will by a con artist so most people\nOut there selling this crap are enthusiastic ignoramus as they're not actual con artists smoke of Charlie show me this region enthusiastic ignoramus\nThat's all uncle Charlie we just nail him right there\nBecause he's probably not a crook if he actually shut down and looked and realize that share your if your\nFriend shares brand sold her that [noise]\nHe's not afraid of my friends like that you will need enemies [noise]\nYou know good at three hundred grand and mutual funds easy for them what they dumped into this\nProduct [noise] whole life life insurance the payday lender or the middle class aggravates me this is the day Ramsey show\nAnd it was really cool we paid off the house on his birthday so when we had it in there and I said well let's just wait until you actual birthdays so we we always remember that day um awesome all four of its ... and thinking for all jammed up for it so it's got\nThat's fun very well done how many kids do is have you got\nTwo boys what ages\nSix and Benjamin just turned three\nSo you've changed your family tree having sure\nOh yeah they don't know anything other than the morning to I've never having a credit card which is pretty awesome\nAs Mary awesome I'm so proud of you guys did you have more cheerleaders or more detractors as you went along\n[laughter] actually talking about that a little bit earlier than my parents are very proud and then you know the journey than you know some other people do you got to focus on a little bit ... basically now and I think my friends or anything like that and they don't they don't say anything now\nI guess not yeah you're sitting there with a played for house or shut up bill that's more to go there and they\nWill well done guys very well done what do you think will be the key to getting out of that is\n[noise] ... and stay on track\nYeah even when you when you screw up I mean I don't want to be the most uh as all my idea of what I Want something or I like stuff so [laughter] I always like the most expensive thing and then you don't want to put it the biggest fuss about waiting or you know\nBeing patient the hardest thing no\nWell you did it for seven years you lived like no one else now you can looming do like no one else you're in great shape\n... area are cool\nWell we've got a copy of course Hogan to retire inspired book for you number one bestseller we want that to be your next a chapter in your story and speaking of projects materials news broadcast because that'll keep you moving in the right direction here in ... in the millionaire land and be outrageously generous along the way okay\nWho are I Robert analysis in Hartford, Connecticut get two hundred and sixty one thousand dollars pay it off that's their house and everything but I was thirty two years old seven and a half years it took them making eighty to two hundred a year county let's zero three scream\n\nWell then you guys very very well\nDone I Love it Sarah is with us in Ann Arbor Michigan and he sat around where you\nAnd great things for taking my call they sure what's up [noise] I had a question\nAbout I'm from the tree the\nFinal parts of the baby step we currently are added that um [noise] we are a waiver emergency fund that fully funded or currently showing two kids in college and um so it's about retirement versus are how the pathway currently oh about ... I'm Seventy eight dollars an hour and our home\nGood and what's your household income uh just under two hundred thousand a year from them and how much is college\n[noise] and our kids are about forty thousand dollars a year right now for the two of them\nNo good for him for doing that so my question as they currently have about seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars and our retirement account [laughter] my husband's company doesn't match that we do Fifteen Percent not a problem mhm\nMy company I'm very blessed with 'em I invest by then they give me ten mhm\n[noise] so that it came to my question is do I find a different way to invest that other Fifteen Percent or the other ten percent to make line of Fifteen or do we put that extra it's about three hundred and eighty dollars a month towards our mortgage\nIt's four thousand dollars a year doing much better\nWhen I saw this year I mean you you know your act like that makes a dent in your mortgage it doesn't\nMake much better and my retirement account or a you know\nSo I I Want you to boot at baby steps for Fifteen Percent of your household income\nYou put a Fifteen Percent of your household into I'm into retirement it doesn't sound to me like you're doing that right now\nNo I haven't been 'cause I Am in the in our end I think that ... thing is I put in my five and they put in the kind of an amazing match you\nKnow it's wonderful man to love the max and we're not going to lose the match we're going to do ten\nPercent somewhere else like you said and Roth IRAs or you can do it during the four oh one gave you got good options if it's raw for one day particularly don't do that but I I I Will be putting Fifteen Percent of my income away in return to the point is you're going to pay off his house\nAnyway right at really the exact same speed\nBecause for a thousand dollars is what's going to get Seventy eight thousand dollars paid off\nWhat's going to get somebody that was most paid off when you got to concentrate on that when you get little bit of a bonus a tiny little inheritance or you just squeeze some money out of your budget but in these three hundred dollar deal here is not\nThat that doesn't move the needle towards getting house paid off the house is going to get paid off cars you buy has been concentrating and focusing in probably what's going to happen is when the kids would get the kids off to roll you probably just go up the house in that year a cause that forty you'll be down to about forty by then and then that year you'll just knock it out so\nUm you're fine you're doing really good usually\nI mean you're doing really really good overall but I'm going to do ten percent you\n... percent of the ten percent in in their retirement\nMaybe some more five your cash flowing sixes and everything else we can find reasonably within the budget\nQuestion I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse or you have kids yes you need term life insurance\nIt's the only way to protect them until you're out of debt and the build up your ... your only digging a deeper hole if you waste money on cash value plans says it robs you of the ability to make real progress and that's why I send you to the sand or insurance and I have for Twenty
