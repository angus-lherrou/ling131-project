morning your morning magazine and we have our regular guests every Monday Dr Susan and Susan I was talking to you before we went on the air here obviously this is the first time I've done this show so we're gonna see how it goes\nAbsolutely we're in the house because I'm a veteran so I think we'll be okay All right between you and me I think will ah will make it work All right Susan so anyway what kind of stuff that's been going on obviously we've\nGot a you know the uh risking rational debate coming up tonight or we've got some a big news stories happening right now there was of course they're shooting a synagogue Pittsburgh lots of stuff going on I guess I kind of let you a lead the way what do you what would you like to talk about okay so\nI mean why don't we start with a couple of the the major issues that have gone on over the past week or so and that would be the mail bombs yeah and then uh the uh\nThe synagogue shooting and so the male bonds I mean that dominated the news cycle I Would say all of last week when\nAll of a sudden these um bombs started appearing in the mail or getting intercepted um through the mail that were being sent to a very prominent ah people Hillary Clinton but President Obama and a whole number of other people\nRobert De Niro got one right because I assume of the comments he made at the Tonys I don't know if you remember that yeah\nUh that's but I don't I Can't imagine any other reason why you would have received one other than that but\nYeah I Know it it seemed like it was a very targeted towards people who have attacked the president I Would I surprised and there may still be more that might've here but I was kinda surprised that\nI'm Nancy Pelosi Elizabeth Warren I kept waiting for those two hundred and ... there are those names to be heard because they take a lot of grief from the president at his rallies but clearly if you go down the list of people and then CNN as an organization that got those bombs in the mail\nThey were clearly a list of people that the president regularly\nAttacks during his rallies or criticize as rallies\nSure yeah and uh I could be mistaken about this but I I mean it's a good thing obviously but I for me what was so strange about that story was none of the bombs uh\nYes we do it's coming up by just in a week from Tuesday so we're ah what seven or eight days out\nThat's right we're uh we're right on the costs but I Know I've been seeing so much about people voting early more than I have ever seen um which I think it's a great thing I have not voted yet but I Will be voting of course in the elections so\nYeah it's become early voting has become every year I think it gets to be more accessible\nAnd um people ... states have made it easier for people to to vote I remember you know back in the day that you when you if you're going to vote it was called absentee voting and you have to have a reason why you are not going to be around nine eleven today\nNow it's some sort of no questions asked you can vote and I live in Illinois and we can just order the ballot you know the whole law and order and I'm On my eye pad and then it comes and we vote and put it back in the mail and\nI took care of that about ten days ago so I've been I've voted you know\nMid mid October ... piece of cake now as they make it if they make it I'm fairly easy um\nIn some regards and other regards we know it's more difficult because of ID restrictions and other things like that and it's not always as easy to get to an early voting station and things like that so um we should think about it and in both regard but yeah in terms of the push for early voting\nThat something that campaigns really really work on to get those votes locked in as soon as possible so that\nUm you know that you can already you know sort of had those in the bank\nRight kind of a have a projection of where you're going to be ... um after the\nRight or watching to and then you never know what's going to happen so if you know that you've got those you know those votes already kind of um school all the way then not\nGet a little bit of wiggle room yeah you'd say oh yeah\nAbsolutely so we are obviously it's a you know big election um some important names on the ballot I Know Tony Uber's as a\nThan a to be honest to my surprise giving a Walker pretty good run for his money according to the polling I've seen a and we've also got a coming up\nTonight actually in Janesville at a you W a rock county um we have the first congressional debate with Randy Bryce and Bryce styles um\nI was talking to Gary about this on the morning show I'm I think it's going to be a I'm interested to see what kind of conflict arises out of this debate because I think these guys are two very different guys and I I'm what's your Sam excited to see this\nYeah it should be interesting from what I understand all the tickets that had better made available are are spoken for so it's going to be a a a packed packed rouse sold out you sold out and um it's going to be at the interview whitewater a rock county campus and it's not exciting\nAs well and you're right it's a a fiercely contested election um I think that when a Paul Ryan Speaker Ryan announced that he was\nA not running for reelection a lot of people on the Democratic side got very excited because they thought that this would be an opportunity to perhaps ... to reclaim that seat church luring it over the Democrats mhm\nAbsolutely yeah and there was a a contested primary election so Randy Bryce came out of the primary election as the the person who would represent the Democratic party and there was also it was contested on the Republican side as well and buy and sell came out I'm On the Republican side and so now we\nHave this this match up I was like you said to you know quite different individuals in terms of their their background right now I'm\nA and just in terms of maybe their perspectives are obviously very different in terms of being Democrats and Republicans and so you know it should be interesting tonight I'm On WCW to uh listen to um\nTo what they both have to say in terms of ah\nThat's right and uh I Believe you are moderating tonight\nI Am I'm old coal moderating so you can tune back in tonight and you can hear me again [laughter] and ... will be giving any opinions or anything like that but I Will be or how it will be helping out um to get that get that um moderated and uh hopefully it'll be a lot of good information for 'em\nBut if people are making their minds up about about that race and I mean this is one debate they've had another debate a\nAnd this is sort of debate season rent so as I think about it I Know that there's been um debates between Governor Walker and Tony ... there's been debates in a Senate race so we've had a lot of debates in ah in October\nAnd I haven't really paid attention much to what the the ratings have been but I made debates are really really good way\nFor a voter too to um hopefully hear the candidates speak to more of the substantive issues in the campaign right as opposed to perhaps some of the um [noise] I don't know what we call more floss\nI mean attack ads sooner and I mean getting I Know a lot of people that are unfortunately base their choice completely um\nAh advertisements which I don't think it's a good one\nUh unfortunately the their choice completely or advertising which I\nDon't think it's a good idea or those a lot of those packets just take the lowest you know the woman was shot they possibly to swing your opinion and you're not really learning anything about policy or what these people actually use man for\nI Know a lot of uh people are just sick and tired of they've been sick and tired of the ... the airways are just saturated with um\nWith attack ads and it's I Know people criticize debates because they say that you know candidates don't always answer the questions um but I think they can still be valuable because they are being that's right and the way they respond to the questions we'll give you a bit of an insight into their policy perspective\nAnd I'm also their demeanor and their their personalities\nWhile until it is different than just watching an ad on TV or an interview\nAbsolutely yeah and I mean I'm you know occasionally they will answer a question honestly and those are\nThose are the candidate for hours to go to me just the ones that are given a difficult question that maybe even before they answer you know it's going to be\nA you know in opposition to whatever they stand for and they're still able to give you a straightforward honest response to it or even if it's not a response that everyone's going to agree with perhaps a but it's still something you know they they answered the question you know ...\nThey gave their opinion on it whether you like it or not and I think that even things like that just say a lot about the candidate and that's another reason why it's important to go to be the base\nYeah and I think I'm a ... in the debates they can't I don't know the question right so obviously if you're a good campaign staff you can think of dissipating what kinds of questions but it also shows how someone can think on their feet\nAnd then it also can show how well versed they are on a variety of\nYou know different policy so it kind of gives you a a peek into how they think about the issue is how they might approach issues but then just like you said even more broadly just a window into their demeanor\nYou know and on and things like that as well so I think it should be an interesting\nAbsolutely I totally agree\nUh once again that's going to be coming up tonight Monday Night the congressional debate we're going to start hearing that seven I'm right here on nine forty W.
