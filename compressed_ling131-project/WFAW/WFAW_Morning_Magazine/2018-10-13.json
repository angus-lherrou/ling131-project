yeah um but you know he lives right on the water on and he built a house that's like twelve or you know like ... feet above the ground and he said the water was four feet up okay so so\n... was a smart choices but you know it's so funny that you know think about this though so if your house is twelve feet off\nThe ground right every time they are do you pull into your driveway you're getting your steps then you're going to make sure you're wearing your ... [laughter]\nBecause you're going up and up and down a best is in Tallahassee as Andrew said hello there\nBeth Hi Pam so do you have Internet access has everything goodbye you\nWe do not have Internet ah we have body cell service a GOP alright\nSo without the Internet what do you miss the most\nOh my gosh I'm probably social\nMedia Facebook that I heard Facebook in the background fake I\nMy daughter and my husband are here with me there and so um yeah I I I went to make a dinner last night and I thought oh I've got the rest yet entered oh wait\nI Can't look it up [laughter]\nSorry Karen I have a Mac and cheese again because I can read the boxing [laughter] that's just the way they are right and then were cooking everything on the grill it so that's really interesting to well you know that it's healthy right or you know kind of kind of we just kind of died out the window [laughter] oh her and\nHer name all I did was eat it was like I had the nerve at length\nChief [laughter] that's okay you know what you guys are doing good and it takes a while you know make sure that everything's all back in action and uh but certainly our our hearts and our first booth everybody that has been affected by that hurricane especially as it continues just to keep moving on\nUp the coast um so I understand you have a question about the smart a speakers once you get the power and once you get your Internet back\nRight yeah yeah I mean I just heard a lot about you know everybody getting them the thing that everyone should have and I'm like do I really need one what would I use it for\nYou know it's a really good question because it's one of these gadgets that initially when you get it you go wow that's really cool I mean so you can say you know tell me what the weather is tell me what the traffic's going to look like order a more toilet paper paper towels or whatever it may be\nAnd then you start moving up the actual long so then you say turn on the light\nAnd you can also say goodnight and when you say goodnight is that the alarm system will set the front door will lock the lights will go into night mode and then suddenly on the smart speaker next year end table some white noise is playing to sue the you to sleep\nAnd all that happen automatically\nKnow of course not you know that [laughter] if they like you to think that but you have do you have to buy all the gadgets along the way I write a height you got to buy the lights the smart lights and the smart locks and then you have to program those but it's not very difficult to program it\nUh there were a thermostats that like the ego be in the nest that work with the Amazon Echo so that this way if you're sitting on the couch and you don't want to get your lazy but up and you can say you know turn the air down the Seventy six or turn the heat up to sixty six or whatever it may be\nAnd so it takes a while for you to get indoctrinated into it so to speak or no pun intended with these smart speakers but once you\nOnce you get it I think that you'll understand like\nThis is exactly how it's supposed to work I'm going to put together some links for you over at commando dot com\nAnd so that this way you can select to the right Amazon Echo and also we have a couple of articles about some gadgets like I just mentioned that you might want to tie into the Alexa environment and\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your line and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN those some of them I Can't say on their\nCars like hide your whatever\nUh then there's nowhere to VPN and then there's also freedom VPN which\nThey were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of ... secure and it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month and so it does slow things down a but if you\nWant to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a common that show picks but she couldn't find it is that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go tell your credit card that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another\nApp that you need to get its called mobile passport\nYou heard me talk about that I'm now okay you need this app okay just if you don't do anything else you get the house okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back okay there's four hundred and fifty people on the plane right right [noise]\nAnd they're all coming down this pipeline all go to go through homeland security\nAnd border patrol\nNow if you have mobile passport on your phone I guarantee you that four hundred and thirty four people are going to be standing in line and sixteen of you are going to be on the mobile line and you're going to get through in like three minutes\nOh my gosh I have to have that you have to do it as just had to do it and so and it's like one of these things like before everybody knew how to get pre check you know it was good to get free check but no but now everybody has pre check [laughter] so it's\nKinda like that same thing with this mobile passport and so when you get off the plane and ah when you land back in the states just look for a sign that says mobile passport here in Phoenix\nOr they actually didn't have a sign and I had to ask one of the border patrol agents like you know where's the mole passport and he's like oh that way you go I mean I went all the way to the left and when I got to the line there was one person in front of me so again mobile passport great at ah for anybody that's doing any type of international travel [noise]\nAll right one of our
