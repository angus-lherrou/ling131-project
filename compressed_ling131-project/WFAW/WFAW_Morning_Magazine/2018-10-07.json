respect or do you lash out at them harshly and even unjustly or you quicker to yell and be little than you are to listen understanding build up\nDo you put your needs are wants the head of the needs of your children or do you even make your needs and wants your children's needs and wants\nOr you inclined to deal with your children sharply rather than with Christian love\nYou always you always remember is that your child is a gift to God and also that your child is your brother or sister and Christ our own unjust improper treatment can anger our children that they cannot properly honor us as God wants\nThe resentment our children may have for us as parents may lead them to resenting God this godly resentment consent from parental actions an attitude that show little to no concern for their child spiritual training\nAs parents we can spur our children to resent got either by our example which is inconsistent with our Christian confession or by being permissive of our children sense\nAs parents we want our children to have spiritual and moral values but by a life of open and deliver it sin we as parents can damage whatever religious training our children receive\nAs parents we can also provoke our children to resent God by being too lenient or by exerting little tunnel influence upon now consider the high priest Eli we're by a lack of discipline correction an admonition provoked his sons to resent him and ultimately got\nAs Christian parents the Christian parents need to be concerned about their children's spiritual upbringing\nAccording to a fifty year study of Christians and non Christian family most young adults who follow Christ either come from non Christian homes or homes where they grew up loving Jesus because mom and dad love Jesus\nUnfortunately very few believers came from homes where there was an indifferent apathetic commitment to Christ\nIt's sobering to suggest that the chances of becoming a believer are better for children growing up in non Christian homes for children growing up and spiritually loop warm apathetic environments\nTherefore Christian parents recognize and assume their God given responsibility of spiritually training and raising their children and the nurture in admonition of the lord\nBut how do we do this\nFirst we must begin with ourselves you must recognize our own continual need to build up our own faith in the best way to meet the needs is by surrounding ourselves with God's word and sacrament by regularly renewing our relationship with Jesus Christ\nJesus springs relieved to fathers and mothers who haven't always done is Paul suggests who haven't nurtured and cared for their children has got asks who haven't always spent appropriate time with their children aren't always as kind of smiling and loving as they ought to be\nNo matter how long we have been in the parenting business we daily layer sends up across of Christ and find peace and renewal and the forgiveness Jesus one for us there\nBut if that reminder isn't enough Jesus intimately renews our faith and calms our guilt ridden hearts by placing his own body and blood on our lips a physical reminder that we had been forgiven the body and blood of Christ body and blood given and shed for arson\nGod's word and sacrament some power us to live in the forgiveness won by Christ every news us to lead our families and the training of the lord by modeling in their site the training we ourselves have received\nThis is so important today because our children receive so many on Christian messages from so many sources the Internet social media television magazines the list can go on and on\nFor many young people the values of today's culture or just as powerful as the principles of Christianity and Christian living\nThis is why modeling our face making worship a priority and conducting home devotion are so important\nThere is enormous competition for our hearts in the hearts and minds of our children and grandchildren we need to counteract those messages with God's word to devotion worship Christian education and constant Christ centered conversation in our home because if you don't provide it who will\n\nThe church can only do so much\nAs parents and grandparents what you want your legacy to be\nYou can give your kids the best home the best education the best economic grounding in the best career advice available you can supply them with the deepest love the most undivided attention and the warmest affection this world has to offer\nYou can strive to be perfect parents according to all the standards set by experts you can do all those things that's still not give them what they truly need Jesus Christ\nJesus as the only one who can make any human right with God you're the forgiveness he earned on the cross Jesus is the only one who can give moral human beings to guarantee that on the day we die we will live forever and having\nYour children will learn to forgive whatever feelings you have as a father or mother when they better understand the unconditional love of Christ a love which you introduced to them\n\nPasser once had a conversation with one of his members in which they traced the line of blessings got had given that individual\nIt started connecting some dots God Bless the spouse by connecting her to her husband and their reflected on her children and how they remain faithful through this parents\nAnd their reflected on other family members it was clear that God use that individual in that family to nurture generations of God fearing Christians\nIsn't that the legacy we want a legacy that includes the training and nurturing God Speaks of this morning the kind of training and nurturing that brings space and blessing to Seoul after soul when it all\nNurturing got speak some this morning the kind of training and nurturing that brings space and blessing to solve after school when it all went into all said and done what else in this world means more seeing your child or grandchild and having with\nNothing there's nothing more important than that\nSt have declared an all out war on the family not too many fronts he is when\nWe are armed with God's word in Sacramento\nAnd Wendy's means of God's Grace we we get our families and the training of the lord boldly unashamedly persistently and confidently because Jesus Christ or Victoria's savior crushed thing and rendered powerless there was death resurrection\nSo we fight for the spiritual health of our families as we lead them in the training of the lord because this is the battle for schools and that's
