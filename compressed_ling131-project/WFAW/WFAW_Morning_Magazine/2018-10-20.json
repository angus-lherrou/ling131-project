today\nJust on the number of players who have yet to really play significant time on defense who could get their first chance\nThat end of the wind could be a factor will get in the game conditions a little bit later on that might affect any passing him on either side the element in them yeah\nGo ahead and make this yeah throw the ball very well right okay well let's be honest about that if Illinois is going to move the change is on the ground\nIf we're talking about this game Illinois doesn't throw a well Wisconsin at a bad week throw in Illinois doesn't depend a run at all and Wisconsin or make their living on the ground\nI Want to see how what scouts and bounces back\nAgainst Russia against a quarterback who will try to exploit them similar to shape Patterson Patterson had some success running his own read last week a lot of the pressure is on those outside line backers who might fight inside and that's where Patterson made perfect grades\nFled to one eighty one yard run lead to a touchdown so as a that's incumbent upon and can't kill and bought to do a better job of studying the edge of the defense and those young corners also have to get a little bit wider when that players run to their side of the fear we saw\nSaw what can result in that long run we're outside linebacker gets caught inside the corner on that side of the fuel wild goose also got tied up with

want it to the big time we've also been Brian Barnhart\nThe voice of the line I last week was a tough one a homecoming for Illinois against Purdue got run out of the building\nI just asked Mike ... of the big picture question you to start feeding a with a lobby Smith where is the process I Know that there was we talked about this in the past a lot of patience and wherewithal to go about his business where's the process\nWell we were really liking where we were in the process before the game last week that was the thing do what we played up at south or as soldier field in South Florida who's a rank team now and they just told us last year in Tampa\nAnd it was a totally different ballgame we lead that gave all the way the last two minutes had a third and twenty midfield with two minutes to go and they can play to fifty are passed away and when the ball game at the end but you could see during the course of that game and you know if you've done a game of soldier field or not have been there the fans are right down in front of me they're all high fiving us\nBecause they were getting turnovers they were running the ball like crazy and everybody was like a lot of people at fluffy ball because that's what he did in Chicago you could see the\nThe outlined beginning to take shape now last week what happened is two things out but I was our poorest effort of the year by far wasn't even close\nA and to produce took away the thing that Illinois did really well which was run the football we were third in the Big Ten and rushing before that game they just stacked the box and they're at our quarter back to beat them and that we couldn't get that that's going to get the running game going and then on the pets we give it up\nA lot of yards along the way but also our first or second to the big planet turnovers and near the top of the country and turnover margin so we give up some yards band and don't break but uh just a map of able to get enough pressure could not get enough pressure on Blau who has you know if he got time ... park\nIllinois as if they're not there you know the numbers or if they're not the youngest team in the country there in the hand pull the youngest teams in the country how has youth being served in what they're putting on the field right now while they've got some really good\nIf if they're not the youngest team in the country there in the handful the youngest teams in the country how his youth being served in what they're putting on the field right\nNow while they've got some really good young players but the class they're building around right now is the sophomore class that was a really\nReally solid class with a lot of flame acres the freshman class coming in behind it not quite at that same level but still pretty good but he's got like thirty a freshman in thirty eight software or something like that so it's still as you as you say a very very\nYoung football team but ah what they're building around is bad sophomore class we don't have a lot of juniors we don't have a lot of seniors\nSo it's still guys that are learning to play the game are offensive line last year and I can't remember if it was against you guys are other games but we had for freshmen offensive lineman starting\nAt one point for several games why harder and harder to you can't do that yeah and it showed and so those guys will gain a lot of experience through taking those lumps and there are better it's better team over the last week didn't show up and that's where fans are you talking about big picture\nOkay where where are we now I Know that you know it'll always going to be a big underdog to Wisconsin today but it's a different style of play it's a running attack it's a you know pounding and pounding ground where's Purdue was very much moving the ball around and and hopefully we can get our run again going to\nMean at one of the interesting things about you know obviously with us falling Wisconsin football on a weekly basis\nOpposing teams try to take away the run and force you to beat him in the air Michigan is it different defense than most animals you see out there um and and they really did they completely shut down Wisconsin's passing in Illinois issue defensively has been given a big chunks of yards on the ground\nThat creates an interesting dynamic today yeah it does and uh\nYou know I think last year you saw in the game or a Illinois forced Wisconsin into a lot of third and longs and were able to get some pressure that's been the biggest issue is just not getting enough pressure up front they've had a ton of interceptions very opportunistic defense but if you don't get any pressure or you know a quarterback or any quarterback including Horner broke\nA can hurt you if he's got time [noise]\nWhat is your view then where will your eyes go early in this game what might be an indicator that dictates that direction this game\nTake well I think the thing that Illinois needs to be we talked about the third it along on defense they do that but get off the field and also we need sustained drives we need to keep them all away from Jonathan Taylor\nFrom this Wisconsin all fans because they just wear you down as the game goes on so we need so same drives a we've been better at that in some cases this year than we much better and we were last year for that the early indicator to me is can we\nHow well the first couple of drives go go free and out and like Wisconsin come right back and start marching or do they make them wait to get on the field\nWork some clock to limit the possessions get a turnover to give yourself a chance to be in the game at the end to get a turnover to to to give yourself a chance to talk\nWith Brian Barnhart the voice the lineup before I let you go back into your work and that is Illinois dynamic on off and some of the Wisconsin fans have been seeing the on I play I mean there are some play makers there are some ability to to the light things up off and similar\nYeah with a ... a who's had a big deer are also a Mike abstain they will run them single back sometimes for both of them out there and then Bush is he would want a job it was clear to anybody that saw five minutes a camp but he was the guy that was going to play\nA he's quickly athletic he's pretty tall or he can run the ball he's not Jake Barrett or anybody like that but he can if he makes the write and read and he can really heat up a lot of yards in a hurry so it's kind of a three headed offensive backfield in Enron Smith came in as coordinator\nAnd you know it's it's a look
