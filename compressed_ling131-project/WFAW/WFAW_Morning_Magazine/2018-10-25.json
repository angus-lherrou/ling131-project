I don't want to sacrifice going out and I thought of that sacrifice you sports I don't want to sacrifice my rent a couch I don't want to sacrifice my effort to fifty it's costing me seven hundred bucks a month or I don't want to sacrifice that\nTo get out of debt today Ramsey spaceships and so all plant I Want to go to jail I'll go to jail\nBefore that ... or ... or a three point five million dollars you not heard of the babies that said that that they just truly have locked all help that they will never ever ever ever gotten out of what\nYou just hit the point they walk out so they think I'll go to jail and then when I get out of jail I don't have any debt\nThat the cars they may I I Want to believe and my the glass as half full caught that there is ... ... that's not right yeah well I have full I get asked Georgia go down opinion what do you think about that in the lobby\nHe's like this he literally put his hands up and looked at this guy you know what I Want to believe in my optimistic view yes that three point five million Americans this is an optimistic but that they just don't know that they can sacrifice lifestyle\nYou can make different choices you can live on a budget you can take out an extra job for a short period of time\nAnd pay off that data is but the sad thing is that they had read like that they thought that they don't think you're ... you're exactly right I Hope that someone now I think someone doesn't say I would rather\nNot I'd rather not give up cable and got a child with in jail didn't have cable and you\nKnow I don't think so I mean I don't know I think it's limited and it's like murder she wrote for Thirty years ago so here's the point [laughter]\nCable and go out with an jail\nDid that came on sale [noise] no I don't think so I mean I Know I think is limited and it's like murder she wrote from Thirty years ago so here's the ... Dave Ramsey has a plan so we're having fun with this crazy stuff but the reality is if you're joining the show today and you feel that loss of hope you feel that desperate\nThat your basic freedoms you give up your basic for him\nWe've got a plan is called Dave baby steps total money make over walk she threw it joined the show the conversation on a daily basis take inspiration from the men and women that are showcased every day on the show to their debt free scream\nSwell and on this show and and the rights of Chris shall we always have a couple of come in and share their story and when I left in it and it's ... you're listening to you\nIt's it's everyday average American that's where it is people don't make crazy and ... they don't have like a super being Cape like no these are everyday people choosing something different ... and at that you have to choose something different for a different outcome and so that's that's the parrot but again anyone out there you can do\nAnd trying to do both triple eight eight to five five two to five is the phone numbers that is how it started to take the step today triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Eric who's on the line in Kansas City Eric how can we help\n[noise] hey how's it going good how are you sir good\nUm so I have two options I'm a registered nurse and I'm looking I going to grad school either nurse practitioner scores see aren't a school we owe a hundred K. on our house or get free otherwise um we have a four month old am I looking at having a second baby and the next year\nI'm In the school like a cash flow and worked full time through high school would be a little bit longer it about a five year program and totality a budgets prerequisites and and I could not work for the three years and the debt that would be Ninety thousand dollars at the end of it\nAnd so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a ... make sure the one Seventy five\nWhich do you really want if all those money things on an issue and you had the responsibility of the life and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\n[noise] [laughter] it's hard for me to personally answer just because there was a vantage isn't disadvantages to um\nI don't know I Would take away your name over right okay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nOkay so the question becomes a can you take that next step uh what do you call it ... T\nIs that right yeah nurse practitioner\nOkay ill okay in ... and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nNow without going back to that tree or program and your same prerequisite\nFlight but my point is let's say you're in ... for five to seven years and you've got no debt you may even pay your house often that time and so you cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder how old are you\nTwenty nine yeah I just wonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the in the situation\nYou're in a casual that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to casual your way through that ultimate role\n\nReally know what are you making now ...\nOkay so you'd have a forty grand bump basically ... a year with that and how much does that cost again you said that you the cash flow\nOr that one would be forty K. uh-huh total and the other one is nine thousand yeah correct\nYou could add new I just start bumper salary honestly\nAnd go and do that is forty can invest that but you're going to make forty came back in a year the Atkins right if you do that I Know from the point is that many years have asked that and then go back to school yeah you may not be able to do it and that our school right now like that 'cause you don't the cash for it so now don't go into the lung death for that\nBut go ahead and go through the school get an upgraded job upgrade basically and you're in a sense that's an increase in income at least\nAnd yeah and then move into the school\nAnd a few years and cash flow that you know that ... I just want you to have that idea in your head I think well you pause you sitting there trying to run the numbers and I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder to that ultimate goal might it\nTake you seven or eight years yes but guess what eight years from now you're thirty seven [noise]\nYou can castle your way so I think it's both saying that's what I said because both of them are what you want to do also for something that you're going to hurt folks more of your calls about your life your career your money here on the day rain to show don't go anywhere [noise]\nDown the ... that started doing it go down totally agree but the financial coach it's more almost like counseling you know type of situation\nBecause you'll have to get referrals and all of that so I Would definitely say we have a lot of those that have gone through our financial training our financial um master coach training here Arabs decisions I Would say that's a great first step to uh to come here go through that training Chris Hogan teaches a lot on that and it's phenomenal\nAnd they'll go through that and and try to figure out people in your area that are doing that and then even get connected like even some churches some places that will have\nPeople in the family that need this specific help that that they can give you the referral a cause that would be huge as well so that that takes a little bit of time to kind of build up your book of business but I mean that financial coach but it's totally do a whole and to make that money for sure and so I definitely would go through our training on that\nRoute and I think you bring up a good point racial Chris at twenty eight I think you do need to look at the differences even if they're somewhat new launched somewhat specific between the coach\nAnd the plan or because I think you can be a financial planner and make money a lot faster and it's still a coach me Dave says all the time\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that's that's one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to know that he's got the heart of a teacher well that's ... well I Do think you've got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nAnd and at twenty eight you have plenty of time to get there but in the meantime while you're pursuing the plan I Can't say there's enough\nYou're not being dishonest you're not being a shy stir in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and then I think you're going to be fine I just would not let that way on you\nTriple eight to five five two to five is the number Ken Coleman Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour let's go to Kimberly who's on the line and nodding home Pennsylvania Kimberley how can we\n[laughter] I can um I Am fifty five years old I had been teaching in public school and the health care for 'em Thirty years\nOn and I kept telling it in the last few years that on time coming on or something else on the back of last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it\nUm yeah I can collect my a retirement um if I retire with a little bit of a penalty on as opposed to going all thirty five years and my only on\nA challenge or block is convincing my husband that's a good idea\nOn the ... the difference here I was there not twenty five thousand dollars in salary but I Know that I can\nMake that um I I really get excited thinking they're on helping people find Hong thing but he and I find that really interesting okay not what I said I Love my teaching them but it's just time for a\nJob I got good news good news for you and your husband okay [laughter] so for you to become a realtor a successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time and I think the fact that you just reveal\nTo us and our audience that you still enjoy teaching there is no big hurry you're not calling in a completely burned out and so I Would not take the penalty either I how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role of teacher before you retire without penalty\nFor five years\nOkay I just want to throw scenario but what if over the next five years you build your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends I think that's extremely doable anybody who's ever been successful in real real estate\nKnows you're going to build a pipeline your husband's only real concern sounds to me rituals that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five thousand dollar that's just that's a scary thing certainly your age what if you kept the teacher salary for maybe three years still take a little bit of penalty but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business\nOver five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into retirement full benefits and by that time you should have easily replaced if not\nMaybe another extra twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what you're making I think you can just absolutely double your income while still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I'd want you to consider Rachel\nBob and it's a it's a great situation to be an because real estate usually agents show how this when people aren't working so that means it is night than it is weak and that's what the busy at the time and so to say hey I'm going to commit for maybe when you and your husband can decide that a year two years three years old ... even though to five years if you can\nDo whatever it is and say okay we're in commit the amount of time and if you start to see herself that while I'm really good at it because you sound very enthusiastic about it you sound like a people person which means you're gonna be a crate residents say the agent 'cause most people do great when they have great people skills as it sounds like you can really so\nEven though you're enthusiastic you still may not be great at it you can kind of get some things under your belt while you're learning for again a year or two\nMaybe three years whatever your husband decide\nAh and then kind of step into it yeah I wouldn't go cold turkey by any means but I think that this could be excellent because having a great relative agent here and there are I think about it is it still commission base that you get to decide what you make basically like how much you work how many how you sell super fun versus going from where he wears a salary of the teacher\nTo do something like that can be very incredible for you personally and you may find that you're really good at it and maybe in a year's about\nUs and I think once you show the hobby replaces twenty five right now I Want
