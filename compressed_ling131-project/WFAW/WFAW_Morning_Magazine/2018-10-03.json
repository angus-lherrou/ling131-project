a tax money or a city budget is just the the community that sees the the need yes ah for this and a a bit of it has been supportive\nYes yup and it's been very encouraging to see um our community and even some surrounding communities in what they've been willing to donate and I'm In fact the fundraiser that we have coming up the\nMajority of the food was all donated I'm from festival foods and

work or if somebody's in a wheelchair yes absolutely yep\nWonderful what's your background [noise] well um\nYou know I'm a big proponent of this school music programs because my my start on violin was in fourth grade in a classroom and um I remember saying to my parents when I came home after having tried to buy land\nI'm going to be a violinist when I grow up [laughter] and I've always been grateful that my teachers and my parents didn't just laugh there you know took it seriously and got lessons so I'm\nI've been doing that for all these years I I went to um Eastman and Florida State for my undergrad and then I did my graduate work at University of Wisconsin Madison and like so many people to do their\nGraduate work you're W mad at us and they started staying here now [laughter] that's what I've heard that story before yeah yeah it's not a unique story\nThat was on the fourth grade and the violence came in and yeah I just never heard anything like the religious on anything like\nI felt so um\nI I don't know if privileged probably in fourth grade I wouldn't have used that term but it seems so special when someone handed me a violin\nTo play I ... I felt just so excited to have the chance and our teacher played beautifully and it was really inspiring to listen to him play and try to copy\nYeah no I had a a a wild\nIt's how should I put it that but my favorite part\nOf a ... of some of her and all of a\nPerformance I watched the strings yeah because there's so much work involved and watch the the them working their instruments\nIt's invisible yeah I think is that it ... you were saying at one point how it's a little bit like painting like they have to paint with your belt where they had the element to dance but there's a lot to one single\nSince you and compared I'm not I'm not I mean criticizing but I'm just comparing compared with the wind for your for example who's pretty static right the ... I mean they they do move with their instrument but it's not as demonstrated as the strength to do it because of the book because of the the shift\nThe bowl with the right and and she's with the left and and we do want to move and breeze with the the extra money with the music and it it's it's also mentioned as principal sick and so it's it's you you you mentioned it's a lot of work\nBut we do put together the booming some Indians the way that the bows move together as a section so that's worked out beforehand so we all agree on which direction the book\nGoes and as a positive effect on the audience to yeah\nRemember the prairie home companion oh yeah\nEvery April the do the joke show that's right and they did one on you know lawyers and all kinds of lawyer jokes are coming in the ... one time oh those unique about it was all the jokes came from other musicians\n[laughter] string players about bras or percussion or whatever or none of the others were like the [laughter] adultery from outside the profession but uh the best jokes about musicians getting from musicians about their little there's a large Germans I made that\nLarge repertory of you know um [laughter] you know they shouldn't joke\nA great jokes to uh [laughter] but anyhow I picked up on that physicians are it's a little different than other professional so Savino ... what's your background\n[noise] well uh I'm a little similar than the ends background so I I I don't remember my my both my parents told me that I asked\nTo providing a throne speech five when I saw a ... on the TV than in the way the new year to make sure that I really wanted to do that and so I started investing [laughter] yeah I started around six when I was six years old\nAnd then I went through you know private teacher first and then I went to the music school it's a music concert touring France\nAnd then in two thousand alone I came over here to us to go to Lawrence University are you from France yes I'm from France and so I went to continue my finance duties or tolerance University in Appleton\nAnd then the ... when I was done with that I was looking to get a job she made it sound with both the symphony orchestra and the ... so that's where it's been since then\nOkay or I'm quite similar yes you know it's [laughter] yeah no\nIt's um the uh the pianist those little bit about her I think I've had her own\nOh yeah because we've been here at the gym I haven't really yeah I'm so me and he is from South Korea and she came over I Hope they don't say anything that's not exactly accurate um but she came over\nAs a young person I Believe still in her teens to study at Juilliard um and one of the\nThings that I mean one of the things that makes me to take a different feel just that we do tell jokes about all the other sections of the extra\nBut another is the lawyers and other lawyers you know but we also get to it it's a very\nSort of small world yeah and so one of the things I learned about young he when I first started working her with her that made me feel very excited to play with her\nIs that she actually while she was at Juilliard accompanied the violinist and I think a lot in the in the studio and he's one of the best known teachers in the world so if you may be no the name of its ... Perlman or cannot tongue or some of the most famous violinist studied with Colombian and those of my\nMain private teachers steady with Colombian and so she had worked in his studio quite a bit when she was young [noise] um\n[noise] that she's been on the faculty whitewater longer than me I've been there Fifteen Years and she's been there longer so [noise] um she's a really wonderful performer just gave a concert have rocked my enough solo piano works last month that it's\nThe talk of our department for several days afterwards you know\nYeah it you know there are schools are just remarkable yeah I'm from Boston Boston area yet Merkley yeah right quite famous all the people who ah were musicians when I was in high school that was their\nGoal yeah I'm a little known to uh\nEither people outside of Boston or people who weren't musicians but\nYeah I think it's reputation has grown over the years though I mean it certainly seen I Know a prestigious school\nYeah I was watching the Tonight Show one time many years\nYeah I think it's reputation has grown over the years that I mean ... you know a prestigious school yeah\nI was watching the Tonight Show one time many years ago when Johnny Carson was still doing it and they had um\nOh gosh the jazz musician oh I Can't believe I Can't remember his name I've got two or three but um but\nHe did a number and I sat down and Johnny Carson said are you always have these young musicians backing you up but uh where do you find them\nBerkeley School of music ... soon as I graduate don't have to pay much [laughter] than they you know they get known and they leave for more money works good tribute\nBuddy on yeah OK mhm yeah but uh yeah it is a mostly jazz musicians so I knew that wanted to go to Berkeley but uh the the uh the school has expanded yeah course Juilliard was talking to\nA Glen ... daughter up all we know\nShe was out at the Massachusetts for the summer at um the\nTango tango when I Do I Can't remember anything more than I spent summers there and I was younger ... huge Clarence ah you know talked to many people that have been there and a beautiful part of Massachusetts in the means yeah\nAnd there when you practice they you practice it so I feel like it's it's as if you're in a story book because they have little shed is scattered\nThrough it's in the ... mountains\nAnd you take you just decide where would I like to go practice today put your case on your shoulder I'm not sure what lined as ... plays the heart has put her harp on ...\nBut I Would put my case I might have been ... you know go walking down these beautiful paths find a little secluded shed to practice in for a few hours\nIt's been nice nice to meet it in the summer yeah\nIt is and so my management as my management support for musicians to have a I wouldn't call it a vacation but you're still at a time to go and ah reflect man they'd be joined in with a couple of other a talented people\nWell I mean if you do need to be there there needs to be a spark of inspiration and if you're doing creative work and so when you go to\nA festival I think there are a lot of sense you're trying to pull\nTwo things together so there's a sense of respite and being away from that busy busy world and being able to concentrate on your music but also trying to\nMeet with other musicians play with other nations and sort of I mean in a way it relates to what we're doing tomorrow because you're when we play a country like this it it it's too inspired the students is to give", "show_name": "WFAW Morning Magazine", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "03"}
