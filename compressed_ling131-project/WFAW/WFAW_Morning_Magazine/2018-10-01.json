scientist Susan Johnson or the FBI they've already started talking to people\nSo from what I understand Saturday yeah they they're investigation began it's a very it's a narrow and limited investigation\nAnd there's been some uh I Would say confusion or lack of clarity in regard to who's running the show\nAnd how open it is it is going to be so the the parameter the parameters of it are that it can look into two different claims that are out there the wind by John I'm I'm Sorry but Dr Ford and then the one by another misery Ramirez\nWho spoke of a a party when they were both in college\nAnd and so that is what is those are the two that are being investigated there was a third one that have come out late at the weekend to go from a woman who talked about um other events and that's not apparently part of the investigation\nAnd there's a limited number of people that the FBI is it's going to be speaking to\nAnd I read this morning that there are several people who have tried to contact the FBI to share stories and\nHave not been successful there now President Trump has said that this is a an investigation being run by the FBI and that it will be very thorough\nBut to this point the parameters of that are have been laid out in a very narrow way and it's being managed um from what I've read by Don McGahn who's the White House counsel\nWho ... who has been the person who has been most active in in promoting judge Kavanaugh within the White House\nAnd working to get the nomination um confirmed so there's a lot of concern that this is going to\nAnd working to get the nomination um confirmed so there's a lot of concern that this is going to be a very limited investigation that isn't going to allow for a lot of different questions to be asked and different lines of inquiry to happen\nThe FBI only has until the end of this week\nTo complete its investigation there's no clarity as far as what happens if because normally if you think about the investigation the FBI agent will speak to one person who will say hey have you spoken to\nYou know to this person and or this person or this person and then it ... and expands and it can expand and expand and expand and there's a day when this has to be over and then at the end of the week and it also appears that it's fairly limited in terms of how much it can expand\nAnd I don't know to what degree there will be latitude available I think that people\nUm on the Democratic side are really concerned that this is I'm not a legitimate investigation and\nUm when all is said and done judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed either way\nAnd and so I think we have to kinda see how it plays out what what I Will point out is that originally there was going to be no investigation and so there was through all of this there has been pressure put in more pressure and more pressure and that's more pressures been exerted\nThere's been concessions I Would say on the part of the those who are supporting judge Kavanaugh and so there is a possibility that there could be more concessions if the FBI comes back and says that um\nThey're they still need more time or or something like that I don't know that kind of people we knew the store yeah that and that that could happen to\n'em it just I think it it just all I'm all depends from what I've read the FBI and I'm Sorry that\nThey have NO PLAN B. right now you know of another nominee that they'd be able to plug in and then to be perfectly Frank about it we got an election in five weeks here and this is on the minds of everyone Democrats and Republicans in regard to how this may or may not impact\nThe election and um there's a lot of concern that if the if the cabin on nomination gets derailed that Republicans will suffer at the ballot box because they were unable to deliver the Supreme Court judge that um they promised they would have on the court\nAnd you know on the other side Democrats are\nReally hoping that this can provide some impetus for Democrats to get out and vote so I Know it's crass because we're talking about something that is very serious the idea of an of an alleged sexual assault but\nWe'd be naive to not think of the fact that there are these political calculations that are going on in the background that all play up to what's happening in in November\n... me another interesting we\nYeah I mean in fact I read an article in a commentary I should say in yesterday's New York times in regard to\nThe political implications of all of this and and this from this perspective\nIt it suggested that the Republicans have almost seeded the house of representatives in hopes of Maine and hopes of getting Kevin not confirmed and maintaining the Senate and the the the thinking there is that there are a lot of swing districts where there's Republicans and hold those seats in the house that are vulnerable\nAnd by continuing to push forward supporting Kavanaugh there's a belief that Republicans in those types of districts will be hurt in November and\nBut they're moving forward anyway and on the flip side you've got a\nFor most of our most Republican senators this isn't making that big of a difference only for a handful of and then you have a lot of red state Democrats who are going to be put into a tough spot so there's political calculations going on all over the place yeah\nUm it's everywhere I Know Jim I'm\n... ... a ... and ... are we going to get ... daily stories from the ... just nothing into ...\nSo theoretically we would we would think he'd get nothing yeah right I mean that's how the F but that's how you're going to last me I Would worry now since everything seems to be full of leaks lately um I Would think that there's going to be ... there's going to be a whole lot of speculation this week about what's happening and what's not and\nAnd we do is to those countries and we try to get some skills um don't try this we give her skills to last a lifetime laid are almost programs can go in there is is\n... and early educate these areas have electricity advocates on how to create solar panels\nAnd then that really goes out and they educate other said before you do it all these little ... they're able to have solar panels said honestly cyclists here is\nI don't know I I I like to hear what's going on [laughter]\nDescribes mental walk around a long time\nYeah yeah we're we're going to be celebrated his seventies sell you certainly over a barrel 'cause I Can't remember for Seventy or Seventy five that's cheered when he was in the anniversary for us um and um that cross says the church World Service\nCrowd has been around for about six years old I Am following World War two is there is\nA lot of excess crops farmers got together and they did over the earth the those that after those countries were decimated from the wars\nBetween virtually every country in the world ... ...\nExactly yes yes yeah and so I really started all this is the state of Ohio for us so this is the truth is\nIs this area that started it says the crab walk in Ohio this is not the Wisconsin is is that Ohio is started and\nShe was very very sick all three of them are very very fighters states for us so we're supposed to stick to squeeze her powerhouses for Church World service\nFrom them and\nHow did ... million or did you become part of this\n[noise] ... the first crop lock in white water oh we heard about it and so my family walked and my children were Cub Scouts and the ... walked\nAnd that was when you got paid per mile and you went back and got the money you are and we could walk five miles or ten miles and it was lots of people and not to fight and I have not walking on the ... because sometimes you know I wasn't able to do it but I've walked in lots of that\nAnd but the reason I continued to support crop walk I realize you don't usually tell people that you know we talk just about crop up but the reason I like cop walk is because I feel\nA as my mother would say I get value for my money because of the money is not going for buildings it's not going a for a lot of staff is going to help people and they're I think we're not\nRacist about nine million dollars a year\nAnd I'm like in in Haiti that's one of my favorite places to hear about because ... ah was ready and one of the things they do they do certain things you specialize in and one is emergencies\nAnd they have warehouses in different places and they had one and in the Dominican Republic which is right next door to Haiti\nSo when the earthquake happened within hours they were taking in trucks with water infiltration stuff and stuff like that where I think people were just hearing about it and starting to get organized and they are still there helping those people because\nWhen you give somebody some help we can introduce something new not only do you have to help them build it you have to help them understand what's happening I understand their needs help them um\nDecide what they want but then you have to make sure that um the know how to maintain it\nAnd if it becomes part of your culture it becomes\nBut they do part in your everyday life and that that kind of change takes time and so uh\nI had a piece of literature which showed a man named Rickey to see that says he's explaining exactly what happened to him and how grateful he is but again you just are starting with a few families and what do we know happens there are other family members there are other neighbors who are watching\nYour nerves [laughter] right\nAnd they keep learning and then the ... ... ... if you can do well with one and people understand what is happening each branch it's not something that happens overnight but it grows and you've got a solid foundation and we know in Haiti is going to be more earthquakes\nSo they it's a way of preparing them when\nI hear that seems a little bit of seeing\nThe houses that cw less healthy sealed after that has the first place say his latest through and they're still see her every hurricane or tropical storm since they were put out\nA row and wonderful news\nMakes sense a lot of things were done after the storm didn't\n[noise] yes yes yeah they they um um um\nYou know we don't go in and do we go in and work with them how to build them and I don't even get so that they owe whatever wherever they're being educated or they take it and they grow it and they do grow it\nDidn't go down there and you know they'll turn houses so right now a lot of things that we did it was that it was\nHis his I guess you know five six years to a family and a lot of those things are led by women is an egg egg think he'd sell the seas\nSeas have fresh vegetables and it just keeps growing and growing and we even have some little micro loans to other women\nSaid is it seems as though so you know it's just it just keeps going to get educated they learn how to do it and I think he says\nThere's stuff in this world\nRight right [noise] I have something ah and I are in a number that I'd like to tell you as you probably know the third friday is when schools take attendance\nI have something ah and I are in a number that I'd like to tell you as you probably know the third friday is when the schools take attendance and out we have like for whitewater now in white water there are\nA between kindergarten and fifth grade the elementary schools either six hundred and eighty nine students four hundred and Fifteen of which I qualify for free or reduced meals\nThat is six sixty one percent which is\nA lot yeah it has been going up every year last at the maybe two or three years ago it was fifty percent that time it was three hundred and Ninety nine children but the ... or ... or more children at that at that age so I think this is something that we shouldn't [noise]\nI I think about I guess I don't know exactly what it means\nI because we know we have a good lunch program at the school and there's a food pantry and these things but it's something that we as a community need to think about and become aware of it's about fifty percent in the middle school and then in in high school it's thirty eight percent\nYou know because the kids can do you know buy more stuff that's going on and on this line there is of course the stuff the bus in my life this weekend\nAt friday and Saturday is right and that of course just the FFA and now some bus company and Walmart and I hope that people could donate\nBut remember the people that children need more than just calories they eat good nutrition so that in this I Would sort of like to suggest that people get fruit can shoot but not with\nA sugar sure about with food stamps and of course there's oatmeal and Syria and all kinds of good nutritious things that you can yes so I'm hoping you'll think of that\nUh because he has to children and we do have children and what was needed\nIndeed and I need to take a break if everyone can hang on for a minute here you are listening\nTo morning magazine this is Michael Klisch my yes this morning to hear about the whitewater crop hunger walk which is coming up Sunday or from whitewater Marianne Scott who is with us every year and a from the\nUh from what a\nWhat [noise]\nBut when a medical from Church World service yes okay\nOkay I thought there was another name but whatever Heather Wilson and we're going to pause for a quick update on the weather and a few messages are isolated done the storms still likely today\nI'm Wendy easily wins eight Fifteen miles an hour and a high in fifty nine degrees known as fifty two
