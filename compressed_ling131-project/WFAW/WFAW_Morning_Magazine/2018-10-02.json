according to the polls\nAre you know has a ... I had my maybe five points which isn't very much and and that's that's a neck and neck race there's no question that that one could go either way\nIn the in the in the Senate race a mirror is not doing very well you know at this point the ah Baldwin has a a fifty seven to forty three percent lead in the polls pretty substantial and and to put that in perspective of a\nThere's two sides I go to and I'm looking at politics and I'm trying to get a sense of what's going on one is real clear politics and I I you know what I like about real clear as you can go in and you can look at every race in the country and they'll show you the latest polls and you can get a feel for it and so on\nUh the other side I go to his five thirty eight need silver site five thirty eight is not a polling site but they take all the polls and they evaluate the polls and they wait some\nYou know summer are are less dependable than others and they kind of give a an indication what they do is in they'll give odds\nAre much as they do with professional sports on who's likely to win and the match up well it's interesting ah you know in the ah Baldwin a nuclear race or they give Baldwin a thirty nine out of forty chances\nTo be elected and they give more one out of forty wild so right now unless something changes dramatically how they see this as a uh it's very unlikely that mold when will lose now\nAnd a couple of things that are interesting about the race one it's the first time that you have to women\nVying for a Senate seat in Wisconsin I think tend to long was the first woman ever elected from Wisconsin to the United States Senate as I recall said he runs he wasn't the first candidate but she was the first one I liked it so you know it's it's unique aspect or I think will clear has been hurt\nWas hurt by how far right she had to go in the primary Nicholson\nAnd a Adelson had outside money yeah millions of dollars and outside money and she had to go\nFarther right than the normally I think she would have been that's not unusual in today's atmosphere not I'll give you an illustration of the dynamics of the primary system by it's designed tends to attract\nThe uh art into ideologues and so whether you're a Democrat or Republican in the case of Democrats you have to be\nPretty pure on the left side and the Republicans pretty pure on the right side ... test uh on on the Republican side in the primaries this year was how much do you support the president\nWell you know you know the words you are trying to win that cohort of people who are dedicated followers of Donald Trump\nThe problem is the president's not terribly popular right now with the larger population and especially with a well educated women yeah and we'll talk about that dynamic in a little while as well and the second half of the program but uh you know I think that's hurt her\nAnd she moved to ... to the general election\nNow ... is very interesting comments you know we have the ongoing a cabin all saga and a singer flake who is retiring from Arizona was the key Republican who forced the FBI investigation and held back\nOn a vote yeah this week that\nUm I ... I saw a bird probably everybody did he when he was cornered in the elevator yeah but those women who had been the victims and they held them there for a long time for a minute or so and and all of it being\nHuman being tell us yeah and you know and and he was there respectful and and I admire him for his willingness to listen yeah but you know late after the\nDecision was made and the FBI investigation was announced in you know is under way or the extended FBI investigation uh someone asked him if you had been running for reelection would you have done that he said no ... well\nWas very honest and he is incredibly on as you said there is no value\nWould you have done that he said no ... well\nHe was very honest and he is incredibly on as you said there is no value at the moment in working across the aisle and he meant that in terms of how you're treated you know in your primary you know he he was I think he saw the writing on the wall he wasn't gonna win a primary\nBecause he's a moderate he's a middle he's willing to work across the aisle and that's the unfortunate part of where we are indeed All right well we're having to go so hard right\nTo win the primary now is saddled with some of that and I think that's hurt her you know as we move forward and if these numbers hold and again this can change and it's all about you know what happens in the next month who turns out and so on uh but I think that's put her in this position of playing catch up\nShe very loudly backed Donald Trump mhm many of his uh ideas that\nSome of 'em most Republicans don't like building a wall in a\nA was one that I'm a I'm not sure if there's a majority Republicans at one of\nThe well they may not be but there are a strong support from his core his and they're the ones we're probably\nGoing to turn out in that primary and uh you know that was one of the reasons we now have an opponent like Nicholson who was pulling you that way yeah she did not want to get a you know out Fox on who's the more dedicated Republican yeah and Trump\nIs the president or he's it's his Republican Party yeah so you're either a loyal or\nYou're a traitor you're you're not anything in between and that's what I think Senator Flake was saying that if you wanted to be reelected you can't work across the island and Michael that's a very bad sign\nFor us yeah well he is there is a lot uh many coming out criticizing Trump for not being a real Republican or being a real conservative then after that he\n... yeah and but at the dynamics of all changed now and ah we have to remember that the going back into the very beginning\nThe political parties were never fully\nIdeological they were always have a ... a\nCollection of different perspectives that would come together work together and agree\nOn a candidate or an approach ah we've been we've become more ideologically purified in the party's since uh the Nixon administration in the early seventies and that's the accelerated today\n... no matter how you define that so in any case a that's a part of the mix now in the Baldwin of oatmeal race I think Baldwin I did a marvelous job of\nUh selling herself while because she didn't have an opponent the primary while we were in Nicholson were beating up on each other and uh she had some very positive are uplifting a commercials that I think helped to re introduce her\nTo the voting public and I think she's doing well right now probably with women and independence that's my guess given or that lead so we'll see if it holds but I I Believe that's the dynamics us let us to this point for the moment\nYeah I agree um ... that was a definite advantage she didn't have to prove herself to be in whatever ... a ... mirror I ... I think that's what hurt or\n[noise] it does um it has and you know and so she hasn't\nFully been able to uh you know move herself a little bit more to the middle but also a to a establish yourself as a legitimate alternative yeah to sender Baldwin cell or you know that's where it stands we'll see whether she can move the needle a bit more in the last month\nShe hasn't really mentioned those issues that she ran on in the primary she's been kind of avoiding\nWell that doesn't surprise me you know because of the nature of our primaries you almost always moved to the middle yeah and in order to win the independence and so that's that you know the problem for her and let's remember this is a a a midterm election that traditionally goes to the party out of power in the presidency\nAnd the and the Congress and so she's she's swimming upstream to a certain degree and then you have the dynamics that add to that and we'll talk about that more\nLet's talk about the sixth congressional district oh the one across or just north of Milwaukee in in the suburbs there and a little bit up towards Green Bay and out towards Madison\nTry to get more manufacturing things like that so I'm interested to see kind of what the dynamics of the voting there does he pull some Trump supporters\nTo him because of his background that that could happen but we will see you know so that's an interesting one we'll we'll update that one but right now style seems to be a out in front and the may well hold that seat for the Republicans\nWill say\nWell then we have the nation yeah and what makes this year so interesting is\nThe Republicans have the presidency the Senate and house and yet uh they're not happy campers you know uh there's just been too many surprises a you know conflicts or issues and they certainly are our continuing right now\nA part of it is that it's a mid term election uh and and mid term elections in the first term of a new president generally go against his party\nAnd so they they have history against them\nIt's a most every time I can remember Bill Clinton got nailed good\nYeah you've got an email that's when the Republicans central uh in in Ninety four in the Ninety five and a you know so this is fairly typical of rock Obama yeah uh NTN got hit hard by a red wave so uh you know there is this expectation of a blue wave\nOr how big it will be\nWe're going to see but there's a lot of friction out there a lot of concern a lot of hand wringing and in the middle of all of it is our president Donald Trump is yes he you know it's a love hate relationship in the Republican Party [noise]\nAnd ah you know and so we'll see kind of what comes there we'll talk about the president more but I look at kind of where the house and Senate are\nUh the uh you know again I look at real clear politics you can look at different races they all have all the polls that are being a reporter and go into any specific race in the house or Senate and you can see the latest polls in those races uh five thirty age which I mentioned before will give the odds\nBased upon all of this polling so here's the interesting thing what are the laws of the Democrats will take control of the Senate\nWell five thirty eight says it's one in three for the Democrats but it's two and three\nFor the Republican so odds are better the Republicans given the dynamics of who's running there are more democratic seats up in Republican and remember every two years one third of the Senate is up yeah unlike the house when everybody's up every two years yeah All right now\nSo for the Democrats to take the Senate and it's it's a little bit bigger chore yeah than the house\nAnd can they can happen sure but it's a you know you need a a you know at the Texas candidate\nTo ah have a surprise when they're over uh the incumbent in Texas and that would really be if that happens in yeah the Democrats are probably on their way to take in the Senate side say you know but uh again or don't count on that happening or they need to win at Nielsen needs to win in Florida\nA incumbent against a you know the Governor Scott and that raises neck and neck\nYou know so you could go either way so when you look at the polls is kind of interesting to see the possibility you know what happens to I think is moot ... one half\nIn West Virginia He's a Democrat But West Virginia is a hardcore Trump state ah can he hold on he's doing okay and the holes but again it could go either way\nI've been curious about Florida I haven't done any uh research so to speak or they they have I Believe the uh the largest older population\nAnd they have the large older population they have a very big transient population that is that's you know you look for states that have a smaller population of people born in that state yeah Well Florida and Nevada or two examples you know like in Nevada thinks it's like you know\nA a eighty seven percent are transient that as they move in only a smaller percentage born their\nBorders that way and of course it's this big retiree ... and then move down moves down there and so that affects the dynamics of foreign Florida's got the Cuban population they got the Puerto Rican population they've got\nYou know so many different aspects of Florida is a fascinating yeah a state to try to predict in read\nYeah Senate fit in the south you\nKnow it's what's there again because they have a transient population by probably half of them are born in northern exactly and and so that's a part of it to a but in any case uh and you look at the house odds and five thirty eight says what are the odds the house\nWill go democratic right now four and five yeah four out of five and a state Republicans one out of five yeah so in other words a you know this has been a consistent message that of either house is going to flip\nThe house of representatives is the most likely to go democratic that happens the dynamics in Washington change because the ... president no longer has\nGood buddies running everything in the Congress well am than really good five easy I I use that with Michael ... uh but you get the point and so that's the dynamics now the wild card and all this is Donald Trump\nA you know Trump has a\nCore set of supporters who are very very ... a loyal uh they've weather just about every attack on him and they stick with him uh in the Republican Party and now people who say the Republicans make up about twenty five percent of our population\nOf people who say they're Democrats make up ... about thirty percent\nThen you have the independents who are the big group in the middle yeah All right so you're not going to win a general election with just a Republicans voting or the Democrats voted you need the independence\nNow some of those independence lean Republican some lean democratic and uh you know in in races like we're talking about in Wisconsin ... and Walker and and Baldwin and who are competing for those independents get them to lean the right way\nDonald Trump they you know are looking at the popularity ratings the the different polls and they're they're out there every day uh you know is stuck\nAt a round uh thirty eight to forty four percent alright\nHis average right now I think is around forty two percent somewhere in there or the disapproval has always been up anywhere from about fifty to sixty okay ah so that's\nNot good for an ... you know for the president I mean obviously he's not bringing in a lot of popularity [noise] uh and the big concern right now with some of the race\nFor the president I mean obviously he's not bringing in a lot of popularity\nOr ... and the big concern right now with some of the races as some of the issues out there in L. are where will the Republican women and the independent leaning Republican women who are well educated the college educated go\nAnd right now they're leaning more towards the Democratic candidates\nLess so towards the Republican and some of that has to do with Donald Trump\nYeah I think a a judge Kavanaugh's moved a lot of them to the\nThat's the other part of this may drive them now one of the things that that it is always been a poll is called the generic ballot\nAnd the generic ballot ask someone in the polling if you had a choice of voting for a Democrat or Republican which would you more likely to vote for right now the Democrats win by about nine points\nThat's a sign you know it's not a sign of any particular race going one way it's a sign of a general mood it's also a sign of enthusiasm and there's more enthusiasm in the Democratic base\nFor this election than the Republican base they find that in the polling but the generic ballot suggests the independence may swing more democratic this year\nWe're as a you know they have swung in two thousand ten for example Republican so ah the signs in the polling suggests this could be a better year for the Democrats whether or not they can get that\nAre over that hump and take the house has yet to be determined obviously but the indicators there are such\n[noise] excuse me yeah it um\nAnd things can change 'em right up until\nWell there's so much going on you know and and Michael I think we have to have one more break when we come back we'll talk about NAFTA and Kevin ... a\nGood idea\nYou're listening to morning magazine or going to pause for a quick
