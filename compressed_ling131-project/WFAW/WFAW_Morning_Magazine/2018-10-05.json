everybody anybody makes request for them to drop by and explain the referendum they're glad to do so uh we got some coming up [noise]\nThere's one October seventeenth I think it is at a uh a

by our alliance group next Monday to\nIf a doctor awesome is always willing to go out and talk to groups actually Steve tinkle is coming by our alliance group next Monday to talk with our group they're also\nLions are all of those you have a which is good or bad or if you don't want somebody walking into the voting booth and finding out about the referendum at that point built\nAnd and that's that's the case and and we want people to you know make an informed decision\nAnd if you haven't been in the schools are if you haven't heard about these things you're going to vote with their pocket book and that voting with the pocket book a long term is going to be detrimental a not only to the students in the school system but to themselves because\nThey these kids and their job to bring him back you know dollars back into the community\nIt does it's a it's about the only\nThing where you can just point at ... returns and that they are and there are significant um the uh the school district is\nUm how should I put a generally happy I guess with the with the the way the school district is being run and a ... you you've done well the last couple of lemons yes just in your eye I guess I'd so you're saying people feel the same way\nAnd I think as Neal mentioned some of the things that you know the wars are winning a that\nEspecially with our new leadership with mark Rosekind in his group um are these the school system just continues get better as people see this I recognize that we're hoping that that you know the white and when they walk into the voting booth that yeah they're voting because they ... they're seeing results\nYeah what's that says there are all over the positive [laughter] [noise]\nWell they get input from their kids or there's something they find at school every day that uh they come home and talk about the athletic Serbian or history or whatever they find out something and uh so I Know\nFor that reason it's not just people that have kids for that matter\nA when people are looking about a\nMoving to a new city or town for a job or whatever they want to look at the community and one of the ... one of the first things they look at what are the schools yeah yeah yeah a ... that even if they don't have kids they want to know because how good the schools are is a\nClear indication of how good the community exactly they go together and in in the um [noise] yeah so\nAnd you know it's a situation you talk about kids or my wife and I have not had kids are but we're both strong believers and you know what's right for the community which is a good education system and the school system you know when I went through was very good to me in\nTo go to Jeffrey ... yeah [laughter]\nSo we have a well is very positive [laughter] we have three generations in our family that what did you ever since school really at all graduated graduated from ...\nWow okay so we're proud of that yeah well you guys have been pretty good [noise] that's amazing\nDale is you want to talk about that uh well uh you you I'm a hit on that a little bit there might go on to an\nJust junk community is yeah you know and uh I Do have an example of how that works [noise] our son who is a director of sales for us for our Hershey Chocolate\nYou know getting her shade [laughter]\nMaybe I had samples on Saturday they pretty popular with just several yeah I always say I made a a business move\nFrom Cincinnati to Wisconsin and they needed to settle into Dane County area they reach there's new research to different school districts to find the one that they would give their three children the best education\nThey discovered that want to key\nI had a very good or academics an athletic uh programs that's the way they moved it long story short they lived happily ever after [laughter] or they were always involved with the school activities as well as community events it was a win win situation all the way around\nThe Jefferson school district ranks with the best in the state and we also expect that gain to gain more students because of that but that there is that community um uh enforced with with the schools you know it does make a difference\nUm it's not a just a feel good story there's some real depth to it there is some Rio's frightening stories symbols and wonder if it was absolutely don't disclose abs\nAll right but I think I think something that is really cool about the way that our directors approaching this is we're addressing topics that can have a an unfortunate spin to them but we're still gun ho and into the story as a positive outlook\nLike from this experience what I was wearing yeah and the moment it kind of sucks but I was powerful and I powered through it and I had this really operate awesome opportunity while wearing this and I remember it for this rather than\nThe unfortunate that you hear the kind of stereotypical about women in their outfits and\nI think it's a really cool spend that ends well has put on directing the show is not look director is angel you know any\nUm yes and she's been amazing at looking at it through a different I threw up positive I rather than yeah this is the tropes at all women go through and I think that it's really cool and hopeful for the five cast of women to go through powering through it and not\nGoing into a negative mindset but being positive through it\nYou talked about this with the direction you're right\nYeah it's all been kind of established throughout a rehearsal and now going into a like dress rehearsals tonight I'm that we're not trying to make it fit into the typical tropes that are found in the writing um\nIt's you know it's the energy that we give it it's supposed to be very\nUh high energy and you know we're supposed to enjoy what we're doing so you know how to creative session yeah view yeah and it's it hasn't been like a single session itself but like rather throughout while we work through this uh it's it's been very consistently shown\nAnd something that I really liked about um the process is we weren't we were told to not try and pull from our real lives are so if I could understand right so it's been a lot about developing the different characters especially since\nThe majority of us have so many different characters in our tracks so that was really great to explore those options without trying to make it you know too much of myself you know\nBecause I imagine you've been through many of these right wing ... right virtually every woman Broadway mhm mhm\nWell you're all pretty happy with this [laughter] running around and the ones that are open to be removed from the [noise]\nThey open time the eight which is next Monday and it runs through Sunday of the ah on the fourteenth um and that is a matinee I must say that that one's filling up because we have a special tribute to I'm Dr ... on that date um and that they're actually performing in the heck when studio theatre so ... so\nThere's a reason for that the U.S Dr ... turned a hundred in July and she's still she's amazing I'm and I'm so uh so that one's pretty full I Would recommend Monday through Friday Saturday as getting your tickets\nUm this is really a fun show for I Would say\nWomen and men men you're going to learn a lot about women if you come to the show and I'm understand why they want to wear black um 'cause it's swimming and it always looks good um [noise] and ...\nThe movies and I don't think\nOh she did well nor and daily and I'm going to mess them but they did sleepless in Seattle you got ... they've done\nThey've done a ton of ... ton of stuff and they've done a ton of Broadway as well um so they're um they're they're amazing writers um they have a great it from it they are funny and\nUm but if you want to get tickets to this very wonderful show with these terrific actresses here and ... you would call this number in and operators you standing by right now for your numbers\nTo six two four seven to two two two two or you can go on line at tickets dot U. W. W. dot edu and tickets are reasonable but I Want to mention that this is the first show of our season and we have a fabulous deal you can get like\nAll by all six shows for fifty dollars\nWow it's a really good deal and it's even less if you are or are you W student or a senior citizen so check that out when you're calling in because we have a a great season I'm sure you're going to see some of these girls back in another show but uh we're kicking it off\nUm strong with love loss of what a war that the girls\n[laughter] what do you know director [laughter]\nWhen I look around and running and Iran and that's pretty much what I had to say about that [laughter]\nSo there there's something referred to two in the in the script called ... can you talk about that [noise]\nOkay yes [laughter] so ah the clothes line is ... uh the clothes lines is\nOr the the single moments or where all of the ensemble world speaking together and it's it's it serves as like a break in between all of the monologues and the dialogue and all of us are they're doing this this is these things um\nI I Want to see what the first the first one like it's it really kicks it off and really sets the vie for the rest of the show because we all\nAre kind of mocking the things that are mothers say to us and once again it like it has that that like the tropes in the cliches of like what my mother said and you know it it has all the things that like\nUm uh it's it's just it's it has a beat to it it's it's a\nOh man I'm losing the words for someone else to talk about\nA trillion old joke [laughter] I like jokes why do\nGrandparents and grown children born so strongly in so quickly why we were common enemy [laughter]\nOn my mom the [laughter] [laughter] right [laughter] ... [laughter] so you\nOh man so kind of going off of what have they said it I think the clothes lines are really fun because it is it's the five was\nJumping down and going to be that is set by I'm One of our cast members\nAnd it's just really cool because we all get to experience it together but it's experiencing these tropes that has been flipped completely but still makes sense and are so unbelievably related will\nMhm but [laughter] but\nSlipped completely but still make sense and are so unbelievably related will mhm but they but we're taking a spin on it where it's it's related well but it's funny and it's not in a bad way\nAnd they're all different topics as well so like Heather was mentioning the first one is what my mother said and then we go on to talk about our first prize and our experience with that then there's the dressing room the closet I just want to say and then there's black\nOr only wearing black yeah and we're only talking about wearing black\nAnd they're all set in different uh like different patterns to so like the first one has that being in a couple of them do have beats but some of them have little interruptions of percussion and it kind of served it kind of acts like a poetry slam kind of kind of thing\nUh but they're all different they all have different topics and they're so fun they're so fun mhm\nOr we should mention I think I read it here somewhere that this may not be suitable for all\nAudience mhm it's a I think you've made it clear why that would be so it's not for the kids\nNot little kids I you know eighty someone\nGoing through puberty might find the joy of all\nRight I I mean I think you you need to judge this but it is it's talking about things it's just a few women um that happened you know the whole you know Ross situation body image it also talks about\nUm some abusive relationship so there's there's times yeah there's times where I could it could trigger you know something that that might bother somebody so we put a warning on there just to be on the safe side and um but I Do want to say that\nIt's it's real it's mostly fun I mean I read this and laughed out loud [laughter] um I haven't seen it yet and I'm excited to but but reading it when you know it's not often that I read a play and I laugh out loud at it but laser learned to read yeah they are like a novel reason you know it's\nBut all these monologues all these different people are really fun and now to Heather ...\nUm the the thing with like the the content warning yeah it's it's not for kids and we\nBut we tried to um that's the that's the whole reason why we we don't try and like ... like our whole lives in this production like we're not trying to be emotionally attached to the topics because I feel like if we\nIf we spend too much time trying to connect to each of the pieces like it would probably be more triggering the people in the audience so we try and keep things as a matter of fact as possible and we try and keep things as light hearted as possible so everyone can enjoy it regardless of what the topics are\nI have to interrupt because we have to take a break if you can hang on a minute to ruin", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WFAW Morning Magazine", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "05"}
