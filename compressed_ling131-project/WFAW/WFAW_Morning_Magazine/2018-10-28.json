name of our Lord Jesus Christ [noise]\nDo another broadcast aloof and worship surface [noise]\nThe broadcasters sponsored by the local congregations of the Wisconsin you've enjoyed the Lutheran synod [noise]\nOur order of services common service as you will find it on page Fifteen in the in the Christian\nWhich was a blessing in disguise got it said that Paul would be his witness in Rome and now he was even though he was in chains he was able to bring the gospel to many he shared the cross of\nChrist with his jailers with the palace guards and with many others who were there with him\nOr came to visit him even some members of the emperor's house who were brought to faith then Jesus through Paul and you know what Paul is still preaching from Rome today\nYou see during that time of his first imprisonment Paul wrote a number of New Testament books\nThrough which Christ will be proclaimed till the end of time yes both\nPaul and his message must have looked so weak under the cross but that wasn't the case at all and you know that shouldn't surprise us that's the way it always has been with the cross\nI mean think of Good Friday things didn't look so good when Jesus had to carry his cross to ... and nail to it there he looks so weak at ...\nStatic state must have thought he had defeated the son of God when the father turned his back on him and made him suffer out the demons and how must have been shouting with glee when Jesus dead body was sealed in the prison house with the grave\nBut again blessings are often disguised yes through across the son of God died but through that cross sinners now live\nUh what can we learn and no one believe about these things\nAre going to be the Holy Spirit open our eyes to see that our crosses are not just burden to bear in life following the savior innocent followed world with the sin corrupted nature but as a way that God can keep us close to Jesus and his cross an also an opportunity to which God\nCan use us to bring others to that cross of calvary\nLet me give you example [noise]\nEarlier this summer my wife and I attended the Seventy fifth anniversary service at my previous congregation\nThe preacher that day was the son of the congregation and a classmate of one of my children how wall talking with his parents after the service and telling them how proud I was up to him that a former student of mine was now pastor\nThey told me an amazing story about what inspired him to become a pastor\nWhat inspired him to become a pastor was what he witnessed at his grandmother's deathbed\nHis grandmother had drifted away from the savior and really for many years was distance from both the word in the Sacramento but then an illness be fell\nHer although it was a painful cross she had to bear for years and which you eventually led to her death guy\nTo use that illness to bring her back to the seizures cross\nOn her deathbed she not only can faster faith\nThen Jesus she also expressed her desire to be with him inhabit it was the last time I had the privilege to give her the lord supper and her grandson was sitting in that room and he heard\nAnd saw it all and when he saw how the power the gospel could not be chained even in\nThe hour of his grandmother's death she want it to be a pastor her cross led him to dedicate his\nLife the sharing the saviors cross with others although none of us has yet or God willing never will be arrested for being Christians\nI Know that we all have had process to carry I don't know what crosses you've had to cure it in your life\nI don't know what crosses you might have to carry a right now or even in the future what I Do know is this when God allow suffering or set back down to our lives he is not punishing us he already punished us when Jesus died in the cross\nAnd I also know this when God allows across to come into your life he wants to bless you through it and make you a blessing to others through it a blessing\nIn disguise let me explain it this way it is not uncommon that while visiting members in the hospital where after some tragic event the question is raised pasture why is\nGot allowing this to happen to me to which I always answer I don't know\nWho knows the mind of the lord but what I Do know is this that while lying about hospital bed or one life puts you flat\nOn your back there was only one way you can look and that is up\nMaybe just maybe\nGod is allowing this cross the commenter life because he wants you to look up to him for mercy and strength that come only by way of the cross of Christ\nAnd maybe just maybe God is allowing this to happen so that others can watch you know\nTo see which way they should be looking to\nA man\nAnd the piece of God that surpasses all understanding chopped cheap your hearts and minds through faith in Christ Jesus gay men\n... ...\nOh ooh\n\nOoh\nOoh\n[noise]\n\n[noise] oh\n\nOoh ooh\n[noise]\nOoh\nPretty easily [noise]\nUm [noise]\n\n[noise] our second him this morning is
