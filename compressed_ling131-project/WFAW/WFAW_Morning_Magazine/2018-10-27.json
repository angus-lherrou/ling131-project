State game this is Wisconsin at Northwestern today\nAnd we welcome you aboard on my killer Mike Lucas joins me on my hands just a minute then I'm not whoever it was it mass my God I Am not my gun when\nOil out of hair cut like that but more am I supposed to do with all my prep work I got I got the long horn style stowed away there\nIs history here it's not all good with Wisconsin in northwest or maybe it's just because we can't forget lawsuits like in Nineteen Ninety two when the badgers we're looking to finish over five hundred for the first time\nThey're here it's not all good with Wisconsin in northwestern maybe it's just because we can't forget losses like in Nineteen Ninety two when the badgers we're looking to finish over five hundred for the first time in a Year's Day some burns funneled into final minute or twenty fourteen Melvin Gordon\nTwo hundred and fifty nine rushing yards but the badgers lost twenty to fourteen in twenty Fifteen Alex Erickson had to return for a touchdown waved off on a fanfare catch signal and then jazz period in complete the process of catching the badgers end zone as they lost thirty seven that was in Madison those are the nightmares today\nTo talk about what we're going to talk about it here in a moment I just saw but let's get into Oklahoma say about the let's talk about the cowboys what do we get we get a little flashback\nTo bury Sanders back in the day we walk him in my glucose our game analyst here in Evanston and we got a picture perfect day for college football game to get this one underway here in Evanston and\nAnd my brother's been conversation throughout the week about Wisconsin's health and for the first time we're kind of talking about that at the quarterback position how does that deal into what we'll see here today\nWell it's a big gap in experience between Clinton Thor suddenly start things forty seventh rice straight game and Jack Horner was studying is first time so that that's a disparity that the badgers they're gonna\nHave to overcome maybe what the running attack establishing a what they are and who they are offensively and then allowing cone to kind of subtle into Israel whatever that role may be we don't know how we saw a little bit last year we watched them in practice\nAnd he's got a strong army some more mobile than Alex forty broke with assistance they view and I think a lot of people are anxious to see how he handles well\nI didn't mean to bury the lead but I got a little confused on the Oklahoma State stuff but the question mark has men with Alex ... be available to go and as we understand it\nBut he's not expected to be a viable for anything today\nSo in that regard wine and Wisconsin and one of the things that has happened here is that the badgers have been able to run the football northwestern hadn't been able to stop the run northwestern can throw the football but they can't run the football so I mean it it creates a an interesting\nJuxtaposition between when north western as the ball and all they want to do is throw all because they can't run and Wisconsin as the ball and they want to run\nWell I think Palin still is important for the badgers I mean we saw what happened to add that Michigan where I thought they ran the ball fairly effectively I guess one of the elite the fences\nOr within this conference and maybe the country but they didn't do enough through the air uh to to really balance it out yeah you're right about northwestern they did have a one hundred yard rush or last week but I don't think that's what they want to do they understand who they are now and that is to throw the ball around a lot with Clinton Tillerson he does a heck of a job when everybody knows that he's going to throw it\nWhen you go back to that Dr game winning drive against Nebraska anytime I also have to throw the ball and he's still is able to get them into the ... so this is special quarterback there's no doubt about it and he's shown his toughness and the thing and talking with some of the Wisconsin coaches they realize it's tough to rattle him even though last year the badgers got after him had eight stacks [noise]\nUm my my ... which today is that Andrew ... morphs into Garrett duly as that happens badgers could be in pretty good shape because they do have to pressure him a little bit\nBut one of the one of the things that has always been a bit hard to figure out is who northwestern is right at me and that that applies to what they've done so far this year they lost to Duke and Akron after opening where the wind at Purdue\nAnd then since then they've been a pretty good football team they played Michigan topped nearly one that won even though last week although winning it was a struggle against Rutgers so do you have an idea of who northwestern is\nWell they haven't played while at home if that's what you're getting too I mean there one in three here uh they should have beaten Michigan they had ... down for most of the game and left I Want to get away last I don't even count last week at Rutgers a pat Fitzgerald and sometimes you go on to a game without your best fast ball I still have to find a way to when\nI was what they did last week so it's it's always been a a really intense series between these two programs such as it has been one of the better rivalries that nobody really talks about because it doesn't have a trophy which doesn't matter it shouldn't matter and players know you talk to any of the\nGuys who are addressing that Wisconsin locker room right now they know what's this is what the scan is all about the toughness the physicality that that will be really a challenge and then what's on the line today and I think that you don't have to really talk about it they know what's on the line that will give\nYou ... you and take something to do over the next four months come up with a trophy for this game between Scott let's just apple is\nProbably not into trophies my got the wrong guy [laughter] maybe somebody on the interviewer and later we'll see if I may will work on the other way\nThis Texas and Oklahoma State play for a trophy to\nKnow yeah I feel that question we could play the entire intro maybe later and his brother as well because we cut it off in the middle I was just getting into very rude Mike up before we we took over here I'm a ... ... there's a big day in the Big Ten west\nAbsolutely and then I I don't want to get into the long math but\nUh northwestern we pretty much in the driver's seat if they can knock off Wisconsin now they've got back to back road games\nAt Iowa and Minnesota but we know what the schedule is for the badgers they still have to go to Purdue in Penn State so that's daunting and then\nRather than just have to root for the Spartans today and made alliance because she got Purdue point any slashing of Iowa the really good solid Iowa teen come out and we we understand that we saw him up close and personal Iowa Penn State\nSo it it it if we pull back for a minute is Wisconsin a team that is good enough talented enough to go ahead and do what they need to do to win the west\nYes yes I think they've been getting better though the the injuries [noise]\nAt some point you wonder if the end result catch up to him yeah I Am today will be a huge test for the secondary because it's the type of our fence that they're going to be facing under type quarterback veteran quarterback told prime post sucker earlier on the pregame show that's\nSort of touch football flag football system where they get the ball they tried to get the ball the hands of the key piece or as soon as quickly as possible and then let their claim acres run with it they don't have a marquee receiver for NATO's really good but you wouldn't put them in that category is Marcie orderly Ida\nFiring from the coach in Minnesota or go but I mean they they have guys every year they plug in a different receiver\nBad your vantage time to announce

Fisher started playing\nAh but but I think as a group there's this line backing corps has played really well and I and Patty I I mean look the last year he was far and away the leading ... and and this year he's the second leading tackle or next to Blake Gallagher and it's not that fishers playing poorly it's that that uh Gallagher's played very well but\nYou know I think they finally got a defense the last few years that sort of matches the intensity either head coach and what he wanted to hear\nFor defense to be their identity to be able to win games with defense which for a lotta years northwestern would win games because they were just find a way to store in the final minute I'm not saying they never do that anymore but uh so it's different in Clinton's arson\nGo here's a guy who has started every game since the first game of his red shirt freshman sees him which was a winner here over Stanford a and and I was at Stanford team that was contending that year for a spot in the playoffs and\nSo I think you look at his body work he's going to finish the is the second leading pastor in northwestern history we ... them a second almost every passing category to him but in terms of winning on a consistent basis\nHe's he's one to ball games which no other northwestern quarterbacks ever done a you know I think he's going to go down\nNot only for what he's accomplished on the field but remember here's got tours ACL bowl game yeah and yet he's starting August thirtieth at Purdue worked really hard to rehab to get back and and they measured him early in the year and they had TJ Green come in and playing\nAnd alternating series and stuff they tried to limit the hits he taught\nThat stopped at a few games that go in and the guy who is except for maybe a little blip last week against Rutgers he's play great\nA couple of final thoughts here let's a bigger picture on on what the Wildcats have done that was a huge sees an opening when at Purdue after that law says to Duke\nAnd Akron on something when last week against Rutgers at times hard to figure out your closer you see it every week what's your view of this program this year\nIt was hard to figure out why and I will say one thing that the win over Purdue looks better by the week and I failed at that time it was that was Ron Dale mores coming out party if you remember a big game but\nAre they were able to control them of course uh the boiler makers turned it over it soon or through three ... northwestern was able to take advantage of and got shut after the second half and at that point source it was just kind of trying to get into a rhythm\nBut still that's a huge when do I felt the office took a step back and even when they're healthy Germany lark and they they just didn't have a lot of success offensively in that game but I Will say this\nI just I Would say it's a pleasure but I don't want to lie so uh we appreciate your time here\nAnd do you have some other work that you should be doing now always and that's where all the knowledge of make you jump the trick is Marcie Journal Sentinel Jay us on the line checking out still to come and look around the weekend of college football field visit was sideline reporter Patrick curb coming up next we'll get you up to speed\nOn former badgers playing on Sundays in the national football league that with my ... more of our American family insurance pregame show is coming up next three minutes you're listening to badger football from their field\nSome to my Harvey ... days to find your own my hand ... from the world's number one selling tractor and test drives sub compact tractor Compaq tractors\nHeavy duty utility tractor handle both vine of utility vehicle or we end up back things in a year during the heating vents harvest demo day find your do your at Wisconsin the hatred ... to test drive in same during my endurance harvest demo gate\n\nAt U.
