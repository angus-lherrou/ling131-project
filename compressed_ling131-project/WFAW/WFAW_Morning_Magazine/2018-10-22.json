didn't get to the insurance partner or we purchased our life insurance only got part permanent part term and of course we watched the insurance part last night and we just got\n'em off and turn about a week ago\nSo I take that our financial advisor and cuddly immediately wanted to get rid of the term or sorry the permanent and just have term\nAnd he said Dave Ramsey is talking about oh a permanent insurance not portfolio they permanent insurance which is what you have to do is it failed bad shall we still didn't get the term\nI don't know he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey\n[laughter] because they Ramsey does not ever invest I was real clear on the lesson you heard me yeah when you are never tell you under any circumstances\nTo huge life insurance as an investment vehicle one hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do with\nWho I Would say you need a new financial advisor\nThat's what I Would show you you don't have a financial advisor you have a life insurance salesman\nOkay they're selling you in church\nSo what we were thinking we should do is put to four hundred thousand just the term age and then the money we were 'cause it was like three hundred dollars a month which I Do a lot yeah um and just go ahead and open up our rod Roth are IRA and start getting money into that\nIn bed with mutual funds okay it's exactly what you learn in class was uh yeah so you already knew what she said\nYeah he didn't like which tells me one of those things are you this guy's a liar or he's are ignorant\nRight [laughter]\nHe's a family friend news and the um actually one of our friends who did apparently gave them our number ... for as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which is I mean I I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight and the last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said you know twenty or Thirty years whatever was on and the art term policy was until we were eighty with hand [laughter]\nOkay\nWhy don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy of four I think it's going to blow your mind how much this guy's overcharged you for everything you sold your\nOkay [laughter] okay\nAnd you're probably going to just cancel and everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nOkay that sounds like we're getting a deal I'm In the end of this week\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... number for some reason heard they were able to talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um\nThe people who so investment based or whole\nLife or permanent life or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and so they\nTry to ignore me or lie about\nBe with me they don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else but those are pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nRap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing\nWhen you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual\nFund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money and that's where you should be when you die with cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only\nThe face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account for\nThe first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a bad right of return and when you die they keep it all\nThis is a bad savings account bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more\nThan you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's one day room she has always said for twenty five years here on the air upset it\nFor twenty five years this whole line of owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or\nInvestment based life insurance of any kind\nEver not did get a horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque\nOld school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Britain they it was a guy my wife knew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than Fifteen to twenty year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker that shop several companies the best way to buy insurance if any connoisseur a broker the shops several companies and get you the best possible deal\nThat your car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deal and that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from slander and I don't own Zander insurance on our own any of it that show that while this always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement\nBut the reason it done well is he said he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price\nOn term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd then also your name to a list of people when you go on there either so that's why I'm indoors it's real simple takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance have been cost that much so just jump in there and do it\nSo Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that\nYet again yet again yet again yet again yet again yes you need life insurance oh by the way a broker\n... you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with get what they are usually indoors local providers for your ... what we call PNC property in casual yes your car and your homeowner's insurance you can shop
