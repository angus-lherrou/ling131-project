magazine this is Michael ... regular Monday gifts political scientist Susan Johnson\nKnow about the election I'm a big items seems to be a judge ... uh there's a lot of talk that that's going to change or what was looking like a blue wave a just make it just the opposite I don't see that happening\nI don't think so either and I think that what um what there was a poll that came out around the same time that the Kevin stuff was going on and it showed that the enthusiasm gap\nHad narrowed and so the Democrats consistently the Democrats had been quite enthused Republicans less so and that poll showed that Republicans were more enthused and that happened to come during the the context of the the cabinet stuff\nAnd there might have been a little bump you know from ... but I Would also argue that the poll was done and mad at you know men I ... or early October here and I'm\nDemocrats if you just think about it from the perspective of the national political environment Democrats have reason to be\nEnergized ... they've been energized since President Trump took office you know ... or even the far right and so and so so there's this constant level of energy I Would say it much more so than what the Republicans I think you see that\nIf we would have gone back and looked at um at twenty ten we think about that mid term and we had the Tea Party I'm guessing Republican enthusiasm was Fifteen or twenty points higher you know what I mean but then what happens is once you start getting closer to the election\nPeople who haven't been paying attention at all start paying more attention so I Would say that there might have been a little bit of a bump as a result of\nKevin off and I think also Republicans are just starting to pay attention more when they hadn't you know the they're seeing ads on TV they're getting phone calls yeah it's just it's time to start thinking about the election so I think that that's a little bit um you know why there's been more enthusiasm as well\nBut I think what we're seeing is and and this is I think confusing for some people but we're seeing that\nUm the Democrats are likely going to take control of the house of representatives um\nThere's a there by every measure it looks like the Democrats are going to pick up enough seats in the house to take over the house\nAnd and that I think is is you know speaking to what this blue wave means however if you look at the Senate what we're seeing is that the Republicans main facts pick up a seat or two\nAnd and that that does not mean that Democrats aren't energized what it means is that the math is just a bad map this year for Democrats\n[noise] so there are um you know of the third of the Senate that's up to Democrats are defending I think about two thirds of that third you know what I mean that are up\nAnd a lot of the seats the Democrats are defending our in states that I'm President Trump won quite handily so a Minnesota Minnesota also but I was thinking I purchased it in in Minnesota but they're defending a seat in Minnesota but I'm ... I'm states that Trump won Montana um\nUm Indiana West Virginia Trump won big in those states and the Democrats are defending ... seats there\nThan there is you know seats up in Wisconsin there is a seat up in Michigan I said Minnesota um and and so the Democrats are really playing defense in in a lot of places and\nIt like I said it's quite likely that Democrats may you know actually end up losing um a seat or else who in the Senate and and that's just you know by virtue of the number of seats that are up for the Democrats in in states where Trump\nAnd and that's just you know by virtue of the number of seats that are up for the Democrats in in states where Trump or Trump won\nYeah it uh I don't see the cabin on your shoe making it all the way to November as as a as an issue it uh I think health care and uh that migration\nThe bills are you on the issues that are in a couple of ... that have been at the forefront from the beginning that are still there um but uh the cabin on your shoes a kind of thing that's good for a week or two I think\nWell especially in this environment where things cycle through so quickly but I think you're right about having a especially because\nThe Republicans if this is a a win or lose they want you know and and so I'm In that sense\nI see even less of an impact because I'm for the Republicans because they they won I mean ultimately Kevin uh I'll tell you that often they not only to Kevin I get on the court but by the end of the whole process\nThe accusers had been in many many people's estimation um [noise]\nA discredited the wrong term 'cause I don't want to say that that they were not being truthful but um they're kind of pushed aside to almost and I'm a\nYou know and just counted my guest is kind of does a better a better word to use and Kevin I was on the court and he was sworn in and there was a big ceremony you know last week in the public um where you know the president apologized to the Kevin family for what they went through\nAnd so no I don't think that that this is going to ah you know to be a case where I mean you know the uh Mitch McConnell did a masterful job of making this out to be about the judges and protecting majorities\nUm in order to keep up pointing Republican judges but I don't I don't know that that's front and center the issues that you brought up though I think are no um especially healthcare and it's just amazing ah to me that that health care now is the issue for the Democrats\nYeah ... that's that's quite a change um [noise]\n... ah well I the the big issue or ... or\n... existing preexisting reasons and conditions that um has become maybe the ... the single most important issue with ... mostly of Germany Baldwin and Leah Vukmir of the second debate\nA that was one of the ...\nUh and that and uh immigration Boop air when he was going back to president build\nA wall oh I don't think that even the majority of Republicans want to build a wall or the I don't know how that's gonna affect her campaign she's white and the ... is left to poll she was ten ten points behind in the market bowl and\nFifteen and the what was the other one but um she may be getting a little desperate I don't know\nYeah I mean I think that she allied herself very closely with President Trump and I think that um that was a you know a bit of political strategy born or the primary issues and right right\nAgainst an opponent who had a ... seemingly bottomless pockets ... giving money yeah or you could be though\nYeah and I mean it will end ... it'll be curious to see what happens in that race because like you said\nIn the ... the last few recent polls she's been down by a by quite a bit quite a bit as opposed to a Governor Walker and that race seems to have tightened the governors are going\nTo want to spoil Uber's tempers and\nWhat another mark ... had it regular though for the last ... yeah\nUm I don't know that one as I think too close to home yeah yeah that was that's the only time I've seen a ten percent lead in the governor's race so I'm yeah I'm not going to pay much attention at all the all the polls are put it pretty close I\nMust I mean even you know even if you're looking at a four or five percent that's still close when you think about the margin of error I think we have yeah you know be a be careful about that and um\n[noise] um so but as far as the issue of health care it um it's interesting because the past two election cycles the Republicans ran on repealing Obamacare here I mean that was their big issue and\nThey and the issue of health care was not pulling really well and now when you ask voters what their number one issue is the issue is health care and it's pre existing conditions like you said and the Democrats are running as the party that is going to save people's health care\nYeah goals as a nation that does not action\nYes and uh I had a lot of people from the county from Port healthcare from\nA a free clinic the the dental clinic and all of these things contribute to to do the war and things like this with them as well a very important in that designation you normally have people come\nIt's maybe more important than the fact of having it it's a they're popular everybody seems to join us in\nA it's a a ... were you there the first year\n[noise] [noise] yeah I'm so last few years I've kinda been helping out when race and then just kind of took over a little bit more of this year you know everything's ... yeah\nOkay hope you it was a friendly takeover\nYeah see I Do I get lots of help from people [laughter]\nYeah it's um uh it's everybody sort of connected for these events or a Ford healthcare being the center of so many yeah but the\nThe people you really are and when these November first it's a good\n... I have to say well anyway [laughter] I think as\nAs I did once this morning are ready to limit it which was a Saturday\nAnd the Saturday morning yeah there'll be the holiday parade that evening write a\nGreat opportunity to hang out in Fort all day and just using that absolutely a lot of good stuff\nYeah it'd be pretty good shape for it to um\nThis uh what uh what do you do to put this together um any for healthcare employees are going to be running or participating [noise]\nWell we had a by committee or people that need throughout the year to get everything set in Cairo view things from last year\nProbably about twenty twenty five of us that really decide what we're going to do next year um but then we have volunteers all over the community um different areas from our hospital that help volunteer that day of the race to make it a success so huge thank you\nTo everyone that volunteers or the race\nYeah and eagerly as I said earlier that makes a difference of excitement about it\nUm what uh\nWhat do you to do when you're not organizing events like this or coming on the show\nUh yeah so I work at the therapy and sports center in ... I'm a physical therapist there\nI saw a busy place it is very busy a lot of therapists they're um they get to work with a lot of people from the community album get them back to activities they like um see everything from ankle and back pain to neck pain\nI'm post surgical so it's great to work with a bunch of different people\nAnd you young lady\nI'm I work in our community health and wellness departments so any sort of community involvement with things such as races um employee wellness you name it we're kind of out in about ten promoting and this is obviously like you said a great opportunity for people to participate then get our community involved\nTowed in about oh about you know we talked a little bit about that last week too but you're always there uh\nWe really try to focus on your own any kind of like I said and you said you know at the school designation into a great opportunity for some people do latest participate in this race and other younger the efforts that for health care is a part of\nYour young who had a couple of times I've talked to groups that are just for the first time trying something or and and I will mention ... why don't you contact Nicole a Ford health care and I think they'd be interested in a participating or in you know helping out on this than I hear back from um\nBe from you know after the event of well thank you thank you that here's what they did for us you know it just they were saying as they were unprepared for that they poured healthcare explain to him well this could happen so\nWe you know we need this or that anyhow it uh they had a great idea but they weren't sure how to do it in with help from Port healthcare and others say\nA cause for the health care brings people with 'em too mhm so it's a it's a nice a nice operation\nWe think cell phone [laughter] like salt seems worse [laughter]\nTo be working a this um this is just one of many events you have in the course of the year all annual mostly money and you look at some new ones this year\nI mean we're always trying to be innovative entering different um you know like I said on participate in different events on the community as Emily is that this is our sixth year of doing ...
