thirty\nOkay good to know that there is to actual director yeah correct a scarlet Chris was telling me during the break you if you're an author\nI Am yeah [laughter] I shortly after the tragedy I started writing a book called not surprisingly\nNurturing hearing loud and it's really about my first six months of my journey following Jesse's murder that how I really from that tragedy on his choosing lot myself [noise]\nI one of the other things Michael and I were discussing during the break was a\nWhat a what a challenge there would be to respond to something like this and so many people even with the Parkland shooting in Florida you know the the first responses to talk about gun control and and things like that and then that just ends up sort of being a political\nA mess most of the time and so divisive and yet you came up with a whole other response\nI'm to the shooting in Newtown so I'm just wondering you know what kinds of things led you to do that as opposed to getting together with so many others in saying we need to you know we need to control the guns that are out there\nYou know I I I watch the news following the tragedy along with everyone else and I saw on so many people on both sides\nOf that issue coming out with such fear and anger I knew that I was not strong enough really to the again\nUm thing I knew I wanted to be for something and I wanted to\nCreative where\nEveryone got together regardless of political affiliation regardless on what their\nFeelings were about guns um regardless of any er the difference I wanted to create a space where we can all come together can be part of the pollution and I thought what is\nThe most important thing in our lives and really it is such a and a lot of what we see a\nLot of lives but also a hero to understand how did it for yourself you know I I've worked in prison wow it's so interesting on it's actually one of my favorite thing you hear me\nI you know I've been I've worked in prisons as well and it's so interesting on it's actually one of my favorite things to do to be able to provide this formula to\nPrisoners and have them respond with\nJust is amazing and uh and and generally they said to me you know the only thing I ever have known is reacting with anger hatred and resentment you hurt me and I'm going to hurt you and those that you love even more calm and this concept that they can actually choose to live\nA that feels good by the way we're we're all moving toward feeling good in in one way or another and a and by the way anger temporarily feels good\nRight I get a good shot of adrenalin self righteous indignation um you know and and it's interesting because um we have pretty much the same issues that kids do we believe each other we do drugs where we are incarcerated and\nAnd we do all of those things in an attempt to feel better about ourselves to reduce anxiety\nUh and but that is a negative way of doing it obviously um there's an alternative and that's using lives and we can feel good by getting along managing our emotions being resilient but we need to learn how to do that\nAnd so the interesting thing is uh when I started researching social emotional learning shortly after the tragedy I realize that forty four years old I didn't have a lot of these skills and tools\nIf you're not taught them but you don't necessarily have them in an argument against it as well all of this stuff should be taught at home\nBut if if you're a parent and you can't if what you don't have\nYou don't have the skills into it you can't teach them\nAnd even if you do have them best case scenario you want a consistent message at home and at school and so um I I have to tell you that I you know it's it's not just for it for parents to and I learned them\nThese skills and tools and and and my life is that's been actually better\nThan only I hate to say because it's become such a cliche but it does take a community\nYeah and\nI agree with that you know and they know that anybody can learn this you know that you really it's not too late to teach an old dog new tricks here that you can learn how to love or you can learn how to foster social and emotional learning and it can make a difference in your life no matter what age\nThat's right that's exactly right and I am living proof of that\nWell you're not an old dog yet I can\nAsk your question before we run out of time a Christian I ever talked to before we get on the air we looked up new town\nUh it's pretty good sized town twenty seven thousand people but to lose twenty six people virtually everyone in the tone and some connection to one of the victims oh did Newtown handled this\nIt was difficult on everyone and and I've actually kind of learned the tremendous\nAh wake if you will of trauma we had a resiliency center created a after the tragedy and I think the original idea\nWas after five years for it to maybe a downsized and it's interesting at the five year mark it's actually how to expand its services because there are more people coming in and not just community members\nSide first responders and um family members and die extended family members that is so\nUm you know it's it's interesting um\nNewtown came together uh initially and die but you know there's this thing called the burnout that uh people feel as well um ... the lights up the same receptors in your brain is physical pain you can only feel somebody else's pain for so long and this is kind of\nA a natural thing that happens in math tragedies and\nSo then you have a a time in ... it's called association where you have on you you turn away from kindness than men you kind of slowly come back to it it's been really it's been so interesting for me or if you know some I have to take a step back and take a deep breath in kind of look around and\nAnd learn from what's going on so that\nUm I can help other communities unfortunately who have experienced similar things after hours\nBall so that they can do tricks so that it doesn't get boring after a while so I think that's part of what really touches on this wheels park when Jordan said it really is almost an excellent design\nBen yeah I I agree I I think that um you know I'd I'd like to jump back you know Thirty years I was doing this in this town and a pioneer\nRight and ... and ... and the the next generation is\nTo my right Jared who is you know eight years ago started this\nAlmost movement about wanting this park and here he is now a young man twenty three years old I'm I Know he's doing some travelling to possibly get some sponsorships out in LA did you say [noise]\nUm and he is he's a native to here here in ... and he still has his passion eight years he hasn't given up on us we we need to we really need to get this park but\n... no no a big ... it is a big project um there are a lot of people have no idea what you're talking right right right um I Know that the you know the skate and the wheels parks or Jefferson I was I was passed there three times yesterday I'm Out while I was working\nAnd there's there's kids out there they're all all day long\nI Know the whitewater a skate park same thing you can go by their anytime there's kids playing there I'm hanging out and I'm\nSure they have a quick question does the wind or make a difference\nYou know honestly uh depends on how harsh it is but in my mind I don't think so you know\nAs scary as we've had some pretend windy may that I don't know for sure huh and but there are still out there a steak skateboarding oh\nEvery day I Would definitely whether it's ... you know even if it rains sometimes I'll still stay out there sometimes you know it's about the passion of it\nWow and are we gonna go ahead I was going to say I I I can remember back when you know when\nI was skateboarding every day that the ... the first places that guts shoveled where the places we went skating not not our driveways we've [laughter] there was a lot of other places that got shoveled first [laughter] so I already\nIs understandable a bell you're you've got an event\nComing up we do have one on November eleventh we're trying we're we're not try and we're going to hold a benefit to raise money for this skate park\nAnd I've got an amazing ah it was just amazing response or that I got when I put out lick and all and all points bulletin for musicians from our local area and they pay you to this to [laughter] that's all your old school [laughter]\nAnd uh and I got a great response we have ten or eleven a different acts that will uh put music on for three hours from four to seven o'clock on November eleventh it's it's an hour after the Packer game everybody don't worry about\nThat and we're going to have like a there's a suggested donations on the on the various sites that are representing it but uh for me the main thing is people to come it is you don't we're not going to set a ticket price or anything like that come and\nDonate donate what you can vote you will of and\nJust trying to use this event to get it back on the front burner in a Catholic and all the heart of the city and the caffeine ... co sponsors on this so uh we're but it's going to be at the Fort Atkinson club\nUp in the theater okay yeah we're going to hold it up in the theater the ... club or that holds more and it's ... it'd be much easier to know to hold things will get some of these are folks that are in the room perhaps to come and see if you were there as well [noise]\nUh we won't I don't think we'll do a demonstration of through the floor looks pretty good [laughter] so [laughter] maybe I'll do a demonstration I'll just fall over right away and ask you figure that you'd probably be acceptable\nFor a for a demo of ... for that\n... we would get very long as the ambulances right nearby\nAnger I I'd like to encourage everybody to come out to this event um whether you know what this is or not this is a great opportunity to meet with myself I'm Jared some of the other other local skate boarders see our passion [noise] um\n[noise] and if you've got questions it's just it's it's ... it's going to be a great great event great some great local musicians kind of an open Mike a type of thing I'm just just\nCome down and hang out um and ask ask questions I'm I'm going to be there for sure uh to answer anything Jared will be there um he may

he does a\nWrong you end up in the river probably oh I mean I think I could a missed the river oh yeah most definitely like administer ever\n[laughter] okay\nThat's a you mentioned heart of the city I bet there aren't too many skate boarders in order to the city but they understand the value of something\nLike ... for her to the city is looking for something to provide enhancements for the community had to and and that's that's part of the mission and a ... or the car and we're just sponsored because I Believe this thing should should happen\nUm and want to be part of it finally you know I was on the city council when that when when we had a meeting in the school or in the ... in the uh\nThe gym down at the met uh at at the building and it was I was very amazed because the kids were eloquent they they had their they had their reasons and they express them and they they had sincerity and they had a real desire to have it\nAnd they thought something would be done I'm sure all you know seem like it would be I was there I think John Milky and I remember both being they're standing together and vote and\nWon't speak for John but we I certainly was impressed with with the kids commitment and and the good language that they used you know it's a it's always fun to see young people represent themselves and and and give you an idea or without him and hauling as much as I Am
