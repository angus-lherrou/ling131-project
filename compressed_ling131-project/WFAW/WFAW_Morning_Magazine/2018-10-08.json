NAFTA sort of sort of a different is that\nWhat well first of all just to to back up with what put one of the things is different about this is that when ... was negotiated back in the early beginning in the early Nineteen nineties um [noise]\nIt was negotiated somewhat simultaneously between the U.S Mexico and Canada and um the interesting thing that that happened with this new new bill and I believe it ... this new treaty I Believe it's called you us\nAnd see or something agreement so it has the initials of the United states Mexico and Canada\nAnd it was negotiated first with Mexico and and there were negotiations there and then the Canadians we're not so much at the table for parts of it and and you know people may recall hearing a President Trump speaking el of Canadian Prime minister Trudeau and\nI'm about the Canadians not negotiating in in good faith\nNecessarily and so we had this announcement of an agreement between the U.S and Mexico and then a candidate wasn't even at the table for parts of the negotiations and then there were no deadlines that I don't think they were real deadlines that they were you know working deadlines and\nAnd then Kennedy came back and then last week we had this announcement that now we have this new new what's considered a new NAFTA and it was a it was overshadowed quite a bit by what we were just spending most of the first half of the show talking about so it didn't get a lot of um\nMedia attention one of the ... um from what I understand it's not a ton different from the ... after that had been in place one of the things that I did us see was that it actually could be better for Wisconsin dairy farmers\nBecause there were some changes made to the Canadian ah ah protectionism of their own theory so farmers in Wisconsin might actually see\n'em a benefit from it but I haven't dug in I haven't seen a whole lot of analysis of it\nYeah I Know none of what I've heard yeah of ... the ...\nAgain I haven't seen a whole lot of analysis of it\nYeah I Know none of what I've heard yeah of ... the ...\nOf course candidate was going to pretty ... uh most of our dairy exports go to Mexico for the most they can do won't drink mhm um but I ... a adding to the market is always\nRight and it has to be um there's a a a period now where it's under review and then it has to be voted on yeah you know by the by Congress and you know by the I'm assuming by the government than in each of those countries so it's certainly not a not done yet and\nI'm a ... you know the way that treaties usually work is that um\nThey tend to go to the legislative body as for an up or down vote because you can't have the\n... it makes it more difficult to say the legislature in different countries trying to you know put their hands in there but I'll be really curious to see what the\nReaction is from a people and in Congress in our Congress to see what what they think of the deal but from what I've seen it's\nIt's not that much different but as far as President Trump I mean I think he can certainly argue that this is a win for him and I'm assuming that he will argue that if the wind for him because\nHe talked about how he liked to make deals and trade deals and he was going to\nYou know fix that kinda stuff and and\nSo now there's been negotiated a change to NAFTA so I Would think that he'd be a speaking out about that quite um probably\nYou know\nIt's it's not in place right it's not in place now a ... but a move so far this oh it's getting a lot of good ... response we'll see what happens what else is doing\nWell I mean I think if we think about you know we've got the election like we said a month from tomorrow\nAnd I'm ... I when I think about these issues like um NAFTA and the economy and employment was down again\nI'm with the most recent numbers and so it's at three point seven or three point nine so we've got you know very low unemployment and I'm just thinking about the the campaign commercials that we're seeing him what's being highlighted and what's not being highlighted I'll be curious to see over the course of the next month\nFrom the Republican perspective if some of these um economic numbers the tax cut numbers things like that are going to become more prevalent in a\nYou know and there can't in campaign ads and and what gets talked about on the stump because that's not necessarily you know what we've been seeing a whole lot of that so that that's kind of surprising to me because you've got a tax cut\nWe have this again very low unemployment the economy's doing you know doing while I Would make for for most people and um and yet\nFor some reason we're not seen that I'm a lot from candidates on the Republican side\nYes furious I'm a and nobody's quite sure what\nYeah and I don't know on the Democratic side what's interesting is that I'm a if you if you think about this over the past few elections the Democrats had been I'm not focusing a lot on health care but the Republicans have been focusing a lot on\nRepealing repealing repealing repealing repealing Obamacare if you remember you think about twenty sixteen it was huge you know I'm In in the presidential election and then in congressional races and every candidate was running ads about how they were going to repeal\nObamacare and the Democrats were were were kind of towering I Would say because Obamacare if portable care I wasn't particularly popular well now you flip it over and you have Democrats who are running for reelection\nI'm across the country who are running ads\nDemocrats who are attacking Republicans who are current office holders about their a lack of support for the Affordable CARE Act and then you have incumbent Democrats who are running for office who are trumpeting the Affordable CARE Act and warning that if you elect Republicans\nYou know the big issue has been pre existing condition and it's been a big issue in the ah in the Senate race here in Wisconsin between ... and a Tammy Baldwin\nUnseen commercials yeah in Indiana where Joe Donnelly Democrat is running for reelection and he's really going after his Republican\nOpponent saying that you know your pre existing condition coverage is going to go away so it it's an interesting juxtaposition from just two years ago in terms of how health care is being treated by both parties on the stump\nUm sex tat from Luke jihad elaborate more um so for that one we use faculty plus we use some students we have um two students joining us that actually sang the rules in ... in Italy this past summer so they already knew those parts\nSo we've put that together um we also have um some ensemble pieces that are ... I'm Adam and I will be singing the pro Fisher do at which is a very famous beautiful do at\nI'm from ... the pro fishers um were all there is also a duet from a logical owned or\nThat um will feature Adam Shelton um Tanner and racial would mess with soprano so um it's it's great that we get to do these ensemble pieces um we're used to performing on our own a lot so it's it's really a joy for us to be able to perform with other members of the faculty\nThank you\nI think it would be a great if we didn't mention all of the faculty members that are going to be included in this one\nOkay um so um we have the soprano is a brigade or did you get rich and um she's been at whitewater now for um I think about sixteen years and then um the Mets the Sopranos Rachel would and um tenor as Adam shelter and\nUm I sing baritone and then I'm Bob Beck is also a baritone and sharing that ... is another ... soprano\n... [laughter] I'm actually one of our students [laughter] he sings a lot lot lot lower than Bob and I do so um that's been Swanson he's a senior this year [noise]\nAnd I should also mention that um that UPN or ... or are you know he can and can't do\n[noise] yes and we're so fortunate to have both of them on the faculty they're absolutely fantastic pianist and I'm sure a lot of your listening audience is familiar with their solo recitals that they do um but they are they a\nNoisy asleep is later the Brahms I'm actually requires piano for forehand so they are both playing on all of those pieces together\n[noise] how long you been working on this [noise] um\nWell we we chose this music we decided to do it at the end of last year because we always have to kind of plan out here yeah um so and we started choosing music I'm back then and then at the beginning of this year we really nailed down the exact pieces that we're going to be doing\nOkay how do we mentioned where and when [noise]\nProbably not I can handle that [laughter] would you mind [laughter] it is a October eleventh we can't believe it's this Thursday in any at seven thirty PM and light beside huh at ... water I intend to send in the arts\nAnd you can get tickets right now by calling to sixteen for sending to to to to to or on line to get to that you W. W. dot edu it's that easy it's so easy\nOperators are standing by ... ... a very ... a little bit about your background\nI thought\n... years in\nMinnesota and unfair couple of years in Germany and then I've got my and I think at the Clinton levels and why why they call it of course work and let me think ed classes as well as some of\nThe last what I have done in my career together really got things in a really long time so it's very funny thing is my colleagues who are so funny this\nRobot [noise] and ah but\nYeah we're um we're very fortunate that have second well rounded um music department um particularly in the vocal music and I want to mention that the Gaeta and I'm Brian for a number of years had been doing some or what happened in Italy can you tell us a little bit about that\n[noise] um yes it's a five week opera program that some over towards the east coast of Italy and uh we usually have between sixty and Seventy singers that we audition from around the country and we even have a singers from other countries we've had several from Scandinavian countries\nUm as well as some\nPoland and England so um and each year we usually have a few people from whitewater our students that go and take part in the program as well so it's been going now in this next season will be it's Twenty years so\nUm it's a very well established program and uh the students come back changed after experiencing the\nCulture and I'm being able to sing and Italian where\nBasically it's the cradle of opera over there so it's a it's a wonderful thing\nInvented ...\nInvented it yes [laughter] we can call it that yeah no I have a question I've had this conversation many times over the years uh in Italy do they sing all of their operas regardless if they're a Taliban or German or French and Italian\nPretty much yeah we do all of ours and that's how I Am there are a couple of programs to do them in the original language but generally every year Italian and you go to the opera you're expecting to hear it and the native tongue is yeah um\nYeah I'd read that the ... the U.S is the only country that does all of their operas in the original language that the other countries\nInterpreted which I'm might work or might\nNot ... it's um you know that's the kind of a\nA pluses and minuses to it now yeah now in ... you know there's been more and more of that now that we have a super titles so that they can flash the English above the screen while the performers are singing but um [noise] before that there was actually a lot more um opera performed here in this country in English\nYeah yeah that's about the only drawback you don't know one thing and we can speak Italian but sounds like that's been a taking care of yeah\nIt's it's a chance for ours we you know we do most of our performances of opera at white water in English or because of our audience and basically this gives our students that chance um if they're going on to graduate school or study uh beyond they're going to be singing these roles\n[noise] basically this gives our students that chance um if they're going on to graduate school or study [noise] ah beyond they're going to be singing these roles in the original language eventually so [noise] um it's a good way for them to kind of get your feet wet and throw you able to perform it it's really different learning or\nA Mozart opera with all the recipe for the Senate in Italian um\nBut they realize once they start doing it well\nThis is a lot of words [laughter] and uh it's it's good it's good study for them to get into\nThe habit of doing that\nI think it's necessary to turn now to singing as it no [laughter] [noise]\nSo my question is are you singing a disc concerts um in English or are you singing in many different language [noise]\nThis concert is all in native languages and we don't actually have\nAny English on this program\nI think this is probably the first time that we've done that and um we we toyed around with maybe throwing in some music theater at the end of this but then [noise] um because of time limitations and we wanted to use the students as much as we could with those sleepless leader wall says um [noise] we went with all the different languages so it's good for our students to hear\n'em all these performance in ... in the different language because at the end of the semester when they sing on their recital juries or their juries for their voice lessons there all required to sing in a certain number of languages so I'm clear twist them tune in and trying to hear\nWhat that language really sounds like so for needs to take a break\nFor everyone can please hang on for a minute here you are listening to morning magazine this is Michael clash my guess from the U.
