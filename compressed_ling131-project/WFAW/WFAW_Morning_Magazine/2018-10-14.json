'cause Jesus his good in fact he's perfect is God\nSo the man was right to call him good but but the man was wrong to think that there is\nA good teacher would be able to calm is troubled conscience by telling him that he too that the man was good or for by telling him what he should do to be said instead of Jesus very subtly offers his diagnosis and what is the diagnosis it is and that's what was wrong with the young man\nYou see that the young man should realize that when Jesus said no one is good [noise] well that included him\nBut he didn't get it did and in fact you them fails Jesus little test because Jesus as the man what what the commandment said and Jesus was sort of implying that by keeping those commandments willing to go to heaven and sort of Jesus rattle off the basic\nContent of the ten commandments to which the man told them all this I've done since I was a boy\nAnd I'm sure at this point the man was pretty happy he had come to this good teacher and he seemed to be confirming what the man had thought that he'd been pretty good all of his life and so he should go to heaven but but now Jesus helps them see why his diagnosis was true that his problem was thin\nAnd Jesus helps us to see the same about ourselves how often do we think the same way that that good people go to heaven honestly it is the most common misconception ever about how people are safe and we reveal it\nTo be in our own thinking as well when we do the same thing that the rich young man was doing we do it as we sort of rank and raped people as good or not or maybe we do that on the basis\nOf how successful they are in life oh he's a he's a good man he works hard or maybe we do it on the basis of how they compare to us maybe we in fact I think that they're better than us and so certainly they must be a good person man\nOr we do it as we say oh there are such good people look at all that they do for the church\nWe\nDo it as we go fishing around for whatever it is that we think we are lacking in in our biblical knowledge or in our Christian living in ... and then we pursue that as if once we've attained well then we can be sure then we can be sure of our salvation\nIsn't that what that rich young man was doing\nAnd isn't that what we do when when when we think we need this or we need that and then then we can be sure you know what God says when we start thinking that our salvation has anything to do with us\nHe says all of your righteous accent like filthy rags\n\nTry as we might we we can be as good as we might end it might be quite good indeed but but when it comes right down to it we're not perfect as our heavenly father is perfect and we're not wholly as the lord our God is fully\nKnow all have sitting in for a short of the glory of God let's not look to what we're doing that is certainly not the how we're saved\nIf that young man was having any trouble understanding Jesus diagnosis know Jesus was about to drive the\nPoint home for him but notes that he did it lovingly\nWe're told in our tax users looked at him and loved him\nOne thing you lack he said go sell everything you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me\nAnd we're told that the man went to a sad because he had great well\nJesus was not setting out to crush that man's spirit that day no in fact in Supreme love Jesus was setting out to save his soul\nWe will assume for the moment that that that Richard man had indeed kept all the commandments since he was a boy now Jesus would show them the one thing it was lacking and apparently it was where his heart was that it was set upon his well because when Jesus asked them to part\nWith it we're totally went away than\nBut we don't know what happened to the young man the text does not tell us beyond that he he went away as sad as all we know did did he actually go and sell all but he possess the follow Jesus may be and it's just not recorded for us scripture horror or maybe he returned home only for the the Holy Spirit to sort of turn that light bulb on in his mind\nSo that he understood what Jesus meant and what Jesus meant was that there was no sin\nAnd him being wealthy there was only sending him loving his well and so perhaps he went on to faithfully make use of the wealth that God and interested to him we we don't know maybe one day we'll meet him in heaven and and then we'll get to find out what he did next but if we do meet him in heaven one day\nIt won't be because he was such a good man\nIt will be because he had come to know such a very good teacher not someone who teaches us just what to do to be saved but rather someone who teaches us what he did to save us and Jesus\nSpent his entire life on attached to material wealth we're we're told how he had no home of his own no place to lay his head and they did that in our place he kept a perfect focus on his father's will all through his life\nIn our place and now here's ... credited to us by the his innocent\nDeath on the cross paid for all of our sins whether that sin was attachment to wealth or or whatever else Jesus could reveal to us because he could easily do the same thing with each one of us couldn't ...\nEven if we think we've kept God's commandments so well\nJesus knows\nHe knows what sin we struggle with he wouldn't know just what question to ask her direction to give us that would reveal our sin as well and maybe it would be well also maybe it would be popularity that we can't give up maybe it would be academic achievement because we think are so smart\nIt can be one of a thousand things that we let become an idle in our hearts are our congregation as to Bible studies going on right now both of them focusing on\nTalking about the idols that we set up in our hearts maybe we all would do well to ask ourselves what what Jesus would have to point out to us what he would have have have to ask us to leave behind\nFor him\nFor the rich and man it was as well the the rich man had grown so accustomed to being rich young man that he probably\nDidn't even realize as well to become his idol maybe we too have been too long blessed by God in some way and we're taking some gifts for granted we're focusing on the gift over the giver\nMaybe we've grown far too comfortable with some sin that we were once well aware of and and that bothered us but now we let it take root in our hearts\nComfortable with sin that we were once well aware of it and it bothered us but now we let it\nTake ruining her heart what must we leave behind\nDefined ...\n\nIt's all evidence of the same problem the diagnosis is seeing the symptoms can be different for each one of us but the treatment is all was the scene\nLook to Jesus that perfect teacher who lived and died in rose again in her place in him we can have what we're looking for him we can have with the young man was looking for we can have that certainty that\nWe're going to ... we can do that because\nThe Bible tells us Jesus lived the dining rooms again for us\nFor each and every human being Jesus is done all that is necessary for us to him and we simply need to put our feet in him made the Holy Spirit help is to overcome that that that most common misconception about how people would have said let's remember that in fact good people do not go to heaven\nWon't be perfect people do and there aren't\nMany perfect people there was only one Jesus but through the didn't him we are made perfect were made perfect through the blood of the lamb\n\nOr sins had been washed away we received that righteousness RCB gives to those who believe and then let us live in that piece knowing that heaven is open to us let us living at peace being good people not to save ourselves but because we are seeing\nWhat a wonder receive your weekends you know as we look in the mirror every morning we\nCan know what's wrong with the diagnosis it's the treatment is Jesus\nMe we ever looked at him now and maybe spend eternity with him in heaven\nYou\nKnow I mean these guys would surpass his own understanding keep our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus\n...\nOur service continues to him when I surveyed
