Fifteen Percent over and above that or count that as part of it\nWell what I tell folks is that you\nNeed to put Fifteen Percent and most of the time and a pension plan you're not putting in anything\nAnd\nYou don't have any control over what happens with the pension plans\nYou don't choose the investments you don't get to um you know if the ... municipality in your case is poorly run like a break the pension bland happened before doesn't happen very much but um no I think you need to be voting Fifteen Percent of your\nIncome away in\n... four one K. is whatever you got to do along those lines\nAnd and that's the thing I Would tell you that the reason is is that what you've got that's money you choose where it invested and if somebody mishandled something at work it doesn't mess up your four one K. doesn't mess up your Roth IRA you are controlling your destiny are not waiting on someone else\nThe people you work for it affects your life\nThat's a big deal Johns in Pittsburgh hey John welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHow are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm afraid I'm reason I'm calling is here's my question uh my wife is sixty five but I'm sixty two birds you're now into getting on the on the snowball we have our emergency fund saved up mhm\nAt my we're looking for a new place to live in the house was rent right now is your way to make for my wife and I ... about ... ... up and down the stairs opinion about all the time okay [noise] um my question is\nI'm no rentals around this area and now are skyrocketing in because there's new cracker plant going am so people are coming in from out of state sucking all those up [noise] but I found a couple of houses that I could purchase\nAnd the migrant right now eight Seventy five a month or my payment dropped to about two hundred thirty dollars from up mhm [noise]\nUm but the other part of it is when I retired from the post office I rolled Meyer a percentage brand into an IRA and good that I can borrow enough from right now ... no I already just be able to put towards ... percent down on the house so I wouldn't have to pay the ...\n... you know just what you and your body the American idol down twenty percent no you're you're you're turning your to broker buying a house here in day out here you're in debt you get your\nBorrowing against your retirement I mean you're straining every corner to pull this off okay um and besides that you if you're moving from an eight Seventy five rental to six hundred dollar payment you're moving down in the house substantially\nSo we're going to move down in house substantially moved down to a different rental and let me just tell you if the rental market is squeezed because of a plant that has come in the buying market is squeezed as well\nSo what you're telling me is not logical you're using this as a rationalization to buy out of order I if I were you when you call me and I ask what you should do I would rent something else move out of that rental move to a cheaper rental that'd be fine\nAh for a short period of time while you clean up your debt your debt free you build your emergency phoned up three to six months of expenses\nThen you have a good down payment and you can do all of that in a few years of your careful watch what you're doing and then make your purchase but uh when you buy a house and you're broke you're asking for trouble I mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bringing his three ... broke desperate and stupid owning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse\nRather than a blessing\nSteven as in Virginia Beach Hi Stephen how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI don't want to know what would be a martyr to do it right now I have a higher and my name and I know you can only put five thousand five hundred into a year yesterday glee me and my wife only at ... mouth that amount of money five thousand five hundred to go toward things that would be smarter\nI got it ... me and my wife only at\nThat it's not an amount that amount of money five thousand five hundred to go toward things that can be smarter to put all of it into my ... is portion I open up a rock for my and my wife's name and then flip the five thousand five hundred and put two thousand seven hundred and fifty in each of them and watch it that way\nWhat's your household income or ... thousand okay Mm\nSo Fifteen Percent of that going in it baby step forward into retirement\nIs more like a ten thousand no it would be more like Seventy five hundred okay I'm\nGoing to show you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some it it doesn't matter uh which one you do mathematically let's say you chose the exact same mutual\nFund and you put three thousand in more than three thousand in another okay one in one Roth IRA and your name one Roth IRA and her name or or um you put six thousand in the same mutual fund it's going to grow exactly the same so it really doesn't matter\nA hill I even have like a thousand dollars I can I could open up one of five hundred and ... and five hundred hurt the exact\nExactly it doesn't it doesn't have you any mathematical advantage whatsoever [noise] the only advantage is just a relational\nIn that if she feels like that you know you're fully funding mirrors and she's not got anything for retirement which is not true because if you ever got divorced or died or anything else she's going to get half of that money even if it is and your name\nOK okay that's how it is not true but sometimes people just you know like she just wants some and her name that's okay so you can do half and half if you want you need to get to the point you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement that's baby step for and that would be after you were out of debt and after you had your emergency fund them ...\nWhich may be why\nYou don't have the money right now\nThat's why we put baby step for after getting out of bed and after having emergency if I Would do folks temporarily not to save for retirement until you clear your debts that way you have the money to put Fifteen Percent of white\nAnd a Fifteen Percent is more than one Roth IRA right for you guys but conceptually if you just even if you did Seventy five hundred thirty seven hundred fifty bucks each\nAh that'd be fine or if you did fifty five hundred and two thousand and the other name that's fine if they're in the same mutual fund you're going to get the exact same results whether you split it or not doesn't change a thing James is with us from\nFort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nGood thank you for taking my call sure what's up\nMy wife and I are planning to home next year and have a little trouble deciding or or agreeing on the house for love or to get kind of outline and towards getting a fixer upper\nThere'll be a cheaper house with a lower mortgage finance ... and that gave me the opportunity to learn\nLearn how to do those polar bears myself mhm\nAnd she wants to move on ... ...\n... ... and it'd be your first home\nThey are sick at all and we had a house in a while ago and then we moved in with an rent printing well over a year now you know\nThe other home that you had was at a fixer upper it was not able to ... ... ... and um so what is her fear\nA bar or we have to cook it you know and kind of a hassle Amanda ... over how mhm\nI didn't want anything major and just you know there's some minor cosmetic type stuff but what couldn't you do it for you moved in a\nFinancial aid I'll think we'd be able to pay for rent and a mortgage\nNo I'm saying oh yeah okay I see what you're saying that you use the fixer upper would take a few months maybe and you wouldn't have to do I got you\nI'm a part time real estate agent so if I live in a house for two years and then turn around and sell it\nI can tell it tax free ...\nShows anyway about him I though you could sell tax free anyway tough you know to be a real estate I saw how sex for your personal residents will be limited to your factory growth on that anyone for anybody [noise]\nI don't think there's a I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to this is just a question of what you guys want to endure it is your home and we are homeless topsy turvy because it's being renovated all the time and yet some valid points on her you're not going to make as much money on it to your point so it's a valid argument [noise]\nSevere shovel rentals and pay off your house you got about a hundred and fifty a hundred and sixty thousand bucks to your name is ...\nOr the paid for farm you know fifty five years old and um and you got a pension of forty grams\nOkay and\nWhen you die what happens to the pension and it goes away right\nAh probably ... or we would go to my wife she's still living would would continue to receive a lesser amount that's probably because I can take I can take you there is no survivor and probably get more\nYou know but are you healthy yes\nI Would take it as no survivor getting more and by Fifteen year level term insurance to cover your wife have\nSomething happen to you it's a better deal yeah go ahead\nAnd take all the money you can get you know okay are currently have a\nFour hundred thousand dollar term policy show\nOkay yeah then that she's probably All right ... without the survivor benefit because that's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that are invested ... percent will be forty grams show that that's pretty good you're in\nGood shape and you can probably do it this way um I Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\nYour ear in a way above average shape I'm In good shape is is is way above normal because normal just sucks okay you got to weigh rather than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life for the next forty years is going to get old\n\nAnd you don't really have any income coming other than that because your investments are big enough to create it and so I\nWould you know I you can do it you can do it\nBut I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\nI'm considered that I thought about it for health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of these men to share programs do you\nRemember ... was not driving this for me for what's driving it for me as you don't have much money\nRight and you got the pension but I understand you know think about what what are\nYou know forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing yeah nothing\nThat's the problem I've got here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being able to live and we can figure out how you could live\nIn other words if you had a million dollars or mutual funds this becomes like a no brainer instead you got like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe even a scrape everything together after the failed a rental properties and you know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what might what I'm thinking is ... and again you can do whatever you want to I'm just talking it through with you OK I'm not saying you're right\nYou're you're you're wrong or you're bad or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing is and so I probably would think about what we always call an encore career and say what\nCould you do that would be really fun that you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years and you enjoy doing it start a business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank\nAnd bank all of it and health insurance as part of the day I don't care if you're working for somebody else you start a business but just do something what you're doing out and make you smile anymore so you need to get out of there\n[laughter] you picked up on her yeah and so you know but I but I mean when you're you're young you have a lot of uh a lot of\nService to humanity left inside of you that you could get paid for ideas concepts things you could do I don't know what it is but something that just I mean I I'm just a little bit older than you I'm fifty seven and do and I plan on work and it's not\n'cause I Need money I don't have the money I got money coming in my ears but ... I'm working\nBecause I have a blast yeah I don't find something like that\nAnd then you can work and hunt and fish and worked in the hunt and fish and farm and you know\nBut but you know I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next eight years and have fun doing it that's what I'm saying that's a that's the only challenge I've got is I think there's God's got something inside of you there is something you can do more than hunting and fishing that\nNot that bad it's not you've earned the right to do that and you should get out of the place you're getting outta but what's your encore career you take a bow and you come back out to the stage for the encore that's what the encore careers and a lot of people in like a lot of money on that Richard\nShow and and it's not that money's everything but I I just want you to have a little more pad between you and Murphy then this scenario gives me here\nAnd I think there's some magic left inside of you\nThat we all need still that's what I'm saying and it might be you take a year and you do nothing but hunt pension farm and then usually at the end of that year I'm going to go do X and that's okay but but Ninety for for the next forty years you're going to get tired of fiction [laughter]\nSo bottom fishing [laughter] so find something makes you smile and ended that's all I'm saying so uh I'm gonna send you a copy of a book then again George called start\nBecause you're starting a fresh chapter and I think\nYou'll enjoy this thank you for calling him saw her to talk to your shirt [laughter] this is that Iran share\n\n\n\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nTo be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full\nOf resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dog ... have to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new\nIt finds them for you it's powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes\nIdentifies people with the ride skills education and experience for your job\nAnd actively invites them do apply\nSo you get qualified candidates fast and right now ...\nIn an experience for your job and actively invites them do apply\nSo you get qualified candidates fast and right now my listeners can try zip recruiter for free at zip recruiter dot com slash Dave that specific recruiter dot com slash Dave zipper crude or the smartest way to hire\nShould you be able to get more bang for your book the answers to ISIS\nWhere you're hunting headquarters and have everything you need whether it's closing and footwear stands and blinds firearms enamel Laura ... some central lemonade Tyson's as all of the ... the one from the top brands to mix is your best season ever so make some traction head over to Tyson's today Tyson's home farm auto more for you and more for\nThe birthing center at Fort healthcare is the best choice doctors and nurses at the Fort healthcare great expectations birthing center\nFort Memorial Hospital in Fort Atkinson are specially trained to care for prenatal visit [noise] routine at high risk pregnancies labor and delivery plus postpartum\nFor health care has been designated that may be friendly facility one of only a handful in the entire state of Wisconsin the birthing center wants you and your baby to experience individualize care while making sure the whole family\nIs part of the experience you can enjoy all the comforts of home starting with the ... private sweet experienced the hydro therapies before and after ...\nPlus for health care has restaurant\nQuality food service twenty four seven [noise] please visit for healthcare dot com forward slash be bored health care\n\nNovember is a big bond for ... family dental marketing janitors but these upcoming events on Saturday\nNovember ... looked for the ... the Fort Atkinson\nLighted holiday parade as they had a tree toothbrushes then on friday November thirtieth ... family dental is showing their appreciation to veterans by providing a day a free dental care to bench veterans please call nine to zero five six three twenty nine twenty eight this scheduling appointments prior to November thirtieth\nAnd eating family dental on Madison Avenue ...
