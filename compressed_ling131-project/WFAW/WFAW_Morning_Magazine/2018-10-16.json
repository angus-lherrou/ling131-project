Tuesday my regular guest political science are a lot of people think that's what you know I Know your medications dean ... professor emeritus Richard have a good one\nHey good morning Michael we get a lot to talk we do where we're going to look at some of the big stories percolating through the news and some of the not so big stories but ah we'll take a look at them and talk about them in more detail because there are some things going on that are very important to us indeed\nYou know the first one we want to talk about and it's an ongoing story it's a mystery and that's the disappearance and likely murder of a Saudi journalist who was a working for the Washington Post so he has a connection to America [laughter]\nBut ah he entered a the Saudi Arabian consulates in Turkey are wanting to get to the proper people work to marry his girlfriend\nHe never came out and the the it is the belief now that he was murdered inside the consulate now a a consulate you know at all countries have confluence in other countries you know we have conscious ... for example Canada\nThroughout the world and they are a territory that really belongs to that country and and so you know you can't the police can't just enter a conflict\nThey have to get permission from the country that runs the consulate that's kind of the nature\nOf diplomatic relation island yeah essential and so that's why I'm the fellow who runs weekly leaks ah has been held the hold up in a ... you know an embassy of Ecuador well let's see I Would argue for mission or the Swedes can go in and arrest him [laughter]\nA school in school um but they're going to be more precise wasn't MIT no ghosts and they didn't meet in the west coast on the west coast and what's that the MIT equivalent and eloquent\nIn Stanford or know California technology Celtic no wasn't towns that it's interesting they actually met in high school in Seattle and I knew that there we go out and ah and Paul Allen went to Washington state university\nAnd Bill Gates took off to Harvard yeah All right and Paul Allen eventually dropped out of Washington state to take a job at honey well but he convinced Bill Gates to drop out of Harvard in order to start a business\nNow so they got back together and in the Seattle area now as a high school students or they had a chance their school high school happened to get a access to an early computer\nAnd ah they were the ones who actually got it up and running the teachers in how to do it [laughter] and they wrote their first program and I wanted you know what the name of that program was\nNo I don't\nThink was called trap old data trap that he or a F dash oh dash data and\nThere was a little program that was designed to collect\nAll the data out in that area about traffic and then it was beat it back to the engineer's to help them look at what's going on with traffic let's just say it wasn't a big success you didn't sell a whole lot but it was the first program they wrote now\nIn the seventies they uh came across a machine called the old air eight\nEighty eight hundred alt area and it was one of the first computers that are individuals can start doing some up to that point a only businesses big businesses and government had computers you wasn't something for people that have the personal computer wasn't really a thought of\nAnd they began to work with the old here eight eighty eight hundred and are formed a business\nAnd Paul Allen actually named the business Microsoft but it was micro dash saw he liked ... yes yeah and as micro dash often because they get rid of the dash eventually become Microsoft and um they uh you know but they began to see the potential\nIn for them it wasn't to build computers it was the software\nAnd so eventually they would hire a programmer I think out of Canada they paid them a flat fee and he wrote MS dos\nAnd it must dos would become the software that they would offer that then the personal computers that we're starting to appear in the first one I had in my office and this would be\nYou know really uh in the late eighties I think early and I don't know it was early nineties even with a Venus you know and so they were all these little companies making different personal computers now but they would run MS dos and that's what Microsoft did\nAnd of course at some one point they would have Ninety plus percent of the market\nRunning their software\nAnd of course eventually they would that would lead on two windows as we know about today and their competitor out there would eventually be Steve Jobs and apple\nAnd the introduction of the Mac yeah so that but the Mac came introduced in about eighty to eighty three somewhere in there\nSo you know Paul Allen is the somewhat forgotten partner yeah a Bill Gates gates has gotten more of the attention Allen a left the company and about eighty three I think partly because of illness\nAnd ah but he would rejoined in some ways a ... he was one of the richest men in the world a very very generous with his money uh he loves sports and music bought a couple of teams you bought a couple of teams out their eyes including the Golden State warriors early and the Seattle\nA football\nTeam saying but he also uh when he was like sixteen and I think he heard the Jimi Hendrix perform\nAnd he loved to that performance he loves the guitar and I remember being out in Seattle and there's a a museum dedicated to the guitar that the building looks like a guitar now and it's all paid for by Paul Allen and while you know has all\nInteresting guy who was born in the background Bill Gates became the face of man here and I crochet song\nBut Allen was really the guy who got to go in because he got gates out of Harvard and they both started up the company and together they started as on the road to eventual success in the computer field\nYeah amazing story yeah a a fabulous fabulously wealthy yes I'm\nI'm In ... because he he just passed away and he had a a form of cancer but I think that actually developed early yeah he's dealt with it throughout his life he was only sixty five when he died or just the other day but uh again do very very generous man he he funded a lot of ...\nAnd singer Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts who is a vocal\nUh outspoken critic of the president and someone the president likes to taught by calling her Pocahontas\nWell that had to do with say a story about how she claimed that in her family history\nThere were stories of American indian uh ancestry on her mother's side\nAnd out and she said she was simply repeating what uh she had learned from the family well ... this was first an issue when she ran for Senate against the then senator from Massachusetts Scott Brown and he raised it as a question of her credibility she won the Senate race for\nPresident Trump raised it again after she was very critical of him in two thousand sixteen\nWell he uh even though he now denies it ah said well if you can prove it or with a scientific DNA test or I'll give a million dollars to your favorite charity\nWell just yesterday I Believe she released yesterday in a study that indicated that end her background it was the scientifically very likely like Ninety nine percent of that there are Native American heritage now\nIn her mother's stories it indicated that they were Cherokee going back on her mother's side well I'm the DNA sample it probably does not tell you whether it was Cherokee or yeah\nI don't know I it doesn't tell you that DNA could break and now just indicates that there was Native American background now and I could even be just pointed out as a Asian yeah\nSo you you know and it but more likely it would point out that there was Native American background which could be South American you know a Latin American or North American\nIn any case ah now people are attacking her claiming that the I think that President Trump this morning a suggested that it's a it's a fake DNA study you know and so they're beginning to try to under caught what she is claiming\nSome people ask why does she do this why you know once you get the DNA study of course she's launched a really slick video all about a challenging the president and basically you know calling them to task\nAnd or in the answer to that question is because she's running for president and she's getting a lot of attention and she is the most likely going to be a candidate for president twenty twenty I think that's likely that's right and and this was her way of doing two things\nTrying to to give credibility to this family story that's been used in a negative way against or you know and the same time growing lots of attention to her as kind of the leading progressive candidate\nYou know she used to the left of Joe Biden and she's going to be competing with Cory Booker\nThe senator from New Jersey so [noise] you know she's she's kind of\nPutting her a you know noted out I'm ready and of course she does not shy about attacking the president so areas and the story has similar eggs and we'll see how long it lasts but I think that's the reason for this story\nYeah I'm ... I I agree with you know she just she didn't do this to prove she was rights right she's got a plan here oh yeah absolutely\nYeah I I probably have a nine now I Do have my brother did a genealogy chart but ah my mother is a family goes back to\nThe sixteen hundreds in Canada a French Canadian fern rappers the early ones and I know I have a Native American ancestry been probably about as much as she does but\nBut you know and I always wanted to add on my father's side we came out of Kentucky and we always kind of hoped yeah that maybe there was a little Native American heritage we never could find any of that was kind of disappointing now I have found out that I've got all these\nYou know havens who fought in the revolutionary war and the civil war and so on or other relatives\nAnd that's good enough you know but it turns out we just go back to England or who wants to go back to England yeah I'd much rather be you know a a suit you know part of the Sioux tribe or something yeah but in any case uh\nIt's interesting and it ... or something like this which really shouldn't be a big story has become a big story\nYeah yeah well it's you know a\nLot of reasons it's Trump's involved as\nWell yeah well that's part of it and you know you you know he draws attention to it and it will stay a store he'll continue to talk to her\nAnd she will continue to attack him and of course at a Trump sooner running around racing lots of money for twenty twenty already yeah he's been he's never stop campaigning no uh everything he does is all about both helping the Republican Party but more helping himself as he gets ready for a reelection\nAnd he hasn't figured out yet if he quits talking about something it'll disappear\nSometimes it can be an advantage yeah but that's not always the\nCase but with him it's personal he'll he'll fight it really is tired of it\nAnd that's all right uh now there there are two stories in the\nAh not so big category that we have to touch on one is the man who shot at a teen who asked for directions by wanting to ask for directions about how he and his doorbell yeah the the uh the homeowner came out onto the porch the team took off running and he fires a shotgun at\nThe teenager uh this man was just convicted mhm and we'll be facing prison time\nOr this happened in Rochester Hills Michigan a suburb of Detroit\nYeah that is still happening I've been in the nineties I Believe it was maybe was further back than that I still remember this Louisiana a an Asian student veterans of foreign students in a yeah\nDressed in a Halloween suit looking for a party he had been invited to knocked on the door to ask for directions and the owner didn't even open the door shot him through the door and the screen door and he\nOne of the owner ah had had yelled at him now telling them to get off the property of the foreign student did not speak English real well yeah and probably did not fully understand it\nBut yeah uh and that goes back to your stand your ground kind of young and and and that's a controversial interpretation of when is a allowable to use force\nThe this case you know as similar to another one that uh uh we're seeing too often and that was in St Louis where a a white woman\nA ... attempt to prevent a black man from entering a secure apartment building where you had to use a your key to unlock the entrance door and she still does that door refusing to let him come in and he said but but I'm a resident like you and she said\nUh your key to unlock the entrance door\nAnd she still does that door refusing to let him come in and he said but but I'm a resident like you and she said prove it and he said no I don't have to prove it you're not in the building manager yeah I have the key let me and finally he pushes his way in and heads for his apartment she tracks him calls the police\nAnd then she's watching him you know open the apartment door waiting for the police to come because she sure he's there to Rob somebody yeah well she's been fired from her job she worked for the I don't know where\nShe worked but whoever ... just yeah they fired or because you know they they simply a ... D was videotaped by the guy who now live there\nBut in each of these cases\nIs a white person shooting at him or preventing a black person yeah not unlike the ... the white officer in Dallas\nWho went into the wrong apartment and killed the black man who was a resident up there and live there and so you know these incidences remind us that I think we are in a time when people are stuck in their silos in a certain\nThat if someone who doesn't look like them is trying to answer where they live they must be a criminal yeah instead of\nRegular folks yeah and I think that's not a good sign for our society\nToday [laughter] no it isn't at this point let's take a quick break for the weather\nI'm In a few messages a briefly we're looking at a high is fifty three degrees today under sunny skies down to thirty for tonight and up to forty six on Wednesday with clear skies right now\nAt W.
