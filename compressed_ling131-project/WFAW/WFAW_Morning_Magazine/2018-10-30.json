... anniversary of a scary event and that was the broadcast of the radio show war of the world's\nAnd of course ah shocked a lot of people because they thought it was really outright they thought it was a real warning broadcast\nYeah exactly what that this was a true event and it suddenly I Believe this is true or you know someone listening will correct me if I'm wrong but I Believe after that event is when the federal government ordered the FCC order that radio and television stations would always announce the the ah station\nYou know or the\nCall numbers whole numbers and so on at the top of the hour sure way to tell people this is not a news event that's right okay which we still out here to today leave that that has something to do with it or some ... and this essay they show this is

fifty two degrees under partly cloudy skies and for friday to wrap up the workweek here forty seven degrees with a overcast guys\nAll right gentlemen so we were talking about Halloween couch\nYou know I have to tell you real quickly that uh back when I was a student at Ball State I was a history major in a speech minor and if the same time David Letterman was there\nAnd one was a radio TV major he was two years ahead of me I did not know him we probably passed in the hall but after he graduated he was first job was as a weatherman for it and say no and he didn't last long and doing that part of the thing he would do is at times he would make up cities and give them to purchase\nA that you can imagine was David Letterman [laughter]\nAll right I can tell you why they'd have an issue\nWith that you might you might wonder right yeah okay but it wouldn't be very entertaining oh abs uh so we're talking about costumes that and we want to you know look to see what are the popular costumes we'll start with kids what would you think is the most popular number one costume for kids now this is a little bit tough because you've got the girls and the boys and there is some\nYou know a gender specific costumes sure\nSo I'll take this one uh\nI saw a ton of kids dress up as superheroes handing out trick or treat candy this year I'm a mostly for boys there were a couple of girls though and obviously a for the girls I it's always princesses and ferries and things like that I see a lot of those\nYeah I was gonna say I saw a lot of else's from frozen him trying to talk about on us as well er and I saw Spiderman Spiderman was like the number one that I ... yeah and you guys are really\nDoing well the princess is list is number one show about superheroes number two and a ... with all of a sudden Anna's number ten and then the spider man and the Avengers a or on their Spiderman the six Avengers seven uh it's interesting Batman is number three who you know\nIs the only one who's number one for the for the boys but it\nDoesn't say I would assume superheroes that was you know because that list is number two\nI was going to guess uh if\nIt had to be specific like Iron Man I see so many little kids dressed up\nIn their ... yeah I ... surprises me a little bit but I I it's a little bit of data that you know I was surprised with that too now there are still traditional costumes for the kids um which is number five goes this number eight pirate is number nine in so some of these relational ones are still there and I was talking about adults\nToo because I think there are more adult to\nGet into costuming inside especially expensive costume than even the kids do\nYeah I Would argue that um you don't realize it when you're a little kid but Halloween is really an adult holiday and a lot of ways\nYeah such a lot more fun sometimes yeah you get into the\nParties and uh uh you know especially when you become old enough to drink and things like that ... it's it's a ... adults have their fun on Halloween\nAnd but I mean I used to remember when uh you know my wife and I had just been married and we had the other ... young couples friends and some would show costume parties or this was really fun you know when you had to come up with a costume and we didn't have a lot of money I mean I think or at least three years in a row I wore a garbage bag [laughter]\nSometimes I was a garbage bags new diverge grave [laughter] you know okay you tried to be creative with this ... this was tough okay uh so what do you think on adults what's number one\n[noise] oh this is telling you it's tricky because some adult costumes are are not necessarily appropriate to discuss on the air or I'm going to say I'm going to say for adults from for men I really don't know honestly I Know we\nTalked about this earlier but I I think the fruit pass I always say you guys dressed up as a banana for like you mentioned a grape oh yeah something like that\n'cause I think he's getting prepared to wear an energy costs are usually are much better at that on the kids okay All right and for some reason the fruits even food alone did not make off the top ten and they are seeing the adults in some ways are a little more traditional the number one is which\nReally and you know and that's a fairly you know easy one but you know as adults love to get into the make sure All right and so number two is a vampire Lulu may be the men okay and and and you can go as a as a couple of ... and the witch and the vampire right apple or even better\nNumber three is as ... or ... or you know and so you can imagine a zombie or a vampire having a good time together\nAbsolutely you know um when I was a teenager I win has his army and I put on this uh that's like sticky clay makeup and stuff to make it look like your skin was kind of normal yeah and I looked great but removing that stuff was one of the most painful\nExperience in probably wasn't a real good for the health of your skin was that I guess that's one of the things we go through to have a good cause them that's right and\nYou know interesting number four is pirates and again that's kind of a traditional adult costume number eight as ghost but here we come again to a number of fiber ventures a and in one of the ones we didn't mention for instance Batman his number six so we didn't mention incidentally that both were kids and adults\nUh and in one of the ones we didn't mention for instance Batman his number six so we didn't mention incidentally that both were kids and adults Star Wars character a very popular\nAnd ah and then the the ghost is there now surprised me that you know I remember\nFor our kids my wife made she she's a very good seamstress she made a clown costume for kids and all three used it when they were little the clowns not on there but it is on there for adults\nWell with the uh the movie the if you make coming out homes have taken a new uh ... it back in the public eye you could say\nYes and justice creepy as they've ever again right now do you know a clown can be scary so it's it's really interesting the Avengers or on your for the adults so they're really connecting them the same things that kids are in some ways and for adults I think at times it's a chance to be accused again yeah directly\nNow I should there was a third category sure I'm going to guess who the third category is\n[noise] I'm I'm scared to guess to be honest with you John you and I'm\nSenior citizens pets how far is oh oh no All right what is the number one costume\nThat people are by and dressed up for their pet\nI Know what it is for dachshunds\nYeah I was I was only a hotdog carts you've got to what I might have a number to add on gas ... number one uh I'm going to just a like a door because he was like a wizard of Oz like what'd you dress Toto in oh sure\nMaybe not bad but uh it's actually the pumpkin and they make their and it's usually a dog sometimes a cat but is sharing your dog to look like a pumpkin\nNow they also a number three is bumble bee okay I have seen bumble audio wearable yeah number four is devil you notice that is not the or for the uh uh I did to the devil\nA number five is a cat\nAnd therefore they must rest of the dog out to be a cat I get a good sense of humor means number six is a dog [laughter]\nNow that the dog to be a dog I had to be a dog I'm not sure about\nI Can't imagine a Sater site in the world than a cat if I'd forest dressed up as a dog yeah\nI tried to put my cat and a dog cost you ... I ... I Would be over she wouldn't she didn't want her habit yeah number seven to lie in which you know one you know you can dress up to the dog was like a lion Star Wars characters [laughter] you are on this list as you walk out the poor from the new movies like the little birds so yeah yeah oh yeah\n[noise] superheroes or they'll dress up the the dog most often I think it's dogs because they're the only ones who are willing to walk along with you had asked a they have with you I'm outta your yeah uh and then finally a ghost that's it you know that's another easy cost sharing gather\nSo you know people are spending money to grits dress up their kids dress up themselves and dress up their parents and the party for a holiday called Halloween\nI Love it it's good stuff and let's just remind everybody hits nine billion dollars is a race mentoring\nSo don't you know don't complain about paying taxes he can afford it sort of nine billion dollars on Halloween right well\nWe'll get into the political side of that [laughter] and half of our show here um anyway yes we do actually have to take a quick break here we got the weather coming up and a a news break here on nine forty WWW morning magazine we'll be back in just a moment\nFor health care is baby friendly working with the world Health Organization\nAnd UNICEF for health care is one of only a handful of hospitals in Wisconsin that has been designated as maybe friendly there's a focus\nFrom prenatal to earth after ... nurses will provide information about bathing safety and health family members can help out around the house\nComponent to being baby friendly is breast feeding there are several international board certified lactation consultant on that\nThey'll show you the wonder long term health benefits of breastfeeding from child [noise] and for the mother board healthcare and provide some more than it was and their families ... through our nurses support\nPamphlets videos online resources animal\nLeaves visiting board healthcare dot com forward slash baby for health care for him\nWe rate was ready I when I was I", "show_name": "WFAW Morning Magazine", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "30"}
