precision was in El Cornel high tech company and this news business months on October and they're having a ... call it wasn't an open house or\nAn introduction to precision was next Saturday for anyone that's interested\nUh and joining me the director of education and training Susan Hall and also the president or Michael reader we talked a little bit about Foxconn Mike is that how much of an impact do you think it's going to have owned companies like yours\nWell they're protecting over Thirteen thousand employees over\nThe next five years and um [noise] you know there's there's not only a skills kept going on in Wisconsin there's just a flat out body gap and with the expect the retirements over that time period of time I think the the challenges even gonna become greater so uh we're very concerned about what that's going to mean\nA but I also think there's going to be people that will be moving a either end of the state or a you know a driving across the border to ah to pick up the slack and and and fill some of those positions\nYou know I think you're right it's um oh we need to attract those types of people to Wisconsin went on Silicon Valley or we're not\nA you know ... or any of the other night or Seattle with a better known for having companies like this and uh it's yeah it's getting a lot of publicity which in a way I think is is good for prisoners gloves\nI Believe it is very good for us and you know a Foxconn is is working closely with a not only gateway technical college but all of the\nUh advanced education or groups in the in the southeast Wisconsin trying to help develop a pipeline that talent because they're going to need\nYou know from a you know the baseline operators to the most highly skilled you know engineers industrial electrical mechanical or to fill their needs and so I'm going to believe that are probably two thirds of those Thirteen thousand five hundred positions or will be of the\nUh two or four year degree a type and so a gateway is at the front and center that I've liked the conversations with Dr Brian Albrecht\nAbout what they're doing to help advance pipeline and uh some exciting stuff for for all of this year in southeast Wisconsin\nThat's fine that type of worker moves to a particular place it's primarily opportunity there are certainly other reasons but they don't move because the taxes are low or because you know they they got their career oriented they want a good job and they want a future\nOn the statistics are have shown that they expect that the\nAverage W to earnings for these Thirteen thousand five hundred folks will be around fifty three and a half thousand dollars annually\nAnd so that doesn't even get into the benefit side of it so yeah you know these are these are rewarding career opportunities at Foxconn and it's going to make some challenges for a lot of us other manufacturers\nAre trying to compete with that uh we're up to the challenge\nThe Foxconn and that's going to make some challenges for a lot of us other manufacturers of\nTrying to compete with that uh we're up to the challenge we're looking forward to hopefully uh the schools and this is a opportunity that's in front of everyone are elevating the conversation about what manufacturing yesterday\nWill point and Susan you're going to events coming up Saturday that\nWe do we have our manufacturing day uh it's from nine AM to one PM and it's at our facility which is at eight forty ...\n... you know corn Wisconsin are you are able to pre register you wish on manufacturing day dot com website you would also be able to reach me at a precision plus\nAt two six to three to five to five six seven and we are looking forward to having many gas I'm including their families so that they were able to see what

get lists of the the the hardest workers to find every once in awhile the top ten a move for and health care for in a electronics computers or whatever but there's always welders on that list for some reason we just don't have enough welders\n[noise] I I don't know how to weld myself but I've certainly a lot about welding and so yeah a gateway has a heck of a program and the fact that you can get a dual credit or in a high school and\nAh you know technical college credits at the same time as as fast as it was a great thing for the community\nSetting secretly they all want to be artists
