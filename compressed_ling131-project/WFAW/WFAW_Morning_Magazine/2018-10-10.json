Michael clinician my first guest this morning democratic gubernatorial candidate Tony ... good morning Mr Sievers\nMichael how are you today\nWonderful we've got a limited time here so let's get right to in the ... the choice between you and Governor Walker is very clear\nYes yes it is\nA there there's a substantial foundational difference between a Governor Walker if I uh we we are we're focusing on the important issues to the state of Wisconsin whether it's education or\nHealth care of natural resources making sure that I'm sure that are of natural resources are safe and also frankly the issues of a of a\nWave of the economic development are also other people so there are a lot of things out about this time and there was a clear difference between Scott Walker by so\nLet's start with education or you were very unhappy with the way the governor's handled education\nYeah absolutely a first of all he\nWhen he started as a\nPair of scissors that for a big picture of the states or his enemy and a elephant poets are public employees also\nAnd I don't care if you're in the public sector private sector or putting your the people are actually do the work on the line is breaking down your opponent or just makes absolutely no south uh in addition to that it took eight hundred billion dollars out of out of the\nEducation K. through twelve education system is the other couple of hundred dollars at the\nUniversity of Wisconsin system and a theater system has recovered from that store is\nSick or shock of it as a result of the K. through twelve world we've had for a million people vote to increase their own taxes on themselves vocally to represent us and that's that's ... that's a Walker Texas is directly directly related to a public policy\nAnd do those men are more it's not quite as you mentioned conservation there's been a lot of conservation groups have endorsed you\nWell that's right and and I we used to have that kind of support the bottom line is that we were a decided not to have buy in a call or anything it said\nUh we were sold off a lot of our natural resources for the highest better uh we we ate the return of the day was a the department of natural resource actually have scientists working there and providing a service that I went to the people is safe for health\nPolicy makers rate the right to say just I I Want to independence the at our secretary of\nOr we are our next guests are coming up joining us short leap from the orders snorkel museum\nOh we have merrily lead she's the director of the museum we're going to be talking to her about a civil war and governor horn day at the museum this is and and you will about it's coming up Saturday\nSanta for a the a a governor horde of course was a report that concern resident he was the sixteenth governor of Wisconsin\nAnd founder of WD hordes and son publishers of the daily ... Jefferson County union and words daring men one of the fun is publications\nOr for the dairy industry\nOr a generally what\nThe well I'll tell you what merrily who's coming in now I'll let her explain what they're doing to the museum on Saturday Hi good morning how are you wonderful\nWe had a a Tony Uber's on earlier and he was limited and the time you could spend um I've kinda I told everybody is coming up on Saturday but do you really redo the museum\nFor Russia as we do we have this is obviously a very important day for us um it's governor hordes we celebrate governor hordes birthday um and then we've for the past several years have been celebrating and civil war with it as well governor hard was it better than the civil war um and so it seems like a good a good time in\nMy those two things um but generally we celebrate his birthday um but this year is a little different um he passed away in Nineteen Eighteen and November I'm so we are also celebrating his passing or remembering his passing I guess would be them in a better way to phrase that\nUm [noise] so we are I'm going to be decorating the first floor of the Franken while a horde house I'm not the original part of the museum and the old house that's in there um a friend who was the youngest son of WD hoard\nI'm so we will be decorating their house for morning for um for how people in the Victorian era\nI'm dealt with female customs and how they they sort of they had a there was an elaborate ritual around I'm passing and warnings that that makes ... celebrate it so we will be um contain those things together\nYeah there was um it was never and I was talking to someone\nRecently you know I don't remember who it was or I guess was no reason to uh when I was a kid my my home town there were a lot of churches mhm and it was a rather Compaq to city uh\nAnd when someone died the the church that that person went to would ruin their ... and there were occasions when John F. Kennedy was assassinated every for mhm rang a bell ring the bells and I did for days or\nA it's a win of course the John done never son to know for whom the\nBell tolls exactly the tolls for the exactly\nA as a result uh well that's not too many bells around for a while\nRight [laughter] right\nAnd there was a different a different America in many ways\nRight um but that's something that's that's been a universal in in human history though It's MORNING the passing of loved ones and and how have we emotionally dealt with that um and it's you know death is something that comes to all of us no one has figured out how to evade it um\nSo I Am [laughter] other than you and you're not sharing right now [laughter] um but for all of us is something that we have to deal with and and whether it's it's are passing or loved ones passing 'em and so it's you\nAnd varying societies and marrying cultures and even time period it has been dealt with in different ways um for the Victorians and to define the Victorian time period that is the realm of Queen Victoria she came to the throne Eighteen thirty seven and then passed away in the early Nineteen early Nineteen hundreds thing is Nineteen oh\nOne I'm about this particular as an Victoria's rain sorry I'm if I'm wrong [laughter] sorry about that but it was very early Nineteen\nHundreds so for most of the nineteenth century she was on the throne so that that time period I'm kind of becomes called the Victorian but it it's\nNot only that her children her grand right where I Am the ... the other thrown\nExactly they you know they took over the the um Thrones of Europe but um during her rain um that was developed this very\nRitualized ritualized morning and and Mary was stages and steps and she had quite a bit to do with that\nHer husband um Prince Albert passed away in an early age\nI'm and she looked for another twenty five years after he passed away or longer um yeah um [noise] and so but for the rest of her life she wore black just um because she was mourning him and you know there's there's been some questions about maybe your depression and\nFor the rest of her life she wore black just um because she was mourning him and you know there's there's been some questions about maybe your depression and mental stability um because it's rather extreme\nTo go to that really five years yeah yeah it's a little bit much Irish who served a fortune on a wardrobe well just because it was black doesn't mean that wasn't you know fell and all that and like yeah I Would have been some different way exactly exactly I should not wearing ... no no she's living with no\nUm [noise] so um so that she can she sparks that I'm with how she was dealing with his passing and\nUm and dealt with with his loss um so during the Victorian era I'm like I said they were stages of mourning and you'd be in deep It's MORNING and kind of like mental morning and late morning and\nThis is more for women to to to do this and and to me in these varying stages but when I think they would do is decorate their houses um\nTo show that they were a house in the morning so um what will be doing to the Franken well according house is I'm covering the pictures with a black cloth I'm putting black around um\nAround the house we have um in our collection some things from morning um and this is him oh you are and not now am ... um [noise]\nAnd um you know paper with black um ribbon around that are black tracing I'm a handkerchief slack lace\nI'm just ... those were the morning items that people would use during while they were in one of these phases of morning so um it's it's a fascinating kind of part of American history and it seems like a a chance to talk about those things um and talking about governor hearts passing being from Nineteen Eighteen\nRight [noise] yeah it was the civil war is still a very big part of America of it's\nA bar history of we are still dealing with its aftermath in some ways\nUh we had the bicentennial of the civil war right ah twenty eleven to twenty fifth inning and the bus to dozens of books came out hundreds same bed hungry during that time period of time period\nOr above Lincoln and the bones of civil war and very good ones too I talked to many of the the authors so you'd think you you'd Renault\nRight [laughter] and no one has no no I'm In it's fascinating and um you know like I said I'm early governor hard was a veteran of the civil war he actually served in in Wisconsin unit and in New York unit um during um during his um service and\nUm we are very glad to have um the second Wisconsin volunteer infantry and join us for this um for for governor whore day on Saturday um they have come to the past several years um and are there to talk about what life was like for the average civil war soldier\nUm and how they dealt with things um\nAnd just kind of why what it meant to me a civil war soldier\nUm and then we're all so excited that at two o'clock on Saturday\nUm we'll have to um to men who portray surgeons in this unit will be talking about civil war medicine with equipment with equipment um and I would recommend if they ask for volunteers don't raise your hand on the money [laughter] [laughter] um [laughter]\nBut you all like even the ...\nYou know or lack of [laughter] but um they do a wonderful job of explaining surgical technique and have obviously spent years studying um how how surgeons you in the civil war dealt with this because\nI'm ... surgery and the civil war is nothing like what we have today\nNo I don't know if that wasn't bad enough they didn't have even the\nUh the meager supplies that the medical people were equipped with right the right it was a a it was horrible I I Believe as many troops died of 'em\nAre just some ... as they did in the ... on the bill you know it was a it was pretty sad um civil war was the uh the the\nFirst time in modern weapons were used to write a they had a gambling on the news much use they annoy earned clad uh ship only a couple mhm um they had an air force there were balloons right but they were in the air but nobody else would ever do the right ah\nYou know yeah it was a tough so yeah actually I was a\nA ... with this we can do better with very right and it was when he was ... really are just a paradigm shift of nobody would do it until all of a sudden a couple try to ah write prospered right very quickly every everybody when it was very\nYeah and there were there are some issues like you said with the the paradigm shift I'm number one dairy was seen as women's work you know it was a ...\nYes there's traditionally a woman's job um it was a tough women at all [laughter] you bet they did [laughter] well they they would know the ... and they would um or your one or two one or two maybe a few more um um but that was women's work and they would would\nUm you separate the cream and make the butter and write and do all those things so for the men they're like well you know that's where that's one of his work I don't want to do that um and even though hoard and other men were saying no you can do it and you can make money off of it if you\nAsk me how to make for ... weeks right right and we had one crop of ... right\nRight and there are a little more forgiving when the weather's not cooperative ...\nThen you wait which is has a very specific growing season and pattern\n'em when they do better in cold weather they don't mind that too yeah\nI'm so I'm\nSo that that helped and then I you can in the idea too that people traditionally just had like you said one or two house just for home dairy consumption but we also see the development of urban areas where people are living more in towns even you and this is we're talking late Eighteen hundreds 'em\nAnd they're not keeping one or two houses so they they need to have you have access to dairy products and so it you're starting to create a market for for the guy that\nWas a time when people living in major cities are very though and\nRight or the ...\nLegend has it ...\nBecause of doctors but that's I think it's just a legend ...\nAlready ready to write but uh you know but of course right with um but yeah I'm the only served\nOne term me had I don't remember the exact details from the book but it was had to do with the English only\nYes they've been at law I'm governor hoard was in favor of the Bennett law I'm\nWhich would have required public schools to teach in English only um and why he ran into was the German population and the right to vote on it but then there were a lot of young I'm that wanted their children to learn and German as well\nAnd so they rallied um behind governor hordes opponents and that's why he only had one term but what I find fascinating is when you read governor hordes words on on his beliefs in a in the band that law\nIt was not that the German students couldn't learn and German so is that they needed to learn that at home or elsewhere it all the schools\nThey needed to learn English to be able to sister thrive in an English\nBase yeah right I agree ... does asking for and he thought it was for the better of the of the ... right\nHe he shares um you know his writings many stories of uh immigrants were learning English but ... hadn't weren't fluent yet\nI'm being swindled out of usually money Orlando because they um signed something or said something or um there was a miscommunication and ending in English that they couldn't follow\n'em so he he was just proposing in ... and encouraging people to at least know English ... and what I find\nFascinating is that many of the same um argument discussions we're having today I'm with more recent immigrant groups um [noise] that it's\nYou know the the groups have changed but the conversations still hasn't so I don't that's interesting\nIt is but uh yeah I think he would have been reelected most of the civil war those a lot of very interesting was close to the stores\nI have um Arthur MacArthur ... of it is it's not a commonly known a\nCivil war stories the benefit of our listeners\nHe was Eighteen years old as I Believe his father was a judge I Believe so they came from Scotland stop by thinking most chooses to Wisconsin and that's as his father being a judge you think is how we got to be a lieutenant mhm in the civil war\nA if you're the first was guns but I Do remember I don't remember off hand but the battle of a missionary ridge um they were in ... he was trying to turn them around the uh the soldier carrying the flag was his was the only picked up the flag and yield\nBond Wisconsin which you can still hear it all [laughter] during the time to go to a medal of honor for doing so the sun is much better known mhm Douglas ... who claimed he was a Wisconsin resident in the Nineteen forty eight presidential cabinet but mhm he wasn't\n[laughter] but uh that's where his heart was here\nWho is a is father state of the army as a was all over the mostly the western ... uh but there's so many little ... mhm the boat was ...\nAnd it's why we're we're excited to\nUm have civil war and governor hard day to to be able to share some of those um civil war stories and then governor hoard story as well so again it's a Saturday um October thirteenth from tend to for 'em and we have a schedule of events so at ten am I'm I'll be giving a presentation on the wars of WD hoard\nUm he obviously was in the civil war\nBut then lived through World War one so discussing\nHow he viewed the various wars\nI'm One of the um [noise] the best parts of him being a newspaper editor is we have all of his editorials um based on various wars um that we can can pull from um to see what his opinion was of a various wars um then I eleven AM we are this is\nOnly in a museum do you get to say things like that we're very excited to 'em so uh to have 'em Steven person come and discuss the Victorian morning practices um Mr person is a retired undertaker

well so he um\nA docent at black point a state where he provides a program there I'm On the how Victorians mourned and I'm I'm not exactly certain while he's ...\nState where he provides this program there I'm On the how Victorians mourned\nAnd I'm I'm not exactly certain while he's bringing with him but he said he needs quite a bit of time to set up his casket um so it will be\nI'm going to be a fascinating program I Hope people can come and again that's an eleven then at one in three um whether cooperating cooperating um a lot of visitors will be able to drill and with our civil war
