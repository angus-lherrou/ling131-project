I basically work it out for like a twenty hour work week and I multiply that by the hour earlier it so IT consulting so uh you know I can have worked for three weeks and then I can be a no work for you know months on end\nYeah but you're going to make three hundred K. that's pretty clear correct\nWell I mean even if I get plenty of how many hours a week\nOkay got it on the earth All right but is there some question as\nTo whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week\n... ... ... ... that's pretty moderate um kept I I've spoken with some of the other people that work in the position I mean I'm man they they say the thoughts about average um yeah OK yet but they have some months for they they get a paycheck and\nYeah but ... this is a no brainer because you're completely debt free you've already gone all the way through baby steps of and you have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape to take this opportunity and here's the other thing you've probably planned for it what is your three to six month emergency fund look like how big is\nThat the same problem\nYeah I mean juice out a little bit how long would it take you to get that up to thirty or fifty\nYou know a biker position yeah or just in this new position because you're in such good because you're such good shape you know just taking a new position you can stack up some money and take\nYou know my point is is let's say you get into this new role which you really want to take and I'm telling you to take it but let's say you're feeling that the first three months live on way less you already can anyway so the new job is actually going to allow you to maybe put six months away\nSo you got no risk at all 'cause you can jump back in the cyber security I think it's a no brainer I think you're over thinking it because it's not the forty hour week buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where you can take a job like this you don't have to work forty hours a week\nOkay you got me yeah\nSo I may be uh celebrate tonight my goodness don't overseeing this I mean half of half of the eyes is going to love to be or Cody that right now [laughter]\nI mean buddy this is the kind of smart risk you know because you put yourself in a great financial situation to be able to go after this is really hardly any risk at all um\nRisk you know because you put yourself in a great financial situation to be able to go after this there's really hardly any risk at all um man and and here's the deal you're saying that you all you have to do is get twenty hours a week\nAnd that would put your three hundred K. if you only do ten you're still going to be making about the same it's not even a little bit more of course you have to make them more so again go go go\nOh that is fun stuff triple eight eight to five five two to five just as a career seem out on the day Ramsey show I'm Ken Coleman city

doing that in in places that it is happening so here you're next steps\nAfter you talk to your buddy and see how strong connection is\nThe next thing you want to do is I'd like to see you come up with a a bigger list even if it's three or four local production companies or or companies that are in this space okay because you know where to look in your area so look and ideally I'd like to see a list of three or four companies that you least circle and say I need to learn more about those companies\nI Need to get in proximity now the other thing I Want you to do is I Want you to start talking to your buddy other people acquaintances or who dabble or work full time in this space and I think you could probably come up with a list of those people as well\nAnd so you need to take 'em out to lunch or take 'em to coffee and you say hey listen this is the ... this is a place I Want to be in\nAnd so I'm here to pick your brain into areas number one what was your past\nWhat are some areas that I could get better and where can I grow but what do I need to learn who else do I need to ... do you have any relationships you know of any open jobs this is a very simple conversation it's going to yield something positive\nAnd so this is proximity and then even if there's not a fulltime job available ... and this is the this is the part that I Want people to get that are in your similar situation\nLet's say you do all of that and there's not a position that is right for you at the time\nIt doesn't mean you throw your hands in the air and take your ball and go home what it means is\nYou say All right I'm going to practice proximity in a in a non paid situation so I'm going to go volunteer or or I'm going to say ... shadow you for a day I'm going to get in places where some type of audio video production is happening and when you get in those places you will continue to meet new people\nAnd those new people will help you get in the right places are going to open up doors
