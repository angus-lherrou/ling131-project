watch three\nAbsolutely now I loved the photo that you have on your watch and I learned this accidentally bad live photos if you have a an iPhone you don't want to live for two reasons like little mini video that takes a little bit before in a little after when you actually take your photo\nThey actually work on the apple watch so every time I go to look at what time it is I get a little live photo my daughter and\nI had a bunch of photos on there but hers is so cute I Believe that the rest so don't tell her I said okay so you do this and to watch ... only weighs listening yes if you go to the custom photo\nOn the watch out and then you can just add to your gallery you can create a photo that any ... put in that I mean you can create a folder\nThat if any voters put in there to automatically goes to it but it's easy to just pick up on the one that's awesome yeah ... and if you have a you know a hundred different photos it'll just like I was going to just ask you that that's awesome it'll change every time you twist your rich rich you see what\nI'm going to try that 'cause on I have the apple watch for I mean you have to three feet or other such a peasant [laughter] I've been using the fire one\nYeah I Know you want to personalize the pictures of your family I Am going to do that so uh Roger called up he's a new job yes and I have as many calls start with I got an email [laughter] you got an email from someone saying that they know he's been an adult website and to prove it\nThey told him the passport he you owe when he was on those adult and the password was correct correct and if he doesn't give them seven thousand dollar they are going to send everyone in his contacts list\nThe movie he was watching in a video of him were watching that movie\nThat's just nasty now he says he's not too worried because of the time that he had that password the computer he had had no camera so unless they were outside filming and they're not going to have a video of him but he still wants to know what the heck is he\nOkay so you know this is this is really common is more common than you might take because I've noticed that as I've been going through my you know I read every email from a listener I noticed that as I've been going through the email is that that seems to be ... oh yeah it's crazy stuff [noise]\nAll right so Roger you're not overly concerned about it but seven thousand dollars in a sex extortion scam is crazy isn't it\nYeah that that's one life word for it [laughter] All right and this was a how long ago was this\nWell I used the cars for probably seven or eight years ago\nAnd then have you you know it is\nNot very often because you know passwords had become more difficult where you add numbers and symbols and everything and this didn't have any of that so it was an older parents work but I used it for everything so I don't know if they actually got it up adult website or if they ... the\nOther company or something right and just said it was often adult website but they do it what what are the things\nThat you can do is that there's a website have I been pond TWA ... and you can type in your email address and it will tell you\nWhether or not the hackers have gotten a any password associated with that email address\nBut you gave a couple of clue as to what you said like you know you use that password on the same password on a lot of different sites which you know quite frankly don't feel like a dummy 'cause a lot of people did until we realized that that was probably not the best idea okay\nI I work for them and you are still using up has heard that that if I were with you I Would just like you know slap you right across the face for doing that because\nYou need to stop using a password okay now what ... what's happening in is that these uh hackers are getting hold a user names and passwords and then they are crafting these emails and in a\nClassic sex extortion scam\nOr you don't want to pay them they really won't go much further than this they may send you another email but don't feel beholden to actually give them any side with bitcoins\nBut just for safety I Would go ahead and make sure that I'd change any passwords they actually use this particular password\nI and make sure that your systems free of malware and all that other good stuff you know you definitely don't want to pay him because if you do pay them what's the guarantee gay and you've already said that computer had no Web cam so let's just move on and be done with it [noise]\nSo I took a picture and send it off through the app and then I made like seven bucks my foot that's not bad I mean I'm already here anyway right and so\nYou know so the way that they have sort of legitimate apps is that you don't have to worry about malware and viruses but I always caution people that some of these they don't actually give you cash that they may give you like an Amazon dot com\nGift card or a gift card to Starbucks um there's also other ones like one called folk\n... pie that you could take a picture of anything and then they submitted to the various um agencies and so you may get a couple of bucks that way there's a Moby and we want you to go to a particular business and then take a survey about the business\nUh there's field agent which is just like TaskRabbit their diet bet if you want to lose a couple of pounds right\nOr you can place a bet that you're going to be and you participate in this you gotta weigh yourself and all that other stuff\nAnd but the average take home for a month is like sixty bucks their sweat calling for every thousand steps you can get a point nine five sweat coin that will be translate into like an apple gift card their surveys on the go there's just a whole bunch of 'em but\nUm they these are the ones that I mentioned are legitimate there's probably some some that are not legitimate\nBut what I can do is direct you to the list of legitimate moneymaking apps over my website to that help you out\nSome of the country you live\nOh it does and then when you and like most people nobody reads the terms and conditions on any of this stuff so I post a link to it over
