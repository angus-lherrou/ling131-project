to do something you have to be committed to do it and and you have to see beyond your current situation you have to see what you want to be more than you see where you are ... so once you can see beyond that then you can start to dream\nA and and there's many times where we actually drove through neighborhoods and looked at the nice houses and say you know when we do this right we can go pick a house and we can do that ... ... you know what we want to do it right\nYou know I thought about that sharing and I used to do that we would go drive the rich neighborhood and then go you know someday we could do that and here's all we got that we've got to do this and this and then we can get there\nAnd it wasn't like oh we'll never get their roll our eyes or those bigger people rich people was more like I'm going to be one of you ... have you know and that's what you do when you drive the number of them all live here and I said earlier than that one you know just as bad you know
