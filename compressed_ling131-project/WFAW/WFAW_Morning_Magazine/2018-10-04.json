D. dot org and then click on referendum so you can get all sorts of questions answer for that\nSo we just hope to encourage people to vote yes on November ... out for this really important a referendum to maintain maintain our current wonderful programs that we offer through the schools\nSchool district is out there who are willing to be with anybody\nToday are out there doing a great job of getting the word out\nYeah so it's a the information is there and people are asking which is good yes the more they know they're more likely yeah seems they are to vote yes yep that's the that's the hope\nYeah All right um it's\nGood schools and ... as we were talking earlier it's proven they are no good for the community that pays back when you have good schools and any number of ways uh but uh the uh the ... you you got that means\nI don't think we have that just\nWas curious I Know you get signs up saying no we're fine [laughter] [noise] that's here they make nice badges I've seen ...\nThere's a lot of ... good I don't know when they have a referendum they get together\nMichael you want to be on our on our whitewater yes group known [laughter]\n\nThat's a good idea and I ride a good idea [laughter] yeah it is and\nI are solidly behind you on this um it it's it's it's just like I say it's it's there's no argument against it that's really I mean what what are they asking for a ... put a lounge\nIn the snow was no no no no they're not they're mostly it's just maintaining the level of education they of\nYup maintaining class size is um ... current school program students support in mental health services coke curricular programs technology safety all these things we just need to maintain these and keep our school strong\nAnd unfortunately all virtually all small school districts in around the Fort Atkinson area here are in the same predicament whitewater is you know so I'm going to have referendum ... right yeah they they have to you know they have to\nThey want to maintain the the schools that they have and that's the only way to do with the they're not getting money from the state money back you might say for the state does their tax money in the ...\nRight yeah unfortunately the state legislature passed the state revenue a number of years ago and it's never been revisited for some reason you know probably as political I suppose but uh\nEducation seems to be to it shouldn't be political it should be above the kids in our state needing that foundation\nFor the future they're they're the ones that are going to be a supporting those of us who are uh you know like my hair is turning gray unfortunately\n[laughter] actually in some ways you're lucky [laughter]\nYeah no it's a this is necessary for a community and are you another thing about where we live here these surrounding towns they understand mhm uh they want a good education for their children are\nAnd it frankly they're not asking a lot in this you did you mentioned those numbers on the air or we just shouting earlier\nNo I did mention those yeah it's not a lot of money yeah thirty dollars for every hundred thousand a value or\nIn the second year the first year there's no ... no ranch royals only the second third and\nFourth year of the referendum is that thirty dollars for every hundred thousand\nSo it's a it's not a stepped\nIncrease it's just a thirty dollar flat increase\n[noise] and I have to say people that don't have children in the district are supportive of this referendum because right now more native right seniors a lot of seniors and whitewater very supportive of the referendum it's a great great community good sort of little work to make a\nGood community they do to go hand in and everybody knows yep or they should yeah you're on the events going up the informational things or just going to go out and knock on people's though\nWe're going to knock 'em we keep updated information on our Facebook page some people can like that um people like I said people are welcome to get a yard sign and then this Ron said the other day I get to and get one to your neighbor I mean ask permission first but [laughter]\nLandscape are are just some natural settings um I like to think that when everything is crazy um you can look at the painting and jump in and relax\nOK [laughter] we all need a break these days are more so in all the time a good idea how many pieces are you going to\nI have twenty five okay show excellent Tom ah which one's yours\nMine is in the lower left and it's a sea scape landscape peace so my general focus is\nTo him and that's a new painting for this year old so then I have it All right\nUh other than on the card their uh with my ... my focus is to try and capture a moment in time so I Try to do that and and sometimes they're landscape sometimes or\nSituations involving wildlife for animals or sometimes a occasion or their floral pieces but I Try to capture a moment in time uh that I have seen and and the record either as water color oil or cruel or\nThe beans Sylvia what's wrong that's surfer\nHis mind your the big go on and here I guess All right okay I was wondering if you\nOr who's that was that was the would be one of the gun with a\n... and the reason for that is that\nUm I I think I played with art more than these two gentlemen do they both have their style and their media and they know what they're doing I'm the one who does art in order to maintain my sanity and have fun\nAnd so I keep trying new I'm a new medium maybe acrylic pours maybe alcohol ... maybe water color\nAnd this surfer was one that was the first one I tried with on a new technique where you don't even use the brush you pour the paint onto the canvas and then you can send you blow on it and things like that and it happened\nIn who made this picture that way yes yes no brush ever touched the canvas\nUm Jackson Pollock never did anything like that [laughter] yes well I never saw the painting from a Jackson Pollock got for his either as well [laughter] nobody's off or do anything in the seven figures not not yet not yet at the show alive figure that will happen while I was young I think\nIf they knew how you'd that has to be up to ...\n[laughter] well you know after I had poured the paint on and everything and tip didn't blowing on it and all that looked like waves I hadn't intended it to be necessarily that but then it needed a surfer so all that\nSo you had no idea what was going to be you know if you know well let's see what I got here that's right yes while he needs to a gentleman plan their paintings and do a beautiful job for just about everybody kind of plans or painting or Joe the first one I've ever heard of that did it this way yes well that's probably true [laughter]\n... it looks like a beautiful picture through to see a close up\nBut thank you thank you uh it's hard to imagine doing is\nThat like I have a lot of fun with that um I've I've after I had so much fun with that one I did five more by the same technique and they all turn out very very different\nFrom sure [noise] yeah so is this are the uh recent a development for you\nKnow yes yes well so you probably do it another way at some point as well oh very prominently yes [noise] yes good grief [laughter] wow\nIt really is amazing\nOr the other artists or tell us about\nThe other artists in our group ... or have their very styles and techniques as well and that's one of the things that's good about our group is each of us has her own individualize focus so when we bring a show together like this [noise]\nUh it puts out quite a nice array of work for the viewing public to see not only in subject matter but in technique in mediums so we run across the realm of\nSome of the things that you've heard Sylvia speak of a two water color to acrylic to oil to graphite to mix media\nA and any subject matter is they're from the human form subject matter to landscapes to wildlife to animals to florals\nOr so it it makes it nice show and that's one of the things we strive to do is to put something together that the viewing public can enjoy from all those different perspectives\nA lot of trees were a lot of water\nA lot of trees lots of water a lot of animals cello florals\nYeah we've got 'em and uh how often do you get together\nAs we meet a on a schedule monthly basis and then our meetings are to come together and then they have a little lunch and camaraderie together and then we move on to the business section of our meeting and then from there\nWe go into our positive critique section or where we have a discussion about each other's work\nThan someone who may have a painting that's a work in progress in there at a point they're not sure their next steps to bring it and say here's where I Am what am I what I feel what thoughts do you have or will have a completed painting and and they asked the group to give us some input\nAnd so we do that for one another or we also discuss\nHappenings in the artist world or is it south or at large various trends in patterns that are going on what's happening with other artists what are the latest things the latest techniques as Sylvia spoke to there with her\nUh in in an alcohol technique so we look at everything out there that we can see to help us continue to advance and grow as individual artist and as a group\nInteresting and you've been around for many years no Seventy seven years at this point you know it's apparently working for everybody\nAnd we've had a a couple of member changes during that time ah we're currently at a A R agreed top limit of eight members and uh that's working quite nicely for us 'cause all eight of us have our own approach so there are no\nTop limit of eight members and uh that's working quite nicely for us 'cause all eight of us have our own approach so there are no to us that go down the same artistic road you might say we're all in their individual\nPlaces and there's this show itself is pretty much open as far as the goes\nYes and that was the idea that we try to do in selecting a show we start with a green upon a theme and the theme of transitions seem to apply to us because if you think about how art starts idea and artist mine and the desire to take that forward\nSo from the artist idea in their mind to finish piece of art that is a transition [laughter] so it fit from that standpoint and yet it left is open to pursue various things that we may want to paint\nYou need to take a break for everyone can\nHang on a minute here you're listening
