Wagner the morning\nAnd a than a year since you've been on what's happening\n[noise] well a lot has happened to prior youth justice team we've uh\nImplemented a new model it's called functional family case management\nInstead of working strictly with the juvenile they use that identified we work with the entire family trying to break down barriers to help them get what they need so that they can get back up and running and be a functional family\nTalk about what you do that's a very ... oh wow there's a lot\nYeah so you work with youth we work with um yeah uh teenagers who is probably the best way to describe it sometimes pre teens and now not past Eighteen because then they go into the adult world or they're adults and they move on with their life [noise]\nUm [noise] helped me out to them all what do we really want kids come from\nWell in Jefferson County they're all up obviously our kids in our county but they come from school referrals um primarily schools are police contacts okay and then the referrals come to Jefferson County are intact department and then they're process through\nEither we screen them enter screen than out scream them screen them out um it and then that process they go through the court system and then once that's done and they go to what's called the disposition order where the judge has these are the things you have to do then that's where the mall and I and our team get on board\nOkay how many uh teams do you deal with yourself at one time\nWell right now I have a pending cases with in those ten cases there might be several\nI'm OK cases and the person that's right\n'cause that's the new model will go into school instead of just are dealing with the youth that we've got to reform the referral from we do with the whole family so we have family meetings um so do you and as well as the parents who could be grandparents who could be aunts uncles little siblings older siblings I'm\nNumbers that will verified that uh\nYeah and I think that's why it's important for all of us to pull together as a community what community you live in that you know if you're invested in your community and its success in its future um it's a step in and step up give someone a hand up\nWe're all really the same just kind of fight in the same battle at a different time or a different level\nAnd those who are uh more fortunate which I think we have a really nice communities within our county um they do they do step up so raising awareness about these kinds of things these kids are not bad kids\nThey are traumatized kids coming from families with them concerns of where am I going to go tonight what am I going to eat\nWhere am I going to get some money and those those things\nYou take a break you're listening to morning magazine this is Michael but it's my first guest a on youth justice awareness month\nFrom Jefferson County or do you ever seen Tony juvenile justice case managers Rebecca Brown in your mouth Wagner\nLooking at a cloudy day today with a high of only forty two degrees westerly wins eight to Fifteen miles an hour down at thirty three tonight\nClear skies and on Saturday cloudy with a high of all the way up to fifty one degrees thirty six degrees right now at W.

October is youth justice awareness month and I'm speaking to a couple of Jefferson County juvenile case managers Rebecca Brown and Jamal Wagner Jamal we're going to you or\nYes sir um [noise] I just wanted to kind of um\n[noise] talk a little bit about the incentive based program that we started um so like Rebecca was saying earlier we've gone to a family functional case management a model which I said again is\nTo really try to um identify what's what's that family needs in order for them succeed and one way of doing that is um an incentive program called live school [noise] um it was used in schools\nI'm kind of on a periods of period basis to give kids points for good behavior and stuff like that so we thought we take that from school and kind of use it in our our work [noise] so what it is\nPeriods of period basis to give kids points for good behavior and stuff like that so we thought we take that from school and kind of use it in our our work [noise] so what it is is uh we kinda give kids\nYou know maybe or or families two to three kind of target behaviors\nUm that we would like them to work on and every time we see success in that whether it be daily or weekly we give them points to his live school system um\nAnd we know we have the whole family in there and if you know a teenager goes to school and gets all the classes are her classes without getting in trouble you know we're in contact with schools to see how their behavior as we can give them points for that\nAnd when you know we give them certain goals so when they reach a certain amount of points to able to get whether it'd be a gift card or whether it be\nYou know um movie tickets so they could do something as a family whether it be um you know we get a lot of donations and stuff like that whether little brother a little sister or that you may need some sneakers or donate or jacket or any kind of clothing or something like that so we kind of give them something to you know look forward to cause a lot of these\nKids in these families don't really have something to work for their just working to get by every day so we can provide something for them to kind of\nKnow what if we all have a good week this week we're able to go to the movies together which they may not be able to afford which fortunately we have some you know a community partners are willing to donate something so I wasn't really work with us and trying to make something\nGood happens for these families when they might be struggling so live schools really been a big part of what we're doing at the family functional case management\nSide of things um and we've seen a lot of progress through that\nSo we want to catch them being good as a matter of cleansing them for bad behavior correct\nWell living to exist ... we need more everyone things I mean that's good\nYeah absolutely you you'll be you know it's just like everybody that gets up he goes to work every day you know you you do it because you love what you're doing but at the same time you want that paycheck at the end the two weeks or we can you know so that's kind of\nWhat we want them to look forward to to understand like the basic things that they may be struggling with that they could really work on it as a family unit you know they can get something for that and I think that's really done a really\nI think it's really positive for families to focus in on the negative\nAgreed you got something that I Do yeah\nOh yeah [laughter] I'm totally got into what Jamal with sand and lost my train of thought [laughter] so it's just a a summary of what our functional\nFamily case management is and it's about being respectful to individuals their cultures their their family\nWhat they want I'm\nJamal has introduced me to some of his family foods and we in Wisconsin have introduced him to some Wisconsin food just you know [laughter] and\nAnd I didn't like Bryant whereas I Love it if you're somebody like that but yeah it's something I hadn't been introduced to in a in a lovely state of Wisconsin I'm really glad that you guys are really big into ... yeah yeah apple is I didn't care for the lunar surface [laughter] yeah\nYeah uh and our our program is strength based so what we were just talking about his catch them being good offer them incentives um built on the strengths they already have because they do have strengths\nIf they're able to survive there the way they're living yeah they have risen resilience\nThey ... as an excellent work yeah and let them in the back of everybody's that says resilient [laughter] right our shirts say real resiliency I think I didn't even see you're right that on there [laughter] no I don't know\nI Know so um that our program in a nutshell we're happy to start it we have eight case managers um we we do rely on each other is that more than ... uh we had six okay so now we've added two more okay you're mowing Dominic or added a in the land of\nLiberty were even allowed to do that with budgets being cut them\n[noise] yes absolutely yes and we did receive a grant that um our supervisor and one of our other coworkers worked hard to get and the grant is then a phenomenal you know that's when it's giving us the tools we need your help our families be successful\nOthers understand the importance of what it is that you're doing\nIn our agency they certainly do and I think our community partners are becoming more aware and more\nA willing like what can we do to help you\nKnow well it's you know it makes for a better community\nAgree we are all affected by kids that don't have what they need ... to live\nUm we are ... ... you know we're really fortunate to have 'em\nIntellectuals and thinkers that do things like this at the university and I'm a doctor which on guy has um his own
