we hadn't you do like the difference between a New York accent and a Boston accent yeah right yeah that's true\nCan you give us an example again what are you doing that you want me to actually do the accent I don't want to do with all the accent because the other one that doesn't come out of my mouth so nice it makes me feel bad about myself when I Do it but this one this was fine okay so that's New York and then if you had to say or something with the Boston accent well I mean a lot of people do the basic the ... this hurts\nMy body ... I Can't say that you're actually getting shorter but now I [laughter] I feel terrible\nMelting now his reign thing in the floor it's crazy watch good Will Hunting do a lot of those there do you watch that movie do you hate that movie you know I liked that movie you can get beyond it I just pretended set in New York [laughter]\n... I I rarely watch Jimmy Kimmel okay but I was sent a montage they did last night of different newscasters around the country attempting Boston accents yeah this is bad [laughter]\nIs this something David from your ears and news is this just in the news handbook you gotta have happy chat between the anchors well it's uncomfortable and you have to do accents you\nDo yeah and I've yeah I've seen it before even in even in Texas when you have people who are well foreigners meaning people who are not from Texas who are reading local news and they try to do the you know\nThey try to say y'all they try to do all the exit slang whenever the cowboys are doing well luckily that didn't happen all that often so they don't yeah it's always embarrassing and bad and I don't know why they do it\nAnd the Dodgers will take on the red Sox first on their ... their boss that's\nOften the race rather than ...\n\n... this is where this shown each video look at Craig college so I mean this is like pain waiting\nAnd waiting to see the green monster close\nHard so far are you down with everything that's being talked about\nI it just sounds like they're honestly they're talking over each other so much I Can't really understand who's take is what I'm just looking at it as they're having a conversation about it and it seems reasonable but at this\nAt this part of the Megan Kelly say that when she was a kid it was okay to dress up like a black person yeah I mean because you got to get a little more specific than that you can't go I I don't know if her in her lifetime and she's older than I Am but I don't know if there was a time in her life where you can just dress up as a black person for Halloween [noise]\nUm if it's a character ... you know I remember once at middle school maybe maybe it was early in high school um group of guys that I knew well a buddy of mine dress up as a sugar hill gang mhm and that was part of it they they had faces painted black ...\nThe sugar hill gang was their favorite band you know it\nOf course you wouldn't do it now because you would no no that's not something we could do ... right but at the time I get what she's saying where when I was a kid it was okay I mean you're not making fun of any one year like dressing as right person for Halloween is what she's saying\nThat's right and there are places in New York with ... as she is Diana Ross and she made her scandal darker than it really is and people say that that would raise this era for one\nI don't know how like that that raises that how can I add a painter but I really wanted to look like ... like on ... [laughter]\nSee that\nCommon funny that's okay right [laughter] but saying that if you start getting your skin a little bit to look like Diana Ross I think making Kelly saying when did that become racist that any part of that sound like yes I'm defending blackface\nYeah that the the headline is a little misleading there I think you can have a I think you can have an open and honest debate about whether or not it's okay to dress up\nYou know to pay your face black right for Halloween or did you ever see in your skin color or you can have that conversation but she didn't say yeah you know what let's just go back to the days of blackface in metro shows I I didn't hear that in that conversation\nBut that's just the way it was taken and she came out she apologize yeah she did and the today show even they covered their own story\nOh they did well they had uh our ochre and Greg Melvin both of them obviously black yeah a kind of going off on Megan gal oh\nYeah he does have bigger apology to\nThe country because this is a history going back to the Teamsters minstrel shows to me and denigrate uh\nA race wasn't right but I I I'm old enough to live to Amos and Andy\nWhere he had white people in black safe flying to black characters and it was just a magnifying the worst scenario tax about blacks and that's what's the big problem is that there are ways I'm sort of thing and\nSo again man at the beginning she said you you know if you're white but on black face not acceptable if you're black put on white face not acceptable right in saying that but then she puts it down to dressing as someone for Halloween right you know that's not what Roque are saying there\nHe he he\nExpanded on it to something that in my opinion making Kelly never said and get this is what we're all supposed to be able to do right to sit down and have a conversation\nBut I mean I guess I guess ... also be why could not be a good explanation as to why people are offended by Megan Kelly 'cause they heard that even though that may not be her intent but what they hear is somebody defending quote unquote black face it to me it was like asking\nThe question ... you know it was just it was over done you know I she apologized 'em all down for that you know ... I don't think are intent was to hurt anybody um but it goes on to okay so as far as kids go because this is where the whole bit started\nKen a kid\nThat dress as another race for Halloween you brought up by plant there\nYeah I it was the question because there was last year there was a big dust up over wanna like whether or not kids could wear that white kids could wear that\nI think we wind up way over thinking Halloween costumes 'cause it's one day out of the year and who really cares in the end\nOf the family a lot of people I Know I'm just one of those things that to me every time I see this controversy go up I just got to roll my eyes now look I I get it if there is a you know every once in a while you'll see a fraternity or sorority doing like Mexican themed\nParties right do paint their ... and this isn't like this is a character I liked that I'm emulating it's just ongoing stereotypical Mexican guy writes yeah don't do that there is a big difference between those two but I did ask the question is it okay for a white guy a for a white kid\nWho loved the movie Black Panther to go for Halloween as Black Panther\nYeah and so then if you think that is offensive then then it's also offensive or a black kid to go as Iron Man\nI mean where are the ... where are the rules and where are the lines drawn now we and we can't even have the conversation now look if you're going to tell me that I can never darken my skin I'm not going to that's not the hill I'm going to fight and die on I don't um you out and have it in with that\nYou haven't had a daughter that wants to address is ... that's true I Am not does he pulled the costumes a couple of years ago I remember now today the actress who played ... says listen it's the spirit of love and for Disney is it a little ones who just want to dress up as their favorite character I'm all for it\nYes I support you\nWell and even before it even them on a a controversy if I remember right it wasn't even about you know putting on makeup it was just about wearing the outfit from the movie\nAnd now that was cultural appropriation and that was terrible and stuff which that's ridiculous their kids let kids the kids\nSo they can do that it's not offensive ... did they like the the bronze or tanning stuff on the faces that do much I\nGuess that's where you started getting to the danger zone\n\nThat's when reasonable people look at it and said this is ridiculous now completely separate story but\nIt's somewhat related yeah school is canceled a Latin\nUh this is in Baltimore County uh canceled a production of Aladdin junior at an elementary school because of the offensive to Arab culture apparently\nTown elementary school was going to do this play based on the Nineteen Ninety to Disney film one kid and this is what piqued my interest 'cause they had a kid in elementary school kid got upset about it and I'm like I Want to hear what he has to say if a kid\nDisney film one kid and this is what piqued my interest 'cause they had a kid in elementary school kid got upset about it and I'm like I Want to hear what he has to say if a kid is maybe there is something to this his mom a dead at the guardian mask talk to W.

this story about the pipe bombs that were sent\nTo well who knows how many we all about CNN the Clintons Obama's a Wasserman Schultz sheer and\nApparently the New York governor and former attorney general Eric Holder a among others who have gotten the sin of course you've seen a lot of leaders come out on both sides of the aisle saying no this is unacceptable because of course it is it I mean it's laughable that you don't even have to specify that today\nI guess the division of so much and I guess that's just stock that's one of the things that you just have\nTo say right and so fortunately nothing got through\nThese were screened uh the one to CNN was going to former CIA director John Brennan who of course has been at the center and a lot of controversy so um yeah I mean we'll we'll just have to wait and see exactly what comes out of this whole story it's a frightening day but big unfortunately no one was hurt\nRight the all the other thing is there's reports of not only um you know these devices that are sent also white powder in them down\nI don't understand right I mean I guess we will in the end like okay if the bomb doesn't go off and do all this will knock 'em dead and who knows\nShe'll just wait and see switching gears a this is kind of a happy story we're dealing with meth addict but they were shaped yeah this is on\nThis was in Spokane and I love this story box twenty eight had this story about a couple of people who had been struggling with a meth addiction for a decade and then they get a little dog named Alex\nAnd the dog save their lives is what they say [noise] 'cause they they were having these problems and then a couple of years ago they adopted the dog and they um\nThe dog actually spoke to him should stop no ... well actually kind of in a way that's what happened Elizabeth Osborne David Dixon are these two peoples names there more than two years sober\nNow a and they say their dog help them because they found out that when they smoke the dog got really aggressive when they used\n[noise] whoa very quickly that Alex is horrified by the ... coming out of someone standing for being snout and went to go to Alex and Alex ... by ... no form of aggression out of an ...\nSo the dog's cool until they smoke math and apparently not even just around the dog but\nThe dog doesn't isn't freaking out because he's around the math but even you know you sweat through your I mean obviously you to just the chemical stick on you barely just being around them after they'd gotten high the dog starts freaking out so then that was a moment but they said okay we either have to choose keeping the dog\nFor keeping met and I know it sounds funny but it is but at least they picked right\nOnly Alex was a different dog he sat shaking without ... hiding in that corner ... the first time they relapse with Alex I broke down crying next morning [noise]\nAre you there outlay found a new home or we stopped me they laugh\nAnd carries out and said oh wait that way I could have gotten rid of Alex\nUntil they pick the dog and now it's been two year a little over two years and they've been sober because of the dog that's incredible that's a great story that's a very good boy that dog there's no doubt about it man\nI mean I Wonder how many people are thinking right now you know what if I can train my dog to detect weed on my kid [laughter] I'm sure they smoke and\nThey'll never smoke again it's great well after ... over to the dog or a dog yeah wow that's crazy [laughter] by the way real quick or as again with all the pipe bomb stuff a lot of information is coming out and we're going to have to sort through a lot of it everybody is\nAh we're all just going through this as it develops Pete Williams at NBC right now is reporting that a package was not sent\nTo Debbie Wasserman Schultz the Florida congresswoman former chair of the day and see\nBut it was addressed to Eric Holder was not delivered because there was a problem with the address and the return address was Debbie Wasserman Schultz that's why that package wound up in her office\nGod it just that clarification coming out now\nOkay well when I was first reported\nI mean I think it was obvious on air I was thinking to myself one of these is not like the other you know she you know what I'm saying right like if anybody has reason to be mad at her she helped out\nConservatives ragged make the argument I not so much Bernie Sanders yeah it's like if this really is the target of some you know cooked ... conservative I don't think she would be high on the list so okay\nThat makes more sense yeah but of course the whole thing is senseless I'm completely different story on a lighter note\nYou sometimes people have talked about this so I get the real thing you know like okay really no it's true that this woman admits to fattening up her bridesmaids before wedding oh this was an amazing story makes her look better she's opening\nUp about how she used smoothies to fat and upper bridesmaids before the wedding day penny is her name and she made a special movie for sisters who will be bridesmaids at her wedding every single morning they never knew what was in it\nBut it was high calorie high fat content and she said look I I Know I'd been planning my wedding for a long time I knew I Would get a little ... ...\nUm and she's kind of surprised that herself about how far she went she she says I always felt like Jim Brady in the middle wasn't as hotter as popular as my older sister and I wasn't always was cute and find as my younger sister I was just penny in the middle but about a man who love me for me and I couldn't be happier\nOf Anthony Scaramucci saying that Trump has a scoundrel there has to be some sort of explanation for that well this is Anthony Scaramucci the guy who was a White House communications director for a cup of coffee basically you love this guy I Do I I've grown to really appreciate the ...\nI Know with all the audio came out of him talking about Steve Bannon being very flexible and all that stuff I was like you got to get bad guy out of here\nI ever come to appreciate the moved though you've been actually campaigning for him to get back into the white I think they need to maybe he could be the attorney\nGeneral though I'm saying that might be a stretch I think that I think it's about time we had somebody who could get tough and honest out there [laughter]\nI'd like to move to better just on the talking head she as well when I find myself in times of trouble Scaramucci comes to me my he was on CNN this morning before all this stuff broke with the pipe bombs and everything talking about Trump exaggerating or buying about things\nBecause the media of course freak out about that stuff and a lot of people who voted for Trump just kind of shrug it off by ... know this wasn't the most well attended inaugural address right of course it wasn't but that's Trump being Trump right um so the ... tries to break it down with John Berman\nYou think he knows he's line [noise] yeah I think he does yeah and and read that he likes it actually like flying yeah he likes it because they think he likes the fact that people are talking about it and he likes the fact that it's like taking my finger and like putting in in one of the two eyes that you like on your face and what would you call somebody like fly\nYou know like a rascal like a scale you know like a a fan base and yeah it's a smart this is mark on his face when he's doing it I mean there's a there's also an entertainment aspect to it\nAnd he is absolutely spot on about the entertainment thing and it's all the way the sales pitch of value to come out with something over the top and then you start to get into the weeds of what he's talking about and you realize well maybe he's kinda got a point\nYeah you know he when he goes to a rally like that and you know there's a level of embellishment there because he's playing to the crowd he's playing for the laughs and he\nYou know I mean that's that's been his persona is for his style and by the way\nYou can't really argue with that successive it on the level of the weighted average of what they really care about they can weigh less about that John and they care way more about okay we finally have a president that maybe I advocate\nAnd so all of that other nonsense that he does an existential nonsense is less important to them [noise]\nOkay here's my point okay and that first clip we heard\nYou hear John Berman almost exasperated yeah but you can say so what do you call a person that lies that likes to lie you know it's the saying it's despicable not someone we want as a leader [laughter] you know what I'm saying yeah [noise]\nAnd I just heard Obama out ah [noise] campaigning somebody in Nevada I think talking about ideal\nImpacts okay this guy like through his team right non stop no one ever called him on it\nI think that's the the whole point with Trump is that a lot of people look at it and say look it's not that you're you're happy that he always bad he can you know\nGet out to left field every now and again oh yeah not thrilled about it but in all the time you were looking at results and you're saying All right well maybe he's got a point about a B or C and maybe he could do something about you know a issue a B or C and actually turn around what's been going wrong right\nYou know and part of that I Will admit may be personal you know what I mean I always felt like what Trump I Know when we were getting\nYeah it's like okay some things that he ... he didn't surprise me I'm not saying that I've never been surprised\nBut you don't you know this is this is who he is you know what I mean and there's good and then you've got to take some of the bed with a good break with Obama I was completely filled [laughter]\nEvery once in a while one of my buddies will remind me remember that back into it and he thought this guy was was you had to you know you didn't agree with everything but you thought he was really telling the truth the ... was a good\nPerson and I got a freaking burned\nThat's that is the the sad reality is that if somebody is in politics light in all likelihood they are lying to you about something playing keep playing right [noise]\nWell you merge man and woman blah blah blah [laughter] we can't have people coming in illegally yes one after another after another man yeah OK or by the way now\nTo law enforcement sources are saying that another suspicious package has been intercepted at the congressional

I Hope I'm safe because it could be glyphosate or a herbicide who's a carcinogenic properties have been heavily debated\nThe EPA the environmental protection agency said in twenty Seventeen that goes to fade\nOr ... glyphosate\nIs not likely to be carcinogenic to humans but other organizations they disagree for example the WG benchmark for how much\nGlyphosate is okay and food is much stricter than EPA standards in addition the international agency of research on cancer\nI Am a RC determined that and twenty Fifteen that glyphosate is probably carcinogenic to humans\n\nMan in August the maker of the weed killer herbicide Monsanto was ordered to pay two hundred and eighty nine million dollars in damages\nTo a grounds keeper who said the glyphosate based round up cause his cancer\nThe payout was lowered to Seventy eight million dollars but the ruling remains the same\nNow we're getting to that list memorize there's twenty six and I do not want to go through all this boy you can go

it\nLot of talking about how wonderful some states some representative was at a beef and I ... a reporter and was praising them for that I I I don't think that's a good idea I'm quite sure the president doesn't mean that but uh you know say something like that you're going to get somebody\nUm has to start acting that way I fear and I think that's what's happening now 'cause it's interesting all the folks\nThat that uh got bombed today a and CNN these\nThese are these were targets recently of of ah you know the president and his verbiage and I think this is dangerous rhetoric needs to be turned on\nBy the president has weighed in he said that uh the full weight of our government is being deployed as part of a major federal investigation into the suspected this explosive devices center former and current government officials\nAs he condemned the attempted attacks were extremely angry upset unhappy about what we witnessed this morning and we'll get to the bottom of it he said at the White House we have to unify we have to come together is what the president said\nWell I'm Glad you said that I did not see their report today but I'm very glad that he is saying things like that because we've got to get our house together we gotta get get some perspective\nOn where we're at politically in this country and what we're all about and we're not about violence between the Democrats and Republicans that's not what our history is and that's not what countries for in our forefathers it'd be just horrified with this\nWell you know the same team and\nYes it's all about civility let

eating supper or whatever is that right to\nKnow I I don't think they should do that I think that uh we need to be respectful of folks in this country in my opinion I think\nYou know we got enough that divides us or we don't need to exacerbate it and uh\nYou know I don't I don't think that's generally a good idea I grew up in a family of public service my father was a city attorney up here and I'll Claire and I later city manager for many years of federal Claire and uh\nYou know I thought that that public officials are being hounded like that in a restaurant um you know it's pretty disturbing that's not our tradition is this really isn't\nYou know I Do not I I think I Know you're well enough to know that I you like me I like talking to people that had a different idea on whatever the subject was\nIt didn't a determining factor I yearn for it to hear that an idea if someone who is truly engage in really wanted something you know for the betterment of all of us who are really trying to make something better working more efficient\nOr in may have disagreed with what I thought I Love talking to people like that I think that's a good thing and that's one of democracy is really built on isn't it\nIt is it absolutely is and I used to have a you know pretty regularly I had a hours where people could come and visit with me at the public library here and old cleric sometimes in restaurants and I think you used to do that\nGod yeah yeah and and all those are some of the best memories\nWith the public library here and all ... times in restaurants and I think you
