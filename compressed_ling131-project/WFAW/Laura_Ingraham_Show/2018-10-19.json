inside edition\nNo I mean that's why so many people\nYou know are are thanking God that no social media exist you gotta know camera phones nothing exists than in than time crying out loud where\nUm you know it wasn't me when\nI was a kid but that was one of the things to do was sneak a car out even sometimes after hours and\nYou know put the you know\nCar pickup truck whatever a neutral start pushing it down the driveway as you've heard you know that's what I heard you heard that it was a troubled neighbor kid that you had made me jarred right to do that even with the car neutral you roll it out the\nYes the driveway and down the block a little while been fire up so your parents go near I mean ...\nTo him here yeah um yeah those kind of kids you know what I mean and then the because of the sister was concerned about the little brothers wellbeing yeah she may have ratted you out [laughter] something like that yes but\nThen the bonding of father and son later in life and telling about all the hijackings that he was able to pull off it actually served as a bonding thing for my friend maybe it was really good OK moving on other things you don't okay today by the way out the Astros last last night that they did is my\n... yeah ... what\nAre they ... but you know it's not like a couple of years ago against the the Kansas City royals were they just melted down where I think we were the better team and they just melted down before they got beat by better team so go Red Sox go read so I Am really\n[noise]\nYou don't need ... no that's all right now it's disappointing but I also have to remind myself that just a few years ago the Houston Astros who was a great season if I didn't lose a hundred games so the fact that they've got knocked out of the A. O. C. aspects it's disappointing but the better team won so enemy of my enemy is my friend I'd I'm rooting for the red Sox now\nAnd ... just won't weigh in on anything\nToday Greg he's he's not talking to me\nYankees fan he's called the red Sox evil ... below Greg\nHe won't turn on them like today just so okay signal during the\n... right I got other things to do okay I Do like that part it's part of the grieving process mhm ... what you'll tell yourself yeah here's the bright side of the sea they won last year it never thought I'd see it true that is very true this is all part of it do it ... well every year with my favorite sports teams\nSometimes you're just like the you know what they're going to suck and they're going to suck it as long as this guy owns the team\n[laughter] but I just talking about your cowboys okay anyway we got to move on to other things um school serves kangaroo meet people freak\nYeah the uh this is in Nebraska ahead cook in the states Potter decks public school served up this meat\nShe remains caught up into delusion that the only reason she lost in two thousand sixteen was because of Russian interference she does not seem to have fully process the fact that she lost the electoral college the only vote that counts\nAnd goes on\nDid you and I forgot about this according to a study from the American national elections studies the words most associated by voters with Hillary in two thousand sixteen ... do you remember\nI remember there was something like lying or corrupt or something like that experienced liar okay people sharing and do a trust me you know\nNo they don't um they said you know being in her position\nIs it understandable to want to re have an image yeah\nIs it possible now [noise] and that's the thing\nYou think about different people that were disliked by both parties and I'm thinking like George W. Bush yeah Republicans fed up done by two thousand seven two thousand eight right there and we know how Democrats felt about George W. Bush mhm\nYou give it some time well and then\nThey go to but you give it some time and then people look in the past in their hearts warmed a little bit and some Democrats you know what your people say I don't dislike him near as much to you I don't think he's a bad guy she's never given at any time you know\nNot that I Know I don't know that would do any good but that's the other thing you're trying to go with the hash tag me too and you're putting bill out there\nYeah that's that's a tough sell puts a really tough so\nAnd everything with the Kavanaugh hearings oh\nMy gosh man you're killing the party but keep doing it go ahead be my guest but I thought that was interesting that the old Daily Beast put that out front and center like please just go away as far as kangaroo roommate switching gears [laughter]\nYeah so this is again in Nebraska a superintendent is now apologizing for anxiety and any harm caused after school chef served without telling people kangaroo meat or to students this was at the state Potter ... public school district and they served up kangaroo made\nAnd so I mean the ... and so I guess the chef has been fired right yeah\nIt was fired on Wednesday\nJust because they didn't let people know you know\nDo you think people would have been upset hey we're going to be servants gang roommate\nNo yeah I think I I can see the main concern from from the parent's point of view I can see why they'd be concerned just because it is something that's outside of the norm or outside of the actual in the United states especially at a public or at a school [noise] um\nYeah I think if you're up front about it hey we're going to have this there's going to be another option we're just trying this out\nI think people would have been caught it would've been a funny lifestyle guess school story yeah like well can you believe they're serving kangaroo me and now because if you hide something if you look like you're hiding something people automatically wonder what else are you not telling us\nExcept here's a trust issue there yes and you said you would think it would be worse if it were horse I think so 'cause horses a companion animal\nSame reason why I don't I Would not really ever want to eat dog or meet the R or a cat meat yeah\nMay be good I don't know but I don't really want to try because that's their kind of part of the family\nBut horses served in parts of the United states of you know\nBut again but I think you're right because it's out of a norm you'd want to let people know at least\nAnd then I'm reminded yeah in different parts of the world all sorts of crazy stuff is eating ... and yet this is all if you were to service the school district you'd want to give parents a heads up like if you're serving you know tuna eyeball\nYou might want to yeah you might want to let people know about that you know very big in Japan chicken feet I've had chicken feet and I probably wouldn't go back to it what's it like a little stringy [laughter]\n\nYou better not hot saw it on at anything will tastes good but\nI Know as popular in some areas you know it's not really not something that I Want to go back to yeah

giant spiders fond the hamburger I did not do that now\nThen you know tequila worm you know obviously there's frog legs I Love frog legs I Know a lot of people to do um\nThe ... they mentioned kangaroo and in Australia more and more they're trying to market kangaroo is edible right because\nThey're they're kinda destructive they mess up people's property and they're they can be a nuisance we're like 'cause you don't see kangaroos hopping around the United states every day we got to look at 'em or were like oh it reminds me of the Winnie the Pooh characters but they're they're nuisance here there are kids and their hot button public men is right and so they\nAre trying to encourage people to eat it sort of like nutrient and Louisiana and parts of southeast Texas where I'm trying to get the big the big swamp rats yeah we tried to get people eat those because well that's one of the best ways of pest control like ... where does he have the same thing [noise]\nNow you've had

Halloween\nStay with Ryan ... tiny rotten tomatoes dot com they Ryan hey guys how's it going going fantastic and it looks like a Halloween\nIs pretty good\nYeah it's not bad it's not bad uh I mean I think I I I was saying earlier that ah I'm not\nIf I'm being honest like a huge fan of the franchise in general and I think a lot of that has to do with the sequels that I didn't think were very good and actually I think as a matter of fact John Carpenter has said that he's not quite a big fan of the sequels and that he's not even seen all of them\n[noise] um but uh but I actually thought it was pretty good I thought it wasn't bad um you know I I don't know it gets fans are the franchise\nYou know are kind of like you lost interest along the way the first one scared me to death when I was a kid yeah I remember seeing the sequel in the theater\nAnd being terrified and then it yeah but after that I just lost interest I didn't think there were very good yeah I I I I liked the first one a lot I I really like to be Rob Zombie remake the first one not not so much time we knew who I liked the remake of the uh\nUm Halloween a lot I thought it was pretty interesting to watch sort of be\nA I guess the metamorphosis of\nMichael Meyers from this weird kid a super serial killer but yeah I I Am ... the series drops off very quickly and as far as qualities yeah\nYeah and then there was also Halloween three which had nothing to do with Michael Meyers or Jamie Lee Curtis or any of those character those kind of a stand alone movie that was kind of a weird thing that happened to\nThat was like the greatest bait and switch of all time was that one season of the which yes yeah exactly yeah that's right yeah so yeah\nAs far as this new movie is concerned obviously we've had a bunch of those sequels and re boots and what not ah but this new one it basically says none of that counted um we're going to make a brand new sequel that directly follows that original first movie\nSo you know all that stuff before about Michael Meyers being Laurie Strode brother and a curse that forces him to kill and you know Lori faking her death and\nNone of that stuff counts anymore and none of that ever happened uh instead this movie picks up basically forty years after of course after the first of after the events of the first Halloween [noise] um you guys might remember that one ends with Michael getting shot and falling off a balcony and disappearing\nBut in the beginning of this one it turns out he was eventually we captured and sent back to the sanitary him\nA meanwhile worry strode has been living with T. T. S. D. all these years but now she has a daughter and granddaughter and she's four to fight or a home you know in anticipation of Michael coming back which of course he does now he has three strode to terrorize but uh that's all I'm going to say 'cause I don't want to spoil anything for you guys\nUm this wasn't directed by John Carpenter but uh he didn't give it a blessing and you can post some of the music for it it was actually kind of a joint project between a David Gordon Green and uh his frequent collaborator Danny McBride\nOr they've done a bunch of movies together he's found him down and and vice principals Danny McBride helped write the screenplay and David Gordon Green directed it I think you can kinda see a little bit of Danny mcbride's influence\nIn the dialogue but uh but mostly I I Know I think it was a smart move to sort of\nWipe the slate clean and and forget all of the are increasingly sort of bizarre mythology of the series and and sort of return to its roots in it does feel like a throwback to the original movie so [noise]\nUh right now this one is I think there are certified fresh that Seventy nine percent I I I think it's pretty solid entry in the franchise so whether or not you're a fan and if you're looking for something kind of scarier thrilling to watch I think it's pretty safe bet this week\nAnd you expect to win this weekend\nUm I dunno venom is going really strong and I thought you know\nI I Will say we we also ran a horror icons versus screen queens bracket on rotten tomatoes in the past couple of weeks\nAnd as it turned out by pure circumstance the final scream queen was Laurie Strode and the final horror icon as Michael Meyers as voted on by our fans and I think I think just anticipation for this new movie is really high end so I I think it probably will win the weekend yeah\nOkay and then there's a couple of other movies opening\n[noise] yeah there's a couple of other ones they actually are there's a couple of other movies that are opening wide that that uh we're open and limited release for a couple of weeks and now they're just expanding one of them is a movie called the hate you give it certified fresh in Ninety seven percent it's a coming of age tale about a young\nBlack girl who lives in a mostly black neighborhood but goes to a a mostly white prep school and sees her childhood friend gunned down by police and becomes an activist it's a\nIt's a thoughtful and it's kind of sensitive in the way that it portrays the events and it's a certified fresh at Ninety seven percent [noise] um the other one I Do want to mention is is a film called the old man and a gun or this one's going to be in six hundred theaters this this week it this is supposed to be Robert Redford\nVery last acting performance and it's based on a true story\nAbout a man named Forrest Tucker who was a lifelong criminal and escape from prison multiple times a\nMinute focuses on his escape from San Clinton at the age of Seventy after which she went on a bit of a crime spree and became kind of a criminal celebrity for for repeatedly outwitting the authorities are it's got a great the coast starting cast including you know Casey Affleck and and Tom Waits and Sissi space sec\nAh acting is great and you know if it does turn out to be Robert Redford last film as he claims it's really not a bad way to go out it's a certified fresh in Ninety percent\nYeah and I think that so many people when that story was happening we're rooting for quote the bad guy was like oh this Seventy year old guy breaks out he's pulling off he's he's got the the authorities freaking out you just can't figure it out it's ... I wanted that done you know that's interesting the other one\nOr the you mentioned the heat you give is um the whole premise of the pressure from both worlds this little girl was in\nUm ... seems like wow what a great premise to see this play out the only thing I was surprised that because you mentioned it's Ninety seven percent at least right now and the audience score is lower\nYeah I always wonder about that does happen yeah you never know\nYou never know I mean this happens with a lot of the recent horror films for example in at a Terry things like that you know the audience just doesn't connect to at the same way that critics to I had happened was venom\nObviously a oh yeah got panned by critics and audiences loved it I mean it's it's always hard to tell you you know it it's not a perfect science\nTell you and I got it [laughter]\nSyrian wanting excites thing again right [laughter]\nHe wanted\nTo say oh they're in\nA in a [noise]\nWhen the president now now that I was in an American he actually how it's going to try that\n[laughter]\nThree she's gonna winning twenty twenty four oh running for president yes oh I wouldn't be surprised from yes she really again I mean you're talking about a strong woman ... means smarts\n... the the whole package ma'am it's really really good immigrants all that stuff I mean gee knocks all those ... for a lot of people yes from the identity politics stuff and that also she tough lady and the smart woman\nI thought she did a great job him um want to ask you about this story switching gears here because this person\nIs from Denton, Texas you lived there for a while I did I Lived there for three years is this a common thing no it's not okay you have a southwest flight\nThis week diverted it was going from California to the to Dallas\nThey had to be diverted after a guy on board played a game of foot sea with a female passengers sitting next to him and then wound up getting into a confrontation with the white group Justin Riley Bradford twenty nine\nHe is in federal custody in New Mexico and faces felony interference with the flight crew and misdemeanor assault charge\nSo apparently how this went down as he and his way to you were seated next to each other on the flight from LA to Dallas when he put his arm on her leg as the plane was getting ready for takeoff\nYou can't do that hand or arm that he put his arm on her leg back to the version that I'd heard\nNo there isn't it hard to do isn't it\nThat you're going to have to lean one yeah OK I'm drawing a picture that that's a leaner yes\nAuthorities inside the woman leaned away but he got closer and then started to try to play puts the weather and you can try to be a little cute right I'm a mid flight romance get back uh then there's the FBI report that says that the woman told him to stop kicking and bothering her\nAnd that he asked her to go out after the flight he's a real germ\nGerm or is any Bradford allegedly responded to her by what spring don't sleep with me\nOkay we need the rock we need the rock to be there when the plane lands yeah little quick justice [laughter]\n[noise] so then the woman moved to new seat and Bradford tried to go over to the woman with a drink hey I'm Sorry you know I just I Want to give you this drink and would you still please maybe go out with me by the time and talk to them and then he went from quote zero to sixty nanoseconds\nDisguise hammered or something or so I don't know just crazy maybe\nHe told authorities that he and the woman had been watching videos on her computer and he thought that she was flirting with him so he started playing ... now you also admitted to using methamphetamine the day before the boy\nAnd on Saturday he had overdosed on heroin ... so he's got some issues you also allegedly told the FBI to God was talking to him during the flight ... after I got some problems which got is that I don't know you just said I was talking to him\nThat heroin God or is that another guy I don't know\nYou don't like my idea of the rock just waiting little justice for a guy like this [laughter]\nI just maybe if the rockets just on the plane I don't fly southwest though and I don't know [laughter]\nI don't know how much room there is on the southwest flight I just know on my recent flight the rock doesn't fit [laughter] there's no room they're viewed unfair that he doesn't fit nope right no way you know it was odd do I don't think I told you this\nLike a four hour flight and like you know maybe I'll watch one of these movies and I'm going through nothing looks that good and then there's this other part of okay I might want to watch this movie\nBut they say it's like I don't know the bulls to yeah there was a kid sitting mind you're right that's weird I\nI run into that situation before especially on the market by last year when I was going to Guam\nYeah long fight right so I have all these movies set up by downloaded 'cause he would net points with the ... you can download movies and TV shows right and I thought about that because there was a little little thing may you on the back of the I'm ahead rest for the seat in front of you you can mount your phone or your eye pad bear to watch a movie in lean back or don't have to worry about holding anything\nUm and I realize that a couple of the movies were horror movies that I wanted to watch\nBut I'm looking around and you're right there there are kids all around and I don't want their eyes to be diverted to that\nYeah that's that's the whole weird kind of thing\nBut the guy a couple of Rosa in front of me was watching the wolf of Wall Street whoa and that's something that yeah that is not safe\nThat's the whole weird kind of thing the\nGuy couple was Rosa in front of me was watching the wolf of Wall Street whoa and that's something that yeah that is not safe for kids\nUse it in gear didn't care\nI'm so I'm looking at different things and I see the documentary on Fred Rogers Mr Rogers yeah\nAnd I might you know that got great reviews and different people said it is fantastic I didn't watch Mr Rogers as a kid and I'm like it sounds like an interesting story so I'm watching it and there's a lady sitting next to me\nAnd I noticed a couple of times she just looks over and it's actually during scenes of Mr Roger's neighborhood yeah\nAnd then I'm paranoid that she's thinking what's up with this weird out [laughter]\n\nYou know watching Mr Roger's neighborhood and then it's like if I say anything\nLike that\nYou know we don't need to name\nMonday I Know what you do I go ahead and say I heard this documentary was really good at the name or do you just leave it and go\nThrough that sort of just like screw it I'm putting on the wolf of wall\nStreet [noise] but it was kind of interesting in the end I felt bad for them to feel bad for him because all maybe two thirds of the documentary talks all about all the people that made fun of him so ... where he was just trying to do something nice for\nKids they did a lot of great things I Know I mean if you go there ... I think he's from Pittsburgh but they I mean they they love 'em there there's a statue there yeah All right I I got to go to a couple of museums with my nieces and I know he did great things for this world I Know they're not a lot of people in media who can say that they affected in a positive way\nA lot of ... millions of people's lives in the same way that Fred Rogers can\nI Know you ever make fun of them when you were a kid or any of that I Know a a huge amount of respect some kids did you did well\nOf course [laughter]\nBut yes I said before they're different people when you're a kid you don't know better you made fun of and then you feel bad about it later on you know what I mean it's one of those things you know Billy Graham was another\nLike all my grandma's watching another crusade ball ray [laughter]\nLater on I realized how much good this guy did in the world that my gosh what a tool I was happening again with Mr Rogers alright man I'd love to talk about how I've been a jerk and most of my life but\nUnfortunately the segments out of time [laughter] need to get the other banks um maybe you saw the most popular\nPlaces to eat late at night [noise] and this will come to a shock to absolutely no one seemed to get to that\nBut also ships are set you up for our big friday five today are kind of coming up in about twenty minutes on the game show [noise]\n\n\n[noise] an official methods for Medicare open enrollment season so now's the time to be open mind looking at everything prescription drug crimes and Medicare Advantage plan insurers why because crime strange\nSo can you help me I'm from lower ... extra benefits aren't saved money open to something better Medicare got\nA call one eight hundred Medicare today from them on their own [noise]\nPaid for by the U.S department of health and Human Services\nThe seventh annual full flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals there lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty\nPercent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents skin would look laminate flooring all on sale up to forty percent off three finished hardwood and bamboo starting in Ninety nine cents\nPlus special financing stop by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nHardship case are honest mistake it doesn't matter to the IRS when you are back taxes for having file tax returns in quite some time they're coming for you\nLike with Rhonda it didn't matter that she was a single mom and a nurse living paycheck to paycheck and it didn't matter that the reason she owed thousands of dollars in back taxes was that her ex said he'd filed their tax returns but didn't the\nIRS was aggressively pursuing her garnish in her wages Ronda was trapped in what she thought was a no win situation\nIf you can relate to Rhonda you need to co opt them a tax relief after ... knows that behind every tax problem are honest hard working people people with families homes savings and paychecks that need protection which is how they resolve over a half billion in tax that for their clients and our eight plus rated with the better Business Bureau\nSites on trust pilot with over a thousand reviews and right now our listeners contrite zipper recruiter for free at this exclusive Web address zip recruiter dot com slash NBC ... recruiter dot com slash envy seat what's that again they didn't get a liver critter dot com slash NBC zip recruiter the smartest\nThe W.

going to take a look at a movie my favorite baseball movie of all time the natural ...\nHas to be mine too I had a very loving and directed it and there was that movie capture something in the very core ball you know it it had the young fan and the site and you know it was it was it was like a very story\nBall you know it it had the young men and the site\nAnd you know it was it was it was like a fairytale story being told and and good and evil darken and white you know it was just filled with all that kind of symbolism\nYeah on what time are we trying to depict here in the early Nineteen hundreds I guess a\nReal like maybe the twenties and thirties\nAnd ... you nailed it a ... good and evil that kind of thing and a temptation and and all that uh the the woman dressed in black\nShe shows up and gets in the way of uh probably what was going to become very great uh she messes it up and a story of redemption right you can try to do it again and Robert Redford is one of those actors that uh\nWe were just lucky to have in our lifetime because he really knows how to sell it a dashing person of course he's an old movie name as ... bringing up because they don't know of but are you going to do what he says it's gonna be last role he's done with movies or after well\nYeah it's called the old man and a gun to your go thank you yes he says that's it a wrap it up so\nAh but in this movie ah he has to play a very young person and then an older person and I think they pull it off you know they\nThey do they do you know it's one of those things where you know you can tell pretty fast if they didn't pull it off and if you're pulled off it just we just talk for a long and then you buy it it just by when you're watching it\nAnd he did that but the cast in there I don't know if you remember that kept\nI mean talk about big name you know Robert Redford Glenn Close Kim passenger Barbara Hershey there in the cabin Robert Duvall Robert prosecute will for really mean that that's an all star cast right there you know\nYeah Robert Duvall a played uh the sports writer that uh you know a epitomize what what sports writers are sometimes get categorized as though the person waiting to see a slim\nYeah the the one that wants to be there when you fall down in months to get it all get it all out there thinks that that's what people want rather than the good things about you they want to be able to tell what it is that uh they should hate or or your ... your shortcomings that I was a great asked they played that very very well\nUh that movie is one of my favorites I have a favorite scene I'm going to tell you what mine is the first may I ask you what yours\nI'm not I think the ending with you know oh yeah the music to there's that track every now and [laughter] and it had that ready ah yeah and at the end\nI don't think we're spoiling anything and if we are too bad\nBut uh the at the end or the ball makes its own fireworks that's what I say on that and it's really really done well but my favorite scene is the part where I'm there on the train and the ... ... well I think is trying to be a\nHow Babe Ruth is I mean the the ... so he's this guy that um the woman and black is originally are going to go after\nBut then she sees this new guy I'm Robert Redford character and so then she switches and goes with him to end his career she got this obsession of ending careers on her own terms like woman yeah she was sick and uh but she's gonna she's hanging out with a hammer and the ... gets shooting his mouth off\nAnd uh there's one thing leads to another I think it was a helper Robert Duvall too isn't it and he there yeah to kind of ... and get on the go and they have\nA little ah um they make a stop at a carnival and then a ... and then things get a little a heated up or I'm a bomb in a bet you that you can't strike me out and uh that kind of thing and\nThe way we going to see it but what I remember the most and I mentioned this before tia is their own field doing this and that the uh um dandelion seeds are flying around\nIt's just beautiful yeah so anyway are the natural would you recommend it to a friend Holly [laughter] Hi I'm Glad\nI'm Glad you brought it I could talk about the natural all day long on to the movies that I have been bringing up to you and I did go see\nI Want to just bring it up and I'll give it a of my um my attempt at a review here but bad times at the el royale a yeah I Want to cast too I mean you mentioned Castro's one's got one it's got Jeff Bridges and uh it's got Jon Hamm\nIt's got the guy who played for in it and what's his name ... ... worth um [noise]\nYeah I asked you if you are so all the movie uh the hateful eight\nYou didn't like that now as Clinton turned cheat on film and that's you gotta have and that's you know you either like are you really don't um I went and saw that I mean he goes way off the deep end and people expect from him and Gore and stuff like that and you know just going off the deep end but\nThe idea there was the characters in that one we're all in this room and there was a mystery of sorts and you had to try and figure it out same thing here\nThis is a a a Dell royale a of bother Dave is a a hotel that's unique 'cause it's right on the border it goes on both states I'm Nevada in California\nOh so when you get there\nYou can uh either stay in Nevada\nOr California and then making them to tell you if you stay in California you have to pay a little bit more so [laughter] and there's like used to be a casino and then something happened where their license got taken away\nSo now it's just a hotel and nobody goes there anymore but uh these on the guests show up and are they all got a secret died\nThe uh the low slogan in this one is seven strangers seven secrets swell\nThat pretty much sums it up and they're all hoping that there is secret his state's good well guess what a ... if things happen and they don't\nAnd what is I I Want to ask you what's happened with Jeff Bridges Jeff Bridges got a new little dialects going\nHe's got a ... you know he gets really eerie with his ...\nOh yeah yeah and I checked it out is\n'cause his bottom lip is hanging over a little more out here who\nAre some dental work or anyway but ah yeah that is a little distracted but that's been going on for a while now but uh he plays a a priest\nOr so you can relate to that uh the John him he's I think a vacuum cleaner salesman a and it just it it gets one thing ... is one of those movies or you just can't talk about 'cause you'll ruin it I'm a butter or what I recommend it to a friend sure I and I said sure not yeah\nI because I Would like any of these movies where they get twisting turning like this you have to uh you know things happen I don't know if you go so fast but after it's over I went with my family and I go how come she went and hit him ... why would why would she\nHappen I don't know if you think goes so fast but after it's over I went with my family and I go how come\nShe went and hit him ... why would why would she do that did what did she see and I don't know anyway you know there's these little gaps that just kind of stick with the kind of ... stone in your shoes when she got out\nOkay my question is what you see it in a while you she saw the theater but someone who would you have somebody wait to see it on video at home\nYou know that's a good I I you know what this is one you don't need to go to the movies or and I don't think it's going to win any awards I just don't\nI mean if if it was one of those uh yeah you'd probably want to go see it but this there are some roles in this movie like the the role that Chris ... worth has I'm sure you looked at the script he goes oh yeah I Want to do that\nBecause he's got a very eccentric character that that he probably really relished having just because there is any he knocks it out of the park\nUm you know I don't I don't think I'm under stating it any uh in saying and I think you had a chance to read it that's the letter is highly critical of the governor\nThe main takeaway ah and that's being reported it there's a lot of ... I mean one is a accusing the governor of being worried about his political future rather than the future of our state is that a good way to sum it up\nI I think so yeah it language was um uh was pretty critical and um I think I can find the uh the actual sense that you just alluded to in any event uh let's see um\nMm\nIt said that uh the governor\nAll it was um it was a pretty good praise had had been attracted by the siren song of national office I'm a ... that's a reference to his ah his brief run for president a back then\nThat's ... Greek mythology kind of\nWords yeah and we're old brother where art dollars ... ... ... ... um so so that was yesterday so yesterday or some reporters didn't have a chance to to catch up with the governor and ask him about that now this was at a press conference where he was accepting\nSome endorsements from agricultural groups and I'm\nMore or more or less I think Andy kind of a kind of brush this all off and put it down to simply a differences of opinion within his cabinet and um I think most people who who probably read this letter\nWould have to say that you know the the concerns raised by Paul jade and in these other two people are kind of went beyond mere differences of opinion right\nSo this is all on the eve of a debate tonight exactly and there's also a shot coming the other way to ah he's opponent a tuna Uber's tell us about that a criticism of him\nAnd this has been recorded by Patrick Marley at the Milwaukee Journal sentinel today so superintendent ... put together a budget request I'm back in September will just last month\nAnd that included there are some sections that were plagiarized from various sources including wake up Haiti a which I'm sure you're familiar with mhm I'm also a blog\nBy an intern at a think tank and two additional sources now not surprisingly the governor's campaign jumped on this\nAnd uh that was again just hours before the debate this evening\nA spokesman for the department of public instruction which of course Tony ... is currently has he's at the elected secretary of that office\nAcknowledged that quote proper citation use was missed in certain places of the budget request and said that staff would be we trained but that that Tony Curtis doesn't plan to discipline anyone that according to D. P. eyes so\nA couple of development and just the last couple of days leading up to this first debate between Governor Walker and Tony Evers\nAnd the site in which he is accused of being a ... by ... or they\nDidn't really care and then he done that and it looks like come looking at the story now and\nThat that was interesting as well um uh yeah and I I've been trying to keep up with this\nAnd that looks like I'm looking at the story now and\nThat that was interesting as well um ah yeah and I I've been trying to keep up with this as as well as I can uh there's obviously there's a lot going on\nNow here or there is a guy a fellow named Thomas Bee Fordham or from the you know Michael a PR truly a president of the Thomas Bee Fordham Institute where the uh uh this police ... alleged plagiarism took place here they asked everybody calls you called plagiarism I call it impacts baby\nSound yeah this is definitely going on our annual report yeah\nYeah he is wearing it as a badge of honor that somebody did that\nYeah so\nI mean let's be clear these think T. C. throw these ideas out there and they're hoping is that politicians uh we'll catch holes with them that they will look at him and they will adopt some of these\nThese ideas and you are yes you are technically supposed to give them credit when you share those ideas\nAre ... are you in your uh uh I'm a circles sure and that's what the governors accusing him of we didn't have the little after ... at the bottom of the little footnote saying that these ideas were coming from this\nIs a different there's a think tank\nSo anyway idea I mean I I think the takeaway from just a a reporter's stand point um is is whether either of these things um the the new criticisms and the letter by the former a\nFormer Dick CEO Paul jade and and then the uh the admitted plagiarism by the ... campaign whether either of those things is really going to move the needle any\nAs we get closer to the election we we've discussed before about the fact that the you know the number of of undecided independent voters in Wisconsin at this point in just a just a short time out from the election are are pretty small\nYeah what what's going to stick to the wall and you know another thing you have to remember is\nPeople are already voting and never have already voted in fact before this team out I'd already taken my boat I already it's already done a so that's an interesting uh uh you know a dilemma that they face and they tried to times of the news when it comes out it used to be the old rule week two weeks before the election\nI don't know I I think that's under debate now because people early vote more than ... don't you think\nYou speaking of voting Andy I'm here in Madison are going to have a another option when it comes to a voting for mayor in the or the upcoming primary coming up in February\nYeah are you in a new option but not really\nWell yeah you know everything everything old his new again I guess and and and in this I mean I'm I'm making light of it but it's um it's an interesting story I'm mayor up all solved one\nI had a decided that he was not going to run for reelection earlier this summer when he was running for governor\nWell he has subsequently as of this morning as a matter of fact changed his mind on that um\nBecause quote from an email he sent out it turns out that I was wrong about being up for another campaign I Am so I'm all saw Glenn\nNow joins the uh uh feel that it's gotten fairly crowded since he a tape out out of the mayor's race earlier this summer or he is now the seven candidate for mayor\nAnd the general election is next April there'll be a primary on February nineteenth so kind of an interesting develop as a local politics here in Madison\nOh gosh yes a it's a crowded field and another aspect another dynamic to it as there are some holders and we're going to run for their own seats in order to run for mayor so their seats were going to be open so they decided to go back to run for older they'll probably have some opponents are going to uh not run but because they weren't running are running for their seats\nSo I have a ripple effect\nYeah there there are if that's what they indeed do otherwise maybe they'll stay in the race and to be an Indian criticized the mayor\nFor wanting the job and not wanting the job and then wanting it again I don't know some\nInteresting but then and the big the you looted to it earlier there is a a um a debate tonight between a gubernatorial race between Governor Scott Walker and his opponent to state superintendent of schools Tony ... and it's their first debate I write tonight is\nYeah it's hard to believe I was thinking you know as I was writing this up today I saw that the right is this still only the first debate well it is yeah\nWell it has to night and they've got uh some competition\nFor the airwaves or the the brewers are playing\nAnd yeah the ... I don't know if you heard but uh yeah they they're doing pretty good no yeah the brewers around tonight any a do or die game uh and they didn't change at the time of the debate I thought they might moving around to stay away from that but no go Joel so\nHonored we go I I Want to ask you a Bob Hagan reporter of all it's new and interesting what are you going to be viewing tonight\nWell Andy I'm I have to be I have to be totally honest with you I'm Sorry I'm going to be watching uh the national league championship series at home\nYes you are if you don't follow Bob on a Twitter what's your handle on Twitter\nOr let me check [laughter] it's not like my phone number and I know no memory it at our the hey you\nAre do you have to get into ...
