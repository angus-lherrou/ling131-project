different people said oh no he\nWas a huge drink or he would stumbling drunk I had an interesting conversation this morning when I got to work I was getting ready for the show and I was watching uh the first like eight or nine minutes of the today show ... and this other person who is not political at all doesn't really follow a whole lot of news just happened to be in the room and was watching this\nKind of knew what was going on with Kavanaugh story but through the first nine minutes of this show\nDirty they just keep talking about him drinking and people are saying that he got into fights

grand theft auto take her to a completely different level\nYeah well the big new study you know we've seen this before confirming a link between violent video games and physical aggression yeah gets international study so is this a surprise\nNot ... well I mean if you're playing games like grand theft auto for ten hours a day that probably isn't helpful to your mental health I'm going to go out on a limb and say somebody who has done that ten hours a day I'll Wait while not ten hours a day no never that much my mom would have killed me a better invited on that now\nHas done that ten hours a day I'll eat well not ten hours a day no never that much my mom would have killed me better if I had done that no I'm I'll just say there have been times when I played a lot of video games like in summer here or there or maybe I played more than I should have you come out of that like\nJust your ears are buzzing a little bit because you've been focused on the screen for that long oh just like I Can't say I'm a better person for that I'll say that\nNo that makes sense you know some people will say well they're just harmless you know it's a cartoon violence others or you know more graphic\nYeah I mean I don't I don't think that you can blame video games on somebody who would shoot up a school for example I think there's something also deeply wrong with that person but it wouldn't help somebody with those tendencies\nIt could help push them over the edge maybe that would probably makes sense\n[noise] sometimes it also seems like when you're looking and I'm not talking about Fortnite 'cause it's its own phenomenon right now there's nothing out on that right now but with these other games like if you knew a kid that was in grade school like he's a fourth grader and he's going grand theft auto\nChances are his parents aren't the best [laughter]\nOh yeah I mean that's a great point to say when you look at this study that for example what does it they looked at Seventeen thousand kids age nine to Nineteen\n... over the course of seven years twenty twenty twenty Seventeen led to increased physical aggression over time yeah you can't really look at all that in a vacuum because I think you're you've got a great point if you if you're in a household where it's okay for a fourth grader to play hours and hours of grand theft auto\nThere might be other things going on in the home that would contribute to behavioral issues\nYou judge who you're judging anybody you're saying that little psycho I don't you tell me how to ...\n\nI I totally agree with that a hundred percent by the way real quick Greg ... why would you say\nFor night is not violet or you don't consider that to be violent\nBut I mean okay you shoot people but it's not like they it's not graphic when they get hit and they don't bleed out and stuff like another video games but you're\nTalking about the difference between door and violence and violence has its own thing\nI don't know it doesn't door is an ass buying them as it doesn't it doesn't feel like heads don't explode like in some of their video games so it's just you know you you got hit and now you're done\n[laughter] fine as long as you're running around trying to kill other people and be found in a live\nOur cartoons violent is Bugs Bunny violent money smack somebody in the face that's the level of violence we have it just to use a gun\n[laughter] it at home or fun at a gun right and I have a gun ... running mate I went to my mind going off and now I'm not really [laughter] Elmer why they had a guy who does he may [laughter]\nAre there is another study out there saying that if you do limited kids' screen time it will improve their brain function that's good that's positive and this was used our kids between\nEight and eleven and it's all ... not only the screen time but also the amount of sleep till you get and physical activity so if you meet the guidelines which is nine eleven hours of sleep one hour physical activity less than two hours of screen time\nThere will be improvement in brain function\nStudy found only one and twenty kids the United states meet all three guidelines not surprised I'm an almost a third ... none\nOf them while out\n[noise] yeah it's depressing holy smokes man okay one hour of physical activity\nThat doesn't seem like that much to me one hour a day now\nFor a kid eight to eleven maybe nine to eleven hours of sleep that seems like a dual bowl\nThat that seems like it would be harder to do than an hour a day\nMan an allergy or acting out but I mean okay you're going to bed at nine even if you're waking up at six yeah you're getting nine hours that's true yeah and I think the big thing is the screen time ... because less than two hours\nTo anybody have the function now on the phone that lets them know how much you're on just the phone today not to mention a laptop\nComputer at work I haven't done that because of the line of work that I'm In I Would just wind up being very depressed\nAnd someone expose her you know as far as her identity she wanted to remain anonymous\nThat didn't make sense to your friend doesn't say she was there that doesn't make sense there's so many things that don't add up and it's like are they just using this person to go after Kavanaugh\nSo if anything the sweat and the story doesn't help that know and if it was going through your brain like well it might just buying into some sort of conspiracy here and you see a story like short ... you're like okay what is going on here a lot of inconsistencies yeah that makes sense\nAnd I think it's really interesting because if you bring if you can ... Michael ... her lawyer about this you know his response was how dare you questioned a sexual assault survivors story\nAnd you know well this guy is just her ex boyfriend wouldn't be the first ex boyfriend to lie about somebody which I for one I'm tired of Michael ... saying that all immigrants are liars\nOr playing the game now this is how it goes this is how you got to base it on ... and ... that's what it comes down to put so many people don't want to do that okay what\nAbout the evidence we'll switch gears the president talking about the new trade deal or get to the media's reaction as a second but trouble talking about\nIt yeah it was fired up at a speech in Tennessee last night talking about the new trade deals made with Canada and Mexico\nWhich is a big win good deal for the U.S I Know the biggest criticism I've seen of it is well it's beige voters NAFTA ... right it's an update it isn't that positive it's a if if if that's your biggest criticism of it it's an updated version of NAFTA that's still a good thing for the country\nWhen it benefits the country yes my guy\nReplacing Dijon killing disaster known as a\nCandidate workout [noise] [noise] I don't want\nUs to see a you know more now [noise]\nParents\n[noise] and you know we have two wonderful doctors are now their partners Mexico and Canada and this was a I Love you to\nSound like my type you know their voices very strong\nI Love you [laughter] [laughter] he's rolling manning my I guess I'm\nI this was interesting I fell out of minor I almost fell out of my chair when I saw this headline on CNN dot com written by David ... he's a national security expert used to write for the New York times I'm Sorry the failing New York times and CBS now he's with CNN\n... he says\nWhat if Trump's confrontational trades pants actually works white\nWhich means he'll probably be fired from seeing him in the near future does an aptitude for no agreement or us MCI is Donald Trump wants to call it bothered me sending chills up the signs of diplomats and trade negotiators around the world Trump largely got his way and now no one can tell him his bowling a China shop away won't work\nBecause it did\nIn fact from this perspective he's he's writing from France why are you from this perspective across the Atlantic this NAFTA ... only reinforced the newly apparent reality trumps unhinged from precedents in your face negotiating style actually works\nAll three countries the U.S Mexico and Canada or characterizing this was a win win win but the leading French daily Le Monde\nCalled it like they saw their headline was Trump imposes on Canada a new free trade a guard [laughter]\nThis is the second trade pact that Trump has managed to strike this year in March following month of bluster and threats of torpedo knowing the six year old Korean us trade agreement Korea consented to a new agreement saying it wants to slash its average annual steel exports to the U.S by thirty percent\nAnd habits aluminum exports to the U. S. taxed at a ten percent level at the same time Korea agree to double the number of American trucks that could be sold their to fifty thousand per manufactured each year Trump is winning\nJob producing [laughter]\nSo they say I mean look you keep hearing this is just not how it's done\nBut there are positive things happening with this guy and Trump sometimes the style of it even myself I get a little worried sometimes\nOh I think we have lower to be honest\nYes and but you know I mean ... you look at the range of people from around the world and it's not just want to interview saying Trudeau from Canada got worked yeah\nAnd you can certainly make the argument we had been getting worked for years this is one of the reasons people voted for gay\nSo that that's wild\nThat it ... your winnings you mind\nWith CNN had that that's very surprising I don't know if this will be coming to the states anytime soon um but this study says University of Oxford\nThree day or a weekends if that happened yeah we'd all be better at our jobs keep hearing about that you do that is one of the big keys to becoming a better more productive and happier society because the employees are happier\nAnd talking about Fridays off every single week\nI missed that to where people test those out people are more productive when they know they only have four days to get it done it\nDepends on what ... you know you're in you know what I mean if it's just can you get everything done ... and that amount of time cool there's other jobs that you I mean you just have to be there you know what I mean\nI'm\nBut this kind of a sudden ... for most part said I Would argue the four day work week is spot on and striking that right balance between improving the work life balance and unlocking productivity gains outweighs the net reduction and productivity from working day less\nAll of a sudden I'm like man yeah that's kinda cool ...\nDo you ever see the other studies that say we actually have more leisure time now than almost ever right [noise]\nI'm like okay what do we believe weird we try to fill it with a lot of other stuff my biggest point of contention with the four day work week and don't get me wrong I'd love to have a three day weekend all the time ... again not that we have the most taxing job in the world of course friday five we do every Friday tough okay are you kidding me\nThat's nose to the grind will kind of stuff now but uh the problem is after a while you get used to before\nDay work week and then you're saying well why not a three day workweek why not a two day work week one on one day workweek why don't we just have the government get ever give everybody a check for nothing\nYou're ... you're going slippery slope as we get used to\nThings we wind up I mean we we wind up adjusting to our current circumstances and finding problems within them that's just that's just the thing about human nature it's not an inherently negative\nOf adjusting to our current circumstances and finding problems within that just that's just the thing about human nature it's not an inherently negative or positive thing it's\nJust something that happened while you're trying to kill fun I don't understand three day weekend for a lot of people it's kinda cool I mean if you ever get to the some people do this they get to the point there gig where they can actually do that you\nKnow different people whether they build their own business or if uh you know some people in the sales industry they put up huge numbers\nThey tell the employer hey I just want to go four days a week and I want to take pride it's awful absolutely not well then I'm going to take all my skills out the door whoa hold on a lot of times people have more power than they actually realized that\nThey

championship matches UFC on us the twenty ninth is Alexander Kaylee from him in a fight in ... in the program right sock you this afternoon\nJob they have a dog I'm doing just great man I tell you we we got a barn burner a main\nEvent USC two twenty nine it's counter it could be and you know obviously counter is the biggest\nName in and they right now and maybe in the history\nOf mixed martial arts and one of the few mixed martial artist ever to be bigger than the promotion of USC but in could be me as an opponent who is that is complete a light weight as we've seen for a long time and also\nA guy that continues to fight on a regular basis and focus is on the task at hand and that's work inside the octagon encounter McGregor he went out tried boxing and showed he wasn't a striker on that level and he's also been focused on everything but climbing into the octagon so\nAs you watch these two fighters prepare and I know it's kind of a worthy question\nAnd and you look at kind of the rest versus rough thing and you look at one guy in ... who's fighting for his life and a guy and Conor who's fighting because he has nothing left to do\nDo you see a distinct age in focus determination and preparation on one side or the other for this match up\nYou know Joe ... you know when you're talking about like you never want to go to ...\nPatients on one side or the other for this match up\nYou know Joe it's ... you know when you're talking about fights you never want to sort of overplay the mental aspect or like you to bring rats like an intangible intangibles are always\nA difficult thing to analyze freely in any sport but but especially in ... and you you want to try to kind of look at things just like skill for skills drink drink but of course when when both butter to this level and it's so close\nThan you to have to kind of start picking at okay well what about like you said Connors distracted he's got he's worried about is with he's worried about the boxing after this maybe who knows you know he's got all these other things going on\nA new magnum ... focused of Russian killer all he does this train and think about fighting and he's had some Andrew problem so he hasn't been as active as people think probably a lot for years\nBut he's been in there certainly you know he's he certainly been in there and when he's in there\nJust more active than [laughter] yeah I mean who has an idea where the guy on the spot that caught or has the Boston or a\nFew years ago and I remember so [noise] so I I I'm hesitant to say either fighter has a mental edge\nBut I also would have said that about you know some McGregor previous opponents we'd be you know in the first round like Joes they all do and at the right to wipe out mentally were fine\nBut then they lost and you know that was the first thing to want to point it was maybe maybe it was the McGregor mind games you know maybe it was all that that's being McGregor mouth that causes these previously like you know fantastic fighters to flip up and get knocked out\nBecause we we seen a lot we we saw can be walk out at a press conference and you could make the case that counters in his hand you can also make the case the other way with town or being distracted and not having that razors edge well could be does these kind\nOf made all that wash and now it's time to bring these two fighters down analytically and see who has the edge and and I'm fine with taking it in that direction\nWhen you own a counter McGregor he is one of the preeminent strikers in mixed martial arts but the reality is our in mixed martial arts that's what he does well he just doesn't better than everybody else that we pretty much seen in mixed martial arts can be\nHe's a good solid striker he's got a great takedown game he has a very complete game and couldn't really do anything in the cage do you see that as a big advantage in this one or do you see Connors overwhelming striking ability becoming the key to this match up\nYou know every fighter wants to say to their content to to go wherever it goes you know that's what makes them mixed martial artist you know I'm sure McGregor will say on the ground I'll be fine I'm not worried about the wrestling and ah you know no matter I met up his coach at the same for a while like oh we can stand you know because of Mac amount of is a good strike there he's he's known for\nFor an incredible wrestling and control and and Crimeans opponents out but he is\nA high level of director is the one of the ... lightweight I don't know about that but he's he's a very good but he's a very very good strict um so it's\nBut I Do think it's going to come down to which guy\nGets to their specialty gift to start their stuff specialty first doesn't as much as it would be cool to see again\nThey're cutting them kind of challenge themselves in towns are opponents in their respective disciplines it is going to come down to can can Connor land that that massive left you know and then I Know this whatever what I'm saying but and and and it's it seems obvious but his troops and those are the most obvious and now this is the correct one and if you can cope with this ends early or or later\nTire McGregor out pounded on the ground then that's kind of like you're going to see but um yeah do I think that ... amount of sleep that much more well rounded giving an advantage I don't know I still think it's it's a kind of an old fashioned ... versus striker Russia\nAnd you know ... and for those that and talk about the craft grappling versus striker matchup obviously the strikers about keeping on on his feet\nAnd and controlling distance connections with his hands and to a lesser degree with chips you know for the for the ... he's got to take that risk he's gotta close distance and a lot of times the way he has to do that you know is he has to play the strikers game and then he asked issue\nAnd when you shoot as a graphic blur you expose yourself in many ways to the striker and that can prove very very costly if you take a shot and you don't get it was a strike or as devastating as Conor you could be in real trouble so\nGoes through the battle of striker versus Rappler\nJoe yeah you're absolutely right because you can just look at their back on that I was last three fights with Raul convincing win\nBut it's not like he just kind of came out the gate and you know did I did an entry level lifestyle you know double lake takedown drop it got to know it takes them all it takes them a bit of time it's kind of get set up\nFigure out the distance he he's gotten hit Michael Johnson hit him a proposed to hit them eloquent to all these guys kind of hit him I Know how much damage they did that's that's debatable some people thought he got ... some people thought he took the hits very well I'm I'm kind of the camp that he has a better chance and people thing\nBut yeah for sure if it's what what's great about him that he has a variety of ways of six people without sweet doesn't necessarily need to be able to get that shot and just and he and he doesn't necessarily need to be getting close but either way to the fact that if we can be getting close I mean his ability to ... people down drag them to them that\nIs is a whole second to that and he's also just freakish strong I think people look at him and he doesn't have one of the most impressive leaks about a hundred and fifty five pounds he is I Would argue he's probably one of the three strongest guys in the lightweight division that stuff that just based on results I I don't know about you know how much he let things like that so\nHe's going to it's going to take time he's absolutely going to be in danger for the opening minutes of that fight a ... and and when you're in the you know when you're that risk danger zone against corner McGregor for certain you can get knocked out I doesn't matter how does not operating a wrestling as as you say you have to find a way to get in there now I think if you will\nBut anyone pending against him there they they have certainly are they have good reason to think that ah McGregor could avoid to pick up completely an end to what he always doesn't lend up big punch\nAlexander came early and then they fighting joining us here on SB Nation radio and on the side dot com insider line of a preview and UFC two twenty nine ... the main event working our way back\nNow obviously everybody talks about Cano knows that there are a couple of weeks ... great striker preeminence striker in may today a you know I think his takedown game and his grappling game in general is\nPretty limited also salmon there's always an issue so is convened gonna wanna kinda stretch this fight it out and get it into the championship
