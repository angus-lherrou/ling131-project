a sellout UC ... they do NFL players they both protested during the national anthem mayor now apparently fighting air agreed the Panthers went after eagles player Malcolm Jenkins this was on the field before the game we had to be separated before I came to blows\nApparently this all has to do with Jenkins the players coalition Jenkins wanted to stop the protest if\nThe NFL made donations to causes that players supported great idea right\nYeah well yeah we want to try to\nYou know affect some change in our society things that we've been protesting the NFL says okay how about we write a check for Ninety million dollars Ninety million dollars and knock them Jenkins says boy that sounds like a great idea what to do that what's put that towards charities that can benefit these communities that we're talking about right\nOn because that's where it started ... said it was about not only police brutality but systemic races right era greed and like that because apparently now Jenkins is a sell out and he didn't like the current capital was excluded from this whole conversation now after the game\nMedia caught up with him I don't understand what do you mean you mean ... they're agreed who played with cap in San Francisco I took the name of them yeah\nSo is he doesn't like what Jenkins did because he's just\nThey're agreed who played with cap in San Francisco I'm took the name of them yeah so she doesn't like what Jenkins did because he's a sellout yeah he did and\nWhat have Kaepernick come to the meeting because they excluded cabinet from the meeting yeah then he's a sellout right and he picked up caps cause for his own sort of notoriety [laughter] yeah so that's a long and short of it okay\nWhen I was actually\nIt was\nA black in America would be relatively Khan who's\nA neo

problem right with Ninety million no you instead should stay angry yes how's that accomplish anything I don't know ... well I don't know Ninety million is going to do anything either but maybe it will\nI think Ninety million could do something I mean yeah it's when you think about how much money the league rakes in every year could do a little bit more yes but Ninety million dollars is better than nothing better than\nWhat captain is we're born is that's that's what's been lacking all this time is money donor I problem man that money would just come through but I had nothing to do with his father's not involved in the inner city that has nothing to do with it it's a lack of funds and so once the money comes in all the problem solved\nOkay well at least it's a start right because that's what they wanted ... but that's not a good enough for very greed and less capture next involved I guess so yeah most everybody's mad over time okay\nAnd they were agreed you know tweeted about that too you know who gave it the big thumbs up and re tweeted cap ... of course\nYes of course he did it was a rough day uh for one person yesterday in the NFL and that was the lady carrying or at least during the sideline reporting for the NFL Network most of the sharks\nAll yeah she's given a wide report ahead of the chargers titans game gotten nailed in the back of the head by a football but I you

migrant caravan but also Michael Cohen is back in the news and shooting back in the news because he's saying vote democratic\nWhat's really funny about those who is that Michael Cohen on the campaign trail was basically told to not talk to any media anymore because he wasn't credible according to the same media now that says oh look what are your study does everybody to vote Democrat\nAre ways to help these people in these different countries but part of it is you can't fix an entire country I mean you're talking about decades and centuries of corruption\nA low employment poverty you you can't fix everything I don't know what to play from the left is on this entire situation because it's going to break bad against them and just a few we have\nWell if you have thousands of people showing up at different ports of entry and trying to get in demanding entry and you see the chaos there ah that's not Trump's fault\nNote that\nWho laid out the red carpet for this time because it's also not\nProceeding in an orderly fashion if you have thousands of people going through a trying to go through these ports of entry like this he looks chaotic because it is you scandal of bottled over the gate yeah because you're you're right you're trying to have\nA whole lot of people overwhelming system with the hopes that some people will get in here illegally absolutely well we'll see where a all of that goes I'm\nMichael Cohen's in the news [laughter] I don't know quite why but he is\nSo Michael Cohen he's flipping again we're flipping after flipping after flipping because he's back to being a Democrat now in CNN caught up with him and he had a message and it's very important for America year\nOkay the old flipper [laughter] All right Michael for what's the deal\nWith my own mind\nAlready we aren't\nYour family and friends neighbors\n[laughter]\nOkay when he was speaking on behalf of Trump was not credible but now that sound clip is everywhere today [noise] that's just the way it rolls man that's just the way a rolls\n[noise] um [noise] also wanted to get to Lindsey Graham switching gears here to the story about Saudi Arabia\nAnd the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman NBS sir I told your nose to call him is that I don't know that's what all the hip kids column toll NBS or because they're trying to stay away from the name um\n[noise] no I think it's just a shortened version of it is okay I really I I don't think it's that because it doesn't sound too close to bin Laden now I I ...\nI really don't think that's it I'm sure that that's the hip way to bribe his name on Twitter got it that's where it's come down to so South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham hopping mad today about the killing of democracy ... and now the Saudi crown prince NBS used people in the western world it looked like in the kingdom was turning a corner on human rights [noise]\nAnd that's not a recent development I mean come on so this was on Fox yesterday ...\nThis is the most in your face move on many ... maybe ever find it impossible to believe that the crown prince was not involved so grand for him and his inner circle on he's done to me I never felt more used a minor news didn't when he was in Washington who\nHe's coming back into owning it at least he's saying look I thought this guy was actually turning the corner and you find out but he's going to hit squad to kill a columnist with the Washington Post\nAllegedly hell right allegedly right we heard [laughter] All right up to represent over the country yesterday talking to Fox News well saying that these things had happened they were some people would just went broke\nMe I Know Fifteen came in at the same time one of them went wrong there are going to talk to the guy you also had a body double apparently leaving me a consulate yes\nJust wait and row is really it was an organic murder um but anyway Lindsay on\nA and I will never go back as long as these there we'll never convince me that he didn't do this in our ... is on I mean something and I think it is and I look forward to working with the president to find a solution to this but I'm not going to be underway Everytime you look at the other way and the ... when the Taliban Durante regret and so there's no looking away from me\nAnd to grandma's right about that every time you look the other way once\nGets a whole hell of a lot worse later on well and now he's got a buddy with Rand Paul saying this guy should be replaced\nThis crowd and Brent yeah I really wonder what he means by that because he's a Rand Paul's been one of the guys who is very much been\nAgainst you know regime change nation building all of that ... but he says it's time for him to go\nIt's insulting to anyone who's in analyzing this with any kind of intelligent background to think that oh a fistfight led to his them are met with an saw so no\nI think we really need to continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia and how long a serious discussion about whether or not they want to be an ally or they want to be an enemy products will certainly the crown prince was involved and then he directed this and that's why I think we cannot continue to have relations with him [noise]\nOkay so long conversation but at the same time you already know yeah I mean\nBone saucer yes can't have it\nAnd so I think it's going to have to be replaced frankly but I think that ...\nI mean bone saucer yes can't have it\nAnd so I think he's got out to be replaced frankly but I think that sanctions don't go far enough I think we need to look at the arms sale because this is not just about on this journalist being killed it's about the war in Yemen where tens of thousands of civilians are being killed\nAbout them spreading hatred of Christians and Jews and Hindus throughout the world I mean thousands and thousands of men draw says teaching radicals violence against the west the Saudis have not acted as our friend and they need to change their behavior\nThat that part was

middle eastern\nMedia got no time journalists gets killed you got to be stopped and I understand no one wanted to see that absolutely but it's interesting what gets chosen to be covered heavily and

is that you know they were forced to leave so this is all this all walk this guy doesn't get much said if it's just simple case of\nSouth Park with fighting something in the budget but there's no way that they yelled has the potential Africa for other people off with a Walker was if I had it for for cabinet secretaries who have been critical of him in the last couple of months three a federal letter last\nSaying that basically the restoration lacked integrity what I was a way to avoid scrutiny about what a Walker for sort of ... things that get half of them having\nA diverse thought a cabinet and that he's got no problem with that and he's you know the example of duties actor forward here the secretary bark outweigh the here so we want to raise the gas tax and he won't do that without a clear cut the world they all get free for the people\nProtect our colleagues say he has somebody want to raise the gas tax and he won't do that without a profit and cut somewhere else fails you always can be straightforward the people with gossip so you know in both cases it seemed like they advocated okay the question is do\nEither of those two attacks ended up at of paid media campaign that become a paid defining issue the racing clothing we\nAll right John you know you a drug that wouldn't lose and they commercially made out of the moment with a candidate Mary Burke\nAnd um I Do remember that are about defining plagiarism and and she and a bleak steering the peace and was silent for a long time in the room that all in an ad news when you didn't forget I mean it was pretty pretty darn packs a punch\nDominance and that's the thing is it's the sauce lot of these things or not it's not simply the attack itself ...\nJust like we've talked about what to say it's not necessarily the debate of who wins or loses because both folks do typically say just how to respond and do you provide a moment a gaffe that lives on emphasizing that your campaign is over\nSo there was no I knew Jack Kennedy you're no Jack Kennedy moment\nNo not really um but you know Governor Walker I mean remember you know I ran for president because I was Fifteen he's been on stage with\nKim or how many Republicans at one time was sixteen or Seventeen they had I did like a big stage a little stage even all that kind of thing so he's been in the spotlight before it is to save his run for governor to ... you know a pen fourteen twelve so you're there for campaign statewide he's willpower to these things I'm\n... years has run statewide before up several times but not nearly the scrutiny with a deep you had to pay to hit with a good one for both cases they defined\nFiring well my dad used to ask a G G R when Iran or what do you do to create excitement and uh it sounds like both candidates are trying to create some excitement bringing presidents to tone correct\nYeah I mean let's start with Trump first it's you know President Trump is coming to both of which is up by ... sauce what I've been told\nBy Republicans is that if you look at polling numbers and the loss of markets they're not quite where Walker wants to be right now are nice and that the so having Trump go there and make sense\nAlso don't forget there was this kind of Saddam out of the Trump voter a northern and western Wisconsin that's a help President Trump went Wisconsin two years ago this is a way to fight those folks and also you know don't forget that President Trump is not very popular with suburban women\nAnd where we had the votes of her but when the Wisconsin Milwaukee suburbs and Trump is not going there that's probably for a reason because\nYou have a risk with President Trump made in my career covering politics a presidential visit for a campaign is like media gold right President Trump is always at risk of what he said it offends somebody where am I to go off the rails and so you know\nJust sort of like the Milwaukee media covered the same but the difference in their backyard going up the most I mean\nI Would add up there and you have\n... coming out on friday for Democrats in general and Tony Evers um a lot of talking twenty seen about the turnout Milwaukee and that there it was down there that help explain Hillary Clinton's losing Wisconsin by twenty seven thousand votes for the lesson that I mean\nOn one of the great untold stories of the twenties election with God so that it wasn't just walk he that was a problem with Democrats if you were a kid rural districts and go look at the president's result\nHillary Clinton click cratered\nIn western northern Wisconsin districts where I Would normally see us of a democratic nominee gets a forty five percent easily made forty seven percent [noise]\nShe was getting like thirty nine percent thirty eight thirty seven it it just shows you the lack of appeal that she had been rural areas of Wisconsin so for walkie look out all the focus ... that's a big profit that our car was it five Democrats or years ago\n... says it by Obama to Milwaukee is the whole idea is\nYou're going to do if there was the estimate of walking media markets among Democrats\nI don't know how much more juice they can get but let's be honest you know this is a a present at a certain appeal the Afro American community that other kind of lack I mean it's like Twenty years and go into that and say hey you know I'm going to fire in a way of ... Ken writes committed to\nTheir health because I've got up and down the ticket for president come in the Milwaukee or a week and a half hour watches it\nSo that was happening on college campuses too so I think there's a theory on that one as well\nAbsolutely young voters Bernie Sanders is on the people walking campus this morning you know he's got an appeal for being a guy whose Seventy seven give or take\nHe's got an appeal with college voters he was trying to use those guys that had to I mean it's all about Suzie as getting people to the polls right now the point where the messages are are kind of fake then\nI don't know how many new ones you might see a foul ten days fourteen days barring a gas\nYou know uh but you're really at this point about Suzie as in a delivery people to polls and that is all geared toward\nWe're talking a junior raw string with politics dot com and let's talk about the President Trump really is is typically what he does I thought it was he a usually has an auditorium to this is an airplane hangar is there a spot on why that why not take it to a an auditorium up there\nYou know I'm not sure like what alternative available up there it's probably easy an easy out with the airport I don't know\nI think that's the airport they banned it in part because of the traffic going into the sand valley golf resorts for central Wisconsin they may be only once they get off of that area to handle it says it's a plane\nUm Green Bay as a place for the president probably still doing well so you want to go where he can help it looks like this is the area to do something most health and Wisconsin\nAre you there are two other big debates over the weekend one in uh for the first CD the Paul Ryan open seats\nAnd it was between really brazen and Brian style the other was a for US Senate between a incumbent Toomey Baldwin and her opponent a un or a state senator leader who mirror I'm using to report in either of those\nTowns you know set ... it was interesting in that you could tell that leaves ... each other Christmas cards over there that the best of friends they don't see eye to eye on things and there is a\nI don't want to say content but certainly they create on each other it seems like whether if I say it was only a threat to have them at a table by crocheted like literally two feet away from each other ...\nAnd in the course of it they you know that kind of whatever word you want to use it they feel toward each other that came out several ways um their pets exchanges but again nothing that you go okay that's a change the dynamic of this race and looking at TV buys it\nAnd if ... report I'm not seeing a groundswell of independent groups coming here to leave work near\nOr the final weeks now and we still have two weeks from tomorrow things could change but I'm just not seeing the money I Would expect to\nFor the final weeks now here we are all things could change but I'm just not\nSeeing the money I Would expect to see if this were a race that was truly a play it looks like it's just not getting the attention that I don't see that changing their barring barring something different to stop for just change the dynamic for the last two weeks\nAnd uh the first CD is that the closest congressional race in our state or is\nThis the uncool or I'm a Glenn Grothman race up there as well\nThat's a good question of the first gets a lot of attention because writing phrases raise so much money I mean he is north of I think seven million dollars raised as a last summer I ever seen the first time health care that want to gossip raise that kinda money at that time period that we've also fall through\nFor the six billion dollar Soviet Haley had\nBut wait a minute a Governor Scott Walker is a upper education wasn't he always for education threes you know what you're saying well\nYou know what I'm saying is when a currently in school three point five sailing unless and if they had than at twenty eleven levels when you cut\nA trillion it well I think it's something like a A R a billion dollars out of education and he's putting ate hundreds and in fact in\nAll it certainly is the education governor but you know it took me and the is the closer we get elections day and the court and the more they realize that the agenda that they then governor and if you could call it that the last several years ah you know that that\nBasically people or so teams we we really get out and buy\nSome of the Democrats because they since an issue like we think preexisting conditions should be covered recent that our schools are important that should have more money and and we have parks current with probably a bad deal for a lot of the state if suddenly the Republicans that oh you know\nThey're out there and they're going to fix the roads and very very critical already cover pre existing conditions which is a technically true but really kind of a live and we can talk about that\nBut you know federally their own agenda isn't looking very good and the campaign on our issues in what way up to hope for\nIs that people have short memories you know I mean you can all they know all they have to do is four and half of the people to with it I I actually took the hope that people have longer memory than that and that following what they've been doing closer than that\nRight well let's go back to where you see we can talk more about that and that is on preexisting conditions are the Republicans are have a lawsuit do they not on a Obamacare\nAnd a dad used to take down mama care which includes the coverage of pre existing conditions correct\nYes side there say yeah I'd say so they're technically right when they go around as they are now say pre existing conditions that are covered\nTheir their rights because they haven't been able to get rid of the NCAA yet but they refused to stop that law and and get a similar thing called on that but they're not going to stop and think that Governor that I think it was to see them yesterday\nThat he wants to just talk about repealing record\nUh I I guess I don't believe all her one minute that they're going to replace anything and you know this year will be covered for pre existing conditions in the details there and the governor no state Senate is not going to pass\nAnything that requires insurance companies to cover pre existing conditions what we'll do is they will go back to a very expensive program we had before\nUh that people with a pre existing conditions good insurance and the market can apply but that doesn't mean they necessarily grab a\nHigh risk pools rang\nYeah the high risk pools and you know I had this woman ... too but that's an old woman she has a two and a half year old who had\nYou know I had this woman ... he says professional woman she has a two and a half year old who had heart surgery the force he was too and he gets here singer I see some teams already got a pre existing conditions for life\nWhether it's often times there is a tough to you know pre existing conditions but you know we're going to have\nUm what what we're going to pay out you know in terms of a a code over the years that said uh how do you know what's going to happen to a two year old in the theater who had artistic\nOr people who've had cancer you know they don't know sometimes with the three since they're gonna do murder so\nAnyway they said that they are technically through when they say things are covered now they're doing their best to get rid of that coverage or for that fully no way that I I don't see any proposal that the state senator has said they would pass\nThat would cover everyone as far as they set up we cover pre existing condition okay\nWell you're a leader who we're a former colleague of ours the assembly no a state senator or she said she would a jump in front of a truck if it meant to uh to keep a coverage of preexisting conditions apparent for him she said that\nYeah yeah well frankly I think there's a lot of people with what I'm all about that I said\nNo no anyway someone someone has\nGot us She's a really clear every time we try to require insurance companies to cover some rules that hundreds of parents want it to the capital and said you know what am I covered for\nA cochlear implants are weighing the the uh the\nOral cancer therapy was very popular against her ... she found so for me is that government should have any role in regulating the market or requiring that something be\nUm you know that there be covered six fend it is a highly a matter of you were basically a lot in terms of whether you could afford to buy the insurance that's out there\nI just was listening to uh meet the press and the price of gas and the president is rising in the polls is that a surprise to you and why do you think that is\nHere as well because we know he'll say anything now these telling him that he better start talking about a middle class tax cut\nBecause ah people were upset with the you know they they know that Democrats and expose the what happened with the last tax cut ... who went to\nAn ... you know I I Know that's the food and the ... why do we do I guess I tend to ... what what are we deal with people I go to a pool and believe\nIt or what are they not understand about government for instance they know that he can't unilaterally people I talked to\nBite into on top of that or the Congress is not going to be back to vote on something like that\nUntil after the election you there's three possibilities here three said he said this didn't understand that they aren't going to come back ... vote on it number two is that he knew that he was lying when he said it that he was going to provide this tax cut I which one do you think it is\nEven men don't think the man knows when he's lying and Lenny Bruce I think he makes things that goes along and unfortunately\nGet bailed out by you know the rest of the Republican Party um but I don't know you know he can't guarantee a tax cut when they do come back\nI don't they could fight forever and whether or not this is going to be a tax\nCut to the middle class why didn't they did that the first time around right right it's kind of like with with Walker you know saying that now it gets so governor and he's going to fix the roads and all of that well I didn't know what the last ... years why suddenly if people want to believe what these people are saying just before the election\nWhen the evidence you know people hopefully one bad for the evidence is that for years they've been in a position to do something about it and didn't work\nYeah ... good questions and ah I've got a I got a pulling a ... permission to chemo from NBC poll\nOr over the last hour or so and I want to rent or buy and the question is what you uh do you think Republicans and then what do you think Democrats do best I'm going to run those findings by him right after\nThis oh go way families got more
