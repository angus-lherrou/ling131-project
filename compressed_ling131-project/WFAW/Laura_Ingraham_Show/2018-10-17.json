was the Saudi conflict basically right in Turkey\nNever came out went to get a marriage license never came out or it looks like he was murdered he's been very critical of the crown prince ... as as

media have been blaming Donald Trump for the death of Jim all\nYou were waiting for the next sort of crisis as far as the media goes\nA part of that is the horse phase comment more of that is that getting right and then there's this and it's not like anybody in the United states wanted to see this guy die course not and there are different tales of how brutal this death was allegedly yeah\nBut as far as the media is concerned this is first and foremost right now what are you going to do President Trump\nWe've got a president that has already named journalist has been the enemy of the people so don't be surprised and other countries take on a journalist murder thing\nHere a heavy [noise] sort of not in a way to say it's okay then you wonder\nIf enemy of the people rhetoric has anything to

led the night but definitely down\nFrom where it had been where the ... they view was of the ...\nWell then I think that we also agreed that it was going to get a spike it'd be the first week out of\nCuriosity yes so I think there there are sort of patting themselves on the back right now because they won the night and also ah because they basically stayed on part of where the series ended\nYeah but if it is but this was probably the high mark that that would have been my yes you know and again from not seeing it there was playoff baseball on last\nNight time remind me or you want to do this now are you gonna wait we can wait OK I'm Still not over [noise]\nThe Astros are done ... oh my gosh Mr give up again let's just gone on for I don't know how many years they're not done or

your wish I did get my wish unfortunately it was in a huge playoff game in type situation yeah they're done no off\nMore on that a little bit later what is the story with we'd coming to Wal Mart

that\nHim an ultimatum and it does sound like the stereotypical millennial but yeah I mean there are other money on the show ... ... am I wrong\nI I don't like me you're saying those things as a millennial I I agree with Jamie that I'm ashamed that that's how they perceive us but I get right I guess you're not wrong [laughter]\nYou down to stay out just what you guys heavier coping little meeting here I Want to be all denial I Want to pretend it's not true\nAlthough I guess out of the three of us here the one who really moved back in with mom and pops right Jamie when I was Nineteen

don't know a part time job at pay less ... you know yeah yeah yeah I'm On the street will give him some seed money will start 'em off with a nice old Honda Civic or something and\nAn either way just just so you know I was\nBack out of the house at age twenty [laughter] All right [laughter]\nI was just I was just kind of pointing out\nThat you might actually be the most millennials person on this show and you're not a millennial were mom and dad helping cover the bills when you were out in\nTornado hang on staff no uh-huh no even when I was going to school at uh work at pond though [laughter] I had a bus tables and\nWash dishes ponderosa [laughter] that sounds like such a such a tough life their Jamie that's so hard\nI guess it would have been easier to rack up thousands of dollars in a bad and party like some people but I chose not to do that\nI didn't rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars in that I had a job I also did rack up that though I didn't say hundreds that I said thousand dollars in ragged Benny you didn't ragged thousands of dollars in debt did you Greg\nWhat now [laughter] I had a job but I'm right you had a good time I party do yes\nExactly so I'm saying but most millennial person give me a break I'm I'm just saying mhm yes but I don't think anyone's\nBuying that but hey mad at school yes I moved back in for a year it was it was pretty nice my mom just my laundry or scrape the cooking was fantastic free cable step to smoke\n[laughter] yes\nMy brother and sister will still bring that up occasionally that was a\nJoke you know I understand ah there's a story making the rounds I'm Crazy about it\nBeijing late that was a joke and I understand\nUh there's a story making the rounds I'm Crazy about student serving cookies\nOh this is out of Davis, California a couple of students had to venture charter academy high school they served at some cookies made with one of the students grandma's ashes\n... remains cookie oh that's what they read and to the hand them out to a few students and they start telling everybody about it like hey I can you believe they ate the cookies\nSo they were passed out on October forth but it didn't make the news until this week because parents just found out about it okay go do this is like a prank all use a grandma's Ashley yeah\nThat is terrible chocolate chip grandma I that's what they were serving up there [noise]\nSo the parents then a couple of parents talk to Fox forty in Sacramento about this I'm In the school district has been keeping this very very quiet so here's the students whose face was blurred out all of their faces for blurted out because they're afraid of repercussions from the school they're retaliation from the school district\nBasing burned out his voices hilariously lowered I Know it's not a funny story it's a dark story but I kind of chuckled when I heard this but this is where you live yeah\nGirl going around\nGoing or reward earlier this morning she brought these ... miners who remembers the borders were\nOkay to email Darth Vader I had brought him cookies made well the ... All right I mean it was like weird [laughter]\nMake sure I get to straight this guy who's in power got dark going [laughter]\nAll this stuff it's it's ... fearing repercussions\nFrom the district or classmates based on\nThe district version of itching they said from the district because his parents are mad\nOr because the school made him sign a statement about what happened and then the principal there apparently or somebody in the administration told them to not tell anyone about oh\nSo they're afraid that this the school district's gonna come after him or something like that got it out for so the parents also talked about at their voices sadly we're not lowered but their faces were also blurt out\nOkay [laughter]\nWell played the clip people are going to figure out who the\nParents are the voices all if you watch the video I mean she's wearing a pretty distinctive shirt and her hair color is pretty recognizable well they were in the kid's voice than right at well the kid has like a big who is a\n... bike afro hair styles so it's obvious if you were at that school you know who these people are exactly\nIt blew my mind and I was I was really Ramon than I was you know the fact that you know they I wasn't even notified\n[noise]\nHow I Would never know [noise] ...\nDistrict seems to be a little bit more concerned about protecting themselves then protecting their students [laughter]\nGosh it's\nAwful sound the cops are not going to be pressing and or they're not going to be pursuing charges against the students\nThis was the surprising part of the whole story to me ah Davis police department a lieutenant Paul Dora shop said we're lemon school handle the matter with the juveniles in the family it's basically under California penal code a public nuisance\nOr somebody else's ashes that's just a nuisance apparently now they're trying to verify the cookies were contaminated but the department doesn't plan to have these uh been they're not going to have the cookies tested he said the evidence is based on interviews and whatnot\n\nThere or cookies that still exist from this batch apparently yes\nBut the yeah the lieutenant said there is an obscure penal code section in California that basically prohibit certain disposal of human remains but it's sort of unconventional I think that law was written with a different intent\nI don't know what to say it come on man\nYou can't you can't dispose of human remains into food can you do you see a lawsuit come into the school you yeah so well at least against the people involved in creating these cookies if there are no criminal charges for coming out of our mission I'm assuming\nThat there will be some sort of civil lawsuit that's brought against them because jeez man you fed me grandma [laughter] as the ... right\nYes they are heroes okay ah another separate story by the way early you can't have plastic straws but you can't grandma's in California it's a nuisance things we wanted to do and one of

free is Robin ...\nWe've learned he's never had a job interview before knows always falling into gigs which true seemed like it [noise] um\nWe are going to get to the audio of Charlotte Pence talking about just the political spotlight being on her how is it good of the vice president deals with that you know we go back to that tone just a second he's fallen into it\nLike accidentally fallen into jobs you know I Know I mean I don't want to make sure we clarified bad guys you know\nI go it's falling into these jobs you know like I'm Forrest Gump or something oh you're All right [laughter] I'm Sorry that I didn't choose I don't know it's OK I'm just a little sensitive today a lot of times it was me somewhere wanting you to come along that is true\nCow Ali\nSo since you've never been in a formal quote interview ... they were this was just released\nThey asked people you know about job hunting and and the job market's good there's a lot of interviews going on what are the hardest question did you hear about what might be a part of exercise maybe I ask you a question may be asked David we could even ask a great college\nAnd then they have the other two guys rate their answer if they thought it was stock\nThey thought it was really good morning I'm under this generationally too so okay a scout Robin ... what would you say your weaknesses are oh jeez how much time do we have okay I don't think you want to answer it though I Know I'm die but my weaknesses or lack organizational skills mhm I'm\nGotta know windows shut up where you're killing it and I don't think quickly on your feet\nI can find the exit door quick [laughter] you're just ... you don't\nWant to mess that went up no I I Am but again I Want to be honest I mean I don't I'm not an\nOrganizational skill the person you know I Would say that's fine and David from hiring people in the past would you say if that's the answer especially for a\nJob like you would be applying for like on a radio show and he just says that but that's pretty much the biggest thing the organizational thing yeah there's a problem no I'm saying that's probably a good answer to that that's the biggest thing and just stop there yeah maybe although that would be a red flag for may cause you have to be kind of organized\n... depending on the position that you have right\nI don't know a guy made a pretty good career out of it and he's right to use one of the least organized people I've ever been around you\nAre absolutely correct you surround yourself with who are organized [laughter] ... that's another way to do right now I mean only ... yeah\nI mean go to people who are good at it a or whatever and kill your the hell out of them yes um why should I hire you\nHere's the thing I'm best there is I wake up every morning on his excellent ... nights rip off\nHere's the thing I'm best there is I wake up every morning on his excellent ... rip off not getting getting [laughter]\nFor the answer though I mean that's the one where you almost have to sound brag eat to answer it right to ... that I mean that's just the reality of the situation\nI'll just say actually will Jamie it's because I'm a dedicated to human player and I really like to take God as many projects as possible and try to make this team function like a well oiled machine\n[noise] I'm I'm thinking about different guys that have worked with over time but I don't want to mention names but there's one guy that I Know I think you would answer it this way it would be\nTotally acceptable why should I hire you ratings do you want them or not [laughter]\nThat's a great answer [laughter] uh okay we'll bring in ... college uh Craig tell me about yourself\nBut this is a hard question to answer because why would you want to know you can't just tell me tell you about me okay\nLarry defense attorney and I I wanted clarity before I'm playing the role I'm not in the rural yet he was curious what's weird about this is and again these are the hardest questions people said\nThat they hear in interviews now is I've seen you in an interview ... and you did great\nMy thank you get really good way I Would answer that question in an interview for a job in radio I guess I Would say I really enjoy being part of radio station I really like working radio I launched a pod cast company because of my obsession with being part of the you know that world so that something about me I played fantasy baseball and collect pump figuring\n[laughter]\nI'm a huge New York Yankee fan and we only pizza in New York pizza\nBack to Scott Robbins is is a tough one to navigate okay your boat on the spot job interview tell me about the worst boss you ever had\nOh my God [laughter]\nOh I've worked for some awful horrible people [laughter] I mean it's just bad guys\nWas what do you say to that question\nA boy the worst guy you ever ah they by name or just by you\nKnow just tell me about a\nBe rated you even bludgeoned you\nHe made you feel worthless on a daily basis or outside of that he was any bruises brains out [noise]\nUm yeah I bet outside of that though there are a great guy [laughter] [noise]\nNow does everybody think that would be acceptable but it was like ... the ... this this and this\n... that was that was him you know I've had great bosses but that you want to know about the worst that was ... I didn't give a line I'm David describe yourself in three words for sure you were going to say\nI ... actually [laughter]\nI was trying to figure best there is\nAlso comes up on them I don't think the three words all had to make a sentence\nThey don't they can fit your choice alright then fine winning and winning and winning [laughter]\nTo ... college if you could turn back time and live your life over what would you do different\nBut anyhow the army was understand because we hear this a lot they are confused when deeply religious people support President Trump because I mean every day we seem to have a different example has when I'm Out anytime\nOut [laughter] totally not by us interviewing hiring I didn't know I think it to I think\nIt's an interesting question from miles from camera can you hear that a lot and it's good that at least she has an opportunity to respond to the vice president's daughter has an opportunity to respond to this yeah like how to how do you square this sort of you know like right\nBrought up in a tweet certainly do with who accused and having an extramarital affair and he went after her name and none of these things are are things that most people associate with someone a deep faith so how do you square that\nShe didn't even say horse face no [laughter] no I think I\nI I actually wish but this question would be brought up to more people are not not just conservatives but also Democrats as well because I think it's an interesting ah topic because we heard just a couple of weeks ago Chelsea Clinton saying that people who don't support I'm Sorry who who support a ban on abortion or actually not Christian\nAnd I ... I find that to be an interesting angle was well oh yeah people are never challenged on yeah I mean okay I I Want to hear how she answers this question\nSting angle is well oh yeah people are never challenged on yeah I mean okay I I Want to hear how she answers this question\nFor me it's been a lot about on a personal relationship with people and I know that and that's what I think that in ... a lot in the ... and I write about in the ... when I first met with President earns is just really ... and doing now\nFamilies are really special Syrians and all the time for one another and it was very inspiring sounds kind of talked about that in the ... the very first time me when we first met with interfering sound like kind of a kind of\nGo in personal relationships and running around the time than in France\nAll right that's a dance she was dancing around that she did it pretty well gee what a gift from her dad yes\nI mean it's also true though right you should judge people by what you know about them when you meet them if you have the opportunity to meet them and now with other people say about them but\nThat is true but I mean you know as far as the tweeting some of the things that's happened\nYeah I mean\nI think one of the biggest mistakes that so many people in the media made was thinking that uh Christians that we're going to vote for Trump or supported them\nI'm actually thought Trump was a great guy and a role model not the people I Know they knew who Trump was asked to begin with but you're talking about\n... you know the platform that he had and what he was standing up for and who he was looking out for it's amazing there there's a lady she's so nice I'm just a great person banned because of the things that Trump has said and just who he's been over time she she couldn't stand them\nAnd we went through that exercise I forget what the website is David where you can go through\nWith each you know a issue politically you know and then we'll pick a candidate\nFor you the I side with right yes yeah\nYeah and so it goes through the whole thing who does she side with who is her candidate and this is during the primary with all the Republican you know it was Trump She was mortified\nNo because a lot of times it's no ... I may not like the whole act but there's a lot of good things that have happened over time that's what I think people fail on\nAlmost like real quick where the news earlier this half hour Heidi Heitkamp yeah ... this whole thing about the sexual assault survivors well they were fake these a lot of these women weren't sexual assault survivors\nYeah but she put it in a campaign ad that ran in a bunch of newspapers you know\nFor people that support her platform and her politics you think they're going to go the other side because of that uh one person interviewed by the AP said yes okay ... I'd want to her son right most will not they might stay away but it's still the platform I think that's that's part of it so thank you Greg did you have anything\nTo add to that I think it's also interesting that you mentioned are seeing the way he treats his family and I know that decides President Trump every so often about putting his kids in power positions more so than maybe other presidents have but when you think about that\nHe believes in his kids that is kind of an inspiring thing to see from the outside and you get to witness and learn more about how much they support each other I'm not saying that it's the right or wrong thing to do I just think it's it's another interesting comment she makes that seeing the support he has for those kids is you know inspiring they're\nSo coming from New Jersey you're saying it's very ...\nI'm not so bad for your family if you trust somebody outside the family you know they're going to if you trust the family are usually fine everything's\nGood but I see the way it treats the people you love what exactly he knows who they're supposed to be made whole I totally get that yes now to vain camps favorite story of\nThe day yeah yet a NASA astronaut Nick hey give is one you know kind of flew under the radar a little bit last week a rocket booster failed Baron or rocket editor heading up to the international space station that failed they had to make a crash landing basically\nAll right I'm Sorry the technical term is a a an emergency ballistic\nDescent while centrally falling with style [noise] uh and so ... again NASA astronaut who was on this rocket did this interview with NBC's\nTom Costello eggs are just describing what it was like to realize you're getting into space and you realize that Iraq is not going to get you there\nIt didn't feel quite right to it seems to be a little bit of an understatement\nUm ear training takes over and you realize that the thing that you can do to help yourself the most is to stay calm and execute the procedures as a team or I imagined that my first trip to outer space was going to be a memorable one uh I didn't expect it to being quite this memorable\nYou know you hear the sports talk\nAbout a guy man\nThat was a gutting performance yeah I mean dealing with the pressure of a free throw in the last ... seconds of game this is a different level it's a totally different slowly how can you believe that he\nPitched would obliterate Iran as my goodness what I've got a performance that was all this is like you know it's this do or die you got to say it is and this was a crazy part of the the the whole interview he said for a while as their plummeting back to earth\nHe had to eyeball where the landing spot was going to be because he didn't know if he was going to be landing in a different country he didn't know if he's going to be landing in the water and mountains and a desert no idea so he's looking out the window keeping an eye on things as they are plummeting back to earth\nWhile I have to tell you my eyes were ah were looking out the window trying to gauge exactly where we were going to be\nA were we going to end up landing in water where we're going to be a on the steps of Kazakhstan that we make it far enough downrange that we're in a more hilly mountainous terrain [noise] uh so we were you know I was looking outside trying to give our best estimate of where we were going to come down and luckily for us\nIt was a smooth flat terrain and ended up working out as a as a pretty smooth landing\nHey these guys have ice water and their veins don't they yeah you have to I think it's all over the weekend I drive through a little bit of a snowstorm through some mountains ... and I think I've\nTold that story with more passion in my voice and that guy sounds like right now he's the he's like basically he could be describing checking the mail but yeah I mean I wanted to make sure that uh you know we worry we weren't in a hilly region and just kind of had to make sure that maybe we had to clean a flat landing spot you know the training really kicked in so you meet this guy some time\nHe's telling you about landing like one time I was in the mountains it was snowing there I was white you know clearly a man who's pretty terrifying man let me tell you that would doubt that was scary gay and\nThen one time the airlines didn't bring me the right meal that I requested hold boy I was hopping mad I stayed calm now he did say it was really nice he said he didn't feel safe until he got to see his family until I got to hug his wife again but apparently it took some time to get a hold of the wife because we've talked about what happened right after the landing there making calls on the SAT on the satellite phone\nWere sitting there next to the castle after after we've landed and uh we're\nThe wife because we've talked about what happened right after the landing there making calls on the SAT on the satellite phone were sitting there next to the capsule after after we've landed and we're trying to make all the phone calls on our satellite phone that we're supposed to make and then after that we start trying to get in touch with loved ones\nOr so after Alexei was able to speak with his wife I called mind and ah unfortunately I went to voice mail so now she has a uh she's got a voice mail that she can keep a as a mentor for the rest of the rest of her life or did you learn the voice mail I told her I'm fine and uh it was it was a one wild ride\nThen I said why are you picking up you're not watching this this is my first time doing it in the outer space and not having a crash land distinct I didn't gain a lot of respect for the engineers who are responsible for this rocket travel 'cause I didn't realize that they also have to account for the weight that these guys are carrying around with a match made I mean this is crazy\nActually I don't know if you saw those truth there is um about this was all just promotion for the movie that came out on Gosling mom\n[noise] All right more ahead this is my main can't show\n[noise]\n\n\nWhat are they pretend to be ready to play a is everything
