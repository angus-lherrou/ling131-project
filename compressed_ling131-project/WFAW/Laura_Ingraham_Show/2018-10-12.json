for being here I'm Jamie ...\nIs David band camp we are in beautiful downtown Seattle it's ... studios\nThere real quick David we've talked to a lot of people in Seattle and it's a beautiful city\nThe big problem well there's several problems but one of the big ones is the homeless yeah the same as Portland\nAnd we also do this is going on in the San Francisco and there are homeless in every city across the country it's just getting to another level in these particular areas and part of it is because\nYou almost want to say it's welcoming to the home it's enabling well you also look at you know well intentioned but ultimately flawed ideas to try to help people\nFor example who are struggling with addiction you know you can get a clean needle but you can't get a plastic straw in jail yes one of those things you know you might have the Space Needle in a safe needle yes right it's\nCrazy yeah you know there's so many people have said it's not there or you know different places along streets you can't park your car but you could set up a tent right\nAnd then you know you you're walking to whatever destination and you're like okay I got to walk around you know ... these tents well there's a thing in the failing New York times talking about San Francisco and life on the dirtiest block there\nBecause they had some reporters go out and the story to tell is insane\nIt starts saying the heroin needles the pile of excrement between park car's yellow soup losing out of large passed a plastic bags by the curb\nAnd the stained folk Persian carpet dumped on the corner so it's like some developing world sort of problem yeah but it's in San Francisco\nOpen air narcotics market by day and at night is occupied by the un sheltered and drug adult slumped on the sidewalk to Fifteen minute walk to the offices of Twitter it Hoover me think about how much they're worth how much money is around that area\nBut you walk around this neighborhood you know hide street the tender line neighborhood saw the desperation of the mentally ill the drug dependent and the homeless and heard from in bitter residents who say will take much more than a room to clean up the\nSaw the desperation of the mentally ill the drug dependent and the homeless and heard from in bitter residents who say will take much more than a room to clean up the city\n\nOf public works employee uses a power wash or on a sidewalk and it has to do it every single day you know the clean up the urine and feces\nYeah well we've heard they are deploying new crews are pays somewhat decent way to go clean up human feces off the street\nYeah it's the proactive human waste unit\nYeah they say it was like get paid in the morning recent day mother's taking their kids to school walking so we ran into you on a warm reception is he works around the corner from my treat the sidewalk in front of her office stained with species street smelled like all the dream\nSince some parts of the neighborhood you're walking you smell it you have to hold your breath\nAnd she does it every morning hoses down the urine outside her office ... and the city installed five portable bathrooms for the hundreds of on sheltered people but it hasn't stopped people from whizzing indicating in the streets right\nAnd then I guess you had lamp post corroded by dog and human urine over the last three years did you hear that part of the story I have not heard that\nIt became a more urgent issue after a lamp post collapsed a couple of years ago crushing a car like oh my God we're going to have to replace speech from pi yeah just to roads and while\nMore common danger they talk about thousands of heroin needles discarded by users public works department and the nonprofit picked up a hundred thousand needles from the streets over the last year we so it sounds bad right yeah the public health department\nHas its own needle recovery program that any more alarming figure it retrieved a hundred and sixty four thousand needles in August\nAlone golly\nWhen it\nI don't understand what you're trying to do isn't working\nIt's crazy to me and they say\nYou know the at least the theory in San Francisco is we're keeping them all in this area so we are going to let the people come in and peddle the drugs and keep these people here because we don't want it to spread into the other areas as average just go more tourists these spots\nYeah but those out but housing there is not cheap\nI mean you're talking about ... and I just can't imagine\n... up and down a couple of million dollars for a place and you're stepping over needles in human feces\nNo no but that's not acceptable from talking to so many people here though isn't part of the problem well it's known as a place for the homeless to come to you know 'cause we'll take care of you yes you know there's also known as real quick the crack tree the ...\nPart of this story what is the correct three recent afternoon it says we dropped by a barber shop on hide street um this guy opened this job a couple of years ago to escape the high ranch of downtown San Francisco\nSince opening and he is going to gauge it in a battle with drug users in the neighborhood who break the branches\nOff at the tree in front of a shop and use the sticks to clean the crack pipes you know the harvesting of tweaks has killed the previous for trees so now the city has protected the fifth tree with wire mesh\n\n... is going on an everyday dude ...\nAt dawn crucially the city and private organizations arrived to pick up needles and trash and they get it cleaned up and then there's one resident said but by noon everybody jumping out and it starts all over again\nI don't understand how you just let that go and that's what the people in Seattle Portland or afraid it's it's getting more and more to that point\nAnd it's a real fear I mean and if any time you call that out your you know quote unquote demonizing people and you know it's never the intent no but you got to look around and people who do pay rent or pay your mortgage who are paying taxes who are living in these neighborhoods that are basically under assault right now\nWell and people wanting to give money to try to help the problem and help people but not enabled them to continue to be drug\nAddict right it's it's much I have another story declined to the ballot here okay Joe Walsh joy ... from the eagles not a fan of the rock and Roll Hall of fame TMZ caught up with him the other day and he ... he lives in Seattle ...\nAh they asked him about the list of nominees that was just released a while\nYou're dealing with nuts all the time heck no you don't want to advertise that if you take that case some nuts have money this is true some nuts have squirrels\nCompletely different story involving a flight or grandma got booted from one\nYeah Seventy one year old woman kicked off a flight after an argument over a garbage literal garbage or and you know over who was supposed to be taken care of the trash\nEllen Fleming is her name she was flying on air Canada back in August and now there is like a lawsuit pending here's a she found some trash in the seat back pocket so the seat in front of her you know she's putting something in that little pouch in front of her and she found some trash and this is what you told global news okay\nI'm going to put my water bottle independent from the front of me and I pulled her put my hand and pulled him and my my focus when independents when ...\n... yeah not only garbage ... gooey garbage ... just doesn't sound very pleasant here so Helen hall it was sitting nearby like behind her and across the row guy and she described what happened next\nYear and then he came in he ... he tried to rain he he didn't run\nFor my hand can find them and so on the way and and and down the garbage all over\nSo that you see saying hey can you take care of this garbage five ten it's like I'm not a garbage man I'm a flight attendant no I Can't take that\nShe service at its finest she tries to hand it to him he slaps her hand away garbage goes flying everywhere and he walked away\nNow the way she tells the story is that there's this big pile of garbage now at her feet and she wound up kicking him under the seat in front of her and then not long after that because the flight attendant reported it as a hostile passenger plane turned around and headed back to the airport\nAnd she's got a witness yeah no that's not how they just wanted yeah they said it was for the safety of the passengers because she was being aggressive when they landed the cop showed up and told her she'd have to get on a different flight you can be on this plane is what they told her airline claim that she also kept the flight attendant\nAlthough nobody is backing up that side of the story or including Helen the witness okay\nYou know saloon came to town of ... hearing the interaction you remember Mary I mean [noise]\nI keep an eye on that one uh-huh\nI Want to know how that works out it sounds like that they should be fired\nYeah or yeah she might she might wind up voting half the airport who knows\nYou know we'll see here's a question for a completely different but it has to do with flights that is say you're flying and all of a sudden a woman's starts giving yourself a pedicure you okay with that\nMan I've been on a flight where somebody was a turning their toenails\n[noise] not the end that's gross man 'cause it's because you know toenails can be widely sons have guns and you clip 'em and they can fly several feet in the air\nAnd I didn't get hit with a toenail that would have probably been a bad bad deal but it it is kind of gross trigger warning I'm about to say something sex is okay All right you just don't and it it's sexist [laughter] okay\nI have a way worse problem if it's a dude trimming his toenails that a woman ...\nI don't know why\nI don't know if it's because of different friends of mine and seeing their feet again specially say I don't want to embarrass my brother but my brother\nAnd I guess [laughter] you should have given the trigger warning for your brother man ahead of that one I'm not saying he's got ugly feet but he's got a feat\nBeing there and do the does our gross it's not just my brother is just do their feet\nYou know what I mean it would be worse but this woman on a plane was giving yourself a pedicure\nAnd the shaming started raining down [laughter]\nBecause she was giving herself a pedicure using a foot file you know the greater foot and yeah\nSomeone shares the video to the Instagram page passenger shaming and it's been\nViewed ball over a hundred and fifty thousand times the reactions are all over how is she even allowed to do that this gusting and I would have raised hell if I were sitting next to her\nYet another are you kidding me\nI Am seriously losing all hoping humanity I wouldn't go that far it's kinda gross but I wouldn't go that far oh here's another another guy either\nCall the flight attendant and half or tell the pilots have the cops meet them at the gate passenger was intentionally disposing of biohazard material on the plane\nThey're calling for somebody to Dr doubt that lady how\nOr another said what in the actual hell is wrong with this woman so wrong on so many levels\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\nYeah I I wouldn't find it questionable bad that I thought the outrage was actually pretty interesting yeah I think the the\nThe one thing that bothers me about all of that kind of stuff is is that somebody just took it upon themselves to film another private individual just doing something kind of weird and then that person's images all over the Internet millions of people saying the video for one moment of weakness\nWeakness I don't know it's the you're going to them hygiene actually you're trying to make sure that there are toes were nice and pretty\nSad hygiene for everybody else is getting the remnants right I mean she's trying to do something for humanity to save this needs to be\nStyle right okay I mentioned earlier that person going out on to Oregon mhm assignments Amy Winehouse the hologram tour next year man that's creepy to me that's why I bring it up it's you know and the thing is\nI Know I Know sometimes it comes across as insensitive to point this out she got more popular after she died\nA lot of musical artist I heard a lot of people saying oh what a powerful voice in all that did you buy any of her records when she was alive no okay that maybe don't have that take but she doesn't strike me even as the artist too big enough to really have a successful hologram tour\nLike I can get why maybe people would buy a ticket to see how a ground Michael Jackson I'm not doing it mhm or hologram Elvis or or hologram prints it's all creepy to me there's hologram deal\n[noise] I forgot about that which I don't want to see either no I don't want to I go out because you're watching the concert video yeah all you're

there's ... lanes daily uh been Cobain and Cornell that's not cool\nSo anyway it looks like some good movies out this week right\nYeah not too bad I mean we're starting to get into the beginning of the award season so to speak a word studios are going to start releasing their big contenders a and you know speaking of which we have first man I'm this is probably one of the bigger movies that came out earlier in the year it's a\nDirector Damien ... follow up to his Oscar winning la la land and it's based on true event story about the Apollo eleven mission to land on the moon and\nMore specifically about astronaut Neil Armstrong who's played by Ryan Gosling or the film starts in Nineteen sixty one spends a good chunk of time laying out everything that led up to the historical achievement\nAnd it doesn't go off some of the failures and the sacrifices that it took to get there and\nAlso spend a significant amount of time showing the astronauts home lives especially Neil Armstrong and his wife Janet who's played by Claire foie\nOr to give a better sense of what these men were like and what they were risking the missions are all sort of portrayed and harrowing claustrophobic detail and you really get a sense for how amazing this achievement was because of the technology that they had at their disposal\nUh it really feels I'm like ah they were just kind of cranking along on on tinker toys and um\nYou know damaged his al has won the Oscar for best directing for la la land he brought back the same Oscar winning composer and Justin her with the same Oscar winning cinematographer his Oscar nominated star and Ryan Gosling and the guy who wrote it also wrote the screenplay for the best picture winning spotlight a few years ago so\nYou know this one is gunning for that Academy Award and it's absolutely going to get some love around that time uh currently at certified freshly eighty eight percent and if you're going to see it I recommend seeing it on the biggest screen possible IMAX if you can because it was partially shot with IMAX cameras\nCool what about three to stay away from the fried the three D.\nOr I guess you could but um I I feel like the cinematography is kind of amazing enough that you don't really need the three D. uh but uh I didn't see it in three so I Can't speak to the to that experience and and tell you how how much of an improvement or a disadvantage it is\nYou have to remember the gosh I Can't even think of the name of it now with George Clooney a few years ago a gravity space movie\nWith Sandra Bullock\nYeah you're talking about gravity\nYes I forgot my way I it's vertigo issues and we went to see that like three D. I. max I'm like one in it I Am [laughter] bad bad decision but also this week is bad times at the el royale that looks interesting\nYeah that's actually a really great word for this movie uh this this is the latest from writer director drew Goddard and he's the guy who did this movie called the cabin in the woods back in twenty twelve um since then he's written scripts for movies like World War Z the Martian and a ten coal revealed lane\nBut this is only a second directorial credit uh it's kind of a twisted murder mystery that takes place over one evening in Nineteen sixty nine or at a motel on a lake Tahoe called the L. really out of course a\nWhere initially for strangers turn up looking for a stash of loop that was buried there ten years prior except that the the strangers aren't quite who they seem to be and the hotel itself has some secrets that are eventually unveiled and\nIt's kind of like Clinton Tarantino's the hateful eight a mixed with a little bit of something kind of like the movie clue [noise] um\nIt's got Jon Hamm Jeff Bridges Chris ... worth\nA and and an actress named Cynthia ... who is a Tony winning Broadway star she's great in this movie and we're actually going to be seeing a lot more of her in the near future [noise] um the movie is beautiful to look at the the motel set pieces and the costuming and all looks incredible\nEveryone is clearly having a lot of fun with the material and obviously drew ... has a way of playing around with a genre expectations and kind of twisting them around like he did with cabin in the woods\nSo that's a lot of fun I think my only gripe and and I don't think I'm Alone in this uh my only regret is that the movie feels a tad longer than it needs to be it's two hours and twenty minutes long\nA self pacing is a bit of an issue in some spots but I still thought it was a good time and it is certified fresh at Seventy two percent\nTalking with Ryan who's Johnny rotten tomatoes dot com um there's also goose bumps to where you just okay reviews right\nYeah it did actually reviews were a lot worse even up until last night but right now it's at forty two percent which is not bad\nUh this is a follow up to the twenty Fifteen had goose bumps that of course was loosely based on the various young adult horror novels are written by RL Stein that one star Jack Black as Stein himself and also as the voice of the central equipped dummy slap e who played a central role in all of that mayhem and the first movie\nSlap e is in this one as well ah so it seems like there's budding franchise may be built around him but he's not voice by Jack Black this time and there isn't really a lot of Jack Black in this movie which I think kind of works to its detriment or it's basically about a group of new kids who move into what turns out to be RL Stein child at home\nAnd they discover one of his old manuscripts they open it up and kind of the same thing that happened in the first movie happens and this one\nAh we're a bunch of monsters are at least in the world are from that book so if you're a pre teen who read some of the science books I think we'll probably find this entertaining enough uh after a certain point it it does just sort of feel like the same movie as the first one\nUh so I think that's why it suffers a little bit and also from the lack of Jack Black so it's at forty two percent but if you need something to take the kids to this weekend it's not a bad choice\nOne other thing Ryan real quick before we let you go um ... limited release this week the movie free so low\n[laughter] yeah that movie it is a documentary and it is\nA ...\nYeah and it's gotten really ah really impressive reviews I actually have not had a chance to see that myself\nUm and I think the critics love it I mean it's at a hundred percent certified fresh um but it's essentially about a mountain near who are basically a a tries to climb al ... in Yosemite National park or without a rope and it's all about his preparation\nAnd it's all about uh the journey that he takes to actually accomplish that\nEveryone says it's impeccably film and it's a really compelling story to watch and it looks beautiful uh so I think it's probably really worth of watch if you can get to it I don't think it's going to be in very many theaters\nAnd then if you've ever seen those companies I mean if you don't have a lot of room know buying the cash register and and listen I I sympathize because I worked in retail before\nWorked in restaurants and all that and your feet ache after a long day yesterday were standing all day and in a lot of ways to me I Would prefer to have a job like I'm a waiter where I'm walking back and forth whenever I work the cash register and you're just standing that ... it it does suck but that's the job\nYou have oh man when I worked at the music land in Nineteen eighty seven rocking the snake skin boots front of the register all day [laughter] during the holiday season yeah it ... your back as her down for a while\nAnd it's exhausting you know the different people buying crappy music that you just kind of look at him and say you sure about that [laughter]\nYes\nBut they're not the only ones who by the payout Wal Mart is in a bank of America just last year and about Fifteen million dollars\nBecause there was a lawsuit for tellers metro crazy to me yeah yeah that's the job you have to stand\nIn the world we live and no doubt about it that this is interesting clearly different but talking about the world we live in how quickly it's changed Steve Carell saying the office probably wouldn't work today because the sensitivity [noise]\nIsn't that isn't that crazy this was a in an interview with Esquire 'cause there's been talk about rebuilding the office office went off the air what twenty Thirteen\nAnd uh you know Jenna Fisher John present ski both open to the idea of rebuilding the office with the corral the boss on the show says I don't even think it's possible to do this show not in today's climate oh my gosh\nYou cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office of George Bush and Colin Powell [laughter]\nBecause there's a lot of jokes that wouldn't fly he said quote the\nClimate's different I mean the whole idea of that character Michael Scott so much of it was predicated on inappropriate behavior I mean he's certainly not a model boss so a lot of what has depicted on that show is completely wrong mind that that's the point of course but I just don't know how that would fly now\nThere is a very high awareness of offensive things today and I love the asterisk Betty has which is good for sure [laughter]\nBut at the same time when you take your character like that to literally doesn't work and isn't it weird that we've gotten to a point that that show started in two thousand five\nEnded in twenty Thirteen\nAnd already he's saying yeah today it's just a little dated usually you have to wait a few decades before you can say that right absolutely\nIf I was gay I wouldn't be the most flamboyant gay you've ever seen the lead lined up for re covering his feathers and [laughter] just be waving that rainbow flags [laughter]\nYou know he's probably right but again it's it's so few people that make the most noise yeah I talked to I don't know how many college students in the last year that's their favorite show\nThe office yeah there's been talk about whether or not friends would work today and that's the other one friends is problematic now\nOh and yeah I don't we don't just get along [laughter]\nAnd I don't hear any normal people saying that most of the time it's it's these high minded writers for different blogs right these people who think they're smarter than everybody else and this is why this show is problematic and we should watch it any\nOne is your problem\nThat it's offensive of cost off color humor and offensive is is funny\nWell and there was the ridiculous ... that was that was the whole part of it and it was almost like Michael Scott his\nHeart he was wanting to fit he wanted to do the right thing but he couldn't help himself where oh [laughter]\nYeah [laughter]\nOh buddy All right we've got are

how you do it on this program today we were going to take a look at the movie the first man\nAre a movie critic soul man I just came out today and and how he saw it but he did and he's going to review for us later on this hour but first we're going to talk to a colleague of mine an old friend of mine uh believe it or not ah he's the speaker of the Wisconsin state assembly Robin ... is how you doing now Mr Speaker\nI Am good Andy how are you I'm fine I'm doing well and I bring him down here and I sure appreciate your time because you know you're busy guy but I I like to get\nYour thoughts on the gold standard of the polls Marquette law school pool where did you take a look at it now and see what you think is that a deal can we do that\nI think it makes sense [laughter] All right well\nScott Walker has got to lead on a ... right now I Know you're knocking on doors for a lot of your ah members in what you want his new members I suppose uh is that what you're hearing people are happy with our governor\nYeah by and large if you look at the last poll which showed of course Tony ... up by five points you know down by one for the most important thing to me it's kind of the trend line so there's been a six point shift which is outside the margin of error over the course of the past month and I think a lot of that is because people are beginning to learn who Tony ... is is\nThe seats that he has in his house all the Republican side of the aisle seat soon to he's going well are you ... you can nervous\nOr only about three and a half weeks out to this is the time I think every candidate gets nervous because they've been you know going door to door talking to voters for probably six plus month and they just want it to be over with\nBut I also have seen a lot of polling in Wisconsin and by and large people are satisfied as the market poll showed with the direction of Wisconsin so as you know we're sixty four seats Democrats have thirty five and the assembly I think it's likely that we're going to keep a good strong majority the exact number it's too early to tell\nBut I feel like the candidates that were going door to door that their methods that they're spreading the ideas that they are offering for the next session are really resonating so I Believe in the end ah that we're going to be a Republican legislature and I think ultimately Governor Walker will be reelected albeit much more closely that I think it shouldn't be with us successes we've had in our state\nFox kind the further we uh we get from a ... area and do people like you are in the central northern Wisconsin as much\nI think there you don't make one of my second favorite president of course my number one is Calvin Coolidge what my second favorite is Ronald Reagan and his uh one of the phrases he always used with trust but verify\nSo I think this is a prime example where people have heard about all the jobs they\nHeard about all the opportunity and the new things that are coming to Wisconsin but they want to see the reality\nThough yeah statewide when people understand that not a dollar goes out the door until people would actually been hired and you know buildings are in the ground they generally are more than fifty percent supportive of it but if you just simply demagogue it like unfortunately some of our colleagues are doing\nI think that's when you have trouble so in the end I Know Fox kind of going to be great for our state I have no doubt that it's going to pay back and forth in spades with the amount of investment that we made but I also know that people will always he was an issue to try to win an election and this was an unfortunate example where they're taking a really good deal and try to make it somehow sinister\nMade but I also know that people will always he was an issue to try to win an election and this is an unfortunate example where they're taking a really good deal to try to make a profit after\nFinally I asked a Gordon who's ... and I'm going to ask you a is a you know what do you see the people you're knocking their door Robin or I tell you that my friend but\nThe speaker right but I Try to be ... to go the speaker was a when you ask for their votes why they should vote Republican this year or what are the things you highlight now you did already but I Want to ask you then because they want to be fair about it ah what do you say why do you ah want why you think people should vote on the Republican part of the ticket this year\n[noise] you know people ran for office and twenty ten because we had a massive deficit almost ten percent unemployment nurse day was spiraling downward mode ah it took some tough choices and now here we are with the ability to say the tuition frozen for now six here property taxes are lower than they were in twenty ten record investment in public schools\nAre more jobs than we can fill rising wages almost every single metric you look at we have done better than where we started and I think that's what you want now if you want to elect people who are going to go backwards and have all the same to base we had a decade ago uh they're going to go back and want to say should we have voter id or not\nShould we get rid of Foxconn should we put at ten you know a lot of the size place of history and give the unions back in charge I think all of those things have been litigated and they're over with I don't think people want to relive the path\nSo I think people want to look forward and that's why ultimately they'll chose Republican who have been positive optimistic solutions oriented and focus on the future not on reliving every single one of the arguments with that for the past decade\nAll right well and I finally ... games\nYou know I Wish I could I mean I I actually a

few moments with a soul man he uh went to see a first man I Am really interested in this one because uh\nUh some people are talking about how might win an Oscar too or ten and it looks pretty good story about Neil Armstrong's will take a look at that later on this hour we'll also have Brian Hughes Brian is the owner of ... in Janesville and if you need a place to go to a fish fry and watch the

fan and upset a and we're also going to talk to one of the funniest men even uh the state of Wisconsin stand up comedian do we Maxwell as regular on the program and he'll join us later on as well I brought this up before the break\nA what shouldn't you put in your a microwave well a number ... top can ah by the way nothing\nAnd their wives and children and mortgages and I mean all kinds of stuff that they they can't really forget you know and I'm just the whole drama\nThat can crop up and the idea to that you know the whole space program was\nNot solid leave you know\nConfirmed I mean every time a rocket went off nobody knew who was going to blow up on the launch pad or I mean they you know they thought they had everything figure it out and so as a lotta they show a lot of times the anxiety of the astronaut them in the ... when they're taking off you know they're looking at the river\nAnd they're looking at the windows and all that you know to make sure that they they stay in place so um I it just had a real real human real side to it which I really enjoy it and of course\nYou know him walking on the moon when when he gets out\nAnd he's about to take that first out you know and and you're really it really gets you because I mean this is something that everybody in the world was excited about you know it wasn't just America is the entire world that was watching it happened and a lot of pressure with that\nSo so let me ask you a couple of questions about this in the human element as you were talking I was thinking about that you if you were a spouse or one of the astronaut specially be one of the first\nThe first landing on the moon you you're excited but you're also probably very scared about the whole thing to ... or ... and is that where they they kind of go with this to all the motions running high\nYeah yeah the ... you know and what they did back then was they put a NASA put a little like radio in the home so that the wife includes could hear the trans um\nThe transcription you know when they're talking in that so they know what's going on I'm so sometimes the wife is just sitting there you know on the edge of her seat just listening and if there's any troubles or anything you know she's right there with them\nSo we seen this story before a soul man I mean we've seen Apollo Thirteen with Tom Hanks ... the movie\nUm there's some elements but realistically I think this one's a little more serious\nI think Apollo Thirteen was was one that was kind of cleaned up you know I'm ... mass audience has kind of movie you know Tom Hanks ... you know he's he's the guy in the white hat you know and this one had a little darker side to it um it was it was still a good movie but it just showed the\nLevels of anxiety that can happen\nAnd I can only imagine and uh let me ask you about too when you're talking about going to the moon rockets is space exploration how are the special effects\nSpecial effects are amazing yeah yeah and one thing the director ... by the way this director also directed Ryan Gosling in la la land they paired up again after that so but he did a really interesting thing when he\nGot Neil Armstrong on the moon he took out all music so that it was complete silence and that's like five minutes or you know and and it was really effective\nAnd complete silence ... wow it all yeah that is so cool I oh it was just a little twist\nTo see that reminds me a little bit about two thousand one speed side is he a directed by Stanley Kubrick where when you're out in space or you wouldn't silence ...\nIs it reminds me a little bit about two thousand and one the speed side as the uh directed by Stanley Kubrick where when you're out in space or you wouldn't silence ... what you heard was breathing in their suits kind of the same vein sounds like\nYeah yeah open the pod doors\nHal [laughter]\nThat movie all messed with you I\nRemember watching that with my my boys and they were younger\nAnd I'd never watched it before and so and they wanted to see it and I thought All right and it kind of you looked over the ... that's back when the DVD and All right I think it would make the cut and we watch the way we still talk about that one it's a it's a loaded up movie I'll tell you what it hits every one of your emotions\nAnd to think that it was made what back in Nineteen sixty eight or nine wow\nYeah I mean it was it was way ahead of time\nThat it was All right so first man it stars Ryan Gosling any other stars that are caught your eye on this\nOr his wife is played by Claire boy who is I think she's got any one thing she's bringing the lead actors can those um the girl with the dragon tattoo movies\nOkay you've got a new one coming out girl in the spider Web or something which is another book off of the girl with the with the dragon tattoo so\nIs this going to be a an Oscar contender\n[noise] you know I think so yeah it's got a feeling it's going to be there\nOkay All right that sounds like maybe for the special effects and for the acting\nOr a a ... yeah you gotta so enticed alright well I'll ask you the question even though I think I Know the answer a where you are a recommend the movie a first man to a friend\nI Would\nYeah how about kids where we add on that [noise]\nUm I Would say probably I I Would generally say made me like late middle school early high school and up okay I wouldn't take the little kids\nOkay because the story my drag on for them to and you know there's you know I I Am a dad and I I that's Iran and that more often than he did more than the inappropriate stuff is\nThis over yet how much longer I don't want to hear that I Will be long and I have a or a well let's talk about what else loves her what's coming by what what are you planning on seeing next you know\nI'm I I'm I'm really toying with a bad night at the ... which is that it's it's about seven people that go to the hotel and all kinds of secrets revealed and it looks really interesting I you know\nYeah Jeff Bridges is a Catholic priest and you know I have a ... ... I Would never put those two together [laughter] yeah I did you speak for a lot of people there are a a Whoopi Goldberg being a nun I [noise]\nAnd then of\nCourse a star is born is out there as well isn't it now\nPeople are still talking about that one thing it's really good so yeah we got we got a couple of contenders out there\nWell it's good to get back on the horse isn't it I mean for a while there are the best movie it seemed was the may get a and that's all you know [laughter] that's great no I'll bet you kind of show you where we're at a for a while right when it came to movies alright\nWell hey I thank you so much uh the movie a first man if you're thinking about seeing it soul man you loved it right\nIs that a guy who loved it All right so go see it All right thank you so much will talk to you next week All right thanks All right\nBye bye and good weekend Iran that ... we call them soul man our movie critic are stuck in the middle with Andy Jorgensen on him nine forty W.
