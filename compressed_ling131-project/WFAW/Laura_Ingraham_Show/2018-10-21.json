I Know I have no time for that type of stuff absolute cloud especially considering you cost yourself seven points earlier in the game so basically you're a net zero in the game you're a net zero okay so you've done nothing to my liking so enough of that crap\nAlso the Vikings additive feel go big stopped by the jets so they tend to seven instead of fourteen to seven so nice job and get their egos all over the Panthers tend to think about the bucks there put it on the ground sixteen to to right\nNow it's like people forgot that the browns or the most part of the coach team in the NFL is you know three seasons so\nAt the job by the boss will seek leaving on back with daycare but you know all the talk without Baker would light up his bucks defense that has not been a case campus on a nice job controlling this game and you know the only points to brands have was a safety very early on on defense so that point on it's been all Tampa\nJames wants in ten of sixteen hundred and twenty three yards through the air he's already run the ball three times for Thirty years and he has a rushing touched down as well so big game so far for Jamieson Seamus combat as come back from the suspension a couple of interceptions last week in the last to Atlanta but he played pretty well overall\nThe Texans are Thirteen to nothing lead over the jaguars right now and we have Blake board does right now in a first into any Scrabble such as right he's going to pick up about two yards but at the store and his game so far\nThe Jacksonville often with three minutes left in the second quarter has not scored has not scored\nYou wonder what ... will ever consider quarterback change I mean how poor they may have played the last two weeks are often so I mean just to get something going you know the wind up ... has played if you're the jaguars you got at least consider it and I mean it's been that bad and your team that was your role this year and you can't ... points at home\nJake he starts for fifty five yards on the\nTerrible and this is a ... yard that has given up a lot of your niche so you look at the you know the situation where the Jacksonville Jaguars right now I Know ... to back up but you know could he maybe step in at some point in this game I wouldn't be shocked\nThe way that you don't [noise] at least like maybe that will send a message right to play for those and send a message to the team like this is an acceptable like this guy continues to put us in bad physicians weekend and week out [noise] and at some point your defense is going to suffer when they're on the football field the majority of the game\nYeah and so right now is Sam darn I was going to take a look down the field overthrows Ravi Anderson ten seven get about four fifty six left in the second quarter that game will see of Darnah and get some points on the board are they gonna have to punch air force in seven coming up we're going to see if Arnold can make a comeback here and the second half of this football game and less\nLook they may get it back before half the defense of the jets as you mention has been pretty good outside of that first series Tom Brady is going to face a third and seven down three of us the forty eight yard line\nOf the Chicago Bears and Brady today playing with a rubber and ... of course and he's also playing in this game without markets cannon and that means that ... their backup tackle is having to block ... which is in an ideal situation\nAnd you mentioned a Sony Michel earlier a left that day would that knee injuries questionable to return which means that it's going to be more Chris Hogan more Edelman and a lot more James White as well\nAll right so Brady on thirty seven rushed for about six yards it's a fourth one and it appears the patriots will go for this and ... and the guns so that takes out the equation of\nThe quarterback sneak which Brady has become so famous for over the years but they are going to throw the ball and forth and one and a quarter of Patterson or Josh Gore in our early it's going to come down with the ball on the outside there are so nice catch by Josh according to extend this drive for the New England patriots and that's got to be nice for re isn't at this type of guy in a long time where he can\nOutside it wrong in the middle of field I'm Talking about outside the numbers the guy you can just throw the football up to and expect them to come down with the\nBall and on that play you know they talk about a quarter by being able to throw a guy open Brady through Josh Gordon open he just threw in near him but his playmates will go up and make a nice catch over the defender to keep the drive alive and after ... can bring to this patriots all kinds of nice row suggest corn for Nineteen yard\nRight the bucks that sixteen to two lead over the bronze you get about Ninety seconds left before halftime and James once in a working based out of his own ends on his able to drop back and find a receiver under not underneath I Believe is the running back\nAnd they are going to pick up about ten yards out of the backfield there so All right James once and may be able to get more points on this round the events before have done the bronze defenses really skip the frantic\nOne week it's really good like against Pittsburgh to open up the season it was great New Orleans in New Orleans and the dome they only have a Twenty one points against Drew Brees which is\nPretty good Twenty one points against breeze at home is pretty good at and every time yeah and then you'll have weeks like last week against the chargers where they looked absolutely horrendous so you you can tell that right now this is a very young football team there in Cleveland and as you mentioned they probably don't have their head coach of the future either so that certainly factors into because Jackson probably at some point the season\nIs going to lose his job and maybe ... daily gets the interim tag but nonetheless I Would say that it's pretty likely that the browns would be looking for a new head coach after\nThe season I Would I I don't trust you jacks and then on you know I took the guy that the fact that he was one of thirty one or two years and kept his job is one of the more remarkable things you never heard of any NFL\nYeah and by the way we're talking about the Panthers often struggling today don't tend to nothing to the eagles at half time here's cams numbers for of nine for twenty four yards and he's been sacked twice for Nineteen yard so the sack yards or just five five yards less than the amount of yards candidate in this past for\nPretty horrific numbers for Cam Newton and the Carolina often to begin the day Carolina's a team that was three in one and now it seems like they're in a really really bad spot right now after that they had a huge rate effort against Washington last week and to follow that up like this\nUnacceptable by the Carolina Panthers if you want to be taken seriously in this like what are you looking at their you're calling for a flag and one of these games\nYeah Kurt ... scrambled out and and throw a ball now feel there was no receive around the area but he was out on a few I was out of pocket event but just the fence that a nice job after they went for it I'm thirty seven when the deepwater Robin ... and you talked about it on the air Brian Donald just overthrown so the jets at the pump back was about four minutes to go\nIn the first after Minnesota Jesse fence another three and out they had been phenomenal after that opening Dr Sam Donald will get another opportunity here were three fifty to to go before I have time to try and get the jets either tie the football game or a touchdown will give an ally\nTired and the patriots try to do a triple a absolute joke you have the best quarterback in the history of the league and they try to trick play with judge McCain does have a Brady\nLike go to the right side like he's calling out to different play and they snap the ball directly to James White and the bears are all over it I mean just let Brady throw the football I he's been pretty good in a sleep for a long time I don't know what Josh McCain does his thinking but there's got to bring up a third angle\nWith about four minutes left in the second quarter so Brady is going to end up getting a touchdown anyway he finds James why James White I mean this guy's a remarkable weapons for the patriots\nA couple of years ... Eighteen points or whatever it was in the super bowl easily could have been the MVP if it wasn't for Tom Brady in that game but the patriots go up twenty to Seventeen on the bears extra point is pending and that one but Chicago will get the ball back\nJames White or had rate fantasy player Brian every ... every week he's got a bunch of catches these you know he he gets some hand off she finds the end zone as a Russia finds out in the past catcher already got forty fourteen fast she points to wait for those interested in James why always a good option and the and I used to run back and some less\nYou said that to before the game James White always a good fantasy play and you like Sony Michel to unfortunately he got hurt but James White in this game I mean he's been the guy that Brady looks for he is really ... most reliable targets ... usually has doubled covered and then Julian Edelman it's got to beat a guy it seems like every time and\nYeah they're pretty looks for he is really ... most reliable target because very ... double covered and then Julian Edelman has got to beat a guy it seems like every time and he's been heard he just comes back this there again but James White has five touchdown catch this year or the back the other guy has been absolutely tremendous but the patriots\nHe may be the one guy like if you were going to lose now Bronx out today with the back injury but if you were the patriots and you could\nIf you had to pick one of these guys that you were going to lose for the rest of the season like that you couldn't lose between ... Edelman and James White the guy that I Would take that say would hurt this team the most I Would say James what they want a Super Bowl with ... and they one went to a Super Bowl without Edelman like the one guy that they can't lose that often it's outside of Brady that goes without saying I Believe is\nJames White yeah I\nI think I tend to agree with you Brian you just use versatility out of the backfield and everything that he could do\nWith that spot and then yet Sony Michel what could he be in his office but I find it funny that ever since Brady made those little ... comments after the lion's games say hey we need to get James White more involved that are often noticed what has happened James White has been heavily involved in the patriots dolphins\nI totally forgot about that you're right he said yeah James I can remember like the percentage of snaps he only was out there for like fifty two percent of\nAll you gotta love a good old time already passive aggressive comment and that his work yourself getting paid your dolphins do in the ...\nAnd if you're James White and Brady says that about you you're like OK let's go like I'm going to have a big season Tommy's out there at the podium stick it up ... are a lot more to get the you're listening to the NFL rush ...\nWhere can you give your own genes new purpose\nTyson thanks to the blue jeans go green denim recycling program denim waste is being transformed into installation instead of throwing your own them in the trash subsided color to help build homes were organizations like habitat for humanity\nSo just bring your older and um to Tyson's a month of October to recycle it for the cause for every ... modern recycled you'll get a coupon for twenty percent of a new pair of Tyson's regular price genes from our amazing selection of a brand and Tyson's home farm auto\nMore for you people there's a huge mind auction coming up that you're not going to want to miss joined your friends from the seventies group for a large lead auction of hickory farms in Jefferson County the three hundred and eighty five plus acres will be sold in ... free and clear for twenty nine ...\nList ... neighbors really pizza on October thirty first one PM\nMore and more information ... group\nAnd see a full description enlisting ... group dot com that's S.

drama or a book called her second time out one fifty five remaining why they call a timeout they're facing the fourth and fifth scene from their own forty one yard line and is Chandler Kevin's RO out to a game winner perhaps McAdams RO missed\nIt forty forty you order as time expired that's the reason we're here he also missed an extra point\nEarlier in the day so this one will probably go down this just inside mid feel that the fifty looks like ew Jackson will want to take his opportunity to vote for asking the question about a challenge or on the plane they then sacked twice\nAs a gymnast wants to have the team down about the forty a about the\nExcuse me about the thirty something her mind and\nAh after two sacks drop them back ah they were able to get some yard so a little bit of confusion right now and guys this all back to Cleveland Browns\nThis was already there for overtime game this season than just seven games but all kinds of confusion right now the bucks had to take the time out so we're still waiting for this opportunity here at random James stadium and the winner this game\nDoes get back to five hundred a ... that indeed happened and the bus when Mrs Cleveland will take the ball over right after fifty yard my both teams have had a possession in overtime both because I'm also turned it over\nThe streams Winston was picked off by Jimmy Collins on their first chance but then the browns couldn't do a lot with the hunted and then when the buccaneers had the ... back after the next time it was the uh Turner dribble peppers\nKick is on the way from cat and sorrow as we mentioned it's fifty nine yards and we will not have a tie here in Tampa today\nDribble peppers kick is on the way from Catherine sorrow as we mentioned it's fifty nine yards and we will not have a tie here in Tampa today though may have kept his job the buccaneers to walk away winter today ... sticking point three in overtime of fifty nine yards Google a tremor Kevin thorough\nUnbelievable it brings up like really appreciate it really appreciate the overtime worked from you too\nOh what a job by my cat is Errol there and what a great job I owned by pepper there I should say China there Ken is there a form of deer jet by the way guys\nHell of a ... fifty nine yards he missed from forty earlier and I mean how lucky is James Winston he would have been the reason why his team lost his game with his inexplicably taking to sex at the worst opportune time and that over time period during that drive\nYou know on a Wednesday when the bucks we'll take it in their back at five hundred right there in the mix in and say that appears to be wide open right now all over the place\nAnd that cat and sorrow kicked guys it looked like that had well over sixty plus yards on it I mean at edits that kind of reminded me of a bowling ball where it had that spin on it it looked like it was going to slice then it hook back over that was that was a fantastic kick like Athens era\nAnd to like if he misses that you still in a minute fifty five seconds left so if he misses that fifty nine yard field goal attempt the browser and really good position to win the game although it seems like for\nA long period of overtime nobody wanted to win the game but if you missed that kick you really set up the browns with really really good seal position so Canton zero hats to make that kick because if not bigger Mayfield is a completion or two away from setting up the browns to win the game of the field those that was massive for Tampa Bay to get out of there was a when\nI shouldn't say get out of their that's their home stadium but man that would have been bad for James Winston and the browns would have been in really really good position so big one for example in Tampa gets back to five hundred on the season and it's James his first win since last season\nYeah absolutely big win for the box and it wasn't easy but they'll take it and how bad or the Cleveland Browns though I mean how many times do they play games and they inexplicably lose\nAt some point it was not fallen coaching Hugh Jackson should not have a job after going one is thirty one is the first two years isn't that a thought coach I don't care what the excuse is are\nThey go all in with them again this year and I'm Sorry the branch of a a lot better they'd been in all these games the what the amount of games they blown I don't want to hear about all they play these team tie it could have beat the bucks today they just play smarter football terrible\nWell and here's the thing with the Jackson what was he known for he's supposed to be a good offensive coach right that was that's what we heard\nAll these quarterbacks that played for huge acts in the past couple of years the Sean Kaiser was not good Cody casts or was not good okay at the beginning of this year ... Taylor sucked okay Baker Mayfield is coming in and he's given them a little bit of a boost offensively Baker may feel pretty good especially considering that he's a rookie quarterback why should we give\nThe head coach who Jackson any credit for that all the other quarterbacks these coaching the passive than horrible so clearly it's just bakers talent was better than all those guys it has nothing to do with what huge accent is doing so if you can't point to something specifically\nThat you're helping your team do to win football games then you shouldn't be a coach and also you look at other close games they lost last year all of the close games they lost this year that means that the head coach clearly isn't doing the right things in critical situations if you keep losing close game that's on the head\nCoach here's the reality for the browns when you continue to find ways to lose that ultimately falls on the head coach and\nHugh Jackson is a terrible terrible NFL head coach and this was on a hot take it's just something that if you watch the game of football you could clearly see and I think it's an absolute joke that he was a coach for Baker Mayfield and they're gonna make a mistake with him\nGet rid of view and trying to salvage bigger may feel ... put the right guy in place to help develop a franchise quarterback 'cause I think there's going to be a good quarterback but I don't like your Jackson Vegas head coach\nYeah it appears that if they do fire in ... would be the interim head coach because of course he's been a head coach in the past and you also factoring John Dorsey\nHad him in Kansas City when John Dorsey was working as a general manager in Kansas City but\nWho knows if he would hang on to that job long term usually the interim coach doesn't but it does appear that they can make those going to have a new coach after the season because he can't really defend you Jackson that much longer esteem keeps losing close games nobody's getting that are under that guy no quarterback has improved so\nA bench surely you're gonna have to pay for losing all those games and then not being any better this year in terms of the results you get to and congratulations you've lost four games\nYou know you've lost what four games now or three games in overtime okay C team clearly isn't winning close games either\nAnyway a Washington now in the late window up seven and nothing over Dallas ... with a touchdown run in this game or excuse me it was such that reception for twenty three yards\nUm and you also have the rams and the forty niners underway and San Francisco that's a three nothing game in favor of the rams the saints in the ravens they are still scoreless then the second quarter is already underway Drew Brees has already been under a lot of pressure ... says attack in this game\nAnd it's the only team as we mentioned earlier that Drew Brees as not eating in his NFL career so you've got to imagine this is going to be one of those games a bigger ... that excuse me Drew Brees certainly wants to win but man he is getting absolutely lit up early in the scan\nYou have in fact a couple of times has been hit on a couple of plays you look at where the saints are as a team though right they're ... they're a team that a lot of people like to comment it off the by facing the great defense what\nAre they going to be against the Baltimore Ravens the fence and I'm Still not sold on the ravens we watch them a couple of weeks ago you\nKnow nearly lose to the browns or they did lead rounds if she has made a lot of the brands and overtime twelve than I\nI look at the ravens and there are so inconsistent I Can't trust them but they're at home defense outdoor stadium breeze not the same quarter back when he's away from that dome environment so as good as it is that the ravens this will be a statement when and you know through the first quarter so many exactly how Baltimore wants to go no score will say the right as you get something going on all fronts\nAnd oh by the way it Drew Brees just fumbled given the ball back to the Baltimore Ravens so the ravens are going to have a first intends situation at the New Orleans forty six after breeze\nA strip ... are covered by\nAnthony Levine so it's going to set up the ravens at the forty six yard line so the ravens are in business air Joe Flaco look to cash in on a short field I'm with you on the ravens though I just I completely I'm all in on the defense they're great and we saw what they did to Ben Roethlisberger and company a couple of weeks ago they shut them out in the second half it's just", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "21"}
