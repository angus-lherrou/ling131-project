just asking the question I keep seeing that headlined\nManhunt for serial bomber right yes this person's I might be splitting hairs here and I don't know if it didn't sensitive to ask the question\nHe's not really a serial bomber though 'cause nothing blew up so attempted attempted serial bomber no problem what you're really saying\nIs words matter [laughter] words matter and we need to make sure that our discourse is reflecting the truth and they're saying if a guy walked into a bunch of houses and tried and failed to kill people there's not a manhunt for a serial killer\nTime off for a second because I saw that headline to manhood is on yeah I'm offended as a man\nVan horn for a serial killer time out for a second because I saw that headline to manhood is on yeah I'm offended as a man\nWell of course he as you were saying that all men are to be haunted right now down to ... be the person to person on T. S. okay let's\nSee we're solving the world's problems right here non gender specific right on that's what I'm told all the time don't me using gender specific in the fall I don't know that was just a question I don't mean to it I don't mean to offend anybody but\nRight he's not a serial bomber Izzie\nNobody I Know that maybe I'm missing something obviously we hope that doesn't turn out to be the case right but now we are in on this show anti bomb for the record okay we're also anti murder of the Saudis handling not of course that's not exactly new news to anyone right\nNow we find out [laughter] yes that murder of cars Yogi was premeditated no really\nHere's the thing because yes now this the first time they're calling ... death premeditated yeah how many times can story changing [laughter] they're short time span right this is a new record told we just had the foreign minister\nOn a couple of days ago from Saudi Arabia talking about how this was a few people who went rogue and they ... they were supposed to go there and have a conversation\nWhich a mall and try and get them back to Saudi Arabia and it just so happened that they had a forensic expert and a bone saw your hand a body double in the same room I mean you never leave home without the bone so I we all know that correct\nYeah the I ... nobody trusts the Saudis right why and how are you a meditative ... of course they murdered the guy okay\nSo do we give this two more days there'll be another twist and turn well upon further review who I'd actually then we'll get something else we'll just wait and\nSee then they're going to look at how the media coverage has been over the last six months and tried to blame it on Brett Kavanaugh oh stop stop she this division of right there [laughter] I'm Sorry I don't know how to divide okay\nSo we've solved that we've solved the ... the attempted serial mom a bomber but we did have a serial pooper\nUm this is a story for months ago you have kept up to date on this story and another twist another turn to one chapter of the saga of Thomas tried to glean he has come to a close\nHe's the guy who is known as we pooper intend until you was the former kennel worth New Jersey school superintendent he made headlines after he was accused of being on the field at the home bill high schools track and field complex I guess rival school district he lives in the neighborhood until he goes in runs there in the morning but apparently he was putting on the track or on the football field\nAnd he was caught in the act because cop set up surveillance equipment 'cause he kept happening\nNow he yesterday pleaded guilty to death for caving in public and he's going to have to pay a five hundred dollar fine and court gospel prosecutors are dropping lewd miss and littering charges and there is audio from the courtroom\nUh and it's some of the most humiliating courtroom moment audio you'll ever hear as his lawyer is asking him questions about the case as he's preparing to plead guilty [noise] okay\nSee this is one of these traits that I haven't heard yet I\nGet to experience at the ... like you\nWere running\nHe says\nThis is new news to me I didn't realize it was under the bleachers saw I we didn't know that either the cops were not specific about that either but they're saying he went under the bleachers do you think before it was right on the field that's what they said but that's what I that's what the original report said\nThat what it is right there like he's like I'm making a statement he's up to fifty yard line and he's just dropping drought\nOr on the end zone logo maybe okay\nThis is where you where do you mean where does this [noise] [laughter] oh\n[laughter] did you do what you did because it was an emergency yes\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nOkay inch or did you have to poop yes was it an emergency yes did you do it under the bleachers yes did you clean it up yeah\n[laughter] okay [laughter] so [laughter] but [laughter]\nIt said it I rest my case right now apparently he has been diagnosed with something called the runners diarrhea [laughter]\nAnd she wanted to stay home or be home when the kids got out of school she didn't want to do nighttime anymore hardly understand that um\nBut no it was a tough for her but this does seem to be an excuse I well you know what we have the audio of\nThat whole blackface segment okay\nAnd I mean most people do see the headline they don't understand the nuance of the conversation and there's four people that are having this conversation right\n[laughter] it's really ... you'll get in trouble if you are a white person part time or black or white [laughter]\nThat was okay as long as you address character in LA feels like something that's offensive to them then you shouldn't say it and that's fair to begin to dress up like I Want to take anything they mention people catching up like a lot ...\nThan it probably has the right thing and there are places in New York with ... as she is Diana Ross and she made her scandalous darker than it really is and people say that that was raised [laughter]\n[noise] she wants to look like a an around her one day I I don't know how like that racism Holloway or I mean it that way okay\nThere was the pushback that sounded a little racist to me the person said right that's\nJust a conversation that could happen anywhere\nRight now so if you are a person that was highly offended by that would you take\nThat time to say listen Megan doesn't seem like you have malice in your heart there here here's why this is offensive to so many\nPeople and you can make the argument Megan Kelly should know that but maybe maybe\nNot this is a conversation on are going to handle yeah I think that and that leads to my second question is why demanded an apology if you're not prepared to accept it\nBecause I mean she apologized up and down everything and now I Am appreciative and I'm so sorry not doing enough right really that's the unforgivable sin right there what we just heard 'cause it's never\nIt's never about apologizing in unity it's about defeating that's why every one of these cases is\nAnd ... the part that rings pretty high low because you know oh my gosh think about how many people even at MSNBC who have said things over time right\nThat's all going to come out now\nThat will get revisited like OK so Megan Kelly is losing her job for this but you get this hosts over here that said this particular time and it was okay and who knew what about\nIt Matt Lauer oh there's all there's new what about Harvey wind scene but okay so joy read she still employed right after everything that she said overtime yes okay\nThat makes a whole lot of free dissents no it's an excuse for NBC to dump it showed that hasn't been doing very well for I mean that's in the mind and simple but she's going to get her money\nShe is she getting rid a sixty nine million dollars I don't feel that so yeah I mean I Would love that ... that really is with all the hype\nAround the lottery and everything that really is the the true American Dream to get millions of dollars for doing nothing [noise]\nSo she's living the American dream right now\nThat's not the American dream\nTo get 'em for nothing I don't think she wanted to end that way anyway are\nCompletely switching gears this story is getting some attention this woman wow what a day huh\nOh my gosh she has a this is that it was St Paul Minnesota a pregnant woman saved her husband's life men gave birth to their first child\nSo actually get a user name she was in bed back on October sixteenth and she woke up hearing her husband Andrew gasping for air struggling to breed he was having a heart attack\n... so she gave him CPR into an ambulance could get there and they get him to the hospital they had to put them into and into a coma to prevent further brain damage\nNow he woke up a couple of days later and she went into labor because she said look I'm not going to have this baby without you being up and able to witnesses and they were able to welcome in their new baby lemon together or they talked to came S P about it\nOkay she was able to hold it off for a couple of days yes\nCutting out has been monitoring dozens and a\nSubtle though this guy is so far have\nDidn't want to have to think for one second about having to do any of this without him\nTelling him the whole time he was playing foreign has come on that was not going to have the Seine I'm telling you about that ... into downtown library until they're very\nOn and say I'm hospital and just parked right next to mine and he got to be an actor out all of labor and delivery\nFor my shirt off waiting for a year for like ... electrodes he'll pay or something\nI think we're both a little nervous to go home because it's going to be\nSo much different than when we laughed but now we're very anxious to get him\nIt does get him out of you know getting up in the middle of night punishment heart attack huh yeah but man long term I Know she's going to win every single argument ever I save your life and I had a baby and I took care of a newborn and you at the same time yeah you can take out the trash yeah\nI like the way they do already blaming the kid do\n[laughter] you catch a subtle though this guy is so far there's just nothing subtle about it as\nMine and she how much pain you're causing me I was gripping so much I had a heart attack\nAnd now this\nIs my gosh now I Can't win any argument at home [laughter] jeeze [laughter]\nOkay apparently this is true from a new survey things you have some life goals right yeah like\nI Would think most people do I mean it doesn't matter what they are something like at some point in time I Would like to be able to fill in the ... got a bucket list a life goal something to go do yeah I mean this is something I Want to be able to accomplish whatever\nForty percent of people say they don't have any life goals man just a bunch of slackers are said well some say well I've already achieved them\nOr I you know I'm just kind of cool with everything the way it is\nOkay so little aimless after maybe you got the promotion you always wanted and now you're like that whatever whatever happens is just icing on the cake I can kind of appreciate that but it's important to look forward to things right\nYeah I mean like my number one goal by got two big ones want us to visit all fifty states in the United states I'm almost there wow and then the big one\nIs fake my own death but you're waiting for the lottery I got it well I have to have you got to have money to do that\nYou can [laughter] who else is going to know\nAnd that but you're waiting for the lottery I got it well I have to have you got to have money to do that\nYou can [noise] who else is going to know okay she does the wife know that this was coming when I make my own death yes or is she a part of it or not necessarily\nBecause she hears the radio show yeah it's not like that doesn't get out ... okay so everyone all of a sudden we just don't know what happened to him right\nThere are some times where you'll leave the studio city and a brief show prep yeah situation and it's like eight minutes later and we're looking around like is this the day [laughter]\nLady that's also the beauty of it because I Want to try to put it out in the universe as much as possible but yes my number one bucket list item is to make my own debt so that when I actually do die there are a few people out there who are wondering is that guy really dead\nNo one will believe it or what do you mean like I've gone [laughter] there's no way he talked about it too many times are coming up and just about twenty minutes we're going to talk to somebody that knows something about tracking down this attempted serial bomber\nMedic Clint Van Zandt from the FBI he's done this before so what are they looking for right now you know I mean among other things and just common\nEveryday questions of the some of us have like if this person is as dumb as they appear to be [noise]\nAre they going to be easy to find him quite rather soon so we'll be talking to him coming up this is the marketing main game show [noise]\n\n\nHardship case are honest mistake it doesn't matter to the IRS when you are back taxes for having file tax returns in quite some time they're coming for you\nLike with Rhonda it didn't matter that she was a single mom and a nurse living paycheck to paycheck and it didn't matter that the reason she owed ounces of dollars in back taxes was that her ex said he'd filed their tax returns but didn't the IRS was aggressively pursuing her garnish in her wages Ronda was trapped in what she thought was a no win situation\nIf you can relate to

from that conversation they would think the overall takeaway is that if you're thinking that this could be\nA set up and I'm not by the way not saying like oh Hillary Clinton sat here in organized this bomb threat rats not what I'm going what I'm getting at but if you had the thoughts Boyd\nThis could be\nA left wing lunatics just as easily as it could be a right wing lunatics trying to influence public perception and public discussion equally you're not crazy\nTo think that because we don't know that's just that we don't know and the other part\nBecause you almost feel bad bring it up is it possible this person's really bad at what they're doing thank goodness nothing's going on that's how is that possible\nWhere the guy saying yeah [noise] what are the chances yeah so we'll just see how this plays out so this was really interesting because there are a lot of ways that I think people from both sides of the political while you can get along very well and you see it in life\nEvery day you know especially of talked about before with um different family members I Know it tears some apart but for years\nPolitical opinions have been able to be if you know tolerating you still love brother or sister or whatever it is an uncle um when your kids play sports together you know people have different politics which come together and everybody gets along in school\nBut you see OK there is a huge difference when you look at polls\nAbout even what Democrats trust what Republicans trust 'em you know I was surprised as far as Democrats most trusted institution you know what it is\nA not Facebook um what's the same as on okay I was thinking Google but yeah OK Amazon\nOr more so than say the military trust Amazon more than the military yes\nWow that's surprising to me ... ranked military first Democrats ranked third\nI mean ... universities there's a big divide yeah you know like the universities do they help the country or they hurting the country right now the big divide there um suppress\nOh yeah well you know there is a ... yeah I'm Google big difference between who trust and who doesn't I'm guessing Democrats trust Google a little bit more conservative oh of\nCourse right it's scary and the message you know organized labor same thing yeah but at least there are times we\nCan come together and get along and most of the time that the case but it is man there's just so many people just believe different things and you know that part I don't think is going away [laughter] uh this story is getting a little bit of attention wanting to get your reaction so Sports Illustrated model\nRobin ...\nIs calling for a boycott of Victoria's Secret okay why [noise] uh\nBecause uh she says I Want actual sell you light on a catwalk said you know she is considered plus size by industry standards if you look at it you're like she's plus size doesn't look plus size yet by standards yeah she just kind of looks a healthy right\nWhich is ridiculous we already know that right yeah um but she is doing this whole bit about boycotting Victoria's Secret that whole show is coming up they do it you know every holiday season yeah you know it seemed like it used to be a bigger deal ... because of\nWhat people can get on line right it's All right it's not a one night only event here now right\nUh so she says let's help change the minds Victoria's Secret to be more diverse and inclusive of body shapes and sizes on the\nRunways joy secret has dominated the space for almost Thirty years by telling women there's only one kind of body beautiful okay this is the part that is problematic to me\nShe said she doesn't want this for her young daughter the standard that I get yeah but she says I felt like bleep every year looking at that show I shouldn't have to feel that way\nMy daughter is going to have my body shape and body size it's already genetically set and she's three\nThe fact that it affected me so much growing up and we're all compared to what is deemed perfection I don't want her to have to experience that\n\nCan't you teach or not to that these are unrealistic expectations\nI look forward to hearing her also talk about how every superhero\nIn every superhero movie is ripped\nI mean you know you don't have you know in the next Avengers movie the incredible hulk coming up right no I mean you know what I Want my shot at being a plus size store that's really what I Want [laughter]\n[noise] yeah I'm guessing if you polled ladies and said okay next male stars shirtless in the movie is going to be ... words or Adam Sandler [laughter]\n\nGot an idea of who they are going to pick a but she said even at my lightest I couldn't get there this ideal body type you know from Victoria's Secret I genuinely really tried I was counting calories I was taking diet pills I was dabbling and starvation I thought you had to be skinny to be beautiful and I thought I Would never be beautiful at this size\nUm\n... you just teach your kids you know right I mean I get I don't care if I'm not sticking up for Victoria's Secret\nHair well and the market is deciding on Victoria's Secret remember just a few weeks ago there was this story about how they're suffering right now because there are other brands out there that are celebrating\nYou know all different body tired and all of that stuff and that's just been the culture now yeah which I don't see as a terrible thing I'm not sitting here saying no Victoria's Secret of the only type of beauty because they don't believe that\nUm so as you may be a little behind the game here that's what it seems to me\nAnd then she says I women want to see diversity\nOr they appealing to women with this victorious [laughter] show no probably not I mean I think that's that's generally do not I don't ever remember women\nCan't get out of it did you see what the editorial board at Bloomberg News said no I didn't to be they said Democrats need to talk about the caravan yes and they said what a ... a collision seems eminent thoughtful solutions are scarce\nUm basically they said look the reaction from Democrats they can't be silent anymore\nThey need to tell them to either turn around or say you're going to be waiting for a while at the border\nThat needs to be the message yes but it they would\nBe out there are strong again man said\nThe first step ought to be straightforward Democrats should call on the marchers to turn back far and away the best solution and then they ought to not drink away from saying they agree with the president\nGoes and most Americans do agree if you take the names out of it\n... you say hey do you think it's a good idea for four thousand to ten thousand people to show up at different ports of entry demanding access do you think that's a good way to handle the situation most Americans would say no if you believe in names out of it political parties yes and names out of it\nThe true here's the other part and I seriously I might be the only one banging the drum but I really do believe it to be true\nWhen you're talking about people seeking asylum and especially women and children yes our country is all about that there is a way to get in no doubt and I don't think anyone wants to do away with asylum\nNo nobody suggesting that no also don't want open\nBorders and when you see the images of this story more times than not it's a bunch it do it\nIn their twenties yes\nOkay and they're they're angry well and people when they honestly look at that the heart doesn't swelled quite as much for these guys as you're talking women and children that are in desperate need there's a big question mark with a lot of people saying okay all of a sudden this happens I mean there's been caravans for years and years and years not this\nBig but that has happened in the past but\nWhen you're a political message has been led riots breakup ice let's have open borders\nAnd say or anywhere in the city saying we don't care about law and order herring children from their parents in\nPutting him in cages right if that's what you married yourself to you own it\nBut you have a real opportunity now and you know what if they don't they don't and they I don't think they will because I don't think they can I don't think Chuck Schumer can ever looked down his nose with these stupid glasses on\nTo say hey I start you know your writers resident you're right see because of your heart attacks and the ballet when your voice gets up here and then I feel like I Am I'm going to call them and now I'm Sorry you're All right man don't apologize makes me crazy all\nGood we have an update you brought this story up actually the other day she gotten this Arizona boy six years old and his party there's all these pieces laid out already two classmates were invited no one comes none showed but\nWhat a lot of people thought was worse was that the mom put that on social ... his mom's a horrible person\nI'm not going to go that far well I don't think it was the best choice it was terrible\nOr she did say though if she had that to do over again she would not\nHave put that on social media\nBut in the meantime enjoy your courtside seats for the Lakers and sons\nAnd pulled that is true yeah now her name ... magazine E.\nAnd then the boy's dad Ted Bolger said that yeah\nThere was his first birthday party I think they gave him a choice you could do a B or C\nAnd one of them was like go to Disney or something he was like I don't have a party of my classmates and some people are as we pay they were going to show but then they didn't and they said at first he was really bummed but then he starts playing the games at the pizza place and he ended up having a pretty decent time mhm okay [noise]\nAnd we know now from the story going viral a lot of people are reaching out around the world wanting to send this kid gifts yes as you mentioned you go into a Phoenix Suns game the Lakers yeah um\nAnd and now she's saying I Wish that I never would have done it\nBut here's the thing\nIs she's talking about it sit next year they're not going to do a birthday party\nOkay\nYou know why no said well I mean part of it is it's a huge amount of time that I have to put into it she's referring to\nReally seriously it's a department\nOf children family services on the phone right now it's so much planning for me my gosh I'll just take them on a trip by the way the boy's father yeah had told her ahead of time don't put this on social media\nDon't do it\nShe said I did it anyway\nManage and they're not together anymore I Can't it's hard for me to believe I don't know what the situation where they want to be around her\nBut the fact that he actually told a reporter in this story said you know the boy he's tough when she told me she was posting the photo I told her not to do it but she did it and took off pretty\nWild I'm Still wondering when do we find out that way\nWhen she told me she was posting the photo I told her not to do it but she did it and took off pretty wild\nI'm Still wondering when do we find out that one of these people just to set the whole thing up to try to get some freebies from celebrities [noise]\nPoor kid I feel bad for him and he said he has said thanks to everybody for the\n... the man [noise]\nSee now I Want to send them some no they don't need anything else but I I'm I thought about this and my birthday I would've done it and nobody showed up I Would have loved to have have court tickets for the\nLakers game well that's the other thing they said talking about you know go to that game yeah last night it's good to be insane pretty sweet\nAll these gifts\nIf you really like we don't want any more tension would you have gone to the game\nSo I've already got there the same time I was just asking the question when a bike and a PlayStation and a minder stuff man one of those things got while you're here yes so last night World Series yes Red Sox Dodgers\nRed

course that they didn't want him their team exact said we did not reach out to all of course not but\nIt's not out of spite tourist not it was originally just going to be Pedro and David in ... but we heard from a few others so they're included\n[noise] and we invited that kid who'd already showed her birthday party I don't we just we just forgot about that other guy [laughter]\nYou OK guys it yeah the guy that are made you famous that year\nHere's the thing man when we talk about how we all need to come together yes I mean we say that all the time sometimes on the show we'll talk about every one is an individual mhm well included it's the choices you make right yep\nThey should've included Curt Schilling of course they showed of yes absolutely no question about it but ... doesn't align himself with them politically therefore we're going to punish him\nBut that's one of the things that brings us to gather a lotta times I mean with kids is sports in playing games together most of the people that advocate us bring us together are the people that divide is the most\nOil 'cause I like to started the whole thing I don't want to be offensive but right\nNow it's not about unity or unifying or or demanding an apology to you're prepared to accept it's about ... feet right about saying I Want you to apologize and beg for forgiveness and now so you might see the world through my

Chris Farley and there's something on a Netflix I'm not a big\nAdam Sandler for you and I just uh on his movies I just can't get into him just can't do it but uh I did like come on Saturday Night live and he uh is pretty darn good at stand up his Dick is where he a little Biddy songs and I get a kick out of a lunch lady lady into like bad\nAh but ah here recently did a special on Netflix and if you haven't seen the uh you should it's really it's done really well and uh he did he a tribute real funny song but very heartfelt song uh for his friend Chris Farley\nAnd oh man I cried I did I mean\nIt was just done so well but I did so I I called Tom ...\nMan I cried I did I mean\nIt was just done so well that I did and so I I called time and I asked of a he'd like to uh come on and talk about it he said sure the guy is a gem of a person and uh so we'll be talking to him after the noon news at the bottom of the hour a but the story I mentioned uh\nIt happened in Dane County but not far from here just a were by Iraq daily you know what that is over by Cambridge that way you know one time I was asking for directions and it was a note that and it pulled up to a guy and I said hey do you know where this places and he looked at me he goes\nYou can't get there from here\nAnd I looked at him and he paused really long and then he broke into a smiley goes and I always wanted to say that\n[laughter]\nI'll probably never see that guy again but uh now you got me it was funny I laughed All right that three people were arrested after Dane County sheriff's deputies responded Wednesday afternoon two shots fired a call at a three sixteen\nLeon than Reno ... road in the town of Christiana deputies were called to the home at approximately five thirty PM October twenty fourth where witnesses told them Michael W. lung was threatening people and firing his hand gun\nAccording to a news release from the Dane County sheriff's office deputies recovered the handgun and casings at the scene Lund fifty eight years of age of ... was arrested on two counts of disorderly conduct while armed\n[noise]\nAh the landowner and whole homeowner\nThe landlord and homeowner a Robert a veal fifty eight of Cambridge was arrested for maintaining a drug dwelling\nAnd Jamie H seemed grist thirty six of Cambridge was arrested for possession of heroin and possession of drug paraphernalia so that was just happen in a close to home this next\nStory I can relate to this happened to my parents uh they got scammed I mentioned this before\nA guy called and boy these people know exactly what they're doing is another scam that you should probably be watching out for and get the word out on is what I think is the best thing you can do\nTell people that this was happening so if a you know because these people call you and they have such urgency to their voice and they seem to know a lot about your family and they really get you involved in a before you know what you're falling further trick and you're out all kinds of\nCash\nWell this happened in Madison or Madison woman was bilked ears or you don't see a lot bilked out of eight thousand eight hundred dollars after spending\nFive hours on the phone with people she thought were FBI agents police say she was called October eleventh from someone who describe themselves\nAs FBI deputy inspector Eddie Mauro scammer\nTold her there was a warrant out for her arrest because her name and Social Security number had been used to open numerous bank accounts now associated with money laundering according to a Madison police department incident report on top of that\nThey told her a vehicle rented in her name had been connected to an apartment where it twenty two pounds of cocaine had been recovered\nShe was told she could prove she was quote unquote governments safe by going around and purchasing gift cards from various retailers the scammer assured she would get the money back\nThe victims said she was too scared to hang up and didn't want to go to jail she told police\nWhen she finally called the Madison police department and\nOfficer told her no federal official would ever used gift cards as a means of payment or confirmation the officer called the number that had been used by the scammers but it had been disconnected the victim says the scammer broke or spoke with what sounded like an Arabic accent\nAgain this happened close to home or with my mom and\nDad are\nCute of an elderly couple a they got a call\nAnd my son was in boot camp at the time and these scammers said hey you're grandson I'm left to boot camp\nGot an ... and got an accident wasn't his fault but he hit it hit a pregnant lady and she's having complications now and we need you to send money I'm the lawyer for your son send the money to those accounts so we can uh get bail for your grandson\nAnd oh man and you know and and the thing and then they added the phone off to\nWho is supposed to be my son their grandson and he was crying and really lock that down that this was real and he kept saying don't tell mom and dad so embarrassed so they didn't call me or my wife\nAnd my my dad is having complications with cancer my mom and dad are both elderly they ran down to the bank they started this process and and they got caught up in it and lost a lot of money\nAs a result and you know I've been sharing the story and not you know\nThe and I'm Glad I Am because here's why I Want you to know about it because I don't want it to happen to you\nAnd guess what this story almost verbatim I've shared it now with a few people a lot of my friends and be told me the story back because they have already gotten this call and at some point they said wait a minute little light went on and above their head\nAnd they go oh what's her birth date or what's her mom's name or something like that and these questions that someone should know this was truly real\nAnd they didn't and then uh they figured it out but a lot of people don't before you a judge or just know that the lot of the people that are preying upon our elderly and\nThey just want to do the right thing and they get scared we're all human and uh that's just dastardly but you know what the worst thing is is that you bring us to ah ah the attention of authorities there's really nothing they can do about it\nBecause by the time or we figured this out and we wanted to stop checks and things like things like that a bank accounts that already been changed and they were gone\nAnd you know it's a good chance a lot of these scammers aren't even from the United states so just be on your toes if you've got a mom or dad\nAnd you know it's a good chance a lot of these scammers aren't even from the United states\nSo just be on your toes you got a mom or dad an elderly a person that you know of um [noise] you know just\nMentioned these stories hey this is happening or these calls are being made and they're trying to trick yeah and a lot of people are falling for it so be wise to it if anything should ever happen that ah you know somebody would call you know that the FBI doesn't work that way and the IRS doesn't work that way\nI got one of the calls the other night\nSaid you need to call this number now because a legal action is going to be taken it if you don't call a legal actually taking my call back and some poor guy or goes I suppose you're calling\nThinking I'm the IRS well this is a scam I think you're the type of person that called so I don't know what was going on there but you know that one actually left a message on my cell phone\nAnd it was like a typical Irish men it will be eyes were always smile and they were always there was always there was a light in there well I don't\nKnow I watched that special time and I I started bombing I cried I mean it was so powerful in the ... the the spot\nAnd the soul and the heart that went into that to make an Adam Sandler just love your brother\nYeah he did and you know I'm Adam ... is I Know I wouldn't call most boring guy but he's\nHe's very quiet he's very um you know he's not like the boisterous Adam ... Adam Sandler character he's just a really nice\nQuiet you know a typical George boy and he's a good guy and he just and and the only way he knows how to communicate\nIs through his comedy or his songs so when he wrote the song he was really communicating he would never said that stuff to my brother's ... mom but he he would try but the song is his way of communicating how he really felt\nThat a little posse a from a Saturday Night live your brother was in\nUh your brother just love to to make each one of those laugh and I mean you could see it in the ... were they when they bust up and they weren't supposed to but they would because your brother was a was and they they they they had no choice and you can see him with Adam Sandler was one of 'em they just love to\nTo be a um you know the uh the on the other end of your brother's camped out\nFor that so that was Chris Chris wasn't acting\nIt was just being themselves secrets and whether it was it was really funny guys\nOr just a bunch of us in a ... foot fence and Madison you were just you know you would love it when you try to make him laugh and it just it's laughter I\nI used to get a emails from people that were in rehab with a sense that she's I couldn't have gotten through that without your brother we just had me and you know he just had my spirits up all the time\nIn a in a in a in the probably the worst clean some of my life could hardly have to be there to just make it\nWork you know\nThat's worthwhile is where we're getting cruise is\nIn that song and one of the leaders in front of me but he talks about his first time meeting them Sandler in your brother and he says uses guy doing back flips and room and then next thing you know he's slow dancing with the cleaning lady\n[laughter]\n[laughter] I mean who can't visualize that in their head or you can see\nHe's yeah I mean he would always call that so I'm at the most you know just on you know assuming times oh my God I mean we we were laughing church like you wouldn't believe [laughter]\nHow'd you get a deal with that\nWell you know it's always up on the altar as a commentator so we knew we had like at least three steps on them were good [noise] so we know when he was up the glare at us like could screw around the you know and it's like you're not sitting next door so yeah\nSo when I let me ask you a little boys and a your dad\nIt's like you're not sit next door so yeah\nSo when I let me ask you when you were a little boys are and to your dad or you know I did more than the glare you dug Chris trying to make your dad laughed to get out of it\nDone all the time other town you know uh yeah\n[laughter] yeah [laughter]\nYeah I mean is this is the song I Hope people see it it's called one hundred percent fresh it's brand new one Netflix by Adam\nSandler and reading a boy some of these lyrics last big hang we had was Timmy meadows wedding party he's seen as by the way we left our our what's off and all night long and all because of barley\nBut a few months later as a party came to an end we flew out to Madison to bury your friend\nNothing was harder than saying goodbye except watching Chris his father and his turn to cry wow this is ... detail\nHarder than was it was just as hard seeing their yeah my my dad's pain I have my own pain in my own grief but free at a funeral and seen these sad clowns these sad comedians how I Would affect\nIt must like this isn't right you know to see it you know a comedian at a at a funeral for prime does however you got to\nKnow you also mentioned in the song is your brother is admiration for a John Belushi is that was that a real thing\nYou know Chris light\nThat he because of his humor\nHe was one of the most famous guys\nOn a planet for like three years ago she was and it ... you said I Want it that he wanted to be the best light pollution but\nYou know he knew he read wired and he knew that she was a dark character and he had and and not have the same upbringing as she crushed than I did\nUm so he he was very aware of that he didn't want to people who she in that sense\nAt all you know he just wanted he just wanted the success and comedy that she experienced\nYeah that is thought you know\nThe the drugs and alcohol or how the price you pay unfortunately that's what a addict tells themselves\nYou know the last time we talked a Tom are you you uh we're talking about a whole lot of the skits on SNL or come from your family\nA totally off from the Chris Farley show to ah everything on there pretty much to see a motivational speaker um and the one at home with\nMe was the Chris Farley show where he goes member when we used\nTo sell [laughter] night every night and our federal minister question because he would just continue like ... lights were out in like\n... remember that mostly watch yeah we just turned off the TV that was pretty\nScary was us like it would just go on and on and they were trying to go to the creek [noise]\nNever did you think that would be turned into one of the most beloved skits yeah ever are done with the likes of Martin Scorsese and uh uh\nBut that's that was the same when get his Tommy Boy I sure my book tour I I've met with um\nAh\nWhat's your name Warner um for the actress\nA was with Warner around we all um [noise] oh gosh maybe what she in the movie\nYeah she was oh is it love you know the love interest whatever oh\nYeah oh gosh [noise] a bowl Derek wasn't I didn't\nKnow that was that was the ... but don't use ... yeah well anyway I'm Julie Warner purely want oh okay so and\nShe was also in um doc Hollywood [noise]\nAnd there was a scene and doc Howard the duck Hollywood where Michael J. Fox he's come out of a Lakers\nSkinny dipping and critics goes every day when we were filming Tommy Boy Chris would come up to me and say chili remember that scene and doc Hollywood when you're in a good Chris I I yeah I remember that it's like that was great [laughter]\nYou couldn't do it every day\n[noise] oh my gosh oh you're just blessed me up now I mean yeah this is ah your your brother made such an impression on this world in what way too fast and uh but such an incredible talent in the people that you know these stories that we hear that you're telling now and\nUh the Adam Sandler special it all the people around him were ... they look at it as I was so fortunate\nTo be part of that he was in my life in some capacity\nI mean look this is Twenty one years later this side and Adam Sandler who still relevant and doing stuff it puts this thing at the end of the special and it it just it ... the classics flows\nOnly the without a missing a beat the game a standing ovation to stand\nOut there I mean that's you know that's sort of like a ... it's amazing\nAny uh idea where that on a Turing was I was wondering where that one was films because it's on the question\nThere was a couple a lot of times I think\nYeah well there was a bunch yeah they kept switching as that was kind of neat thing about that special is at the same joke and he would go to different auditoriums and he was doing that and he's a closer to be different and everything and it was really done well but this part of it really stole the show no doubt in my mind how it sounded\nLike I I ... I Wonder if this kind of calm and I'm white so we're at the end and that comes in like this makes sense\nSays it's it's kind of call my soul show and really and it really to science Adam as a person to yes it's not just about Chris just about Adam ... friendship\nYes well yeah and one of the things we you and I were talking about off the air is more than once in there he says it Chris Farley was the funniest person ever know", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "25"}
