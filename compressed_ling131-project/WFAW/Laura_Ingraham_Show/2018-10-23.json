others are and lobbyists that are are out and about fighting back on it\nOr a a lot of lawyers and others are and lobbyists that are are out in the boat\nFighting back on it and voters across the state I'm getting this from the Green Bay press Gazette\nVoters across the state will be asked to weigh in next month on whether state law should end the practice that has allowed big box retailers to lower their property taxes by millions of dollars and who makes up for that we do\nSeventeen counties along with six municipalities have added\nReferendum to the November sixth ballot on closing the so called dark store tax\nLoophole\nAnd this is according to the Wisconsin elections commission now what is the dark store\nLoophole\nYou know and this is where things in Washington and in Madison\nThings like this don't get dealt with the way they should because it doesn't roll off the tongue to little confusing takes too much time to talk about that's why\nYou know it's just too hard and to spit back on it all you have to do is come up with a catchy slogan\nA kind of cool a thirty second spot and you can keep things the way they are and you've seen this but you also seen or some commercials I'm\nSaying to a close this loop all but what is it okay well let's find out it all comes down to a seemingly simple question is an occupied store worth more than a vacant one\nNow historically local assess or his base to the taxable value of a store on a formula that included both the value of the building and its use\nThat began to change with a two thousand and eight Wisconsin's Supreme Court decision in wall green a corporation versus\nCity of Madison that limited how uh sensors could lease payments on calculating property assess property tax assessments\nSince then a big box retailers have expanded their challenge of local assessments by arguing innocent palate to use improperly assessed commercial buildings based on their full business use\nRather than the actual value of the brick and mortar structure this is the dark store argument that vacant or dark stores\nAre the Ferris comparison for assessing taxable property\nValue an arts Walgreens Walmart and other big box retailers\nHave used these laws to sue municipalities across the state for lower assessments\nReducing their taxes as a result critics say this has shifted to the tax burden on the homeowners and small businesses\nNow last year USA Today network\nAnalyzed one hundred and thirty dark store cases across the state dating back to twenty fourteen and the sixty seven cases open at that time\nRetailers were trying to cut their taxes by more than seven\nHundred million buck a real nice\nSo why is it on the ballot simply put counties in ... want to pressure the state lawmakers to take action ... are feeling the squeeze as they feel lawsuit after lawsuit\nAs of last year nearly sixty towns cities and villages had paid refunds to these big box stores to settle the cases Janesville alone has returned at seven hundred thousand dollars in tax money since twenty fourteen\nJanesville just down that road out their\nLegislation to close the so called loophole stalled in Madison last year one bill would have addressed the a portion of the Supreme Court ruling to clarify that lease agreements cannot be factored into property of a valuations\nOr the other would have a prohibited closed or vacant properties from being valued the same as occupied retail properties of Governor Scott Walker has said he'd like to see the issue addressed in the legislative session early next year\nAccording to the ... news the Wisconsin state journal has reported that Walker his opponent Democrat Tony ... is in favor of dark store legislation the local referendum won't change state law but we'll give lawmakers a sense of where voters across the state\nStand on the issue I'm going to tell you where it is one more time there was a bunch there are a bunch of places this is going to

this is something that I Know many of you are thinking well for gosh darn it\nA ... why isn't this already been dealt with seems like it's a no brainer\nOh well you know what a no brainer is get checked up the door sometimes state capital and\nIs a has made it it made its way or it is a bipartisan effort by the way\nYou don't get to say that every day a but it is a bipartisan effort to take care of this in a state\nCapital but it hasn't gone all the way it hasn't made both houses and gotten into the governor's desk\nBut we'll see what happens now being on the ballot have kind of changes everything 'cause they're right in this article that I just read it so you know a lot of times a lawmaker will say you know that's an issue but I don't know how big it is I don't know really how people feel I mean it that happens\nOr you might have thought on it and you go out you know I'm I could use some back up on it and that's what this will do they'll turn it'll change the dynamic of the

say likes this loophole wants to leave it all the way it is\nIn the ... votes to close it well now you got a little ah we've got all conundrum going and that will ah maybe change some hearts and minds

well\nWill probably take a look at that before November ... as well and uh get some thoughts on that one if you have any thoughts\nYou know we don't take calls and the show because we we try to stuff as many interesting guests on it as we can and if you will you know what if you want to be a guest you can go to my Facebook page and there I have a button and it says emailed me and you can email me\nThey could very easily beat the Dodgers it was tremendous and it was unexpected because next year is when we thought that's the year\nThat's when everybody is going to be um you know reaching their potential they've pictures like we were up in carbon burns and ... they're starting pitchers they may be in the starting rotation next year\nUm some of the younger players that\nYou know are up and down like Orlando Garcia he came on at the end of the year while they're expecting big things from him in the future so I Know a lot of people are really disappointed or how to end it was but\nYou know like in two thousand eleven everything geared up to that and you knew it was a one shot deal Prince Fielder is going to leave they had to win that here and they didn't and you felt kind of crush\nThis one on you know what the future is really bright so I think there's a lot more ahead for this team\nRight so you're you're right there's all kinds of critics out there and some of them like to focus on job for us to use a poor performance in the playoffs what you see those people they gripe about\nWell he failed again really important times it happens it happens all over baseball Cleveland curse shock the Dodgers star people call it the best pitcher in baseball he has been really mediocre in the postseason\nUm they were better that you know Christian no it did not have a great series against Dr\nIt happens there there's so much focus\nAnd intensity in these news baseball game of failure you know the most ... if if you get three hits out of ten you're considered an all star\n... Jeremy Jeffress was fantastic this year he is one of the main reasons they got to where they were it didn't work out in the postseason um he'll bounce back he's a big part of their plans for the future\nIt would be All right with it it happen it's going to happen in the world series somebody like Craig kimbrell the red Sox called and it will probably blow up people will go nuts it happens to the best\nSo are you this experience now that we have a wider laws are not going on to the world series all important is that to come back next year\nI look at it like you know the cubs they went from\nA five year rebuild it leaves and the brewers never lost a hundred games er Cox lost a hundred games but they got better and better and then added a few key pieces they got to be an option you can ship series got swept by the Mets the next year that go to the world series and they want it\nThat could be steps that the birds take um I don't ... David Stern and credit counselor at a news conference today and see nothing news conference and they they were real specific about a lot of things they made it sound like they're going to add some peace I don't think they're going to go crazy maybe they will go out and get starting pitcher\nBut they have like seven or eight candidates to be in their starting rotation for next year Jimmy Nelson is a wildcard we don't know if he's going to be ready for next year but those young pitchers shot scene chase Anderson I wouldn't be surprised that they signed a free agent picturing the off season but\nYou know they they said Eric things is still very much in their plan I wouldn't be surprised if he was traded and they may upgrade the capture position I don't know aircraft will be back he was fantastic in the postseason but he's thirty eight\nUm there there might be little things that will be anything like last August\nI don't know aircraft will be back he was fantastic and policies and but he's thirty eight\nUm there there might be little things it won't be anything like last season when they went out that yellow Kate in the same day I don't think they're going to have anything big blockbuster movies you know for next year but it's that process of getting better getting better getting better\nI'm a real important decision will be Michael stock it I he there's a mutual options so they have to agree you have to agree that they would pick up the option for Fifteen million dollars for a salary for next year I don't know that fits into their payroll or not\nI don't know for sure if he wants to stay here or not or become a free agent he might be able to get more money elsewhere that's a decision after making the next month if they keep ... stock is\nThen what about Jonathan scope he might be gone maybe shamu to second base fulltime stock is doesn't states and shop please third base maybe they keep scope so there's a lot of decisions like that but after he made\nBut there are so much better than having decisions like wow we don't have anybody to play the outfield wow we don't have the first base but you know they've got those things\nIf they would have made it to the world series winner Eric seems been brought into the line up to the ... when they're in the American league or\nReally good question I doubt it just because they have to keep as many pictures as they did um they could really only afford to have four or five bench players and I think it would've been\nUm you know it might have been a situation where they'd have scope or or or I'm\nA parent is playing second base and then shot would be that the age something like that depending on if it was a righty or left he started I think themes was buried enough by the end of the season that it would depend on the world series roster\nWow you know how does a guy like that take that to have to be on the outside looking in\nYou know he handled it great um you know it was burning 'em up inside the same thing with with that faith and chase Anderson I mean these these were key players for this team for most of the year they lost that job because he broke his wrist or a thumb\nAnd it wasn't by plane badly it just it gave any large Hanson he took it and ran with it um you would expect that these guys with the you know I'm not going to be on the roster body\nNo they were all there they were out you know they work out before the games\nIn the days between theories they had lived batting practice there is the day these curling Anderson throwing things they all handled it really well um and I give them a lot of credit because that had to be so hard when you're such an important part of the team and then all of a sudden you're forgotten about\nI Know only because you had to make those decisions you never did tell us know what you think is going to happen with ... you see a going to be gone\nI Would guess yeah they have\nTheir second base of the future is cast in here uh he was the first round draft pick last year he shot up to the miners the guy's a natural born hit or it's a matter of the fence um he had elbows surgery last year\nThey he may start next season with the rivers but I've really done I think she'll still be in Tripoli eventually he is the second base in the future for the birds\nThere's another guy Murray Field to bond who they were about to bring up to play short stop when they sent her feet down in the first time this year bond towards the the L running the bases\nOtherwise he would have been a big part of the heat of the guy that made me with the team right from the start next year playing the same kind of role is Iran here as he could play shortstop you could play second base whatever that kinda stuff means is Howard Dean of probably there won't be a job for\n[noise] I was just trying to make a bad joke anyway let me ask you this who's going to be gone for sure you you know you're you're guessing it a lot of them or their status is do we know anybody that does not going to be more next year\nAs the the gases would be way by lead a jail in ...\nI'm Sorry a horse and Daniel maybe it would be gone they I think they they they have an option that can be picked up and it's not real expensive I'm guessing either crafts or opinion there will be gone\nProbably craft because his age ah but the the the regulars on this team there there's really nobody you know outside of maybe ... stock is that will be gone one\nYou know we'd Miley why are you so sure that he's going to be going\nUm he's a free agent and the way he pitched down the stretch somebody is going to think he is work a lot more money than the brewers will and I'm guessing that he'll get priced out of their range will be because they don't have the desperation to get them to like him because outside of him\nIt's All right handed starters and they'd like to have a left handed starting pitcher so they end up signing on to it freezes he may be the resigned Miley he enjoyed it here\nI Know sure seemed to like be having fun\nHe did and you know but then once I think the knows it's not the players the agent in the business part of it gets involved if he's offered twelve\nMillion a year by some other team he's got a ticket\nHe's the one that reminded me the most of uh the eighty three brewers are really two members didn't he I mean just the way he carries himself and his hairstyle and\nShaggy looking looking woman connoisseur people yeah guys you know a country boy\nAnd he really he's not the kind of guy that loves the spotlight and loves the the big city you fit in well\nWe're we're going to take a real quick make bring can we come back and what you predict a mini channels future and Mickey a production for the world series that'll happen next\nOn Twitter or on baseball got stuck in the middle [noise]\nGet the latest from limbo I'm the titles on reports this is Wisconsin radio networks for your bill Scott joined me every Monday to
