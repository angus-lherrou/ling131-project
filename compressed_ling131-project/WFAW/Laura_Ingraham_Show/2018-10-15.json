tires rotated and pick up a drier on your way home and the same store I\nCould remember the terminology my grandmother and grandfather used to use about Sears which was yeah we always trade there\nRight ... yeah\nThat was right just a binocular of the day and it would there was a loyalty and that's your you wet\nMontgomery Ward Sears but dude\nThey made bad decisions made very very bad decisions again and again that whole Internet thing just sort of snuck up on people didn't it\nWell they could have been right there absolutely because we were already conditioned which catalogs and we were already condition to ordering online only we didn't order online and was being a male\nHowever\nI mean they they were way out in front of everything they just didn't convert they didn't they didn't get it\nYou have a catalog stuff was big it was a huge and they they have those people on the list they understood\nThe the value in not going to the actual brick and mortar store they got it early on they just couldn't make the conversion couldn't or wouldn't boy I'm too I mean it's it's really it's it's a sad deal it is part of America on it but then people\nAsk me okay ones last time you were there uh I Know but I Want ten years ago where you see different statements that people have made ... there was one it was just brutal\nPolar Rosenbaum co founder and managing partner of the retail advisory from our is our research said the carcass has had everything picked off its bones this is one of the saddest retail stores I've ever seen Sears was the Amazon of its day think about the Sears catalog\nThey weren't see there you go that's my point yeah they had their chance it was right there man\nTrump said it was said he was asked about he was like yo yeah\nWhen I was a big deal

reinvent yourself a lot of retail is done that day reinvented themselves I mean I look I look at target for instance yeah that was kind of like a a I was on the Kmart level for many many years and it reinvented themselves\nOkay uh\nI'm going to try to take about a minute and a half on this okay I'm going to explain to you how it happens I go okay ah do\nYou remember when you were in the eighties

in these big businesses too I'm convinced of it I read too many stories\nThat you have to have enough young bright energy to say this is where this has gone we got to take the risk if we keep doing catalog business we're going to die and some people just can't see the future do you\nThink that's it yes um you see it in every in history and it is one of my all time favorite movies is a money ball where they discuss this very thing that is true\nInnovate or die true innovate or die simple as that OK moving on other toxic Sears would've talked to us first [laughter] [noise]\nI don't think we can

little bit older but people still say it\nI'm Glad because sometimes I'd throw something out there and I go man I tip in my hand those old man river I Am W T F to both of you guys right now I Know your [noise]\nYou know what's still holds up over time what's that\nBeauty that's a ... he's a real\nBeauty that's a good one I liked that one that one very descriptive guy\nOr some just parenting news out there well Craig Allen\nTo actually gave one of these to me that sometimes I Wonder if it's because he's very anxious to have a child of his own\nI Hope so I was wife I wouldn't like could teach a small child how to play a sport that is very true I doesn't have to be my kid it'd be awesome if it was my kids don't you think you should play one first like I Do\nI Know how to play things [laughter] home I'm going out to Jamie in basketball are going to be terrorists that aside swam there from Rob and it was like oh my God and all that was when we were by ourselves for a week here on this and the thing the guy got got rounds you All right\nSo basically it's eleven rules for teaching kids a sport it can be fun it can be frustrating you can do it the wrong way I've read a bunch of different stuff about this and going back I'm like man I made a mistake there and their and their\nUm their son is a good athlete though so you must have must have taught and learn something from you\nAbout dude it's not just whether or not the kid is good at whatever they do their donors are good athlete\nWill thing she got athletic genes running in your family thank you to my wife you know I'm ... you're trying to build a relationship you know what I mean sometimes it gets lost because you know you're thinking about nothing but\nBecoming better and and trying to win all those things but you're losing focus of the goal in the end of the values that you're trying to teach the kid and you're also trying to build a relationship you have with them at the same time and you can get lost in that you know\nI mean there's I read some great things talking about keeping the main goal in\nMind you know what I mean yeah I Do because the reality is how many kids I mean first of all play pro give me a break it's tiny yeah playing college it's also very small very small you know so you try to keep these things in mind\nYou know I can I ask you about that do you tell that your kid that they're probably not going to be a professional athlete is that something you impart to them at some point or no\nOr it's not so much that I mean you're not trying to kill dreams but as they become\nCertain ages then you're giving them facts okay like here's how many make it here's you know here's an example of three people this is what they do every day I'm you know you're ready for that are you willing to make these kinds of sacrifices\nI vividly remember remember my uncle John and he'll hate that I say this could email it to the show taking me to play basketball twelve and then telling me I wasn't gonna go pro I vividly remember that and I know twelve might be old enough to hear that but for me it was still rough\nIt's tough you know but I mean and I don't know if that's on the tips to tell them they couldn't be a pro to keep playing as hard as they can well\nWhat's he saying you're basically going to be of five eleven white guy [laughter] that doesn't really jumped much is not super quick\nYeah those are the words he chose yeah I mean he could have said to the odds are really not in your favor right and it's nice to have a ... but hey chase it as long as you want right\nThat would be nicer I liked it better to have a deadly winds low for you right and then also looking you'll never amount to anything when you get to anything it's like hey look I may\nI ask one more question looking at these tapes man when you gave your son or your daughter advice for sports did you read stuff like that so you just kind of trust yourself\nOh no I had to read a ton no because listen if you think you've already got it figured out usually the first dummy [laughter] you know I mean\nAnd it's not that other people are always the experts but you're trying to take it as much information and then figure out okay exactly what makes sense the other thing is especially in the world of athletics\nYour goal may be different than say the world of sports you know and a lot of times honestly my opinion the world of sports the priorities are jacked up\nReally jacked up you know what I'm saying 'cause especially the young age you should be developing players you know what I mean when they're nine is that little piece of plastic that ... is it that big a deal\nYou work more on development than just beating another team you're trying to win but development is more important at\nThat age my opinion but all these tips I think are okay\nBut you brought out start small get the right gear yes you ever see a little kid try to use grown up golf clubs that were just down there I mean it's like it's like they're trying to ... swing a sledgehammer half you know it'll you know you try to make it fun\nKeep the stakes low\nI suppose but there's also if you want like running a practice little competitions are good he keeps kids involved and that that teachers are competitive spirit there's going to be winners and losers and there is forget that everybody gets the trophy nonsense you know\nThere's one on here that I really I think it does I Want your reaction to switch things up before high school it's rarely a good idea for kids to play the same sport he around ... I think that's accurate yes yes\nAnd the and the more time goes on to the more you read the more you believe that because of overuse injuries are big from staying with one sport\nLike baseball as an example kids aren't getting wrecked the Tommy John surgery is that an all time high for high schoolers even sometimes down a middle school time off\nIt you should be taken months off at a time I agree that if you're going to be throwing anybody that now I'm giving up my kid playing on the NBA now he's got he's got to play all the time if he's going there what are they saying all these sports all the time\nI Want athletes athletes played different sports you're you're getting different skills that's what I read quite a bit\nWas this don't be too demanding that is true don't smoke that's always good advice [laughter] yes here's my advice for you um it\nThey come up with some jacked up charges\nAnd then they just hold up and we saw that with ... in Iran during Obama's presidency yes and it goes on and on and Obama doesn't do anything\nUntil it's like this exchange for hostage is oh I'm Sorry we don't do exchange for hostages except we did and gave them cash\nRemember yes okay yes so in this situation and I don't see this reported a whole lot with the pastor in Turkey we put the screws to them with sanctions that's what Trump and the administration did and they cry uncle\nYes\nAnd we didn't have to go play or to be named later but Harris to be now later there was a double the when the Trump column and\nWe'll have none of that CERN not with the outrage we're still experiencing over judge Kavanaugh\nSo that nobody here I mean you're right that's the stuff that so many\nIn the media and the bubble don't understand that there are plenty of people in America that pay attention to this stuff and then they ask themselves the question where is that story ... ...\nUnless you're going to show the bachelor that's back in the United states praying with Trump vintage shall be mocked\nRight [noise] no it yes it will\nBut no you know the fever pitch is the journalists and I didn't want to see that happened to him either and yes Saudi Arabia should be held accountable but\nHe's in the fraternity who's in the fraternity the journalist\nOh that fraternity what the that turn out one of ours so we're going to make its top priority that one of our guys yes that's ... whatever\nYeah what what was he doing over there you know\nThere is just folks trying to spread the gospel have none of that yeah get out of it [noise]\nUm did you see the peace in the failing New York times over the weekend it's getting harder to talk about God\nDid you see this yes you would agree of course I agree yes\nYeah it just talks about more than Seventy percent of Americans identify as Christian but you wouldn't know it from listening to them\nBecause a lot of people even not Christian don't feel comfortable speaking about faith most of the time no\nTrue\nWhy is that because you're ridiculed for it because ... here's the thing this and this thing that bothers me the most\nI'm a guy if a if you're a guy paid who are both we're both people of faith right I'm I'm sort of new to it or you've been above for quite a while now but when you bring it up\nI always get that yeah you Christians and you're and it's like these idiots\nThat proposed to it to everyone there Christians and they use that as an example that's what you guys are you guys are this right now I'm not I'm not that I don't believe that at all\nBut at least it's in the conversation so then you then I read a cure for bend defending it and then I'm a I'm a cook like they're a kook oh are you talking about like Facebook I'm Talking to you well yeah Facebook all on their interactions to well Facebook I get into fights all the time about\nThis [noise] [noise] yeah I mean yeah some people even notice used a cruise ship to read so you can't be a crucial with all those tattoos first of all no one ever said that did this guy it makes you think\nPeace on Facebook in an interesting video but it didn't happen\nWell it's like anything else\nAnd then you know I'm not her I'm not in that club okay it's like anything else you denounce yes you know they have no that's not what does that about me and then at least you're having a conversation it's difficult man when you are lumped into that in that group with everyone else\nIt's very difficult I understand that 'cause you just kind of keep it to yourself you don't want to cause waves well they don't want to be accused of something you know a split stick the workplace for example\nRight yeah well they do it there but we do all the time I mean we have at least you know with Craig with David\nWe we all come from different places yes with belief right mhm and I mean Craig\nThat rain he had for a little while as the Catholic mouthpiece on this show I Know he was always very excited\nWhen I was so excited to be roped into this conversation do [laughter] you know excited to be here now\nThis but I Want you to be honest I was honestly OK if it was ever offensive because we've talked about some deeper things man David more agnostic you're Catholic have questions um what I Do okay do you yeah I mean everybody has question I certainly\nKnow this is a show that I don't admit that on the air grandma he's lying [laughter] I don't think about that grandma and my question is a very simple what church that I go to on friday that's the thing I asked him I said we all have questions they're not and should I go twice on Sundays and my question\nBut it's a pretty free ranging conversation and I am one of those just listen none of us know for sure why it's called face ...\nKnow if you're having this year I'm right the\nI'm One of those it lets none of us know for sure why it's called face ...\nNow if you're having this year I'm right the the random stranger you know or someone you don't know that well at work if you start just spewing force that's not going to work there's got to be a relationship there ... you know but at least in this piece in the failing New York times\nIs that people are just afraid to talk about it at all I agree we all believe in something or some believing nothing which is believing in something\nRight I suppose if you believe it or not he still believe in something right yes I Know it's off the point from this this kind of generalized topic bombing Catholic right now is not really something I enjoy talking about yeah well it's not something in a lot of circles that you enjoy where the conversation immediately goes a bit of a problem now isn't it it's just a bit\n... what's even worse if you're on a radio show and you're the only Catholic on the show so people are you saying what say you about all this with the ... [laughter]\nTwice in Sunday Graham either [laughter] probably during the week [laughter]\nBut\nThis is another one of those stories and maybe this is just really true\nOn the coast and when you're just\nLiving amongst people all the time and having conversations with people that don't believe the same that you do\nThese things do come up\nYou know what I mean and you respect one another you don't believe the same things but you can find common ground that you share\nMhm you know and\nMaybe it is as bad as everyone puts it out to be I mean when you see another antifa you know\nPiece of violence from the weekend and there's clashes with ... you know with the right and the left but just everyday law abiding citizens that made me believe same things than there are you know just part of a workplace or part of a community\nThey get along all the time but that doesn't make much news but I Do hear conversations like this but I understand what you're saying it's got it's harder to bring up it is sometimes it just comes naturally\nThat's okay and when it comes up naturally I'm I'm okay with it but it is very difficult to share your face without being labeled a hypocrite or with all young labeled or whatever and I've heard it all well I Am a hypocrite so am I I'm trying to do better strategy better every day but I'm On a board of directors of hypocrite [laughter]\n\nBut I don't I Believe I Know what the the ... yeah I Want to be I'm not there yet I Hope I get there but no I'm not there yet um\nBut since we're we're having this this sweet sort of moment together now you can trashed those people on Facebook that are driving me crazy\nYou mentioned this affair you and that just made me think of it because yes\nYou mentioned on Facebook you'll be a blow back about your faith and what about this and there's you know all sorts of fights on social media all the time ... but there are other things that drive you crazy you know what we should do that coming up and just a few Joey I and I want to get I mean I we can we can look and\nFlush the sound a little bit if you like [noise] it's the cryptic sort of messages that drive you more crazy than anything really is I

[laughter]\nAll right we're going to talk about what's going on a politically a lot of debating going on last night I think you were a part of a debate between the uh uh attorney general and a Brad ... and his opponent Josh call anything or any ... on that debate\nOr you know the debate in front of that as well and you know we'll try very hard to drive a ... he's a law enforcement choice with office more heavier on friday that last night a call ... hitting show on a couple of things one of\nThe law suits you don't hear them for that to the contrast of\nAnimal not doing enough in coal or are we term to address the backlog of rape health care and then about any money on rent or promotional item ... at the same time I'm showing me well they're talking about the national leader\nOn testing Rick about driving by the wind or anything do and the thing that we look forward to things like this is is there a gaffe significant that there's always a TV yet or it'll kind of live on it for me and I don't really know that from people I talked to all those kind of moment that they are\nThey going to one more time I believe tomorrow walking Rotary Club owners feel TV campaign style three year old oh\nWe got a lot of debate going on and it seems and that's okay I some people like sports I like sports but I like the beach too because you're right in our world right now at the beach used to be a big thing way back when they are now and gee I refer to it is if you make a gaffe if you make a blunder\nOur world right now to be used to be a big thing we back when one thing are now and gee I referred to it is if you make your gas\nIs blonder if you take a good shot that's would make the needle move otherwise if it's just business as usual I think you've got to give it to the incumbent as a result of that is what happens to me right\nYeah I mean honestly like the presidential debates are different you know different story right because you have millions eyeballs on those things watching that in Wisconsin I mean even for a federal race or race for governor I mean is that they are usually on like a friday night or the weekend night they're competing with high school football\nLike defending debate on Saturday was can\nYou know right came right after the brewers loss in right as a ... take it on Michigan um things like that can be in people's attention to this is there's just not the audience for these things that there are\nWe were talking about a presidential race and therefore there's ... that's where the opportunity to change the dynamic of a race I'm getting barring that big gaffe he paid media\nSo last name ... she or he I I like the style of this debate last night it was at a table and he tried to see that we're going to have a conversation some may have a special name like a town hall debate is there a name for that kind of debate last makes me kind of like a you know\nWhat good does is unlike other debates like were you get Ninety seconds to answer it's a little more free flowing and there's a little more opportunity for give and take than like in the broadcasters debate on Saturday for us\nIt was like you got ... seconds of that was that there was no object for follow up or a bottle or anything like that they just one\nQuestion answer answer done um so you know I sometimes I prefer format where the opportunity to kind of follow up and kind of go back and forth but they keep it as having a moderator who knows what he or she is doing an accomplice format knowledgeable enough about the issues to compress the candidates on these things\nAren't so ah let's try to keep the debate street last night was the first one between a ... opponent Josh call for a ... a they're going to be two more times when does that\nNo so that that last that was the second one oh say tomorrow\nWith for the Milwaukee rotary they were going to do with the debate October twenty sect that has since been canceled because uh they what they realize that they were going up against is also a big group of troll debate that night plus a World Series going on there and\nTry and move to different date cannot work out a workout agreement I Want to do that so\nLast eight have eight tomorrow we have the final US Senate debate on friday we also have a debate the governor's race a first between Tony Evers and Scott Walker a debate in the first congressional\nDistrict on Fridays will be a triple header those keeping score at home and then next Saturday or friday at Fridays her next rather twice actually at the last patrol debate with a Walker and eras and then I think I get my weekend nights back for a little while [laughter]\nAll right well that's not going to happen the next few weeks now the ads are coming in full force it seems some new ads are showing up who's spending money to them barn or TV's\nA notable that Josh call has his first TV ad up on the air this one talked about um\nThat contrast from the ... tried to make about Russia more spending money on you know commemorative coins for the department of justice while these rape kits were tested um shovel has a new ad future got a series of women who sings praises him into the quote unquote real\nBrad shovel seemed to be a nod towards the gender problems that Republicans were having a cycle\nThat we have in the governor's race I'm kind of the two of the heavier hitters the Republican Governors Association of any Democratic governors association they're both spending money on TV they're both with us today so it's it's starting to heat up or really going to get that point another week where it's\nWall to wall TV at every turn the TV on\nLet's talk a little bit of both to some debates that have happened is between the U.S Senate candidates the incumbent Jimmy ... when you leave me or anybody slip up there and get some good shot soon\nUh what was interesting was the first debate last Monday we could go from today there are a lot of response a lot of reaction that bold when did it look as sharp as people expected in\n... she looked fairly you know didn't really poorly because she was little I don't know hesitant three word or just kind of like not really smooth and our answers the ... book there was much more energized a much more on the attack would you expect from a candidate down by double digits to some polls but then in Saturday's debate\nBall was much more bugs smoother much more comfortable I'm ... I'm ball we've got an hers but again I didn't notice a game changing moments\nAnd the debate and for his mom says because her it was like what they saw the book there a week ago they all the knowledge that you know they just they need to have for dinner the better chance they both mirror or independent groups grip on the air with TV as there is here to people because\nThe Marquette poll last week you know show that she's still upside down with voters I mean by that I mean that\nBore people have an unstable oppression we vote for they have a favorable one that's a problem less than a month out elections and balls and had a huge financial advantage she raised\n... six million dollars and the third quarter which is clear campaign a record for a federal cat it from Wisconsin for that period\nUm I have not seen those numbers yet but she has not been in the ballpark was fall when it comes to fundraising and all that three month period and spent eight million dollars roughly that's a lot of going to drop at a campaign of Wisconsin so they're just underscores the financial advantages\nThat you know ball but I have\nAn incumbent has in the Senate yeah you're right well one of the things that can be a shot in the army has been a not always but it has been for a lot of candidates are running on the Republican side used to have the president come to town and I know a a leader who has talked about that happening I'm the one question for you do we know when and where\nNo one vice president Pence was in town of state last week and campaigning for Walker he kinda teed a Trump is it but didn't really tell us when so we're supposed to find out when that might happen but\nSometime this month we think there's going to a visit from Donald Trump will be addressed and watch\nYou know it is it ... do a little bit and where are they going to put on you know I've had people on the Republican side argued to me that if you know put Donald Trump up in Wausau for example and kind of light up the debt rural vote\nA Green Bay so it has a better market because you've got more more people in the Green Bay market and that's a powerful for all territory so\nI doubt it come to Madison unless they're looking for protesters and you know the idea of Democrats being quote unquote unhinged otherwise I'd expect probably Green Bay maybe below walkie for that stop and uh you know it's going to be interesting dynamic for Walker of the president is not very popular Wisconsin overall\nBut he invites a certain ... the Republican base and they need those folks\n\nI think it was politics luncheons political figures or\nYou've got two of them come in your next one and I'm very interested in this one in the way these lunches you talk more about your will tell you what you can do to be a part of it like a business leaders are government leaders and others are just kind of spend some time listening to the speakers\nAnd you're gonna leaders from the uh Wisconsin state Senate\nOr a ... year old the majority leader or Jennifer shoveling the minority leader they're going to be there and I think you could get a kind of neat that can be kind of energy or so so what's the next and if people watch how can they learn more\nThe bill if if it hadn't had that ended the problem with that argument reason I think it's legally we is at the same Congress that made the mandate zero also has decided not to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nBut also the consequences of the students if it's successful are going to be really harmful to Wisconsin I took the reason that reasons I mentioned it would eliminate protections for people to pre existing conditions once again health insurance companies would be able to live coverage on the basis of a pre existing conditions on I I think at a time when we are fighting\nAn opioid epidemic that continues to get worse we had a growing problem we have a shortage of prosecutors in Wisconsin um this is not where we should be using our our tax dollars\nSo the Republicans are chosen instead of taking a what some people call Obamacare the ... the\nName we that was given a instead of taking that in fixing what was broken\nAnd they want to wipe it away and then they want to start over\nAnd so a attorney general ... is a taking this on and when he brings this case against the ... is there a little asterisk ... cause of heard him talk about well no I didn't want to take away the pre existing conditions as soon as time went away and I'm not talking about uh the twenty six year old still being on their\nOn their parents' insurance doesn't work that way that he can pick and choose what he wants to attack\nThem in this suit is arguing that the entire thing should be struck down now what he said at our today um is that um you know there was\nA there are protections in place for people in Wisconsin before the Affordable CARE Act was passed we at high risk pools are but those are not an adequate substitute for the protections for pre existing conditions that we have now there were a the cops were high there were waiting times a minute and just a fraction of the people\nAre more protected as compared to who are now protected\nI'm Sorry I think we need to keep this federal protection in place as\nSoon as in other words the train had both ways by keeping some of the things that whole real high in attacking the other parts you\nKnow I said that seems to be some of what's going on here I mean I I think that if if you want people with preexisting conditions that protection a thing to do is to withdraw from the suit um there are protections in place for people preexisting conditions now a ... and you know there's there is no replacement um right now we heard about ... over the place\nI'm In several different election cycles but there's NO PLAN in place right now to replace the Affordable CARE Act simply just actively record all I think what we should be doing is working to expand access to ... a ridge and working to reduce costs and so I think we should expand Medicaid Wisconsin\nAll right so in other um\nCriticism you have a current attorney general is uh he's ... he's purchased some swing again the tax here a dollar a taxpayer dime or for those who don't know what what is done what does he bought with our money for his office the UCs kind of silly\nHe spent about a a three thousand dollars of taxpayer money on promotional materials and that includes um commercial stressful includes custom made fortune cookie\nI'm editing includes nearly ten thousand dollars of taxpayer money that was spent on gold plated a commemorative coin I'm with his name on them um and and it you know this is the thing is the first two years I guess I'm a first year in office suite here's the millions of dollars that they did\nAnd if you know this is my first two years of dollars to address our backlog of on the grid gets there over ... thousand hits\nBut after that for two years only nine of those kids\nHave to do that in the meantime ten thousand dollars on coins um so I think that it was a very strong example\nNow I was a state legislator Josh and there's no way that I could have gone to use my my budget that I had from my office that you're supposed to use to have a um a correspondence with your constituents there's no way and I know the rules are a little different but\nUh they ... out of town if I were to use that money or for stress balls and fortune cookies or was he playing by the rules to do this or does it say that he could do this or how does that work\nUm what I think the problem with is that if it's a waste of say okay I I haven't looked at the top it all the appropriate rules but this is not where we are attacked\nOne of the legislators legislatures said you know what are we notice that does somebody a play by the rules because we've got to change those rules so he can't buy medallions and the stress balls would you be in favor of a change in that role if you a bikini gee\nI don't think there's any reason that motion materials I mean certainly you know take the gold plated coins will you know it it neither neither corn role on a lot\nOf watchdog\nFor for interest or\nFind a woman I talk a little bit about the debate last night Josh should uh uh you uh had some criticism for our current energy on his on the um what they call ... gets in a sexual assault kids\nAre on it and when we come back if you could tell us what those are and what exactly your criticism you touched on a little bit but we'll talk more about it right after the break\nIn
