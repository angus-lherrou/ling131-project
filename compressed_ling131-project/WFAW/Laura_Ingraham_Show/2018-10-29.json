of\nA high school principal talking about the girl skirts\nApparently they're a little high ... same as like a meat to moment waiting to happen no controversy maybe didn't handle that the best as as the as well as he could've says says some critics\nThan me\nI don't know man will get into that that's a pretty interesting conversation Johnny Depp out\nThat's the word daily mail TV reporting that Johnny Depp has been booted from the pirates of the Caribbean franchise ... and I'm Wondering what the hell took so long because he had a good run obviously which with the pirates of the Caribbean franchise of course the last movie didn't do so well\nI almost thought you're going to say was sobriety like genetic great runway sobriety no yeah Hi\nThe best out even from one of the movies but I was hanging out with that show him on the street corners somewhere ... uh yeah I\nJust I I wondered what took so long especially with the me too movement being what it is I mean this was the guy who beat up a woman y'all that's the word he beat up amber heard mhm and yet he got a pass or it seemed like he got a pass\nFrom a lot of people it really did like nobody's putting him under the microscope you know everybody's gonna obsess over guys like Matt Lauer but what about Johnny Depp not only beat up under him or her but it also is salted ... movies\nWell and it wasn't just that it seemed like he was hit a patch she was still getting promoted right coverage in Q. magazine stuff like that like oh here's an e so charming\nHe's so charming Lee weird if you give me a break that's Johnny Depp but apparently it's gonna be ... now talking to daily mail TV was one of the script writers steward a ...\nRight I think he's got a great run obviously he's made that character his own talking about ... to Caribbean movie and it's become a character he's most famous for now and get all over the world love him as a character so I think it's been great for him to integrate barrage I'm just very happy about it by being ... will be his legacy\nWhich we only character he's played five times in the character he dresses up to visit children in hospitals are taught will be remembered for\nBut at the same time apparently he's on the way out here man\nLike anybody else that's going through a number of different things that I I I mean I'm not to just\nApparently he's on the way out hey man it's like anybody else that's going through a number of different things and I I mean I'm not to just say oh him\nBeating up a woman now yeah it's no it wouldn't be he can get a rehab it'll be fine you know it's like\nYou want to see people restored you want to see people you know battle there demons when a become a different person but\nTo act like the dude doesn't have a problem right just like is a charming no data actors destructive man I mean gosh dang you're right how how did it take this long I'm completely different story\nBut I guess related in my own mind thinking about different scenes over time not that Johnny Depp was ever accused of this um but when you have you know actors actresses doing intimate scenes\nUm heard many times that described as so awkward because you got all the lighting P L all the crew was around it's it's not like a regular interaction between a man and woman staff right\nYep sometimes there have been actors maybe even actresses I'm\nSurprised the other person with the way a scene goes down like what was it that really in the script or you read later this got way heavier than you thought it was going to HBO is now using intimacy coordinators\nFor all the\nWell sex scenes on his shows I got into the wrong business in that you want to be the coordinator I don't know that might be horribly awkward\nOkay do what it what is the intimacy coordinator uh they make sure everybody's cool with everything that goes into a particular scene guy like are you going to be comfortable if this person does this and then you know I Would guess it\nGoes down to the choreography of ... hands full east and I who knows man just making sure that nothing quote inappropriate happens while the cameras are role where I write\nDepending on what your definition of the word inappropriate is\n\nWell she's on top of him with no clothes and ... that's okay\nBut we want to make sure nothing inappropriate happened he well he said something that was very untoward right now made her feel very uncomfortable in that exact moment mhm\n[noise] ah apparently the idea came from Emily ... who plays a prostitute on the show the ... and she said when it comes to sexuality one of the most vulnerable things for all humans men and women there's really no system there's never been a person are required to be there to protect and bring expertise\nNow have more questions that I'm not sure you can answer right now probably not what kind of expertise are they looking for [noise] um it might be this is what I take this aspect can be totally wrong\nIf someone that's going to communicate with the two actors about highways it's going to go down and and maybe what she's saying in the past is the director thinking these two are going to have great\nOn screen chemistry yeah and then like if you rent a movie review of these two it was so awkward they there was no on screen chemistry right like all of a sudden the movie reviewer knew exactly what was going on with the two of them\nWas really that chemistry or where they just good actors right it always begs the question to me\nIf if that's your wife say and you're dating while she's an actress you get married\nAnd then she gets a few great roles and then boom here is a huge role offered and part of the deal is there's going to be seen ah with some you know hot actor and she got to be naked\nAre you okay with that I think I'd have a hard time with that especially the first time I mean look if she's making the money I mean she can do whatever she wants\nBut I Would have a hard time with it the first time how noble [laughter]\nSorry she's making the money no no no no no I'm saying she can make that decision for ourself that's all I meant by it but what would you have a problem with the nomination I Would be uncomfortable with it for the first time yeah but you think by the second time\nWell I think once you realize that it's so awkward in the moment that there really is no intimacy bad happens there at least nothing like what it appears to be on the screen and it's just another\nFilm school guy you know\nYou can think of the ... of all the things to be outraged about today that's about eighty is on my list [laughter] give me a freak and\nBreak what Seventy nine so that was like to know you say in weighing dang sweet on the show okay All right [laughter] right golly I'm taking a beating for that teenage girls listening I Know I Know I Know shouldn't have said that\nOkay if we put it down to this what what exactly is he saying that is so\nControversial to me I it seems like they're most bothered by the fact that he is\nSaying things like legs are pretty and all that stuff and talking about the like their skirts all that and saying that you're asking for it if you wear short skirts asking for what asking for sexual assault bad our\nGirls took any yeah that's the problem I have with that but like every excusing bad behavior from boys\nI Want to hear exactly what he said again it's a ... second clip I can only hear part because the girls are talking through part of\nAn ... means to you know when you're in a non belief is\nGood for me to moment you're putting every mail in an awkward situation right okay everybody every problem with that\nI think again what do you mean by awkward situation you can just can't you just said we're longer skirt you can do that you can\nYou can say here's the dress code the dress code is this and it's a private school and you don't have to go if you don't want to\nUh do you think it does put these guys in an awkward situation I just don't want boys' behavior excuse because they see a girl and a shorter skirt that's all I'm saying I think we're all in agreement of that okay but that's not the question what's the question does it put males in an awkward situation\nMeaning that what did they there is no self control left or they're just a immediately when they see somebody in a short skirt the day what\nNo they are they gonna look all I look\nAt you know have a high schooler\nOkay yes so I Will often but well until they closed the lid okay so saying oh goal right and just saying you know quick glance yes\nIf you were sixteen Fifteen sixteen year old boy where you got to look at the skirts are way up yeah it's a long look too right mhm ... curious I'm human yes yes that's probably\nWhy they are your essay that girl should be covered more because boys leader and look\nWhat I'm saying is they have a dress code at the school right and so I don't know what has proceeded this but he's saying yeah we get it like as you're pretty but there's code they got to be longer\nYou're putting other males in an awkward situation knowing that guys will look it's part of them being a human\nBut well you can tell you can tell your mind as a guy don't look don't look you already thought don't look back don't look back and every party was wanting to look back\nBecause you're talking about brain chemicals they get fed that's why part is the industry it is because they want to look we know this and boys and girls are wired differently All right\nI Know the PC culture will say or do we know this from\nScience right that's what he's saying to me is that yeah it's an awkward situation it's like you tell you know your daughter you dress a certain way you might be dressing a certain way because you want some guys to look\nBut they're all gonna look\nThe creepy old guy that you certainly don't want to look is going to look you know what I mean well I mean you're talking about here\nYeah but I just don't like a a rather you know you have boys a pass on this one I don't think he did was kind of does he said hey you\nGirls are distracting me these boys he's not he's not holding the boys responsible for their behavior that's all I'm saying no um\nI Would not excuse the boys' behavior at all because you're still responsible for your own action yes do you think the young lady is going to get more unwanted comments they've her skirt is four inches shorter than if it's longer\nYes\nThat's part of the point okay so ... I'm not saying he couldn't have chosen some different words but the outrage police gave me a freaking break with that well and then what the girl said you're not advocating denim skirts in buns are you\nOh okay All right I just want to make sure we're in the same page or what I don't even know what their dress code is did they actually specify how much longer they should be made it not\nYou know I'm sure it's not all the way you know to the ankle and I mean [laughter] I don't think it's that but even you know the girls\nAll of a sudden playing this you know I was really uncomfortable because he's making these kind of and that was kind of the whole what do you have any long waiting a little creepy parents need to do a better job\nIn my opinion okay I just don't understand well than someone needs to tell you it's the reality of the world okay All right are we done with my soapbox\nNow he can he can jump off of it now do we have a nice ... happy story to on the ballot alright alive you

band camp All right I Want to make this story is easy to understand as possible okay so you tell a David [noise] okay well I get the short version of it so NBC News we had the story\nA well they they have the story we played the interview of Julie sweat neck remember who was the woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of organizing gang rape parties correct and how she had that sworn statement that came out this one statement look very serious and then you hear her talking and you're like I I don't believe her at all because they're\nCorrect and how she had that sworn statement that came out this one statement look very serious and then you hear her talking and you're like I I don't believe her at all because they're inconsistencies all over the boy and even what was in the in the interview versus the sworn statement\nAnd then Michael ... agree be porn lawyer ... a wind up having saying that he has a cooperating witness to all of this\nAnd NBC News or wind up tracking that person down because ... he wouldn't tell them who that person was\nInterestingly enough that wasn't part of the original story as well that ... he was hiding this other person who could corroborate these claims right now we find out ... when the story ran on Thursday if I remember of last week right NBC News publishing this story Kate Snow is the reporter that\nJulie sweating ... alleged corroborating witness\nSaid there were huge discrepancies between what I said to make a lot of an audience what Michael ... said on my behalf and I called them on it I only skimmed the statement at first but she told NBC News I I'm not corroborating these claims\nYes and NBC News never ran the story until last week\nThe basically Michael ... he was lying and then meddling with this second witnesses statement by and twisting it yes\nWhere she even confronted him saying yeah you're twisting my words I don't appreciate how you're twisting my words\nCape snow at NBC noses is yes and no is this a day before the cabin on vote\nRight knows it to where it could have been a it would have been newsworthy of course in the moment and they waited a couple of weeks to let everybody know hey by the way we have well one person who is now saying I'm not he has completely lying one person who was supposed to be a corroborating witness right\nBut they said the reason they spike the story and didn't run with it is because well by the time we and truly that it is the confirmation vote was over and people had quote moved on right\nKnow first of all no they hadn't because people are still are worse still thinking oh my gosh we just put a gang rapist up on the Supreme Court ...\nI Believe Julie sweat neck and this other accuser yes but anyway she just that no one's interested anymore well first of all they knew before the vote ... there was a reason they liked the story just because they weren't dishonest camp ... what it didn't fit\nTheir narrative ... and what she actually said was we also made clear in the interest of full transparency that NBC News had not been able to\nVerify Julie's went next claims that after repeated requests to have an Audi for her operation of sweat next door he had conference that into a car with a woman\nThe day after our sweat Nick interview aired Mr ... he tweeted out of sworn statement from that other woman was inconsistent with what she had told us by the time we were able to find the woman independently from Mr ... who declined to give us are full legal name and phone number and fully report and vet her story the Gavin confirmation process was over and the news value\nWas limited\nDid not have enough reporting they started to publish the second one was account until after ... justice Kavanaugh's secured enough votes for confirmation as what they said they hadn't talked to her until after the set already gone down it is still newsworthy to publish it when you have that information\nIf nothing else because Michael ... has made a name for himself he's a public figure that a lot of people know who he is\nYou have a witness saying this kind of course in my words he falsified my statement you're telling me that's not news yeah so they and then NBC winds about being called fake news I\nAnd capes no also said when Chuck Grassley sided my interview was sweating like this week when making criminal referrals talking about sweat making Michael ... for lying base of business when it became newsworthy again so we publish this story that's not how news is supposed to work but it's not the first time NBC has done this\n... one of the highest profile well yeah it would have been the Access Hollywood tape they were holding on to the Access Hollywood tape\nTo inflict maximum damage at a later date probably right before the election to release the Access Hollywood tape Washington Post actually get their hands on and says oh man we're run with his right now right\nThey don't have lower they also booted the Weinstein story yes they've done this before and so yeah it is ... that's why it's so hard to take whenever Chuck Todd comes up and says well it's just a right wing smear that\nWe are dishonest or that we we we program for the political climate we report the news whenever it breaks no you don't bring anyone at too many times I Know\nThey do it for maximum effect which is about chasing ratings and all of that this is what they do it's it's that\nAnd because there is an agenda man there is a side and when they have news that may well not that that narrative they tend to spike ... so we've seen it okay enough on that [noise] a Halloween and just a couple of days it was excited ... I\nMean it's fun for the kids maybe there are some people that went to a party or over the weekend we're going to get to a story some people are actually signing a petition to move the date of Halloween to the weekend [noise] you have a feeling on that one way or another I\nThink that uh yeah if I were still going out to parties I feel like it's weird I don't know I maybe I just don't have the partying crowd that I'm Around anymore feels weird that at the age of thirty one to go out to a bar dressed up as somebody ... deals I got past that time now oh you're looking\nDown at the little piano looking down at the little people I'm just getting mature no I feel like it's not about majority hell man I'd love to go get blackout drunk at a at a bar dressed up like the dude from the Big Lebowski but I just don't\nThink you can do that anymore I Would feel awkward hanging out with a bunch of white\nCollege kids at a bar if it's something\nYou want to do I mean it's not my choice I mean I ...

November they kinda close with a positive so that for ... for Walker um\nThey're both a lot of geo TV or would\nGet out the vote for the for the other is hurt out so there is talk of the last couple of days everybody on both sides trying to figure out what's going on is it actually are we going to have a democratic wave is going to be a democratic ripple that are going to be normal public and turned out\nYou know there's so many events happening\nThat are going to heavily impact on the race I mean everything from the credit for the F is for over the weekend\nThe bombs last week the biker caravan for this way towards Mexico for the sending troops at the border of all these things play into what voters think about the final days like go to the polls and I honestly don't know if anybody\nReally understands what it's worth it looks like right now for what's going to move them for the final days I always get a new mark that Paul\nI'm On a Wednesday that was another field if it was bad practices in the field last Wednesday through Sunday so that'll give us some sense of where things are moving\nIf at all but you know if I only or one of the less confident now about what you actually look like that I have been for the last three or four cycle\nYou mentioned at Marquette law school pool and it comes out on Wednesday\nConfident now about what the election will look like that I have been for the last three or four cycle\nNow you mentioned in Marquette law school pool when it comes on and when the news that a ... that is pretty accurate though it does give us a lot of insight doesn't it\nThough if you look at the market pulled history in October it'll bounce around a bit in the last poll is usually pretty good health Astros usually because two years ago\nUm it has the U.S Senate race uh at at one point one point rate which basically means that was a tie ... speaking Neal going dig language that same poll also had Hillary Clinton at\nForty six percent I think it was a doctor up at forty one percent\nWell that poll is done on the field of right before the last call me a letter\nWhich if you talk to Democrats ... side of the entire issue for Hillary Clinton and soul that poll is he'll quote unquote off in the presidential race it was kind of a bar that it got where Clinton was what it missed was the late surge to Trump\nBecause he was forty seven percent to forty six percent so it was pretty close to where it was it just getting messed that surgeon so you know looking at this last polls historically speaking they're pretty good\nBut they're not always dead on and again and I don't know very heavy he called me a letter type incident between now and Tuesday the next move things\nSo Governor Walker's muted ... acted a little different than in the past ... done this went three times before he was just something that he used a less competent a bone or what's the impression you get\nHe's been running like\nHe's down a salad at either because he wants to go to the flock dead or because he's truly down and he worries\nThat will tell you last week it again a TV yeah talking about\nTony Evers one federal benefits for quote unquote illegal obviously some people find that language offensive um for his own about the ads and me and talk to people is that you wanted a change in tone that were used to from Scott Walker and to what I Can't figure out is for that\nHas done because\nThere's been so much put out there and the governor's race I mean a Walker his allies\nHad number thirty three as of this morning so\nBy comparison for years the other end point through the entire campaign he's thirty three a week left so that just like one more thing to put out there trying to break for the quarter for it it's an issue that movie with people and Walker is down and have to try something like this to try and get even\nAre coed or be as he started to pull ahead this is meant to try and push them far enough out front till election day because\nThe reality is if you're Scott Walker you've been in office for almost eight years now you have near universal name id if you work hide election day with ... you are probably going to lose and the reason is over with on politics is undecided break I guess they call it a\nTwo to one so that the tide you can expect that to ... every two on the ... when I go to water\nAnd so that's why he has to be a day otherwise he's in he's a real trouble\nYeah we're talking to a junior Ross Perot is politics dot com or my dad always use ... well what do you do to create excitement in when you're the challengers that's what you have to do so [noise]\n... ah I'm taking a look at what the headlines he's making the day we talking about guns and I'm obviously in reference to the tragic shooting at the synagogue over the weekend and he says he's open to tough inning concealed carry have you heard about that\nYeah so you know if he's also than seeing a line on his running mate until a Barnes has advocated for stricter gun control that health he uh he received it was kind of hesitant about Italy can vet to vet because it seems like in Wisconsin Ken as always walk a fine line\nThe wide about gun control because a lot of plays well walk in Madison\nKinda more urban areas if they get all rural Wisconsin that you feel of a touchy subject that you got to be kind of careful how you you do the language and how you talk about it because they think you're coming after guns that like I said well places like like Holly or you know\nA ... stuff like that\nYeah explain this one to ... in the governor's race you know what we think we can agree his neck in neck but then you're looking at the U.S Senate race are held by a Tammy Baldwin the incumbent\nShe leaving her opponent my ... when a double digits you kind of ... but it's the double digits over her opponent we moved here so does that mean there are Democrats who do that are voting for her for sure but then are voting for Governor Walker\nFourth independents who are voting for her and walk her I mean we really aren't sure of the fall and walk her voters are and I have heard plenty of theories that these races for governor will end up being fairly close that's the hope for those back and look for right now is that so\nFar the governor's race because that one looks like a nail biter whereas the Senate race is not\nBut in talking to people about raises up and down the ticket I've been shown polling at the assembly levels that shows and these kind of the districts where they're really playing on both sides that\nThey have Walker off involved with a so there is definitely a fault and walk her voters that high and nobody I talked with any clue what the person's life for why they can see this fall within Walker who looked very politically diametrically opposed\nWhy they could see how they can support both those candidates and insist that I'm fascinated by tell you the truth\nI Am too it's a head scratcher for sure and then we'll talk about the coming in third race feels ... Reese free G A branch of course the uh\nUh you can come in and it raised Josh calling the challenger in this recent polls show that to many people don't know even with the incumbent is for sure and doing these big margin that no no the challenger and other challengers got a good and I like it right now\nOne of the medallion but yeah I kind of started a league if people don't know who you are you going to jump in there right away I always thought\nNow that's the challenger Josh calls they seem to ... send our money away to catch it when people making those decisions when you do that\nYou may miss a window when they're paying their pain just enough attention that there's not enough that's not so much clutter out there that fills the er at well now you've got the governor's race is on the air US Senate race you've got the campaigns are up on the air so I just don't know how well\nThat didn't work out and to I don't know how much it matters I mean considering that the Saudis casual very well known last Marquette fall it may end up being that the generic ballot his was false size that race by that I mean that if you were to ask do trust the polls\nAre you voting for Republican or democratic if Republicans have a good day on next Tuesday's civil when the Democrats have a good they call with that one of the cab you might be that voters tend to not always but tend to the Republicans a stronger on on law and order type issues that could fire similar point or two in this race\nNow fighter that he may be it\nBut what can the stronger on on law and order type issues that could buy similar point or two with us raise\nThe veil fighter that he may be up for a walk or in some ways because it's just I just don't know and then the other thing is that top of the race employed at the governor's race for the Senate race\nIn full down ballot because of the Senate race Democrats are really happy right 'cause follows a figure right now it's the governor's race it could
