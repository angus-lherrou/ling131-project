Williams what an unbelievable catchy was in trouble coverage\nWho won a hundred percent up terrible is I don't think bill rivers to even get the statistical touched down to that\nYeah so that is fourteen to three and then much to the chagrin of course tough so what's going on in the Minnesota Vikings we got a defensive touchdown again in this game well not again but we have a defensive touchdown for the Arizona Cardinals acre\nThat was a heck of a play by Baker were cousins got strips act\nAnd because of that turf and just bounce gender the bread basket any picked it up and give him credit Arizona getting they're getting up pressure on her cousins then you're kind of like it was a few weeks ago where with buffalo just Minnesota having a hard time getting started getting yeah that game's Chinatown with about four and a half minutes let's\nGo south ... what the touchdown we talked about it in the ...\nIn terms of on drawbacks by average ... gets two point six seconds that is the lowest in the NFL coming into the day he was pressured Ninety One times the most the NFL is without a divine clearly an issue so far today from Minnesota Steelers and Benghazi or even at seven\nAs we mentioned the Seahawks deal with that fourteen to nothing lead over the raiders Russell Wilson ... they're the dolphins uh seven uh nothing lead over the bears and they're playing with\n... not Ryan ... anyway by ... course worse than ... cardinals and Vikings W just mentioned that ten ten\nThe jets and now take it a sixteen to three lead over the coals extra point pending Sam Darnell with a touchdown pass to the former quarterback trout prior Washington up Seventeen D It up and on Carolina Josh Norma with an interception of his former team I can do it in that one\nAnd the taxes they tend to nothing lead over the bill so that's all your scoring so far on the day and these one eastern game\nLot Washington Carolina game to me might be one of the biggest shock so far up the early ...\nSeventeen Thirteen and and ah Indianapolis after the extra points good as well ... I think that one is pretty shocking to me as well just to play good in spots but this is one you expect Andrew Luck and the cold to got to take some control over\nAnd we should say Andrew Luck in that game as cross it seems to point the as a ... clay born picked\nHim up to start the game and brought it back but yeah damned Arnold just for the touchdown passage route prior to put them in front Seventeen to Thirteen but the one thing I'll say about this scandal is at least it's entertaining and to the Washington by the time he may make they're also planned hurt a Christian confidence not in that game games in ... that game and they kill the Seventeen to nothing lead\nJames Winston was running the football is dead of taking just running out of bounds tried to get an extra yarn got absolutely popped right on the Atlanta falcon sideline and some buccaneers offered the Lyman came and got into it with the players who made the hit which is just silly ... completely legal\nYeah James didn't get out of bounds whatever expect us Jamie Dimon students' fault yeah that was on James once that I mean if you want to fly and you wouldn't get hit or if you run out of bounds a couple of years earlier now remember these two teams have a bit of history if you remember going back to oh no actually that was this wasn't the saints to tamper got into it with last year where my Kevin ...\nMarshall ... yeah I think it was around Russia on\nLine and more but yeah I don't know what James is doing there like if you get about ... yards prior to that or you decide you don't take that head and then I get it as lying then it's coming to his defense and whatnot but you come into his defense for something that the other team did nothing wrong\nJust to pick your quarterback up off the turf don't you don't have to get into it with the falcons they didn't do anything wrong there was nothing illegal there was nothing militias and there was probably some malicious intent and the hit but there was nothing against the rules go pick your quarterback up and stop trying to pick fights especially on the falcon sideline that's just a bad luck\nAnd on the next play beautiful pass from James when cinematic Evans is going to set up a first single situation or a ... actually it'll be a first in ten from about the fourteen yard line but nonetheless beautiful pass from game is Winston they're down Twenty one to six though\nThe chargers still at that four teams have three lead over the Cleveland Browns and right now in the Cincinnati Pittsburgh game you're looking at a seven to seven score\nBut this but the Pittsburgh Steelers are in business here you got to play under review near the goal line to see if it's going to be a catcher and not or actually it's\nThe call on the field is it is the catch but it's short of the goal line but nonetheless even if this turns out to be a situation where they end up not calling it a touchdown Pittsburgh is going to get a first intent opportunity at what the one yard long yeah\nI think they're wondering what did the juice misused or did he have the ball and it was he actually contacted was he on the ground before or if the goal line in and almost looked like the defender as well have really good\nPosition on that but this it'll be an interesting uh it'll be an interesting call but you're right Brian regardless of what happens worst case scenario for\nA for Pittsburgh is that they would have the ball inside the one\nIn terms of what a beautiful play by juniors misused ... 'cause this fall\nIt was dry Kirkpatrick covering Jerry was really well defend all my God it was under thrown it looked like dry Kirkpatrick had an opportunity at an interception and you use Mr ... Schuster sorry I Can't say that name fast just went over the back of dry Kirkpatrick catch that football the veil better authors burger out what a play by Smith Schuster\nJust caught it ride around the helmet of drag Patrick who was all just amazing\nPlay and I do your number to receive or by the way I Do actually I Do think\nHe is down just for the goal and looks like us for arms down just short ... even though you're old on top of perk Patrick's body if this were major league baseball replays they've kept calling wrong that's all I Know\nYeah they are they are going to say that's called ... your ... right and what you were saying\nGod major league baseball and and the one the other day with the red Sox and the Yankees you at five calls on angel Martinez in the series for\nHe only got ... uh one of 'em right he was one of five and then he was on the plate in the deciding game now by the way the Tampa Bay is now in the end zone OJ Howard a touchdown grab courtesy a James Winston so that's going to make this age Twenty one is twelve\nGain extra point is spending they miss the extra point the first time around and so that's why I say pending and then on the next playing the Steelers game after they said he was short it ends up being a touchdown so no harm no foul I guess and the less\nYou're ... yeah that's true that's true well I ... and\nJames Winston you mentioned the the a touchdown pass he's got one touched down to each of his titans OJ Howard just being activated\nYeah and Cameron break the other one the a Harvard product okay James Garner is the\nTouchdown recipients and the Steelers bangles game not recipients he carried it in so that's going to make it Thirteen to seven Pittsburgh over Cincinnati extra point is spending nice drive at the end and a half or men or out this burger and those Steelers got about a minute left in the second quarter that wants to put them up\nFourteen to seven if the extra point is getting nice drive by James wants to nice response because this looks like this game was getting out of hand with ... uh and land out twenty wants to fix on the Tampa Bay buccaneers and Tampa comes down and put together a much needed touchdown Dr before halftime that Ryan is going to have about twenty six twenty six seconds to work with before halftime\nAnd one thing I'll say about that hit on James Winston as as they started getting things going ah emotionally that's the kind of situation where James Winston thrives a little bit when he gets his emotions going eats for some reason he was one of those players the very few who plays better angry the mood to calm\nAnd when he eats Debbie is okay so right now her cousins with to turn it was on the day he's looking to put points up on the board and a ten ten game before half will be able to do so will tell you when we return you're listening to the NFL rush ...\nThis is the gold standard what we saw last night [noise] everybody was upset you know affect some and I

Washington is up on Caroline at halftime Seventeen to sex and you can do with an interception it was former friend Josh Norman\nWe look at the Minnesota Vikings to turn over circuit cousins an interception and as strict stacks of Thirteen ten cardinals there alone touched down Arizona's was a defensive touchdown Buddha Baker recovered the fumbling return to\nMiami has just got or excuse me the bears have just gotten into the end zone and make it a seven seven games so Chicago and Miami all even at seven through as a tribute to touch on to treat burden alright so Michel ...\nGet back involved here as there was a slow half for the Chicago often Seahawks up Seventeen nothing on the raiders chargers Twenty one six over\nThe browns fourteen to fourteen Steelers and bangles as they went to half time right before half empty down the touchdown pass to\nBoyd his second of the day and the falcons of twenty four to Thirteen and the buck so that's where all the game stand as of now Craig what set out to you so far today\nAnd the Washington game is one we've talked about it a bunch is one that sticks out I'm not surprised to see a lack of office here in Houston the day the Vikings struggling with the cardinals really has stood out to me is something and then I said earlier the browns and the chargers was a game where I'm really evaluating\nOur the browns is just a group of talented guys that have a few steps to go or many steps to go even or are they ready to take that next step into playoff contender in right now the chargers all over the browns\nTells me something about the browns that they're not quite ready and maybe some of the hard knocks hype is real\nYeah whole entire Williams a great game so far for the chargers parents touchdown grabs one of them was absolutely outstanding and remember to the ground I mean the majority of their good players are really young we accept in Jarvis night journey than him what he says he and his fifth NFL season same drop classes to back him junior so twenty fourteen so his fourth or fifth NFL season and then you look at it\nGender ward has had a tremendous season he's a rookie miles Garrett a second year player he's had a really good season and Baker Mayfield is working quarterback as well so I think the one thing you will say about the browns though is at least for the first time we can actually remember they are trending in the right direction and\nI don't I don't mean to sound negative on the browse my whole point being is after the hard knocks hype which how it happens to every team it's not this isn't just exclusive to the browns you had any\nMore of a lead Shriver than anything\n... doing the show Dr that it was live Schreiber by the way when I found that out just completely caught me off guard that that was the case you think of them is like re Donovan on that show yeah I\nThink of them is a terrible saber tooth and the Wolverine origins movie ah I like live drivers and actor but the thing about this brown seem as a lot of national pundits and take national radio pundits for what they are but we're proclaiming a team ready to make a jump to the playoffs\nAnd that was just completely silly in my eyes\nYeah and I think on the other side of that too is what Los Angeles quietly has been doing without Joey boso who's been out the whole season so far with a foot injury and you'll be looking Philip river is a buck Ninety eight two touchdowns already on the day and you look at his numbers coming into today correct\nThirteen touchdowns to pick so now he's up to Fifteen touchdowns toothpicks he's\nAveraging two hundred and Ninety nine passing yards per game and he's completing Seventy percent of his passes so quietly Philip river is with a team that historically in the past five six years has got knocked a slow starts like last year there wanted for and they shoot themselves in the foot early and they don't have an opportunity at the post season\nThis year despite the fact that before the season hunter Henry goes down Joey both of those down for the first time in like five years there actually putting themselves in a position to be competitive to get into a playoff spot and a lot of that has to go to Philip Rivers cause felt rivers historically has turned the ball over a little bit too much this year just to ...\nYeah and the thing that is six opt to me about that as they've done it with expectations ladies upon them as well this was one of those teams the Texans surprisingly were one of them that people talked about a couple of others as the team it was ready to be that number to the ...\nSome of those teams the Texans surprisingly were one of them that people talked about\nA and a couple of others as the team that was ready to be that number two the jaguars obviously being another one of them that number two to ... patriots and the AFC they see the little down this year from a competitive standpoint so everybody was looking at who's going to be the team that can challenge\nThe patriots and maybe make the super bowl is nasty things and the chargers were one of those teams of people looked at at the beginning of the season despite the previous low starts despite the ...\nLittle bit of it too much gunslinger mentality from Philip Rivers\nAnd they're answering those expectations which is always impressive\nAnd the team that has taken the reins on that as you mentioned the chargers one of the teams who's going to challenge the patriots the chiefs of the team that have taken the reins they're undefeated they'll play the patriots and I'd ... stadium and just looking at that game\nQuarterbacks under the age of twenty five are one in forty one all the time and the regulation the regular season agile that stadium the only quarterback twenty five or younger to beat the patriots ad Gillette\nTrivia question anybody want to take a guess who that is twenty five and under one quarterback started at your let their one in forty one quarterbacks under the age of twenty five\nI mean I was going to guess like morals but I don't know where that game was played this year so I don't remember I Know that old when I was yeah man I I Know who is who is it I don't know who the year\nOkay but if you know the year as you know the player that's even better down on Capitol yes that's right was it like what did you see the stats subject to discuss that\nNo I've had to say I heard that the I heard that this week\nSo yeah I've I remember the game like it was yesterday it was twenty twelve it was a Sunday Night Football game ... and that was the year that of course they end up they being the forty niners end up going all the way to the super bowl I'm losing to the Baltimore Ravens\nJust from the scoreboard again allowed or a touchdown catch twenty nine Thirteen extra points in the\nHow about the New York jets I mean they get a big win last week I mean big win for them of course over Denver who's tanks but unless it's a big one for the jets because it's when they're not used to doing these things but the jets sand Arnold has been tremendous now he's Eighteen of twenty two two Nineteen and to touch down so how about the New York football jak\nGiven New York people something to cheer for a while and the Colts fan Andrew Luck this has not been a good game for him a pick six and another interception it spent an awful game for Andrew Luck\nWell ... I'm Sorry go ahead so I was gonna say I don't know how happy I mean good for them to Arnold I liked him coming out of college a lot I saw 'em up close when he came from behind and and led the USC Trojans over my Texas Longhorns last year\nBut I don't know that I like any happiness\nIn New York sports world I like New York sports is how we can get along man I feel the same way as I've been to both New York and Boston I prefer Boston as a city\nJust personally am American the the New York mentality just doesn't work for me and sports\nGot a got an update guys in Miami the Chicago Bears starting to get going a little bit after a ... full or second interception of the game for ... Wyler\nAll right so it's going to be ... coming up after ... can't get in on first into fourteen fourteen Pittsburgh in Cincinnati so this one is growing up to be quite an exciting game and looks like

Peter man which is the better Peter ...\nWho the J Peter and catalog is very nice I I I Love so that the whoever writes the captions there does a great job I heard her name's Elaine Elaine Ben is the one thing that the one good thing that ever came out of New York central\nI don't think Jerry money maybe as writing money but I just like this show about the show itself I think he's the worst character and without a doubt what do you do know who's overshadowed by the other three am I always talk like that oh the poor why do they call it of course I\nEverybody that watches them as a whole versus the organization itself\nWhat is the biggest problem facing the browns at this point guys is it just ... the history the perception is that coaching because you mentioned ...\nAnd they'll probably it looks like they got it looks like they've got talent all over yeah they'll probably have a new coach after this year John Dory so you probably want to get his own guy in there I mean he already brought in a guy that he hired as a head coach in Kansas City and taught Haley maybe ... sometimes takes over as the interim head coach but I bet that the next step\nWould be a new head coach there and speaking on the sea north Pittsburgh with his Seventeen to fourteen lead\nOver the Cincinnati Bengals we're just about to get underway and the fourth quarter third quarter just coming to an engineer and a huge job either Cincinnati defense they force Pittsburgh's upon from their forty five yard line so Cincinnati is going to get the ball back here with an opportunity to take a leads the seventeenth to fourteen\nOnly scoring so far in this third quarter has been a field goal by Pittsburgh so Cincinnati still very much in this ball game and it's going to go right down to the wire which we kind of a second coming into this one a couple of teams trying to compete in that division Cincinnati foreign one pitch for two two and one coming off the big win\nLast week but definitely used out presents and added there we'll see what Andy ... turns into\nGot I got an update as well guys from the from the Washington Carolina game dumping Hopkins career long fifty six yard field goal in the

over the giants so yeah as you mentioned that now twenty to Nineteen so gee that's a bomb fifty sixty arts\nDo son wants to just took a disastrous back on third down so boy in Houston and they just punted away so bubble bill is going to get the ball back with ten twenty seven to go in the fourth quarter holding call on the pond so that'll back to the builds up inside their own Fifteen\nTo start to drive but Mason Peter men throws a touchdown on the last drive and what did I say how bad does it look for the Texans\nThere'd be ... and Peter ... beach you knew the beat him in his currently beating yeah it really Houston Texans\nAge on somebody they spent a high draft pick on two years ago they didn't they expected a lot from hasn't really shown up but today as you mentioned catching a touchdown pass such big for them\nI look at it more so on the other side of the ball for the Texans I understand you can't let Nathan Peter I'm indeed you\nBut John watching in this game two interceptions the one right before the half was absolutely a Trojan they were in field goal ray ... yes when they were in field goal range and he's also some of the ball twice no luckily they recovered one of them\nBut he lost one of them so that's two interceptions and fumble from to Sean watching this game and I get that he's playing banged up but he's on the football field and this has been\nIn the past couple of weeks he's played really well this has been an atrocious game for watching how he was awful save themselves in the fourth quarter and go ahead with the wind and have a couple of nice drives to win it but I mean the first three quarters them in that\nBut do you feel good about yourself do the Texans if you escape this bill team\n[noise] I don't think you feel great about yourself but you feel more relieved than anything else that okay we played so poorly dished Shon was banged up and we still got through it I mean you can do you can\nPaint the picture on it but yet to your point you can't be struggling with the Buffalo Bills if what the Texans want to do because if they get back to three and three there very much in play I can to ensure so and that division absolutely right so you're going to have a couple of ugly ones\nWant to do because if they get back to three and three there very much in play offs and to ensure so and that division absolutely right so you're going to have a couple of ugly ones along the way but this is not what you want to see for him to shut watching in this office which has made some strides the often so absolutely future today after really that one Dr were Hopkins got the touchdown pass the officers not look good\nNo I completely agree with you it begs the question my my wife has been texting me about the game throughout her show she wants me to ask you when the Texans are going to hire a new coach\n[laughter] I don't know man they're in love with Bill O'Reilly I don't get it but you're right a justification for a five year contract convention or justify that nothing but literally nothing I guess the owner Bob and you're just loves below Brian I don't understand it I mean what is bill O'Brian\nReally done he won the division two times when the division sucked right when the jaguars and the titans\nThat would have to let them was the divisions of not currently stock which has done over the border contender but but when you said the division now it'd be better than the one here so that's my\nPoint is like he's done nothing and he can't manage the clock he's supposed to be it off as a ... but we found out he is not a great play color either so I'm just trying to figure out what the injury a bill like honestly that's my question is like when I think about coaches I say oh Shauna McVeigh this guy is a genius play call\nRight you'd think about different guys in the NFL Mike Zimmer I Know that his team is going to have a great deep and he's a great defensive mine when I think a bill of rights nothing comes to mind I don't know what he is I don't know it was supposed\nTo be quarterback grew they've gone through a number of them in spring\nHas been years so it all the

O.\nY. right All right about that you're playing this game whose second to do this thing\nWith the Dow life points to the game just tribal biggest shot the will power\nInto the end zone the past with incomplete there were two flags in the play both against buffalo water them as they get her fear and so the fact that they're going to get all the one yard line but we'll pull down grabbing lay after the ten in the fall short walk in and turn them over three times they chew interceptions including one in the end zone right before that\nIt ... a couple of drives ago that set up the insurance touched down from the Peter ... Peter man had to call me tickets to replace Josh out and Josh Allen injured his elbow\nIn the third quarter he is not return\nIn coming down to the wire we reached will be two minute warning one fifty nine to go\nHere in the fourth quarter academic bursting go from the one trailing by three they've had their issues in a red zone all season another opportunity here to get in the end zone and possibly put the gave away\nAll right appreciate it Jake let's head to Atlanta and Mercedes Benz stadium where the falcons are looking to put a winning of something in the wind come looking for the second one of the season and Jeff cell is there for the bucks in the falcons gathers\nI Know the falcons just got more than probably their biggest going job seats and they're now I'm\nThirty one that choice to on the Tampa Bay buccaneers Matt Ryan leaf chocolate kitten place Seventy five yard drugs it's five minutes from six seconds and ended with the secure touched does that mean Coleman and later had not scored a touchdown says seven and a half minutes left in the second quarter\nIn their first three possessions away that sport or anyone points they learn choice that that plays\nGeorge or Nineteen yard five possessions after that before this last one truly plays eighty six yards only\nThree point that Ryan twenty seven thirty seventies now over three hundred yards read Jane\nThree touchdown passes he also got to touch them asked them how to live for thirty five yard sale\nAnd Austin who for from nine yards are truly are shown night catches but one twenty five but one of them this is the life still does not have a touchdown this year for Tampa Bay came in Switzerland is first start hurting at forty seven yards three touchdown pass and to pick\nOn their last possession Tampa Bay scored a touchdown they didn't look for to they didn't get it if it got that too they would've tied the game up the touchdown passes cameras grade eight\nFifteen yard touchdown catch OJ high or\nA kitten yard touchdown catch and pain Barbara's been running quite well to James in running overall I'd say falcon Thirteen carries eighty two yards by the way the other special as Chris Dodd when he was more catches for thirty five yards a nine yards touchdown catch so with his choice to go and land elites Tampa thirty one twenty two\nAnd I Jeff great stuff already checking on that Washington Carolina game Washington just took a twenty three to Seventeen lead dusting off into third field goal in the day this one from twenty nine yards Audi already at one from fifty six yards out so they have a twenty thirty Seventeen lead three Fifteen left ... going to get the ball was an opportunity to win the football game\nAnd then you look at the jets and the Indianapolis Colts this is a game or Andrew Luck has to interceptions and the jets now at thirty nine to twenty seven lead six minutes left and that football game and then you get the Vikings and the cardinals twenty seven and Seventeen Seahawks twenty seventh graders three\nCharges thirty five Brown's fourteen yeah as we mentioned with Jeff thirty one in favor of the falcons over the buccaneers\nTwenty seven the raiders three charges thirty five rounds fourteen yeah as we mentioned with Jeff thirty one in favor of the falcons over the buccaneers and were twenty two and then the Steelers they just had to settle for a field those that's twenty to fourteen if three thirty two left in eighty dollars going to get the ball back one chance to win this football games\nShould be interesting to see not much going on the often for either team in this game so it's really tough sledding rented out and to get there and just to kind of switch lanes a little bit I'm watching the Texans as they have the ball to one after the pass their parents call\nAnd this is where I question bill o'bryan you have the ball to one they're going to take three\nSnaps out of the shotgun if it takes three places to get in so you were by default starting six yards from the goal line when the balls at the one\nI Can't I just don't get it at all\nYeah a second ago now and they're in the shock and again we saw this last week against Dallas they couldn't score when they got into the red zone and it was mind boggling to begin with and they're starting to go backwards again they try to get to the outside and they're going to lose ... almost two yards\nShow to play is from the one the first place they lose the yard second play they lose almost to a yard and a half on a jet sweet so now it's thirty goal from the three and a half as opposed to third and goal from the one\nOr you score because you actually start and God Forbid you give your running back a chance to actually start running downhill by taking the snap under center and lining him up in the backfield\nYeah I just I just don't I it's last beyond I'm so beyond bill of Ryan and his play called\nThe guys that I got an update it in the in the Miami Chicago game\nChicago driving with the football were shy Jones from Miami dropped a sure fire would be interception that would've given Miami the ball back with three minutes left dropped in Chicago still got the ball in Miami territory but boy that could be a big dropped interception that could come back to hurt the dolphins and then\nFall started on the Texans on the third third downplay some out you had first and goal from the one that's going to be third and goal from the eight and a half\n[noise] this is like Groundhog Day with the cowboys game last week this is the same thing that happened last week I remember that rape before\nHalf they went for it on fourth down from the one yard line Craig and usually they're play with the shots and run it to the right side and try to try\nTo the editor of against the defense the warming that side I mean this is just mind boggling I thought Steve starts using was the worst red zone play color in the NFL\nIt's below fry it I don't think it's even close honestly\nIt really is mind boggling you have to think like what the rationale behind it is it that he doesn't trust his office of line that he won't run the ball whatsoever Iowa in but still lie to you need to go out and what\nShocked when they ran they ran two players one was a sweep to the outside which obviously went for a lawsuit the first one was a hand off but it was a shotgun so the running backs\nTaking the ball standing still\nFive yards deep as opposed to taking of three orange deep because he's running downhill from a snap out of the from under center and just just awful\nIt's atrocious and now on for single after having the first single from what you say originally the ... it was the ... and now they're going to have to settle for a field though yeah now they're gonna have to settle for and they only went backwards and it's Thirteen to ten right now and to put some numbers on your point to illustrate that\nThe Houston Texans right now are thirty first in the NFL in touchdown percentage and the red zone they're turning red zone opportunities into touchdowns just thirty six percent of the time thirty six percent of the time\nSeattle for example is doing it on eighty percent of their dries any NFL average right now is that fifty seven percent and the Houston Texans are at thirty six percent think about that they're twenty percent below the average in terms of touchdown percentage in the red zone\nThen I Would attribute at least ten percent of that of the fifty percent of the whole ten percent of the total\nTo just sheer formation yeah and I I honestly\nI Would put it out eighty five percent on the play color which is also the head coach have you with that and what eighty five percent Fifteen Percent may be at the offensive line banks and or excuse me so maybe ten percent of the offensive line thanks and five percent sometimes the quarterback\nMay just miscellaneous yeah missed the penalty call ... ... and he said yeah but yeah completely I just wait it out I just said villa Brian should be fired walking off the field for this I'm not and I I hate hot take guy that's not who I tried to be\nBut this is it an isolated incident we've shown the statistics play it out it's a complete problem it is a total problem from the head coach down and it all starts with a bill of rights we\nDo have a sorry guys do have an update in Miami Chicago game Anthony Miller\nTouchdown reception from Michel ... and the bears have reclaimed the lead\nYeah so tempting you mention it that's a huge loss opportunity for Miami after he explained that Russia Jones dropped that interception would have been a huge and now\n... gas and maybe that's more and can than anything else may became just made the wrong read on the plane we're looking at where they showed the replaying yeah Greg Lawson was wide open okay so\nIn that Texans Buffalo Bills game and by the way I can Nunes incomplete on fourth and five and Washington is going to win this game now can't a Carolina those two time outs but it's over thirty four seconds left so\nWashington is going to win this game twenty three to Seventeen overcame new than the Carolina Panthers and it's getting ugly at the end there can be done at it with a couple of defensive players or the Texans end up knock it off\nThe bills twenty to Thirteen bad that pick six from Jonathan Joseph and then the demand comes back out to try to tie the game what does he do ...\nJob of a joke to be good for the Joseph ... jak voted out what fringe actually twenty five yeah when I that I was

game's thirty four twenty nine you've got about fifty five seconds left Seamus twins and with an opportunity to win this one lady is going to face a second ten situation coming up and by the way this works do blanket version does go juice misused you're converts it so ten seconds left Pittsburgh up twenty to Twenty one in Cincinnati after the Antonio Brown\nTouchdown beautiful catching runs from Antonio Brown before that you used misused or with the huge gained down the middle of the field on a third intense beautiful Best Buy better out this burger so Pittsburgh is going to come away with a win in Cincinnati\nToday a huge huge victory eight point vulgar between the jets and the colds and the Colts scored going to go for the odd side kick here just on the other side of the two minute warning are well that'll get interesting we'll keep you updated on the ... and the dolphins as well twenty eight to twenty eight is that one head into overtime\nWell and if you look at it you look at the cheese and you look at the rams were not saying that they have the office of personnel the cowboys to be at that level but at least you see like even a team like we're watching air with the Chicago Bears\nThey're not a great often but at least they do things that are creative they have died moving around and they have guys in motion there is a window dressing to everything they do there is different skim addict things they do and there's a purpose to Israel the cowboys Sunni looked like a team that's in the nineties\nThey run it on first and second down and then they put their quarterback in a bad situation on third down the receivers never move they line up at the same spot every time it's just it's boring it's not innovative whatsoever and if we look around the league all the teams are passing more than ever and if you look at the end if the ease with the exception\nOf a team and by the way Miami is going to end up wanting\nTo know fumble the bears say they have it oh good God that it could be a fumbling the bears or they have it there is a large large man with a large number in an orange Jersey clutching the football\nDid he fumble before he got over I'm interested to see what the call in the field is here because it's almost certainly ... football oh God so we ...\nI think that might have been Kenyan Drake who had the ball stripped right before he got\nSomething that long ago that we ... out that blows out at the one year and he was on it it was on his ... that was that was a\nTouchdown if he doesn't fumbling he found was that it's a one yard line and you had the bears recovered and I believe they were going to rule that they recovered this that the one but it looks like to me these in the end zone\nIt looks like the well he's in the end zone and it looks like now who knows the ball might just barely touched the goal line it's going to be closed I don't know that you'll get anything definitive the call in the field looks like inside bears ball inside the one\nThat the ... going to get back into one oh my God what a terrible way to not want a football\nThe definitive the call on the field looks like inside bears ball inside the one\nThat the ... going to get back into one oh my God what a terrible way to not want a football\nAnd you were talking about Frank or earlier Craig and from a fantasy perspective we're trying to figure out how this back fields gonna work Frank or has almost a hundred yards canyon rake just stumbled at the goal line in overtime I think from here on out we know Adam Gates is going to use that backfield\nFrank or it's going to be your R B one for Miami because the way that they're going that is absolutely inexcusable for Kenyan Drake to drop that football at the goal line\nIt's amazing Frank or played I think when they have leather helmets and they still and he's gonna be the\nOnes in Miami and I was still married the first time when Frank or was playing in college that's how long it's been very you know wow\nThat'll personal there who just let us fire just actually brutal at the one yard line you fumbled the ball you're on your way to score like think about that\nYou're going to score the game winning touchdown you're going to win this game thirty four and a twenty eight and said you fumble it back to the bears that the one yard line so now Michel ... has bears often take over at the one who was a clear fumble no reason that you needed to review it crystal clear he fumbled it or they were reviewing the spot yeah they are getting would have if they touch back or at the one you're not\nSo great play by the barest but just inexcusable by Kenyan Drake in to uh go back to my point would I was saying about the end if these outside of the eagles you look at all the teams passing more than ever the cheese the rams the patriots all the teams in the NFL the NFC East teams like Washington who did get a win today still give them some credit but Washington Dallas and giants\nAnd the giants I should say everybody else's passing at a high level and the NFL nowadays and those teams seem to be like so far behind where offensive football is right now [noise] oh I couldn't agree more\nIt's it's really sad to see the it's\nThe exact same thing is that the only time you should always wind up under center in the same thing is from the one the Texans refuse to do that they seem to do take it to the extreme in lining up with a shotgun and a lot of priest that movement and all that stuff but you're right\nIt seems like the cowboys and the giants they're just mired in the past and they've got to make that step forward if they want to be a part of today's NFL\nAnd by the way the bears they did get a touch back on that so they're going to start first in ten or rather than their one yard line on Italy's wanting so they got lucky there that while not lucky I mean is a great play they get the ball back but lucky then start the drive at the ones they have\nFour fifty six left in overtime so time for Michel ... first intend coming up now at the twenty five yard line I should say\nSo much ... but he's still pressure on them because if they have to punt this ball back to Miami or excuse me second in five Miami's going to have plenty of time to go in and try to get the feel go which will be the game water so on a second and five\nBig around here for Chicago and it's got to bring it out to about the forty five yard line yeah do they run by George or our gas so now they're out to the forty five so much as your best skiing company on their way to winning this football game of thing getting ...\nUnbelievable unbelievable change of events Miami Kendrick is God he's going to be heading himself after this game if\nYou're sitting there with a towel over that I get it\nAt Miami started three in order to the season too and now they're about to lose their third consecutive game all what a tough game it's\nSilly high is still on the board but let's not be defeated the\nShore yeah they could and something could happen defensive religious thoughts on mapping crazy defensively the other way so it could happen for the Miami Dolphins is well

manning but\nAfter further review Emanuel Sanders was actually\nDown at the one yard line so then he gets and an sportsmen like conduct penalty after the play which he thought he got a touchdown instead he's down at the one which then you've got a Fifteen yard penalty for an sportsman like conduct after he gets in the face of\nA couple of ... players because of all those all the way back to the sixteenth first and go a first in ten excuse me from the sixteen yard line so instead of a touchdown or at worst being down at the one yard line the Broncos to all the way back to the sixteen just a costly penalty for Emanuel Sanders\nWith and often they can't afford those type of penalty\nAnd against a team that right now you can make an argument you guys is the best team in the NFL I Know they've had some issues defensively but you you got to take advantage of everything against the rams\nIdol I just saw a play called and the ravens getting ready to Tennessee game that I don't think I've ever call soon call before a titan sweet\nCrude they run with eight in Hearst that's what it looks like yeah that's just I\nMean I guess bravo for being pioneers and giving the tide and the chance to run one how's he going to stretch the defense that I'd just mind boggling for me\nYeah I mean I've seen like Kansas City will do those little shovel passes for Travis Cal sure but then again in layers\nYou get the lime and pulling out on the perimeter to to get some ... lanes this was just a straight street where you've got everyone man on man blocking\nBack in the day the patriots used to do it with the gun bag Aaron Hernandez they would give him like end around and stuff because I mean he was basically a receiver wasn't really a tight end but yeah that is an interesting call and remember Baltimore had some really interesting play calls in that game against Pittsburgh the Sunday Night Football game\nWhere they just kinda like at one point they lined up the tight end like right behind the center and he just came out of the backfield and picked up a first down it was a really weird play called but yeah\nMonday morning way there has been pretty creative with that often there in Baltimore began protesting in Baltimore Baltimore what three into after that last last week the browns twelve and I and it was ugly and Tennessee last last week as well so they're three and two on the season as well and you saw the Houston Texans went today and Jacksonville oh of course taken out of the cowboys right now it's three to nothing\nIn Tennessee last last week as well so there are three and two on the season as well and you saw the Houston Texans when today and Jacksonville of course taking on the cowboys right now it's three to nothing Dallas scored first and this one after a long pass from\nJak Prescott they ended up having to settle for a field goal though so it's three nothing Dallas over Jacksonville for it right now so there's the scores right now is zero zero ravens titans three nothing cowboys having the jaguars and the Broncos after they thought they had a touchdown they settle for a field though so it's six to three semi annual Sanders costs you points there\nThe CBS camera could not get off of manuals to Ender's right now but it just justifiably so\nI mean what an idiotic penalty just an idiotic penalty thinks he has a touchdown he doesn't so he's down at the one in seven touchdown he thought he gets in on sports and like it's it's unprofessional it really is on professional I mean come on man like we understand you can't make this all about you and that's what he did\nPlus you've made a catch I mean so he paid to do and it wasn't some just amazing catch it was a well thrown ball by case\nSkiing them that might be the first time that some has been said this year and\nIt was right I mean it was right where he should have been caught he'd be the man good job yeah I mean I I think gradually shouldn't spend doing your job you have that I mean I guess I mean I have to go up to go to my day job tomorrow in print off a bunch of documents to think I'm gonna get a pat on the back for that one probably not\nWell now they asked for maybe we'll do maybe with someone else or earlier today at the falcons knocking off the box thirty four and a twenty nine game It's Wednesday and three Ninety five for touchdowns couple of picks in the last year the Steelers beat the bangles twenty to Twenty one drama in that game last play the game or not last play but ten seconds left Antonio Brown touched down\nTo when I had the chargers stumped the browns thirty to fourteen\nThe Seahawks beat the raiders twenty seven to three in London horrible game for the people in London today he had the dolphins with a field goal late to beat the barest thirty wants to twenty eight in overtime Vikings over the cardinals twenty seven to Seventeen jets beat the colds forty thirty for Andrew Luck for touchdowns but three picks and this game one of which was a pig six\nWashington deep Carolina twenty three to Seventeen and the Texans beat the bills twenty to Thirteen on a Jonathan ... of ... and now we have the Baltimore Ravens deep in Tennessee titans territory first single situation they're actually going to lose you are an edge\nOn a sweet place so it's got to bring up second and go from about the Tennessee what would you call it five five six yard line somewhere around there\nAre there going to think of them are from out of the Sixers we lost or to believe it was part of the five and it was a just a little toss sweep to Alex Collins to the short side of the field titans not fooled by about seven guys over there and make tackle\nYeah I always find those sweeps funny when you get deep into the other teams territory like the five six yard line it's tough to get those things going when you don't have any space everybody's crowded around the line of scrimmage at that particular point in the field and it just seems like those sweets aren't very effective when you get into that area of the football\nField by ... I prefer to run the ball vertically and just hope you're off into the blind can open the ride hole for your guide to give them the end zone but I I agree with you on that\nYeah second ... going to be in complete it wasn't really headed in any direction it was just he overthrew the guy because nobody was really open so it's going to bring up a third and goal for\nThe Baltimore Ravens from about the six yard line and this one\nAll right the rams now is that six to three lead over the Broncos first quarter now over so that explosive off and so the rams not really explosive so far today they've been stopped both times they've made it into the red zone Jared off for nine Ninety One yards Goff now they thought it was going to be some snow there were some snow yesterday I Believe in Denver but no snow on the field right now\n... not really used to playing in cold weather coming from ... California kid so he's wearing a glove today to save that can help them with the ... Michel Crabtree with a touchdown catch from\nJoe Flaco makes it six nothing Baltimore extra point is pending actually it's not a pending for Baltimore because they have the best kicked around the league Justin Tucker nice throw by Flaco kind of a back shoulder throw with Michael Crabtree matched up against Malcolm Butler Malcolm\nButler just had a tough year in Tennessee and it used to play by ... to get him going because crap trees had a case of the drops this year\nWas that and looked Malcolm Butler had a tough year dating back to the Superbowl last year\nAnd they need what ever happened I the thirty for thirty for what happened to that patriots team is going to be absolutely mesmerizing when it ever comes out but yeah he's additive just continued through scissors become much I'm just something is not right there when he was really very productive player previously in his career\nArt and jak Prescott what the big run now he was trying to get rid of the football dropped it followed it picked it up and ran it down to let the Fifteen yard line of the Jacksonville Jaguars and Dallas already with three to nothing lead and this one after field they'll earlier Jacksonville not really looking like quite a\nSuper Bowl contending off and say may I say I mean like for those had what one good game this year against the patriots other than that he has been absolutely horrific actually last week\nHe has been absolutely Blake portals so that's just that's the best you can say about and this defense not quite the same as last year jaguar Stevens was still good but letting the the Dallas Cowboys often to move the ball up and down the field is pretty shocking\nYeah Blake borders on the season to your point eight touchdown seven interceptions completing sixty one percent of its passes so he has been\nA disappointment and that gaming in Kansas City last week you look at the total yards he ends up throwing over four hundred\nBut he had three critical turnovers and the first half two interceptions and do end up fumbling that game and the first half that really cost you jak Prescott goes for it all into the end zone and they're going to call this on the field a touchdown and take a gala highway J boy but it's obviously going to be reviewed\nI didn't see the second foot come down but that was a great catch\nYeah we'll look at this year so jak press got fined Gallup in the end zone he gets one foot down yeah he did get two feet down it appears\nVideo I still don't see the second foot come down and it looks like clips the back of his he'll on the first but\nThere's one well I think he already had the right foot down oh did you see I I I thought it was already back to I think what you were seeing Brian is is the right foot coming down at the goal line but no he sees his left foot but yeah the I don't know how to run out of a sudden it down\nSo they don't want to vote for the cowboys so so much for them having a nine to nothing lead over the jaguars they're going to have to try to do things on was that was what second down so they gonna have to try to get it done and third down so jak Prescott it appears he finally has like a nice touchdown pass on the season which is a foreign concept to the Dallas Cowboys team but it looks like it's going to come back", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "14"}
