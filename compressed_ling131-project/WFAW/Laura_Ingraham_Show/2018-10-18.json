him yes ... I hear\nYou man I haven't heard much of the people mad at him I've heard them mad as Joel was the ... for making yeah home show where\nThat's where most of the the anger seems to be directed is that the official on the field who blew a call but they could have overturned that right if there's enough evidence I\nMan I certainly did see it he reached the end of the state he reached over the wall to get the ball\nYeah I think it depended on the angle 'cause I enlisted man I'd love to be a Homer here but at that demand depending on the angle\nYou could make the argument that it looks like maybe it wasn't in the stands I don't know as a base it looked like a bad call me fed golf but it's you know that's above my pay grade but if it's like good call bad call who is the up Joel West bad call okay fair enough\nI still think though you know for all the people are saying this this will cost them everything and I know\nWon't if in a while and there was a maid and I didn't want it as a momentum shift their yeah but they came back in the game yeah they did and then they wound up losing and listen if one bad call is what's responsible for you losing a championship series you didn't deserve to be there to begin with you know\nTo some columnist who disagree that shows know who to blame if they don't reach the world series or garbage take that we have a night and\nGail how many other dozens of players are there in a game you cannot blame that on one moment\nSee I respect that take from you I Do I Do I mean there's a lot of different ways to look at it it was probably not the right call it was tough to overturn honestly if there are no fans there if it's empty I think movie butts makes the catch oh he might\nHe might I mean there's still will never know we don't know but he reached into the stands to retrieve the ball and you can't do that the thing is\nThe way the game in last night yeah and I mean it's you know\nTo me it's always fun to watch playoffs baseball when you have friends that are rooting for a certain team that just upset a little bit mhm the diving catches made late in the game to save each team and ultimately it was the red Sox ... that was incredible it was\nBut I mean we'll never I mean you're talking ten years down the road no one's going to remember the game for that it will be the the home run the oil from a Bouvier\nThat's unfortunate I mean yeah it's it's disappointing as an Astros fan but you know I just recently stopped wearing my Steve Bartman suck shirt [laughter]\nI had it all these years\nYou know that you do not like cubs fans for going after and I really did and it was that guy still hasn't come out of hiding well I don't blame him but I don't even know where after the cubs won the world series came out and said all was forgiven now Steve\nWhat you owe him in a pilot ... the other way around it gave them the chance to come in and throughout the first pitch in the world series you know no thanks yeah\nNo I mean I think I Alone I'm going there came up and very upset ...

enclosure and we're ... supposed to be\nAnd immediately as soon as he hops that railing one of the tigers jumps down and runs right up to the chain link fence and it's pacing like OK lunches here and now I get to chase something this is awesome and what is the I think the goal is\nTo [laughter] think\nHe Ronnie James deal always good to hear from you or I the tigers thinking that the the guys would chew toy\nReflect a so he's okay by the way the jury's out on whether he was getting close to the fence for a selfie or\nBecause he had dropped some sunglasses ... back and forth\nBut CBS San

rare to where the ... putting themselves at risk going there and\nWatch the video game man arms over the railing that tiger comes from the other side of it being a loser and framed in high demand [noise]\nBetter trained his eyes on the man and he's thinking lunch and the best part of this story and why and bringing the audio here is when the reporter decides to do some enterprising and just

days ago Facebook we talked about this actually they they launched a device called portal right which is what you make video calls\nOr to other people using the messenger platform they're trying to hop on the other uh other uh platforms that have done something similar okay by Facebook just wants all the eyes and ears and we asked at the time who wants to open up their home\nTwo artificial

[laughter]\nAll right I'm done with Ronnie James the for the day I promise so there's a new report out now that suggests that are now Facebook is working on a companion\nProduct for portal for

and of course again who wants to have Facebook more involved in your private life\nDoes anybody really I I Know it's you know the reality is it's probably going to be fairly successful you think most

to see it not not be suggest oh I'd love to see a flop well\nMy question is this and I don't have the numbers in front of me it wasn't that long ago the usage rate of Facebook is down I forget how much\nLike it's like cut in half yeah but that's massive so they have problems constantly in the news for bad things security breaches yes there was a hole in their security goes on and on and on\nSo all of a sudden they're like okay we're going to have this device called portal and here's what it's going to do are there are a lot of people really they're\nGoing to say yeah this is a great idea I Can't imagine that cause the camera will follow you around that's the way I Am bone it it'll make sure that you're always in focus in who wants to have that just sitting in their kitchen or the living room where the bedroom or anywhere else in their house\nAnd I'm sure there's some nurse assistant managed to get to be great but as far as the privacy now I don't know are they thinking if we call it portal and keep it away from the named Facebook or maybe people won't understand\nIn the same sort of way all the people said we're done with Facebook for going to Instagram [laughter]\nWhich is owned

support for Sievers and say that they basically the Walker put his own political interests has said\nDuring his time in office I'm very critical of him about the Walker campaign kind of responses and the way they look out for a corporation has a growing in leaps and bounds basically said a whole J. was in charge\nAnd they how did they successfully agency but ... says\nYou know it's not great for the governor to have former cabinet members out their back it up and that's the third one to be on the door the opponent a fourth one to be taking shots of leadership\nOkay so you know what are the things I Would be concerned about um our Governor Walker's at these guys are going to start running ads against him or is there any uh I'm worried about that there are we going to be seen them on the

was a closing argument has to include those three about one thing to remember about like ed wall\nUm here's the crux of secretary he steps down the controversy over\nLincoln Hills and youth prison or the Wisconsin and what's going on there he was active job or try to the department of justice\nHe was then fired after us race and says he's encouraged to pay\nThe governor's chief of staff to destroy public record so there is some baggage there with at all I'm not sure I watch people do about that though so it it might be something that voters when I go to visit a TV at the bottom line is that you've got you know these guys caused all the trouble for Walker and\nYou know it's it's not the best luck\nOr is it a game changer I don't I don't know for sure about that yet but it's not the size I personally want to have happening for weeks off election\nIs this what they call an October surprise\nNot quite line with like Mary Burke and the whole allegations that she was fired by her family

races and they think it's going to be closing the see there's a pretty good chance the Democrats could take over there\nSo I'm sure that the increase to some of the attention that you're at your lunch in how to go\nA heel pretty well there is obviously they both made their case about the races to watch the pension though this hassle on shows over\nScott Fitzgerald is the leader of the ... uh basically said he was he wasn't sure he has enough support his caucus to pass a bill that would provide safe protection\nFor insurance coverage frozen prison conditions um he also said he wasn't sure

schools we backed away from that in a fairly through thousands but it's a physical problem or a sixty five point eight percent right now and Walker said he wants to go to sixty six which is the same thing that ... it'll probably go to\n... thirty funding Walker also has been trying to push back against these accusations on\nTrying to deny coverage those previous conditions by saying if necessary they would go out and pass a failed to provide that the subway pass a bill or in June of last year the Senate I take it up at Scott Fitzgerald kind of undercuts that argument with his comments now\nWith the hours later I should say but saying that if necessary they would definitely pass that bill but it sounds of people I talk to you like there's a little bit of kind of covering his but at the mess\nAfter making those famous and maybe having a member mode of candor about worth a fan of caucus is also a big issue with the ages race were turned general bread shovel has the sense of self against a tax credit democratic opponent Josh call\nThat he's trying to deny those protections of folks are presenting addition because he's suing right now for the former CARE Act that law ... provides protections right now in Wisconsin so this is a central theme\nOf a lot of races and Fitzgerald commented on health Republican cause and say hey don't worry about it and say\nWow who's almost like a soap opera now so let's just recap so you have your lunch in the big news was majority leader Scott Fitzgerald after his over somebody must have asked him about to have you have the votes for a bill that would require\nA coverage for pre existing conditions in Wisconsin and he basically said he didn't know if he had those ... what is that what we can say\nHere's a thing of you know ... you have to understand the centerfold and caucus in some ways he has like a ... a really conservative wing he's got more moderate wing you've got some of the middle of that person or that kind of\nSpectrum and an issue for sterilization can't forces members down and he wrote he's got to have consensus from Fort so the reality is they only have an Eighteen fifty majority right now if he loses more than one person than any ... can pass a law that less democratic support and I don't know yet if they'd have\nThem both the pass that bill now you know if if if the ... return and then they had that situation you by the Democrats jump on board to help out but that's a lot of you know caviar tray out of that discussion about this legislation\nSo but the one that went to kind of ... a little bit is in the then the governor is going around saying oh of course we would cover pre existing conditions and she needs a both houses to send that to him in order for him to be able to do what he says he would do and I can just shrugged his shoulders you know\nThey weren't able to do it if the Senate can pass it can't pass and then another thing people every member in his caucus where he says he doesn't know you'd be in the ... year old now is a a candidate for United States Senate\nLeo ... who I Would have always put a G are in that very conservative\nPart of his ... suit you talked about but she has said she would vote for\nWho I Would have always put a G are in that very conservative part of his car concert you talked about but she said she would vote for him she or maybe or am I getting that wrong\nShe would throw herself in front of a truck force you to while those with pre to get coverage\nOkay well that's that's not that we I remember that hey you know what whatever well that's good so you can count her as a yes but still with that yes he at one point wasn't sure if he had the votes\nIt goes back to health care has become an issue where Democrats if these are for both the past ... years I hear that issue because of the Affordable CARE Act they now feel like they are on the office of that issue of as you see that ad after ... after ad\nWhere they're going after Republicans on this tactic for those of you know there's a there's a new thoughts with gothic which was a liberal group that often does attack advocate for Republicans is heading Bradshaw ... the attorney general\nConcerning the first thing that Governor should be doing is is paying close attention to what's going on with tax dollars and we've seen yeah we had an airplane company that filed that that filed bankruptcy we've had you know that was at company office Perrier\nWe had some guy by buying a ... or something with a way to find 'em and you know this is this is ridiculous um and and and I can see why Mr jade and\nWants to speak freely because he he would know a more of the ins and outs of this I'm a board member of this but I wasn't there in the early days it's true that things are a lot better at it than they were in it it it in the past but\nThat's because of public scrutiny and outrage I think um you know watching this money vanish\nAnd literally vantage ... mysteries that I don't know if they're still salt unsolved a is to ah some of the tracking the money and we're wimps\nYeah it's you know and it it is\nA hard job to calculate and try to get your fingers on you know exactly what uh how many jobs are being created if any with regard to money that's going into corporations I mean it's there are some accounting challenges but the bottom line is\nAs you say any money to disappear I mean in that this is hard earned taxpayer dollars\nMeanwhile we got highways falling apart we've got people without health insurance we've got schools that are being underfunded we've got anniversary is a technical colleges and the extension of your W extension all of these entities are being underfunded and we keep piling money at the corporate welfare\nNow going to remember if you're playing at home that's three secretaries and signed this letter there is a fourth and that's the uh ... former or a representative and Republican leader in the state assembly I served with him or he was also the state's transportation transportation secretary\nAnd uh he uh recently said Walker was not truthful his words and increasingly an accurate in comments about transportation funding as well so that's poor secretary three of them have endorsed uh Walker's opponents\nOr the guy has not gone that far but he has since said some damning criticism about the governor\nWell and you know what it is the common element here Andy between all of these guys that are Turk turning the secretaries that are are are turning their\nCriticism I don't walk or the one common element between all of these guys is that they're concerned about the fact that Scott Walker thanks\nFirst about his own political career and then second third or fourth perhaps about regular folks in Wisconsin\nThat's the problem he he doesn't walkers doesn't have his eye on what's good for Wisconsin right he's got his eye on what's good for Scott Walker may be running for president again that his that's his a theme\nAnd you know a lot of people say oh he's not going to do that again I'm not so sure 'cause he's sticking to or not raising the gas tax he really wants to be able to say and everybody thinks in order to run for something bigger perhaps it will be president of the United states to say I didn't raise taxes in Wisconsin you weren't so bad to be able to say that right\nWell and what gets me is that he's\nAnd I did states to say I didn't raise taxes in Wisconsin you weren't so bad to be able to say that right\nWell and what gets me\nIs that he's running around taking credit for for ah the low unemployment rate the truth be known\nThe reason we have an unemployment rate as low as it is is because of the Obama administration rescuing us from an economic precipice\nAnd two thousand eight this country was on its way to another depression you remember when the banks are failing school and President Obama and his team turned this whole chaperone\nAnd now walkers coming in saying let's deregulate everything let's let's just have corporate welfare um and and that's not what's done anything here they can't even track how many jobs they're going with any one particular uh\nUh you know money that's being doled out it's it's a very difficult task but there's that isn't what's caused a ... in our economic to take to get better as a matter at all it has nothing to do with the leader of you know that these\nAre economic forces far beyond the borders a state of Wisconsin that have caused this if anything walkers march this backwards because average wages are dropping or staying stagnant at least they stack and not rising as they should be\nOh wait a minute I thought President Trump's a tax break was going to help with that\nIsn't that a isn't that a beauty well it helps some people that's for sure\nIf you make a million or two million dollars a year you you're you're gonna like that that Reagan\nOr the the Trump tax cuts that's for sure\nBut it's not helping the rest of us and it and and it just isn't fair that used to be a sense of justice a sense of fairness in our society or in the world that that it's gone I mean now now it's all skewed toward the wealthy and that's dangerous that's not\nGood and healthy for the republic at all 'cause it's\nOver time if you take a look at every public that has failed\nEvery single one of them that is failed as Ben do in some part to the tension between the super rich\nAnd everybody else\nWe're going to take a break be back with more with the state representative Dina walks right
