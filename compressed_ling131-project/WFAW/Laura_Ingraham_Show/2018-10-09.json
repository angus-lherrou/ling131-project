[laughter] we can't do this topic I Wish we could\nYou know that's the thing about this baseball postseason real quick has been David van campus just like the sniper mhm he's just\nKind of weight and back waiting to take his shots being a Houston Astros fan because they're truly dominating yes\nYou know you don't need to to talk yourself up when you actually have a dominant team oh gosh\nNo actually I I Will admit part of it is because I as an asteroid lifelong Astros fan I've been burned enough times that I'm not going to try to get too cocky about it\nOkay 'cause I Know it can all fall apart\nIn a heartbeat\nJust asking real ... real quick Greg I'm OK because this was a rivalry thing it is you get this part and I mean even if you're not a sports person there might be a rivalry you have someone in the workplace\nOkay when\nIt comes to this situation is it better to have a pretty good year make the post season and lose to the red Sox the most hated team for Yankees fans or would it have been better to just lose Ninety\nGames I Would have been there done who's Ninety games I Would prefer yeah for sure I don't want it and especially last night look Aaron Boone to data yet I don't even know if you want me to go off line fine I'll go off air and\nDon't want to win the game didn't want to you wanted to lose like an idiot\nAlthough I have to say about it I don't know what I don't know why why why what do you well meaning wanting to lose ... manager wants to lose Louis Severino should not have been pitching in the worst thing I have no idea why he was in the game I have no idea why we lose use relief pitchers the way we use them what what did we want to happen the red Sox baseball throw them directly from\nIt let you know sense man it was terrible and I just kept sitting there and watching and the store got worse and it got worse Austin role mine a catcher went into the game in the ninth inning and will do better than half our pictures last night he had an awesome knuckleball even though he's still gave up a home run because that's what happens\nIt was terrible sorry\nI'm just I'm Still waiting for an answer as to what happened I thought they were dominating\nLook they will dominate the dominate night they'll dominate on Thursday and then they'll beat the stupid Astros all just gay they don't happen it's going to happen\nIs it worse seriously to lose tonight and lose in New York or would it be worse to\nGet to a game five and then lose in Boston I don't know why it's the worst one between the two the premise of your question is difficult for me to understand 'cause losing his heart of it they're going to win both games they're going to be a lot and I I think you'd be getting more used to it I'll please because they won a game\nI Would just I Would just think that it'd be better to lose at home because you don't have to deal with the red Sox fan\nAnd yeah ... I I feel like again this is an example of somebody who came to the Twitter mob\nBecause they're all those think pieces in the twenty sixteen campaign America deserves to know what Taylor Swift thinks about Donald Trump is ridiculous now if they were swept can do whatever she wants but no she came out yesterday or I guess two days ago\nAnd said uh that she is endorsing all these Democrats and the state of Tennessee and I know the world wept for this [noise] uh\nBut President Trump was asked about it and this is one of the reasons why I Do I Know things can get Nettie with Donald Trump one of the reasons why I Love that he's president is that he will\nWeigh in on damn near anything walked about Haram bay for crying out loud [noise] that was when he was a candidate but still yeah we took it like a little baby right yeah that was incredible Trump on\n...

stepping aside at the end of the year and for about what was it about\nForty five minutes to an hour because I think it was ...\nThat broke the story and everybody was all over it waiting for Trump to come out and make a statement bleeding from ... to come out and make a statement and so there was this wild rampant speculation saying well\nOur sources knew about it none of our sources and heard anything about this maybe just shows you don't know as much as you think do you just saying just throwing that out there\nAbout it none of our sources that heard anything about this maybe I just shows you don't know as much as you think do you just saying just throwing that out there\nIt got calm down a little when Trump tweeted my friend Nikki Haley yeah so it's like okay they're a\nBearing to be friends yeah but still I mean people are already running wild with okay is she going to run is she upset about something is she quote anonymous is she the leaker\nThrow the person who wrote the oil or a bad and the failing New York times died so it was rampant speculation for a little while then they came out together\nAnd Nikki Haley they appeared to gather in front of the press 'cause that was an old rumor oh I forgot about\nThat by that she was mad that loser Michael Wolff\nBook finally area and he suggested that a bad she slept her way to the top yes right I I totally forgotten about that\nOh jeeze [laughter]\nI Know that's why when you said that I'm like oh you ... back up sure no no no no I never bought that I don't know too many people that ever really bought them\nUm but no she cleared the air or in a big way when she made a statement later\nI live that's true but then he lost a lot because he ended up getting divorced really but he just kept spinning and it's the story goes he also gave out too much money because someone close to him said he had survivor's guilt\nKnow you want all this cash really didn't deserve it got to spread it around the got it a lot of people that I Love\nAnd then he hurt his back got hooked on painkillers that actually got\nAnd then you've heard this story before you're addicted well heroin cheaper yeah addicted to heroin so down on his luck and then get the idea that we might as well Rob a bank\nI ... you can take over this part of the story [laughter]\nThis is this was an absolutely true aspect of this incredible story Hayes was listening to eighties metal music with this ten pound main coon cat Dr Pepper\nWendy ideas director Rob a bank that's when he had the idea now he's strung out living in his friends garage he said I mentally snapped I was broke dope sick pissed off at the world living in the garage with my beloved cat looking up at me hungry\nAnd I'm cranking Judas Priest breaking the law as he weigh the pros and cons of the song breaking the law by Judas Priest blasted and by the end of the song he made up his mind he was going to go forward and Rob a bank [laughter] oh my goodness [noise] anyway so he goes in robs a bank near Santa Barbara\nEr and he said he was done by how easy the first robbery was I'd never been so scared my wife he said\nI must I walked out of the banquet those until I walked out of the banquet does one hundred dollar bills the poor teller was right out of central casting she looked like a librarian she was terrified to handle the money over is watching TV news he found out investigators weren't onto him\nHe's had the cops were looking for a three hundred and fifty pound has its panic mail I said oh man I got away with this because he looks nothing like at three hundred and fifty pounds Hispanic male\nAnd he's thinking ... you can score if you don't try [laughter] right he tried he succeeded\nAs his crime spree unfolded have read everything from true crime thrillers day Internet threads for tips on how to pull off at low risk heist\nIt generally struck at about five PM as cops change shift the other part is that the ease ease hitting a lot of a smaller town between Santa Barbara in LA so it's not like you have the resources that are larger cities police department might have right so he's just ripping people off\nGenerally struck around five o'clock is cops chain shifts to disguise his body type sprayed his fingers with liquid bandages to avoid leaving print never ... never brought a gun which would've increased is prison time if he got caught\nSo he wanted to make sure if I Do get caught I'm going to minimize the amount of time in prison but most isn't there weren't wearing to fail [laughter] most importantly he had to be gone and three minutes or less is after the first one I was so easy I was like wow you got easier and easier easy every time I was completely hooked it was like a game\nAnd ... and with the timer on I mean we're going from Judas Priest not appoint break yes you got to be disciplined about the time right\nLast September he tried to hit a bank he'd already Rob so that was ... he got greedy the jig was up within a week the feds were onto him just like Bodie they really that's one of catches waves man that's [laughter] do you want it [laughter]\nHe was walking out of his for instance garage on October second to last year when he heard someone shouts thrown it looked up and started more than a dozen FBI agents dressed in bright green bullet proof vest all with their weapons drawn it took me down at gunpoint he said Fifteen agents who they are Fifteen and blocks\nThere were so many laser sides on my body I looked like I had the measles agents cost them their garbage shirt search them for firearms a total attend guns were registered to his name and then anyway he's serving a three year prison sentence but I mean he's he's now in the process of getting clean\nWell yeah but it also had already would\nApparently because he couldn't handle winning the lottery\nCautionary tale now you know he couldn't handle it well no that's just it I mean it it ... this is I mean this is the\nPoster child for this sad lottery story isn't it yeah one thing after another the divorce is he actually saying it it was the worst thing that ever happened to me\nI don't I we don't need to go into those details from K through we totally switch gears I mean I'd be willing to take on that problem if anyone wants to give me Thirteen point seven million you know I'll I'll gladly try to see if it ruins my life\nDo a special amount of research yes you're giving soul I Am really I I'm just kind of falling on the sword here I'm I'm donating my life to science\nI'm moving to the Portland protestors blocking the road you saw this video\nA video surfaced yesterday from a protest in downtown Portland over the weekend and the protesters boy they look reasonable every block in the street directing traffic yelling and drivers who didn't want to be directed by a bunch of protesters\nI mean it was it's just a noxious so yeah here's a\nSample\nOf\nLife on\nThe road [laughter]\nOh I said please just go you're blocking traffic here blocking traffic my gosh I mean aside from the hilarity of having a big chubby white guy call another white guy Whitey [laughter]\nI mean that's obviously a scary situation Evers there and the cops I unfortunately\nThe GOP's just kind of ... old back because I mean they don't want to they don't want to be seen as escalating the situation here\nKnow I always thought it was good it it'd be the best way to get somebody on your side isn't them bang on their ... and call them Whitey\nWell that's the thing man it and it was mostly a say it was a peaceful protest\nYou get some people in a ... they're freaked out they don't know what's gonna happen they've seen other video of things going really really wrong and other people that are driving a car they just they just want to irritate to protest yeah even more others really get frightened or like I'm Out of here man I'm going through\nAbout bad hearing model was going on they were using the situation to raise money so don't lecture anybody\nAbout how anybody might turn this into a political quote unquote rally event\nWell I mean over time we're going to hear more and more things about\nThe Democratic lawyers and how they influenced Yeah Dr Ford and what exactly happened because there's still so much that doesn't make sense we don't need to spend a ton of time on this\nBut you know [laughter] it's like a simple thought and I hadn't really had it before and I don't think I'm Alone in saying when you watch Dr forged testimony\nYou felt bad for her but at the same time you're like there's a lot of holes here this doesn't make sense you know but of course be said that you were raped apologist which is how ridiculous this thing has gotten\nWhat do you suppose it's possible that you know she wanted to remain anonymous ... that was true\nMan I don't know I I just don't know why you write a letter to somebody if you want to stay anonymous\nUnless you're hoping be the only the only room I can see for that is that if you're hoping that by writing a letter maybe if other people write a letter then that Congress person or in this case Senator Dianne Feinstein might say hey there's a pattern here we need to investigate this and then you could stay anonymous\nYeah made a lot of it that it's hard for me to believe but if once her name is out there and someone leaks it\nRight yeah once they get a hold of Dr Ford they convince her this is the way we have to go because as we know there are different parts of the stories have been changed mhm\nMore time but the thing that never wavered was Cleveland Kaiser her friend saying I wasn't there no recollection of any party like that I don't know Brett Kavanaugh\nBut at least we know that there was some influence trying to be put on her to revisit that story a little bit are you sure you don't remember very positive here\nThat's and that's what what was meant by Deborah Ramirez the the woman from the wagging incident\nYes ah who said\nI spent six days ... or or what was it assessing my memories that's what that means democratic whatever comes in and says could you assess your memories a little bit more and tell us that it was Brett Kavanaugh who aggregate in front of you right\nSo you put all of that together because I'm trying to give for the benefit of the doubt\nEven though there was always part of me going this doesn't make sense how do you not know that your name's gonna be out there\nI mean from all of your ... you're an intelligent person right mhm how old are you not know this and then the whole part of her talking about the regions of the brain and how it deals with trauma you're going to put yourself in the situation\nThat you're going to testify on live TV when you didn't need to you and your lawyers never told you that you could stay home in California there's all that stuff I just shut my own theory right now [laughter]\nI Can't believe it I still can't him but I Want to give her the benefit of the doubt you know that was a anyway I there was a piece written\nThat I Am a sexual assault survivor and I don't want you to just take my word for it ... it's a longer piece this lady is saying is if belief were based on a feeling than Dr forge testimony would have won me over\nBut it's more than that I mean that's that's the obvious thing\nYou have to have some level of proof that evidence or at least somebody who can put you in the same room together right I mean that's what we've been talking about for now several weeks with Brett Kavanaugh thing\nRight yes\nI mean I feel like we've already spent enough time on the whole thing um and there's other stuff that we need to get to um this isn't of importance but I mentioned it to your earlier and our producer Craig millennial like you David child of the nineties\nDid you see this\nWhole list of normal things that kids in the nineties used to do that are already outdated life comes at a fast fan\nSo for some of us maybe early fifties who are made to feel old possibly on the show from time to time mhm it's nice to see other people feel yeah but if this makes me feel old it makes you feel ancient not really because I've already dealt with it [laughter]\nYou're still fresh for what a man this is making me feel old after a while you just get used to it into and learn to accept that yeah you're still in that part where you might find it a little\nNo I think the only time I ever really the first time I ever felt like oh man I'm I'm not the I'm not a young kid anymore still fairly young but not a young kid anymore is when I heard a colleague of mine on the radio and realized\nThat uh there was oh I Can't remember what they were talking about oh they're talking about the home run race\nIn the late nineties yeah and says well I wasn't born yet they're still on the radio and he says I wasn't born when that was going on\nSo soon\nYeah and says well I wasn't born yet they're still on the radio and he says I wasn't born when that was going on\nSo soon McGuire yeah gosh that when I that's what I was like dang that hurts\nRight a low Craig ... David only do you ever remember a time\nWhen you would talk long distance with relatives on Sundays because the rates were cheaper\nYes [noise]\nI remember too I I don't because the rule was in the house don't go along this [laughter] what happens when you grow up poor man why is it that I even bring things like this to the table because this is going to be another sad story of band camp childhood\nThem a letter\nYou ever remember taking extra film with you to make sure you didn't run out\nHere we go we were too poor we didn't have a camera that would be to have a camera [laughter] we have the cheap disposable cameras you had to buy more than it was good yeah I never took good photos but yeah\nSpeaking of photos you would take one or two tops the just in case\nPhoto of something because you are limited to twenty four framed when a roll of film\nI I Wish I could remember what the so there was the Kodak a disposable cameras right we got the off brand of that and I for some reason I Want to say it was called the cone ad but that's not sounding right to me [laughter]\nAnd I hate that I just Google cone ad camera that's not a thing called an\n... I Can't remember what it was it was something like that was it was the doctor thunder of disposable cameras you know I didn't use some of the same letters as a more reputable brand and get to trick you into and it was like a similar color scheme\nRight do you remember having to have your parents called the cable company directly if you want to order a paper re movie didn't have cable oh gee oh I Do remember that\nDid you ever have to use a pay phone if you were out some were needed to call your parents pick you up yeah\nI I walked [laughter] had to beg for change [laughter] she's\nA\nOh gosh I Know some of these now I don't want to ask 'em about this having to look up a book in the library through card catalogue\nYes libraries were free yes okay when did you say on that and feel way better about David ... answer right there yeah\nUh do you remember leaving messages on your friends' parents answering machines and hoping they actually got them I only knew one person with an answering machine grown up in the middle school\nAnd I was like the rich kid\nOh you've got the fancy color right don't ya [laughter]\nSecond was\nI was in a crappy studio apartment in the early night I had the little old for a quarter with the little\nTiny ... said they weren't that expensive [noise] you know they really weren't I've I mentioned we were poor yes I mean it's the whole thing threw me off there's a lot more just to get through and we got other news or the day to get two of them are gleaned very game show\n[noise]\nMore than a day for tennis you ready to play a is everything All right this site is kind of share electric dean knows that allergy congestion can get in a way of enjoying the moment to go ahead and practice about\n... regime helps you breakthrough congestion ... ... and non drowsy anti histamine plus a powerful decongestant for twenty four hours of congestion free for a while and I saw\nThat and now the only if you go\nEasy on me get a leg ready and getting back to the moment starts working in one hour available at the pharmacy counter\nHave you ever look to your credit card statement have been shocked by the interest rate did you know you could actually roll all of your credit card debt into one monthly payment as the lower fixed interest rate go to white string dot com slash envy to find out what my dream can do for you might stream offers credit card consolidation loans from five\nPoint eight nine percent NPR with auto pay that's lower than the average credit card interest rate of over Eighteen percent a PR\nYou can get a loan from five thousand dollars to a hundred thousand dollars and you can even get your funds as soon as the day you apply light streamed believes that people with good credit deserve a great interest rate and no fees\nRight now our listeners can get a special discount on top of white streams already low rate\nThe only way to get the discount is to go on line to light streamed dot com slash envy that life's dream dot com slash envy\nL.

complain\nSo we're going to be talking about a a first debate it happened last night a with a U.S senator Tammy Baldwin she's up for reelection by the way those uh terms or six years\nAnd for those of you who want to term limits start their start at the the uh ... senators races because they're they are ... are just every six years two terms you have\nTwelve years it on a very good at math but I can figure this one and three years you have\nA Eighteen her three terms yep Eighteen years and you know I I Would like to take a look and maybe doing something with that because that if you're if you're going to do some about term limits in a ... it's a good argument\nThere are things you have to think about when you talk about that though because while you may want to put term limits on those folks that are a run for election then reelection\nRealize is that their staffs they don't get term limited so it makes them more powerful if uh they go through a bunch of senators but they never leave\nOh absolutely no I I'm a big fan of radio in fact to listening to the brewers and watching the brewers if I get to listen to Bob ... I'm going to take that every time how about you\nAre absolutely\nI mean it's just something that's where I think you and I are built were radio guys and we like it that way and we see nothing wrong with the debt that when a debate included obviously but uh you know the uh the approach the both take a your right to do so that was how a senator Baldwin\nWas attacking a is a\nNo no it was a ... year was attacking Baldwin but also the home or a controversy to write\nA that that came up as well you know but I Do actually have a clip of the two of them\nInteracting All right this was during his eyes what they did was they gave them a excuse me four minutes to talk about an issue just amongst themselves right with no moderator and and they really um I mean they got into it\nOr what could go wrong right well here's here's Here's Senator who come here and then senator Baldwin\nBaldwin character trait of Medicare and Medicaid or get rid of him or don't care I can get ... and it gets rid of private insurance we cannot ... farms now you are wrong so\nI mean that was the tenor of of that exchange and um\nThere was another thing that uh the senator booklet said that I thought was interesting and I'm I'm hoping that somebody will clarification I haven't done it I haven't contacted her campaign but\nAh they were talking about gender pay equity in other words I'm mad and getting paid more than women for the same type of work and a senator who said that a male staffers and senator\nPaid more than women for the same type of work and a senator who said that a male staffers and senator ... office are making more than women staffers um and a senator ...\nThat is incorrect and senator folk Mir says well that's not what our records show so maybe a little ah politifact or some sort of a some sort of questioning of the ... campaign would a would get to the bottom of\nThat well that ah you know the bees enough to figure out when\nI I I Would guess so yeah okay\nBut you know it'd be fair you have to look at how long people who've been in an office in a you know a lot of times it doesn't have to do with ah your sex or it has to do with uh you ... how long you been there or when expertise would job title you hold that he's going to be real real clear on that\nNow I I Know you you did ask\nAbout uh about the exchange um regarding home I don't I don't actually have audio of that a but a senator ... has been pretty consistent on this and are saying that uh\nThat Tammy Baldwin you know was was absent and didn't have the back of the veterans homeless the movie a senator Baldwin I'm shot back that senator full clear was using a marine veterans death for her own political gain and sets that are ... should be ashamed of that\nSo um that I think\nIs an issue that is going to continue to play out uh all the way up to election day off in in this in this campaign\nAnd uh you know a senator Baldwin's making her attacks to or she is a attacking a U.S is state senator Lee of Mirren her positions on a ... year implants are on insurance coverage and then I did vote on that one of the assembly and what I mean is that\nWe were telling the insurance companies to cover that up until that point they hadn't done so and uh she oppose them having to do so she also a posed a was the\nUh the cancer pill um\nThe oral chemo moral\n... a pill correct and that was to allow that to be legal in our ... that was a handful of other ... our our legislators as well so I mean there are those are the attacks I think we got 'em all\nKnow anyway [noise] where do we go next to use their more debates\nNear ... or so on on um on Saturday at a marathon county in Warsaw they're going to have their second debate\nAnd then I'm a week from this Friday on the nineteenth at Marquette will be their third and final debate of bill or anybody uh any of your listeners who haven't had an opportunity to a food didn't get an opportunity to hear or listen to last night's debate will have a couple of more chances\nAlright well are you in the governor's debate list is that coming up soon\nSo yes the or the governor's debate and let me uh let me actually go to my advisories here [laughter] and make\nSure that I've got this correct as well but the debate that is coming up um to ...\nOr the governor's campaign I yes I'm right\nOn friday the nineteenth I'm In addition to a senator a Baldwin and Lee a book or debating a Tony ... and Governor Scott Walker will also be debating a that evening the single day\nA same database right in the house it's like I pick and choose a you'll have your opportunities to uh to tune in to which of those debates you're interested in the gubernatorial debate will be here in Madison\nAlright well a lot of reading going on but you know sometimes that is the best way to find out the differences between two candidates just this\nIs this is true yeah\nAll right well we've got a few minutes left your Bob I I wanted to sneak in the brewers I told you off here that this fellow or ... you heard of him\nI I have yeah and I actually um he uh he apparently now this I mean I haven't seen that shot that he took the at the brewers so maybe you conclude me\nYou know well he's made a bold prediction I in fact the um the headline reads yes you know we predict Dodgers will sweep the brewers in the end so you know now CBS\nSunday for games for games now\nWell we'll see what we\nFeel we are yeah I told your theory if you want some good reading all you have to do is go to the old Google and putting in his name we eat and then in ticks and a lot of things come up\nOr they do yes or his or his reputation precedes himself if ah if that's the the old expression yeah\nOne thing I enjoy sports especially baseball ... but\nI like to find out if a ... an arch rival or a team we got to begin with\nI have somebody has to heat I I like finding out a ... what it is we should be hating and see my subscribe to it and uh you know this guy makes a really easy I he's got some things he just he's been in ... fights he uh he's an antagonist on the field um and then he makes a big prediction like this one\nAnd it makes it kind of easy to you know root against them if you're there to blue against it\nIt it really does doesn't it yeah mhm and are you going to me there to go against him I don't know you get in one of those hundred and thirty bucks standing room ah tickets\nWhich is that the average\nHigh that's what I was told on the street today I don't know if that's accurate\nOr on the street well how are you also ran into a a guy with the Boston Red Sox you're a Jersey on rang\nHe fits Boston Red Sox cap yeah mom I engage with him I said you know that that would be an awesome series and he said I'm actually a big brewers fan but ah I've always liked I ever since I was a kid I've I've locked up Boston I'm for reasons that you know what does he lose me but um but there you have it\nHad a he agreed that that would be an awesome series\nWe'll and it looks like he has a very good chance of happening I Will you do have to get past the Dodgers though um anything else that you picked up on the Dodgers along the way that we should think about his ah you know the next friday\nUm you know I'm I was a I was told uh this morning by somebody who keeps a more careful track of uh that sort of thing um that uh\nThe whole it was this was a very specific um in terms of how the the Dodgers hit seven homers and scored Twenty one runs against the cruise is here and they also took a four out of the seven games\nSo there you have it but that was earlier in the season\nA lot has changed since then and you know obviously Milwaukee has got a lot of momentum and uh if you if they win friday or\nIf they win a friday that's going to be it's going to be a huge deal\nOh gosh well you were describing the Dodgers and correctly soon as the storied franchise\nThey are yeah yeah absolutely I in in ...\nOh gosh yeah well you were describing the Dodgers and correctly so as the storied franchise yeah yeah absolutely I ... and ... that can be fun to take its a David and Goliath kind of a story would you say\nI mean you know brewers are the underdogs and I think for a long time your friend you met on the street to the red Sox were the perpetual underdogs yeah not any more but uh they got over that hurdle but uh you know if you want an underdog gets the brewers right\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean it's just I'm\nJust the fact that it's been so long that the brewers have been in this position a obviously they're huge underdog\nWho's your favorite player on the brewers team a\nBob I my favorite now now you have sort of sort of turned me onto our catcher\nWell how did I Want to say whether the bike the heads you know\nI don't know side to side\nYou know this is one of those programs were getting real deep now I mean I don't know what the urges someone to to look at bat but he he likes it and he does it and it it's his thing but he's also a kind of a naughty boy\nDo I you know I I Love players to hate ... that um I I think it's in Deering sometimes\nTo be able to be heated I remember when I was a kid I heated Reggie Jackson\nOn the on the keys any players and protect you hate him\nPete Rose\nOh yeah you know and usually these ... players are are usually pretty talented but that you know kind of gets a you know wrapped up and all that hate us so it makes it easy a but anyhow so when they do strike out a boy that does it just feels so good or any other uh players that come to mind\nI just don't have time say a golf players because there's so many politicians in the world\nTo Shay [laughter] yeah but you do have to Aaron Rodgers you told me that\nHe has hurt me medic aid is a strong word but I find it harder and harder for me to forgive him with anything when a game and the last three seconds it [laughter]\nOh gosh what what how I was doing so far this\nYear the Packers are doing so well no I Am not at all I Want to be honest with ya I hear you say that\nYeah well you know you did not I would have don't seem to you so yeah I mean I understand you know they we lost to the Detroit Lions you know although that team it usually everybody gets to kick around yeah yeah they they they beat us\nYeah it does it feel good and it makes you wonder what's going on here is this something we're going to have to get used to I I don't know yet\nSo I told you are rich or friends that do you react well and I we get along even though he's a Packer fan and I'm a bears fan because we figured out that most seasons\nOne of the teams is good and the other one is a food lover really a competition we joined together eating the Vikings that's the whole secret\nBut that is a good yeah there is a bonding moment isn't that are in the Vikings always a good but just not good enough and it's no good way to put\nSo they're always there to irritate you usually the Packers are feeding the bears the bears are feeding the ... yeah I feel if you're a long stretch where we seldom split for the season\nBut I was at the right things who are like a bone in the throat I'd like to see them in a different division\nWell it's not going to happen I'm pretty sure that but uh yeah they are they are fun it is a nice a beer fans in Packer fans can bond on on that and then one thing but anyway yeah and then back to this guy he uh he's making the news a reason and brought 'em up or bills because he\nHe must have licked his baton and right after that he said these ... that the Dodgers are going to a beat the brewers and four games I I don't believe saying things like that is ever a smart thing to do is it\nI I don't think anybody's there were still being smart\nUh you got me there\nI I don't think anybody's ever used to being smart [laughter]\nYou got me there no if you want some good reading a bleak antics\nAnd this guy's been a bar fights this guy has gotten a you know ... on the field or a you know deliberate tonsils are he's done it all he's he's a good guy said\nThat he is a bona fide character\nYes yes he is he's good for the game I really do believe that I because personality\nBaseball need parents oh God yeah they don't get\nThat there was a victory dance they don't get this fight the fall they don't get the signal that it's so first of all of the things that football players do now it's like watching the people at a dance club baseball is supposed to just take your alma and walk around the face off those jazz\nJazz it up a little bit I think they make it more entertaining\nWell speaking of entertaining we're going to take a break and then when we come back we're going to talk some politics do that now\nYou're listening to start in the middle way to
