you got up your Instagram followers right right you gotta have the social media presence the heart of it\nSo yeah a lot of people want the perfect selfie a lotta times that involves doing stupid things like jumping off of bridges are cliffs to impress the Internet 'cause that's what we need to do these days now the today show how to practice this morning I thought it was pretty interesting about how search and rescue crews are kind of tired of rescuing people who do stupid things for Internet glory and I don't blame him\nDo it all you can see the irritation somebody out people LA county is where they did the story but it's this is pretty much true across the nation search and rescue missions are up thirty eight percent over the last five years and that's not a hundred percent because of selfies but it has absolutely gone up because of that\nUm they talked to some search and rescue professionals about it who are obviously annoyed\nSocial media major job harder\nIt has it has made it harder and it's because of the type of things like people jumping up and trying to get that spectacular shot they look at the pictures of folks in the forest are performing stand for their shopping off waterfalls going on a hike that maybe their skill level is not set up to and then they feel like they can go out and do it\nRight you see someone else do it so well it's not like they're an expert I can do that right I'm going to do that hash tag no filter no or one of the guys\nSays another problem is having friends or this was fascinating having families of family members or friends wanting to document the rescue while it's going on instead of helping the person who needs to be saved ...\nWhat do you think they forget about all the basic rules of safety they're more concerned with the social media aspect of it and record anthon after remind them\nKeep in touch with all the way it helped me with their mother [laughter]\nPut the phone down right helped me get your mother out of this tree have you done anything even remotely there would be considered dangerous in\nLife or for for online on me for a while for a photo hell no okay I mean I get annoyed when it's like we my wife and I will go travel will be visiting somewhere we've never been before and she wants to stop like every ten yards to take a selfie I'm annoyed at that there is no way I'm climbing up a cliff right to get a\nSelfie as I'm jumping off of it\nNo I mean there are I think there are some times where you take a selfie or people do that it's just like a scenic background you know it's not dangerous and I never considered it dangerous members showing you as a photo it was from this last spring in Florida and as we're walking and it was about twenty yards away from a pond and there was a there was\nLike Cory Booker come out and say I this is my I Am Spartacus moment they're not going to vote for him anyway\nNo of course not so what's the matter Wayne in cow talented their demands\nHe goes on and say listen to MSNBC It's MORNING and the host almost on panicked about how the FBI might not be able to confirm Julie sweat next absolutely ludicrous charges against Kavanaugh even if she reported that NBC couldn't confirm any of it\nThe urgency wasn't that the media let Michael ... played them all for soccer's but that it might be too difficult to prove allegation sweating herself walked back almost entirely\nIn other words the fear possible in many quarters is the charges might unravel prematurely and so the press must start rattling them [laughter] and they kind of true and in the end going\nBack to the Trump party said yeah Trump he thinks it's done in the country a disservice by how he talks about the press and that's where a lot of conservatives won't agree with him but that's what he thinks\nSo but so have you journalists because you have made it so easy for him and you're making it worse right now\nIt's constant outrage and it's the constant if Trump why could it must be wrong\nBut that's why it\nSeems to so many people the media and the Democratic party or in concert together because they're playing the same notes and there's never looking at the other side totally missing it look at this Cory\nBooker thanks yeah and I will say at least he's being honest about his intentions now democratic senator Cory Booker Spartacus you may know him as\nI still prefer Corey tears of rage Booker but that's just me yeah me too came out and said well it doesn't matter if Brett Kavanaugh is innocent or guilty we should right now be looking at a different Supreme Court nominee 'cause the allegations are enough\nWhen it's time for him and has been revealed in an emotional moment [noise] where do you use language than than frankly shocked a lot of [noise] and then ultimately\nWhy what what is he talking about there's part of me that can kind of agree\nNot\nWith the overall message that Cory Booker is saying but saying that you know Brett Kavanaugh was very emotional and I can see where somebody would say oh jeez man he was a ... he may have gone over the line that being said this is a man who compared himself to Spartacus and you're also talking about another man and Brett Kavanaugh who's been accused of gang\nRape with zero evidence to back it up so I can understand why he might be a little pissed off at the whole thing\nHe wasn't even talking tone there which I Would agree with that take two wars the language or what is he talking about\nWhere do you use language that frankly shocked a lot of them in an old lady who\nHad a pansy argue he had tears of rage Jamie night what he had she\nNot whether he said this is not a trial the false and Italy [noise] none of the questions the race\nThat we should not be long to wait another candidate in that long list put together by the Heritage Foundation and the federal society move on to another candidate because although no Supreme Court is not an entitlement and [noise]\nJust because he went to jail or prison is your last entitle you to the Supreme Court [noise] this is a sacred institution\nIt's sacred and anybody that is accused of sexual assault attempted rape gay wagging the winking in somebody's face or whatever else gang rape or yeah I mean there are cool under pressure no I didn't do it\nYou know it's destroyed my family [noise]\nIt's kind of ... death threats to my daughter and you know and my wife\n... threats but I'm OK unfair and are you kidding that's what you're\nGoing after Corey I mean why Cory Booker hears about them a rough language yeah oh yeah in the White House and that I had seen or something [noise] he had tears of re I actually have\n... yeah he was we buy 'em up high I'm appalled by the way what was the worst word the Kavanaugh said he didn't go F bomb on anybody he didn't say like the s word what was the worst ... said the language not sure\nWhat mayor but I don't know if he's talking about just the tone it\nIs that what he's getting out or the language saying on you because\nYou use language than than frankly shocked a lot of [noise]\nMay be referring to the idea that Brett Kavanaugh said that a lot of this push has been because of an inability to come to grips with the fact that Hillary Clinton lost the election and twenty sixteen what's the bad word there were like well you know how that got divorced\nBack out and saying that Hillary Clinton was behind it which I guess would be shocking language if he actually had said that which he did not by the way I take it as languages in the language shocked me I mean he's he's saying bad word\nI think he said ... at one point okay All right here's a brave yeah go way man\nCash this whole thing man\nIn the end what are we what are we saying the people that allegations are enough that's basically what they're saying [noise] more on that\nComing up a little bit later on we got to get the alec struck back uh-huh well he hosted the gubernatorial debate Pennsylvania ah I think this was on Sunday night it did not go well for him\nBecause well he made a Catholic go I mean look here's the thing he got himself very involved in the whole proceedings to the point where he was almost debating alongside the people he was arguing for positions alongside the\nTwo candidates on the stage and then you know this was something that definitely turned to my head was making a joke about the Catholic Church you know something happened in Pennsylvania recently having to do with the Catholic Church if he'd been paying attention at all um\nThe last time I look to\nThe approval ratings for the legislature was that's fourteen percent the only thing with a lower rating in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania is the Catholic Church near [noise] now don't go there\nI was I was born

not to that degree it's it's a very [noise] that's actually a pared down quit because he talked for nearly two minutes about this ... this is a gubernatorial debate not you know high takes without your back\nDo you think that whole thing was prepared or was that the joke bombed and then he was trying to explain it I don't know man it\nWas not and that was about halfway through the debate then later on he asked a question about a tax increase and wound up debating what the Republican candidate not letting the Democrat talk\nNow now like some of the answers we have we're the only state has impossibly then in ... was among you talked about laying\nThe used to be poor and a half percent now down to one going to present as he mentioned that the moments ago can combine the mood\nMost of

millennial thing it's not from my generation if you're going to throw a party and partying has been a big topic of conversation this week [noise] certainly surrounding judge Kavanaugh in his days in high school and college right right okay\nA big topic of conversation this week [noise] certainly surrounding judge Kavanaugh in his days in high school and college right right okay so I see this little piece\nAbout if you want to you know hosting good party and want to make sure that people will leave in twenty minutes there's some things you should do\nI okay I don't know a long long time since I've had a party I think my fortieth was the last time my wife through party for me um I don't remember\nAnyone ever leaving within twenty minutes no or the theory of they're going to decide in the first twenty minutes if they're going to stay\nOr not that I could see yeah I've been to like a couple of Christmas parties where somebody stops and just to say hello maybe drop off a gift or something and they say but I Can't stay\nYeah but usually there are a lot of other people who do stay but according to the survey you\nHave the twenty minutes so this is what you better do to get people to stay\nYou're ready I'm ready\nNumber one offer somebody drink in the first eight minutes well they might not the first thing every one that is\nWhat you're supposed to serve it to them or I mean 'cause usually party that I've been to or hosted it's beers in the fridge or the where we got a keg or here's where it is it just does or it offer offer it so that to offer I guess\nYeah I mean even if you say hey it's over there you're offering right may not be great service but you're offering it right\nThere we hear nothing to do that are we here to be cordial earlier to drink that's my question\n[laughter] well so you're saying that it always has to be a drinking party well no wonder you're a big fan of\nJudge Kavanaugh [laughter] I'll tell you I it doesn't it I'll tell you if you just send out an invitation to what you say singles\nTheir twenties or thirty you know and you don't have boosted the alcohol yet or a boos at the party and you don't specify that people are probably going to leave in the first twenty minutes a lot of times\nYeah um\nTalk to your guest within eight minutes of them getting there\nAs soon as I read that then all of a sudden I'm thinking okay I Know this comes from the New York post yeah\nWhoever writes this or participates in the ... the survey they're not real people these can be real people hello and welcome to my apartment but as one bedroom [noise]\nYeah well yeah you're going to talk to people of course\nSomeone snacking less than ten minutes [laughter] that means the odors we have devil eggs and caviar in the tiny kitchen slash bathroom offered drink refill within twenty minutes\nNo bears over their help herself yeah I mean that's just kind of weird\nAnd then if you do that say is hey we're all friends here right it's a ... you got the algae are males whatever if all of a sudden there's a female friend she comes over they\nWant to be here there you go there's beer right hey you know and I bought another one\nThen that's quote raping isn't it yes well and the loading I current definition I Know I haven't been to a lot of fancy parties I Know you're shocked\nTo hear this but I mean for the most part it's not ... you don't have the host walking around offering refills Egypt say bears over their head it you know help herself random somebody standing next to the bar yeah you could do that but I've also never been to a party where somebody leaves because they weren't offer to refill\nNo well jeez DJ didn't offer me a new drink I'm going to leave now\nAnd if that happens I Want that got to leave your probably like as a little picky yeah then okay don't talk about politics for money [noise] okay I'm Down with that I'm totally onboard with that unless all of\nYour pals or whoever you're having a party for everybody's got you know the same kind of thinking or that sort of the sport\nYeah that your job and I think a lotta times that that can be dangerous if people if people aren't able to take criticism without getting into a shouting match is\nIt a bad idea and then you've fuel that with ... and who knows yeah talk about TV shows movies or food\nSo basically it's like entertainment stuff yeah that seems to be OK unless it's our producer Craig Collins don't talk about food because that may be worse than politics very opinionated and you bring up pizza and he'll yell at you guys all you've got all his Yankees garb on today like Mac matching hat and Jersey\nWell done um don't ask people to take their shoes off\nOkay photo white protect the bird uh the the carpet\nYeah\nYeah it's kinda weird if you're having a big party you say hey make sure to leave the shoes of the front door that's a little weird\nIf it's a bigger party you know that you're going to do some serious clean and yeah the next day so I get that and how many shoes are you going to have\n... you know at the doorway 'em\nAnd make sure here's the best one ready the party will look good in Instagram photos\nWell [noise] some [noise] done\nYou got to ... you guys said not me\nI'm saying millennials\nBut you're painting a broad brush here yeah I Am because I don't know about producer Greg as a fella millennial ... have you ever considered the Instagram implications\nWhile I was just wondering it's been about eight minutes into the segment started you guys need to refill on your [laughter] guys are you voting for now\nI I guess I'm okay right now but I think you for asking angry she ate a welcome very very well done I'm going to go to your home state of Texas ... favorite towns David I'm a little\nDisappointed in Austin, Texas\n\nBut this is what happens when you have a bunch of hippies takeover and otherwise God fearing America loving down like Austin, Texas Austin pretty liberal right uh yeah it is yeah there there was the first ones to have the keep insert city name weird there the first ones to do that sorry Portland but they were\nAll it's on now and just do it and that's that's a true thing though I'm just going to get out there some people wouldn't agree now but it's true ... so anyway ah as of this week though in Austin, Texas they've taken an aggressive step towards curbing food waste which generally I think that's a good idea\nSure but there's an ordinance that took effect that prevents restaurants in food businesses from throwing away access food or other organic material in the trash they can be fine for this this is the universal recycling ordinance a set of regulation of programs aimed at getting us into reaches zero waste goal by twenty forty\nI mean he was allowed to uh to associate with these people outside the bounds of politics and yeah I'm sure he has seen a lot of stuff\nAnd I'm sure there are a lot of people right up by the way is Blumenthal even answered this he never does I mean how do how do you explain yourself you have to have someone asked him first that's the difficult thing when you screw up big time on a big stage\nAnd you make all sort of an forced errors in your career in life you got to kind of keep it to yourself wanting to when it gets a little too close to home\nAnd that's where I'm going away for being liars when yourself are a huge

watching like a favorite team and they're going to have heart issues we talked about this yesterday I Know that laid out his worst case scenario\nWould be a tight game late into the game yes like a one run game let a ... so you had that into the eighth inning mhm the cubs die mhm and then there are chances to win and the night and then there's the tent than the eleventh and twelfth yes and then it ends in the thirteenth yes\nSo my question is you know and anybody that's watch sports at all\nEven casual fans ... you can kind of remember\nThat one you watched that is worse than all the others like it was the most heart wrenching defeat mhm for a team you were rooting for us right up there was this in the top five right up there yes I Would say top five yes there is there one that comes to

honorably under um yeah they're up to the games on the Padres one went away from\nGoing in the world series and we know what happened you know they went to San Diego disease that one Bartman I mean the yeah so there are several but this would be tough so is this was a crush or though yeah although you know what I totally did I I had a really bad feeling early on in this game\nYeah because they were playing like they normally played over the last month the season\nLots of six four three lots of strike out lots of ... I mean just not square and at the ball not eating it and there was a problem and they lost\nI didn't take Josh burying it takes you right before the game you walk you know I Know you did you did\nAnd then once the rocky scored I didn't feel like I get taxed because I Know that I can irritate you sometimes and I didn't want any of that\nI heard from other people while the game was going on for a producer critical and of course yeah I heard from him\nIt now is critical you rooting for the cubs by the way I don't root for teams other than my favorite team I don't know what you're saying no ... for the cops okay\nAll right because I felt bad for Scott being up so late got so bad for Scott yes and the devastation of losing the way you did and ... and how the Yankees will win today and then your age will be out I felt bad\nIn up so late got so bad for Scott yes and the devastation of losing the way you did and ... and how the Yankees will win today and then your age will be out I felt bad for all there is not you\nKnow what I was reminded of last night though I was reminded of have you ever been ... been to several baseball game certainly are back in the days when we used to hit pretty hard you and I both did yeah I can remember when the game was going to extra innings\nAnd you saw that you that when you could see you go into extra innings you didn't know how long you were going to be there when they stop serving beer like in the seventh inning\nYeah and my my buddy you know I thought it was a tie game\n... the guy would walk down with like twenty I mean we I every single one of them\nWill take the money 'cause you don't know how long you're going to be there\nYou know you mean Kavanaugh she's crazy [laughter] yeah yeah I didn't care to do it in kings fan so\n[laughter] ... do you have one comes to mind like in just devastating dry oh yeah no I Do and it's like well yeah do you gave me\nA ... are you considering all sports do they have all thrown all in there why not ... well baseball when I was a big Pittsburgh Pirates fan and we had World Series tickets were all set to go\nAnd the Braves came back in the bottom of the night there was a heart crushing loss in game seven in Nineteen Ninety to ... and ... me and my buddies are watching it with the world series tickets on the coffee table\nOh boy that that would suck for a while\nAnd then I think a few years ago you know my daughter and my son they also become cowboy fans please don't call child services and when they lost the Packers with the does rank catch ... they they they took it hard so that was tough just to watch\nThem like right yeah yeah\nWhat about you Craig why my my best and worst sports moments happen in the same series it that two thousand one Yankees in the Arizona Diamondbacks its tail Martinez my favorite player at the time hitting a home run on my birthday to tie a game with two out and two strikes in the ninth for us to when I think that was game five\nHonesty that when you were in your hospital badly yeah he did he don't help me out here for you or a bird and awesome and then a game seven unfortunately\nUh gave it up in the ninth inning to runs we go on lead to a three to last and I didn't hear\nThat was one of the few times a lot of the country was rooting for the Yankees because of everything New York had gone through and two thousand and one\nAnd even the miracle of that series the two games in a row being down in coming back in the ninth and home runs Scott brochures does it the next night Dieter as Mr November when\nAnd I mean you know they don't win that often the Yankees was he was unfair I thought it would be almost started it is and in one jet or to at least have other people talk about yeah this was really you know really bad right oh yeah you're you're not alone there\nBut I used to have my old friend Budweiser next to me and I don't have that anymore [laughter] I was thinking too I mean you do another show I mean you've got to get out early\n... you're going on not very much so yeah a little bit by the way there if you think working from home is great there's a downside to that we'll get to coming up on the marching band camp chef\n[noise]\n\nImagine the panic that came over this that he was working late when he got an alert on a smartphone what are the motion activated blink cameras you'd just installed picked up something in his home pops open the blink cap and views a video clip of a man peering through his kitchen window he calls nine one one and alerts his wife\nHelping prevent situations like this is what blink is all about I\nMean the point of having a home security system is to help alert you both for some ... breaks into your home\nNot after boiling motion activated H.

tomorrow and the brewers are will take on the rocky and that is our broadcast moral by the way starts at three thirty\nAnd\nAnd that is our broadcast moral by the way start to three thirty\nAnd\nI Know your first inkling would be too well I'm gonna watch it on TV but you know what I really want to urge you to turn on WSBIU W and listen to Bob you could call the game that's the best way you're about to make a memory in your head of the brewers going on and to the playoffs\nAnd then you're going to ... you're going to refer back to it later in life wouldn't you want it to be Bob ... voice that you refer back to his great calling of the game\nI'm just saying I think that's what you want so that's tomorrow three thirty in the beginning of the broadcast that on friday we begin or broadcast at two forty of course the Rockies is still in Milwaukee\n\nA oh yeah the cubs yeah they didn't win last night so that's why it's the Rockies cubs are done now get some good needed rest a all saying that uh but anyway the brewers\nOf the evening are unclear Trump also told the people at the rally last night that men might\nBe fired from their jobs after being unfairly accused\nOf sexual harassment echoing a sentiment that he told reporters earlier on Tuesday about how it's a very scary time for young men in America\n\nOkay so there are a few things uh that uh catch my ear on this um at first of all you know let the investigation play it play out I was happy to see that President Trump\nDecided that uh the FBI should investigate this as best they can I mean it's a long time ago\nIt's um\nThey've done investigations like this before though so why not bring them in they should have been brought in at the beginning of the process that we can debate why that didn't happen but I'm Glad to see that it's going on and that's if it is a true investigation of what may or may not have happened\nAnd you know there's this idea that the Democrats are delaying there in the minority you really can fully anything they have no power sure they're raising concerns\nYeah that's what the minority does they raise some\nConcerns they try to be as loud as they can they be can be heard there aren't as many of them as in the majority of us\nThe minority\nBut they have no ability to a schedule or unscheduled or\nAnything they can't do anything or so\nThat accusation on this one sometimes or because of the rules you can say well they're obstructing um the process\nYou can every now and then say that but you cannot say it on this because they don't have the ability to do that they have\nAh raised a lot of questions um they've taken some stances that\nA make a lot of people question what's going on here and a doctor or I should say a Brett Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh and that may have done but they can't do anything if as if they want to schedule a vote tomorrow the voters scheduled for Democrats can't stop it\nIt's\nNot for them to decide so\nThat's one thing to think about the other is a President Trump\n\nSeems to uh you know get kind of an tagging this stick with the is a way especially at these rallies having it whether or not you're ... where you are on President Trump in your opinion of him you have to admit that at these rallies he gets going\nHe's very unscripted you just goes flying off the cuff and he says some things that are just there to antagonize can we agree on that\nI Hope so\nIf we can agree on that than there are those who say oh he's the most picked on President tea and they then media just attacks him relentlessly they're always so after well don't you think it's because of the way he acts as you don't you think that the way he accident but he brings this on he riles a lot of other people up\nThat's what I think\nAre so this idea that always the most uh\nHe brings this on he riles a lot of other people up that's what I think are so this idea that you know is the most uh attacked president by the media by the ... yeah\nWell you may have a point but there's two sides to every story you cannot deny the behavior that he has a on his hand to perhaps create the atmosphere for that to be the case\nAt all I'm saying sometimes not what you say is how you say it and that the you know I read these quotes from you know as mundane as I possibly could\nI didn't want to try to imitate him imitating her didn't want to get into that\nBut if you watch any of the tapes and which I'm not going to play\nBut if you watch it you'll see that ah yeah he's he's really trying to get in the crowd go in and he does\nSo uh that's I guess ... or it's going forward that's all I got to say on that are coming up next we're going to talk with a gubernatorial candidate\nA Tony ... he's running against our Governor Scott Walker\nAnd uh we're going to have him on a chat about his campaign or he took a ride with a is a candidate for lieutenant governor I'm Mandela Barnes yesterday and ah oh that was a on a on the YouTube and daily lives or stream didn't live\nA and a ... some people got a kick out of it uh and they were kind of poking fun at uh the governor and he is a flying around in his airplane and they were at a car and so I I haven't watched it myself but I did see that it a lot of people are posting on social media will ask about that well ask him to vote his agenda\nOr what he wants to get done as our next governor if he gets the honor to do so so that's coming up next if you have any questions for him you can or\nA text you had to you can't takes me but it's close you can tweet me that stuck with Andy On Twitter you can go to Facebook it stuck in the middle of the anti Jorgensen and I hope you what you do there when you're there\nYou are like the page and then you can live stream it
