studios\nI'm this fantastic it's a great set up we had a fantastic time last night it was a listener event I'm more on that a little bit later on a lot of the country right now focused on hurricane Michael\nYeah this one ... and we've noticed is I think we noticed that last year or two after Harvey it was sort of like if you have a couple of\nBig hurricanes in a row the freak out in the news coverage seems to diminish 'cause I don't know if that's because your average person just kind of says oh it's just another hurricane or why that may be it it just kind of an interesting thing to notice as you watch how the media handle things\nWell I I don't know if that had to do with this past weekend everything's Kevin Kevin off what hurricane who cares about that right this guy might be a Supreme Court justice saw\nIt and we were talking about it it seems like there's this kind of snuck up on everybody 'cause it it just it strengthened so quickly\nBut this thing or it's like a monster\nYeah it's expected make landfall along Florida's north eastern Gulf Coast or this afternoon category for or stronger hurricane has never made landfall in the Florida Panhandle people alive

boarded the plane regular when they were ready to take off when there was an in mountain and be happy to be seen as a woman world and a little terrier on her lap build\nOn a second what the people were not upset more amused those are\nGood people [laughter] your delayed two hours you know I\nI Would not be amused either no and and that that doesn't really even matter what animal\nIt is somebody's got a Chihuahua you know in a carrier and and because of this person in the Chihuahua my flights delayed two hours I'm very upset\nBut it goes to another level if it's a squirrel and it's like a damn squirrel yeah yeah yeah\nThe owners refused to get on the brain and she had to be quoted on my own remain don't believe the video that he would impact on me around on media like mining experience for the\nChildren they were that reason I mean when they leave early memories you know from my home room jumping\nOn hold on somebody's in a wheelchair mhm and I got to get off the plane because of this not yes\nImagine you're helping that person on the it's a pain to fly you've been thinking about it all day you finally get on the plane okay exhale all good no support squirrel we got

know it and I understand we're always trying to be better especially with mental health issues and the first thing that comes to mind me it's veterans would be TST are trying to deal with that and you know\nEmotional support dogs you know you've seen some positive results because of that so you're always trying to be sensitive to that fact that being said\nFor decades people were able to fly on airplanes without emotional support animals so true and so why is somebody expecting that they have a right to bring a freaking squirrel\nOnto an airplane\nWouldn't you love to have Trump go off on that one but talking about it's [laughter]\nI can just hear it in my head a ... maybe you'll find comfort in\nThis you know for beetles fans big fans of John Lennon would've known it would have been his Seventy eighth birthday was yesterday yeah how did he Yoko own over paid tribute and\nDoing on her and I don't I don't I'm gripping the year I'm white knuckle in this do you need to support squirrel before yeah they do actually I mean might yeah uh she decided to release her own version of imagine\nWhy\nListen man you didn't see the online gathering of signatures of beetles fencing Yoko please can you do a version of a magical and then release it were begging you we need this now please Yoko nagging\nHoping [noise]\nIf he if\nI'm starting to imagine that right now actually [noise] no

narrative will be what the president is just using Kanye West mhm isn't that going to be\nPart of the use someone can't but you see here use this yeah see [noise] so unbelievable\nProgress in this case it makes sense if you can't use a motor can't be used and you're useless did you see the quote from Bacardi sellers on CNN know\nTo what he said and this is something that you would never have heard anybody on any news network say I'll just quote here or what he says his Kanye West is what you get when quote negroes don't read\nOh how condescending that\n\nSo he doesn't line up with you politically ... and that's the shot route you kidding me\nAnd we're supposed to be kinder to one another it's these evil Republicans who are just mean right every body right\nUh-huh\nOh wow\nWell this sure will be fun oh looking forward to that um you know Halloween to not too far off every year conversation comes up sooner or later when should you stop trick or treating well is there a specific age some places there is a specific age you\nSee this story down in Virginia will find kids up to a hundred bucks or\nJail them for six months if they go trick or treating and are above the age of twelve\nI'm against this and I believe in freedom [laughter] there still are they really got to throw a Thirteen year old in jail for going trick or treating\nIt starts with discipline they've if we're going to make America great again discipline starts at a young age that's what we're talking about uh-huh no I Know it's it's a bit much but all of a sudden for a guy like\nMe who is kind of looked at as the evil ogre in my neighborhood because you know you know all my friends around in my neighborhood they all have kids\nAnd we talked before and I'm like yeah I really think the cut off around and sixth grade and you know right around twelve and so those kids that might be later in middle school or even early in high school\nYou know like hey I still have this outfit I really like getting the free candy ... why do you have fun Mr markedly itself I'm just thinking about my own\nChildhood yeah you know once you were out of fifth or sixth grade you were done yeah I kinda think\nThe ruled generally was when you're old enough to walk down to the corner store and buy your own candy you can't you're not going trick or treating anymore\nRight and that was right around twelve for most people\n... million man this is a law according to the city's ordinance if any person over the age of twelve ... should engage in activity commonly known as\nCritical to treat or\nAny other activity of similar character or nature under any name whatsoever he or\nShe shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and she'll be punished by a fine of not less than twenty five dollars or more than a hundred\nOr bike confinement in jail for not more than six months or both obviously a story like this gets picked up\nBy now [laughter] yeah [noise] [noise] do you think it's a little too harsh though to throw kids in jail for this so of course when they think the stories funny\nYeah do they have the time limit for trick or treating activities to all of that stuff I mean I I yeah do you do you mind the time limit um\nYeah because if you're trying to keep it under the age of twelve and you're saying hey come at you you have to be in by eight o'clock yeah generally I think it's probably a good idea for an eight year old to be inside by eight o'clock yeah depending on the town you live and depending on where you are or what neighborhood you're in but\nIt's probably not great to have an eight year old wandering around the streets looking for candy from strangers until ten o'clock at night\nWell I I wasn't even thinking about the kids' safety I was thinking about man eight o'clock lights out no more ring the doorbell yeah we've got a three hour window\nAndy that's a good thing about living in an apartment complex for me personally is I've never been bothered by trick or treaters\nThere have been times it's like every year my wife wants to go by Halloween candy just in case although it's really just a clever ploy to make sure that we have plenty of candy in the house and we wind up eating all of it and there you go then the Christmas fat season begins yet to be honest I don't really mind but yeah there should be a time limit on it\nAnd yeah you got to stop some time in the ... um the other story of the government killing an old lady\n[noise] yeah well [laughter] that I haven't read the headline that ... that's the click bait headlines sort of Maryland woman you hear about this kind of stuff going down every now and again Maryland woman learned of a death in the family through her bank and that that was hers but she was still alive\nSo the capitals reporting doesn't crofton Marilyn the capital is reporting that Ellen Baron got home on September twentieth\nShe found out she went on line to check your bank accounts and both of our accounts were frozen dew didn't know why so she called up the bag and says hey what's going on bank tells her while the Social Security administration said you were dead\nSo we cancel your account she's Seventy five very much still alive\nOr she spent two weeks go into a bank go into the Social Security office to offer proof of life\nBarron says you've got progressively annoyed as she found out her prescription and health care plans were\nAlso affected by this because they're not gonna give pills to a dead person\nThey don't have that technology yet [laughter] so yeah there and said you got progressive way you know she was getting more and more annoyed and she said look beat the the error though luckily could've had worse ramifications if you were immobile or still out of town because he came back from traveling to find out but she had died\nBut what if I mean you're talking about missing some time with your medication yeah pain and suffering you a little something back I don't I don't\nThink so usually don't I mean you and luckily I mean it seems like she's been able\nTo clear this up relatively quickly 'cause you hear about people who are dealing with the ramifications of this for years\n... if the government messes up and it happens every year you hear these stories where you know somebody hits the wrong key and the government says you're dead and you're standing there and you you're like I've got five\nForms of ID in front of you I'm also breathing you can hold up a mirror to my mouth and all bets are off fog up the mirror\nAs crazy star right I've got to play this story from oh yeah yeah and this is what we heard the awful Yoko own version of imagine that\nWe don't\nDon't need to hear that again this was last night American music awards but I don't really care much about Music Awards but I saw this making the rounds saying is banned panics a disco no some songs not a huge fan but you know All right and they covered bohemian Rhapsody you know the movies coming out on friday mercury are really looking at it\nI'm not a huge fan but you know All right and they covered boy mean Rhapsody you know the movies coming out on friday mercury to really look at 'em and I'm thinking man that's got gee that's a tough song to do there have been many that have tried and failed how is panic at the disco going to do\n\nSo far where you think that's really good that's a really good as are right yeah\n\nI was impressed sometimes you can think about a bad differently after I started more all the way this is the marketing game show\n[noise]\n\nHave you

you care less about those award shows because we're not all sharing the same experience to the same extent we used to write that is true we used to be you know you turn on the radio and everybody knew this one song that was being played on the radio constantly it's not it's becoming less and less\nUh like that as we as time moves on that is true\nOr the other old man river like me and like you know them using the day the other part of that though is who wants to sit through a three hour award show you when all they're going to do is ramp politics\nDown your throat that is why the Oscars honestly and a lot of movie award shows have tanked\nYeah because the reality is is that people who are obsessed with politics may not agree with it and may also just want to have some sort of escape from it and then there's a whole lot of people in this country who could not care less about it\nThis is true and when they hear a joke do Trump bad Democrat good all that stuff they're saying they shut up and play the dang song\nYeah this used to be you know I just like musical artist I like music\nOkay I Know for certain that we disagree politically but I appreciate the musical talent but you tune in and then seeing someone GM their views on your throat feel like I'm not coming here for that right but this new record low in ratings matched\nWealth to thousands Seventeen which has a new record low that it now I'd\nWith two thousand sixteen except this one was twenty five percent worse than last year [noise] wow\n[laughter] [noise]\nYou're not beaten the big bang theory there no no you're not and she is in the news daily call go this is click bait this is a bogus story what do you mean go ahead and give me the headline oh well it's actors says she'd be fine of her husband's split\nWhat does that say to you know she doesn't care if he leaves well I think that is kind of what she's saying I don't think so\nIt's not no it's not it's not as salacious as as of course the headline makes it sound and I think she's actually she's making some sense it's about the uh the financial security angle of it right I Would be fined financially he would be fined financially and that actually helps out their relationship because they don't need each other for financial dependence\nWell of course everyone knows she makes a big bang from the show but you see the headline bag me fine of her husband's split [laughter] [noise] [noise] ... yes financially she makes a lot of money\nYeah she just married a Carl Cook who's wealthy in his own\nWords about three and a half billion dollars was dad's words about three hundred and ... and three and a half billion dollars or she did this interview with women's health and she said I Want to see I'm Talking about her husband uh I like knowing though that I'm financially set because I've taken it upon myself to do that\nI like to tell my friends always make sure you have your life going and that your number one so that anyone who comes into it has been boyfriend girlfriend however you roll that's just an added bonus to something you're already creating an I wholeheartedly agree with that\nYeah that's what more marriages need all about me no way a recipe for success I I don't\nThink she's saying it's all about me she's saying that you know take care of by I under I don't know it's not even that it's saying that make sure that you've got what you need in your life that you are set up and then you are actually choosing somebody 'cause you want to be with them not because you're dependent on them\nFor something other than just ah other than an emotional connection I Know and I I agree with that\nI understand I get it I mean but the whole headlines misleading oh yeah point from like I don't care if he leaves fought to click bait world yeah is that right yeah so I see the headline even in the short run out I'm like really holy cow okay now I now I just feel duped\nNo big deal OK other stuff we got to get to all there's the lock her up chants that we still haven't\nGotten to yet oh yeah [noise] um we'll get to that coming up\nUh in just a little bit there is a story about a weight to lure a tiger that they went out and kill is this right this was written\nUp in the guardian wildlife authority authorities in India they're trying to catch a tiger that is thought to have killed at least nine people and what they're thinking about using is Calvin Klein obsession cologne\nSo the tiger\nIs preying on people uh and rangers have thrown significant resources into trying to get the animal um so they're saying that what they want to use as this cologne the power of obsession to lure big cat was first established apparently by experiments have Bronx Zoo in New York in two thousand three\nThe key ingredient here's why is it a synthetic version of the mosque sit greeted by the civic maybe peck yeah this is a small nocturnal mammal who's glandular liquid his prize for its powerful aroma\nTo the base of the cologne is something that might actually attracted tiger because they think it's a little civic or whatever it's called\nIt's Kevin Kline obsession yes uh-huh yeah you know some people that saying would use it to attract cougars and the early nineties [laughter] it's been pretty effective [laughter] so I could see where this work\nWere you an obsession by Calvin Klein guy a it was bought for me as a gift yes but you you or it probably yes I did and when ... when that ran out did you go to the brute\nHow Senator Feinstein this and then\nYou leave your documents [laughter] [noise]\n[noise] this has been going on for a few years why am I still laughing why is that still so amusing to me why am I Alone ear and to paint the picture he's kind of turning around like what happened in the hearing\nOr the Gavin hearings Dianne Feinstein was asked by John Cornyn did somebody from your staff leak this and she goes I I don't I don't know and she's looking back at our staffers and their staffers are saying no remember di fire we we we said we didn't leak anything right of course you are [laughter]\n\nYou\nHe just said no we didn't [laughter]\n\nAnd I think did you find the can you believe [laughter]\nCake already happened from the left\nJ responsible these people saying lock her up lock her up\nThis is ridiculous I'm the president should be encouraging miss but don't you dare call people who harass public visuals are at a restaurant do you call them up there they're not a mob you can't do that but that's that people are but it's totally a responsible for lock her up chants cabin\nOkay if you don't call those people that you know stop cars and traffic an angry mob what do you call them ...\nPeaceful protesters right is that still the line there they're warriors for social justice or that's what they are okay you know try to find a nice story every once in a while yeah Clinton was about oh I get\nThis is pretty cool it's sad okay do you there's first of all the news is sad but the way people respond is where it's more uplifting\nOkay so the way the story starts is with the Fifteen year old kid in Chicago Josh banger\nRecently noticed division in his eyes a little blurry just starting need glasses but then he was diagnosed with something called leaders hereditary optic neuropathy guy who's going blind nothing can be done about it and no cure for that no surgery nothing\nAnd he could lose vision by the end of the year\nAnd so obviously kids devastated you understand yeah um but it's the story goes he's starting to come to terms with it\nSays his faith has been a huge help and now he's on a mission to see if he can see as much as possible while he's still can\nAnd so it was sort of a bucket list like okay we want to go to Niagara Falls um want to go to an NBA game mhm things like that\nAnd now hundreds of random people on line or making it happen stepping up donating so far over thirty seven thousand dollars to help them see whatever you want to see while he can still see man that's awesome um\nDid you eat the other thing it's weird man you just don't know how much time he's going to have to see this stuff I'm being front row seats to a ball game last week you have to water ski for the first time ah this past friday flew to California go see the mountains in the ocean\nAnd all the money is going toward medical expenses and research and his bucket list so let's go fund me and you just search help Josh see his bucket list\nThat's a great story man I Know some people give to Michael Cohen's go fund me\n[laughter] right [noise]\n[noise] ... yeah this seems like a pretty good thing to manage a good thing and you know what I I was thinking about this um 'cause I've seen a lot more of\nThese are the take of the idea of the civil war coming back like a civil war part two in the United states 'cause everybody at each other's throats right you get a hearing that over and over again and certainly we live in times where politics can be testy and toxic and all of the\nAbove but man it's important to talk about stories like these because most people\nAmerica are not totally caught up in the political news cycle and they're not thinking that the world is coming to an end most people are are actually paying attention to stories like that and helping out one another there are all good people there are people doing great things in this country\nRegardless of who's president regardless of who has control of Congress or your local city council or whatever a lot of people go to work every day very busy\nRegardless of who's president regardless of who has control of Congress or your local city council or whatever\nA lot of people go to work every day very busy they're taking care of their family I mean we talked about this so many times and I get the feeling again after these midterms you're going to have media especially on the east coast saying we got to get out of a bubble\nLike they did a couple of years ago because you really don't have your finger on the pulse of just regular everyday people I think you're right about that here's a question for you think of this you are not performing well at work okay All right and one of your boss who says you know\nI think what you need to do is stop having sex okay so you can get your focus okay here's right now the focus isn't there how do you react to that your boss telling you that we go to a guy named Gary ... job\nHe's a former Philadelphia Eagles linebacker commentator not really a boss you saying the eagles are often it's disappointing starts so far\nHe thinks she knows why they're getting busy too much so I I go to drastic measures here go I'll just like in played the clip for ya okay go for it because you know you serious they're gonna have to stop doing\nDrastic measures\nThink that need to go out to pass or\nNot hold fast ... need to be cut off from somebody's [laughter] no\nCut off from the goodies [laughter]\nThat's my favorite you

W. dot com\nOur guest is David ... he's the president of the Wisconsin fair trade a coalition\nAnd David you're telling us about some of the good some of the bad but mostly bad\nIn the new U.S M. C. A. or which is the United states Mexican Canadian agreement\nIn Canada or didn't almost make this a ... didn't they and they came late to and I don't know what was the hang up do you know\n[noise] well uh this wouldn't get us a take too long [laughter]\nOf it has to do with the American demand that can or do open up their receptor for more uh import and the ...\nA lot of it had to do with the American demand that Canada open up their receptors for more uh imports\nAnd the reality is that any significance to tie the increase in our exports to Canada would have decimated cause a Canadian dairy industry\nAnd as a result a lot of their rural economy now there was a concession that was made this going to be hard for dairy farmers who Canada to take\nBut uh that was what was holding up the deal and let me mention too that\nYou know a trumpet saying oh this is going to be great for American dairy farmers market or saying oh yeah our family dairy farmers are going to be able to export all us more milk or in Canada or that's bullshit I'm the I'm ... so we can\nExport is a minimal in terms of solving our over production problems of milk and milk products in a in the United states and especially in Wisconsin so this is the solution at all\nRight well you were telling us about some of the good that you have to admit isn't here but a lot of the bad and even with a good mood comes a ... uh where where do we leave off what else is in this thing\nWell let's see there's one thing real quick that is good and that is that uh they increase the percentage a of labor that has to be from the United states Mexico or Canada in cars they go across any of the borders\nSo they increase the percentage was sixty two Seventy five plus they said\nThat has the least forty percent off the value of the car has to be made by workers that are making at least sixteen dollars an hour so that is if this works out right and some people say a woman but if this works out for ice that should help ah Americans in the\nAutomotive vans or auto supply chain industries bombs so that you know that appears to be a good thing now one in a real problem areas is the labor environmental standards area\nUh first of all as far as the environmental standards are concerned they're basically the same as they were before and there's no enforcement mentioned at all so to me is that they're useless 'em\nAnd all linked is with the labor standards because they all let's see both sides of the same effect um the labor standards are better because they have more protections for Mexicans to form unions and most of their unions today are basically company unions\nAnd the workers have no control over those you said all now the\nProblem there is that while what's on paper is good once again there's nothing of his Portsmouth so if there's no effective enforcement then it's totally reading\nBut it means that we need to pay a lot of attention to this because\nThe lower the labor and environmental conditions are in Mexico for more incentive there is for American companies to move their production to Mexico\nTo exploit that cheap labor dumped their toxins you know in the water and the land a which has a lot cheaper than they can do hear a and so that means they're going to move production more protection a\nTo Mexico so are we in America have ah any interest in a very strong alliance\nWith Mexican workers and raising their wages and being able to enforce them cause the more that we can get\nThe cost of production and kick in Mexico\nUp to the level of the United states and Canada for more we're going to be competing on a level playing field and the more we're going to be able to keep production in the United states and\nIt's obviously going to help Mexican workers as well so just keep that in mind that the the alliance with Mexican workers is\nAh extremely important for us in making some a real improvements here\n[noise] so you want to go to a couple of the really bad\nThen you gotta learn we got to find out sometime I as we know him\nWell okay here we go I'm One of the most outrageous things is um I ... are you concerned about the increasing cost of of pharmaceuticals of medical drugs absolutely\nWell you just lost because of this goes through a it's going to lengthen the passes for all of these new biologic crops and they a lot of these are the ones you see advertised on TV\nThey're they tend to be very expensive currently they have a protective passes for five years and in this new NAFTA their patterns\nOr any generics could be introduced which means that we're going to have much higher prices for these drugs are a much\nLonger time and that's going to drive up the cost of drugs and that is one of the last things we need in terms of trying to you know control even roll back the cost\nOf medical care that's operations and again that's a you know it's a gift from Trump to his friends and the pharmaceutical industry\nOh wait a minute but he said he was going to bring your price prices down under his presidency he promised\nYeah right\nHere said broke his promise ... told me once [laughter] All right well we got a little time left what else is bad news deal\nOK well a lot of things it's bad there is that um this is Ben in the old and that fits in our other agreements it's totally crazy a and that is that we have laws on the books\nWhich require the government ah and in some cases at all levels you know state and local to a government when they\nBuy things it has to be unless you know you can't get it in the United states but it has to be purchased a and made in the United states\nSo that's important because that's our tax dollars right there are being spent but all of these\nTrade agreements have a waiver of that requirement saying that you know in the case of the countries that are involved in these trade agreements\nThat is suspended and uh you know any company from any country can come in and has bid on these government contracts there is no preference given\nTo American workers that are American companies\nSell their go our tax dollars um you know the lowest bidder from whatever country\nAnd this is a big issue with singer ... on this\nShe does she does and she's got actually some bipartisan support for that but whether it goes through is very uncertain because a Trump is probably going to start having his people may cause this\nIt goes through is very uncertain because Trump is probably going to start evidence people make all the you know don't support that we don't want to do that a and besides you know if\nThis after goes through the way it's drafted a wouldn't make any difference anyway because it would override a senator Waltons bill\nAll right so what it had all these changes you've made can he just do them a a ... is that the way it works or does this eventually have to go to the Congress for a vote\nIt does have to go through Congress luckily I'm and there are not too many out there are some opportunities\nTo make changes for the final and that's what we have to organize around right now and you know especially when I was talking about in terms of labor environmental standards\nThat is weird there are players icy will\nTip the bad like right after they just miss you know they hit a foul ball straight back they they just missed it and they can smell the wood burning but he licks is that I don't know why\nUm it reminds me of in the playoffs in the playoffs last year I forgot what the player was but he kept looking face one of his just weird\nOkay I thought there was a reason given at some point but apparently not maybe a you know during the series one will come out but\nAll right so this guy is kind of a bad boy I guess we could say and I like the bad boys ... they're fun to heat and they got a personality that just makes it interesting I remember as a kid I heated Reggie Jackson or because he was good and he was kind of a flamboyant or you know the way he ... a man just\nHow you swing is like none other but when you were a kid when what player did you have to\nI Would say a Reggie was one of them because he will always be the first yeah um [noise] for some reason I I guess the Georgia bred for a while\nHe was really good yeah and then you learn to appreciate how good these guys are later but when you're a fan and that guy with the like in two thousand eleven any brewers fan absolutely hated the would preserve the\nCar though he just kept\nHim and he's done it more since he's moved around the pirates and all over the place and now he's with the Dodgers and you've got to be facing the birds and the the a lot of people haven't forgotten that it wasn't over Portugal's meeting the wars in two thousand ... with the with three\nUh-huh All right so this week is easy a good player were mentioning all these players they're actually really good what'd you say he's really good player\nHe's got a lot of potential but he has a couple of years ago the ... girl that's right that fell through with the last minute and I think probably\nThe problem here kind of like Carlos Gomez plays for the first really a lot of the holy ... fans and I think we would probably be the same thing Niger Oregon another one guy when he does it work I Love him\nWhen he's out of the other team you hate him but he\nGets his rookie year he burst onto the scene and everybody thought this was going to be a superstar in the end and really lived up to it\nAnd right now the Dodgers that such a loaded I'll feel that a lot of times in that camp\nAre ... they have a four or five or six starting caliber outfielders so at some point maybe get straight is I don't think it would be the first ever know how\nYou never know I mean I saw yesterday I think it was while they're playing it yesterday was a him in the locker room after a meeting the\nThe Braves and the headline says that he uh he predicts said he's the Dodgers are going to win against the
