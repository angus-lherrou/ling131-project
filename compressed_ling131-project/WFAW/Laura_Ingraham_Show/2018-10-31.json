are\nYeah ... eggs a big deal in\nHalloween reference all over the place [noise] um it was making Kelly talking about Halloween costumes that got her fired from the gig\nWhat really it was you know because the ratings and no one lighter thrive that's the real ... the real story but they said it was all about these unforgivable blackface comments I even saw Geraldo Rivera\nYou said it was horrifying what she said horrifying yeah again just for reference\n[laughter] actually do get in trouble if you are a white person I find time for a black or white [laughter]\nThat was okay as long as you address character feels like that and then you should say it and have a fair shake wining they mentioned the okay\nThat was a big part of it right [noise] okay [noise] and we know that well Jimmy

Susan Boyle\nNone of that horrifying saying it was okay when I was a kid when the movie soul man\nWas out that if if he is just horrifying yeah so they asked people hey what do you think about NBC canceling Megan Kelly today\nAnd this is what they found that well six percent of people said her comments gave them a much more favorable view of her\nForty eight percent said it made no difference either way I'm twenty nine percent said do somewhat less favorable after what she said [noise]\nAnd then well does the cancellation of the program seem right\nI'm\nForty five percent said canceling would be too harsh a consequence for comments twenty six percent felt it would be the appropriate consequences for her comments most people like no it ... punishment doesn't fit the crime\nThere yeah I've asked the question before what's the point demanding an apology if you're not prepared to accept it and in the case of begging Kelly if you don't like what she said if he thought it was so offensive then I think it seemed like she was a able to receive that criticism and process that criticism and came out and apologized\nYes and\nI don't know what else do you expect from her except to be fired and she's going to walk away with millions of dollars either way I'm not weeping for Megan Kelly and you're right\nAnd I don't know what else do you expect from er except to be fired and she's going to walk away of millions of dollars either way I'm not weeping for Megan Kelly and you're right NBC found this has been very convenient opportunity to get rid of her\nOh my gosh yes that's what it comes down to on Sunday night show that she tried to do up against sixty minutes we ... are just\nTerrible is a failure yes no doubt NBC Megan Kelly today didn't work it just she was never going to work in that in that role no she's not a mid morning most of the type of woman no\nDoubt about that but yeah I think most people say well wait a minute you're what really was the unforgivable sin that she committed just in\nThe bars what she said she was in the headline what she was defending it right and she was more asking a question or\nSo again that whole apology to the whole tearful thing yeah\nI mean a lot of people are like God she over did it with the apology you remember what the take was from her today show Carlos ... that\nDidn't come off well right wasn't enough give me a

yeah um now I thought this was interesting if I were to ask either of you guys\nAre millennials versus\nOlder Americans people over the age of let's say over the age of fifty older older than millennials as what I meant by that Jay ... well what are you gonna do like I say people over fifty people under fifty who would prefer Oprah Winfrey who would prefer Tom Hanks what would your guess

got better for dumb hang says it went on beat out Oprah every time now people under fifty basically Eighteen to forty nine\nOr all put Oprah AS number one here's the thing about Tom Hanks okay what are you know about Tom Hanks political views\n[noise] I don't know anything about Tom Hanks political views Scott\nOr you know and right but I don't know what I Would assume he's one of the Hollywood bunch pack but you really don't know but I don't know I don't know much about Tom Hanks personally\nThat's why you get so many votes got a successful marriage right has been married to read a Wilson forever yeah he comes on like a nice guy at the Jimmy Stewart of his generation right but that's the thing where we're at right now\nThere could be a lot of nice guys but when you know their political views then it all changes\nHave you talked about it before and I mean he donated to Obama's campaign he he endorsed Obama in ... wait\nHe supports a lot of liberal causes but you're right I mean he's not one of the guys he's not the Chelsea Handler type or what where they're out front and center all the time talking about politics right\nRoad would be All right and you say it would be Tom Hanks in Wilson whenever volleyball is the vice presidential with the little face painted on it\nSo then I got a call from them and we don't have to worry about money no no\nRight into the horse ...\nNot him for president yes I'm In one other thing for you at least for right now Scott [noise] uh David brought this story up I'll let him deliberate because all he can choose the words he's going to use\nYeah this is a crazy story out of Colorado ... doctor in Colorado\nHas a twisted sense of humor and somehow is allowed to keep practicing medicine after playing a joke on someone in his care he's not a general practitioner he's he is a gynecologist then he played a prank on somebody who gonna colleges slashed prank go Dr Barry king was working in Mesa County is a gynecologist and last year a woman who worked for him\nAsked him to check on an issue that she was having her own doctor just retired now she is a cancer survivor and she was worried about something and come back ...\nSo he agreed to sign all yeah it's it's a little bit weird because we know each other but we'll do our yeah I'll do it of course I Will go after the exam he says hey when you get home and I I Want you to have your husband take a look at it\nWhich that's weird right because he's not a doctor mhm later she's using the restroom and she notices the toilet paper and turn purple ... and it turns out it it was the type of medical die that's no longer used and she thought that was weird to why they use that die on me\nThe next day at work that Dr was Getty she says and he kept laughing and then he told her well [laughter] it was a joke for your husband died died it purple\nDied it oh benefit gosh\nSee\nI have a good idea [laughter]\nHere to the other way down here and you\nGo ahead David [noise]\nSo the dog was that she would go home and\nSleep with her husband and her husband was the hit list or an issue would be perfect [laughter] first of all yes dog walking around the office was joking with other employees telling them what he did [noise]\nHe's bragging about this because you won't believe what I did her [laughter]\nSo they go to\nCourt and they all live oh yeah just wound up getting a plea

R. A. indicates a concern\nAbout substance abuse people will be reviewed or referred for treatment but won't have to comply to be eligible for Medicaid\nIn response to concerns identified by the federal

Medicare and Medicaid services responses to questions on the age are able ... ... in a referral for treatment as applicable\nBut not impact the applicants medicate ... ability of the changes also include full coverage residential treatment of a substance use disorder for anyone on Medicaid\nOur work requirement applies to able bodied childless adults ages Nineteen forty nine if they don't work or\nEngage in related activities for forty eight months they'll lose coverage for six months after which they can reapply Wisconsin is a former state to have a Medicaid work requirement approved\nJoining Indiana Arkansas and New Hampshire Wisconsin submitted its request for the changes in June of twenty Seventeen the changes many of them approved by the state legislature in twenty Fifteen cannot start for another year\nHealth care advocates have opposed the changes saying they'll make it more difficult for the poorest residents to maintain health coverage that could help them stay healthy and employed\nMight bear research and program coordinator for the community advocates public policy Institute in Milwaukee called the timing of the approval less than a week\nFor the election brazen ooh that's a powerful word\nGovernor Walker and Donald Trump or putting barriers between low income Wisconsin nights and life saving health care to score political points bears said Walker's office didn't immediately respond to requests for comment in a statement the governor said the changes will encourage more people to work\nAnd this is what he said in a statement with more people working in Wisconsin than ever before we can't afford to have any one on the sidelines we'd need every one in the game Walker said we want to remove barriers to work\nAnd make it easier to get a job while making public making sure public assistance is available for those who truly need it\nAnd they go on that that one is a listed is breaking news by the Wisconsin state journal All right dad taking a look at the Marquette or law school Paul they are new and here's the headline in it and this comes from the actual\nNew Marquette law school poll finds Walker ... tied in Wisconsin's race for governor well you know what that means in a tie they both are going to be governor no that's not how it works\nBut ah so you means you've got to look at other places to figure out who's going to win\nAnd\nIt's a coin flip at this point and that's why earlier I said it's going to come down to voter turnout and of course that has a lot to do with it anyway but this is where you got to go on and there are a few things any here that I think at least one or that give\nGovernor Walker the edge you'll get to that in a minute but a new Marquette law school pool of Wisconsin voters finds a tie in the states race for governor with incumbent Republican Scott Walker and Democrat challenger Tony Evers each receiving forty seven percent support among\nAmong likely voters libertarian candidate Phil Anderson hanging tough with his three percent and only one percent say they lack of preference\nOr do not lean to a candidate I Want to meet those people and I think by many 'cause there's only one percent\nYou'd be able to prescribe Governor Walker or will you vote for Twenty years\n[noise] not sure OK okay\nPercent declined to respond and the question as well that I get a little bit more ... how hot and heavy and enough and they don't they don't answer likely voters are defined as those who say they are certain to vote in the November ... election\nAnd the most recent Marquette law school poll conducted October third through the seventh Walker was supported by forty seven percent\n... forty six percent and Anderson by five percent oh he's dropped off a little bit among likely voters in the race for Wisconsin's US Senate seat democratic incumbent Tammy Baldwin leads among likely voters with fifty four percent supporting her\nWhile forty three percent\nThat one stay in pretty much the same forty three percent support Republican challenger Leah Vukmir only two percent say they lack of preference or do not lean toward a candidate and one percent did not respond\nIn early October Baldwin was supported by fifty three percent and book nearby forty three percent in the race for Wisconsin attorney general\nIncumbent Brad ... is the choice of forty seven percent and Democrat Josh call is the choice of forty five percent of ...\nForty seven percent and Democrat Josh call is the choice of forty five percent of likely voters seven percent lack of preference in this\nRace so that grows a little more and that's because there's this one started out with the people just didn't know either guy even within the incumbent being in the race they are it still was that way so seven percent\nLack of preference in this race and two percent did not respond in the early October Paul ... held forty seven percent call forty three percent of likely voters among all registered voters survey\nSurveyed in the poll Walker receives forty seven percent in in the race for governor Uber's receiving forty four percent and Anderson at five percent\nNow on clarify that's all registered voters not likely voters so in that category he'll say it again Walker receives forty seven percent\nOkay and uh I guess we should mention reliever up pictures Syria is also a elected for a free agency more chance he's pretty much gone right\nI Would think so yeah he didn't he didn't do a lot\nUm somebody will find him for four five six seven million a year maybe there'd be the ... but they have a lot of young arms maybe they'd rather just try one of those guys\nAre right and then uh the brewers are exercised a a\nOver a three million dollar option on all star right hander ... Jeremy Jeffress would have been eligible for salary arbitration\nIf he had been declined so ah it it is that a good thing\nAbsolutely that's a steel for the first to get an all star for three million per you know one year I I don't know what\nWould have happened in arbitration but I think he'd get a lot more than that um I don't know how I'm happy that will make him as a player but in bargaining position the strongest right now after his postseason failures are so\nHe fits right another piece in the puzzle right there the back into the open it is with the animator and all that's in pretty good shape and it looks like\nBurns and what drove and maybe Peralta will be starters facts here so they still have some competition there to set them up but as long as they're healthy that's as good a trio is any in baseball\nOkay and the reason it put it that way is that a good thing 'cause oh man that you mentioned his performance in the post season and a lot of people attacked him\nOr you know Indian blamed him for some of the things that happened when it came to losing games I think it was a little unfair myself and you're right or he brought them to the dance he's a big part of why they got their right well\nHe he was a huge part of it and if you look at other pitchers ah how about ... kimbrell the red Sox closer who was awful for much of the postseason um what is considered one of the best player in baseball\nUh they're not just going to suddenly get up on them because of what happened in the postseason quake Kirsch ... pitch in the proceedings of the way he normally does in the regular season but the Dodgers are not going to turn down the chance to resign him for thirty plus million dollars so\nJeffress is definitely a steel and there is somebody they believe in\nOkay and uh just to kind of my peers from other um names that have been acquired by the ... basically for this year in the run they made a ...\nI Would think so I Know he really liked Milwaukee but\nThe price for him would probably be out of their range I'm guessing a ... you know with all of these things it all depends on the market and if there is more than one key interest is the price goes up so I think it getting really cheap\nThey have so many other options I don't think they do it\nOkay and then a a Curtis Granderson I'm On the uh you know the end of his career is that's in could that happen\nI don't think he'd be back he's another guy who like to hear from Chicago great guy a future ahead of the players association there wants to be really intelligent man he he has a lot of options beyond baseball or even end up retiring after this year\nAnd then let's go back quickly too I weighed my only a year that there was a really good picture we discuss this too he's the one that really looks like harkens back to the uh eighty two breweries these kind of grow up looking long here I like it uh but uh what are the chances that he will remain\nIs the one that really looks like harkens back to the eighty to ... kind of grow up looking long here I like it uh but uh what are the chances that he will remain\nA he also like to hear a he's not a big city guy\nHe has a little bit of bargaining power because of the way he pitch\nAnd you have to remember that beginning of the year he was in the minor minor on an injury rehab he when he was assigned to the birds\nIt was a nun irritate contract and he got hurt late spring training and they liked him enough that they kept him around he agreed to go to the miners came up got hurt again came back and was like a late fee and traded dish they really like what he brings to the table but what price you\nKnow they're they're probably going to have to pay\nFor a free agent starting pitcher whether it's one of their own or somebody else out there but he's seen as the most likely to resign ...\nOkay so what will a lot of this uh begin to move around will continue to do so or is there a time or at least we'll get together and then that's their hot spot when all this happens\nAnd it kind of crime down for a little bit they you know the MVP and all the other or\nComing up with a couple of weeks and then after that\nEarly December I Believe in the winter and that's where traditionally some of that stuff heats up the last couple of years it has much I'm trying to think when shots scenes signed it was I Believe\nLate January or mid January I Know they signed a cane and treated for yellow turn the thing a\nLike a couple of nights before the diamond dinner which are there the Packers are the brewers are forget what they call it now that we're the fans come in and they get to see all the players and get autograph um\nThat is right before spring training so we're talking about all this stuff could happen to late January early February\nOkay and then he was the last question about the brewers but the brewers looking for a specific player or a position that they would like to have it they feel is missing a puzzle piece a that's out there\nWell they say they're happy with catching but I don't think they are I I think if anything is going to get upgraded that would be the ... the catcher with the Miami while in the real noodle who everybody would like him\nHe would cost more than ... in a trade and I can't imagine that the modeling would want to come back to the earth say hey you really got the better of us on the straight\nLet's do it again [laughter]\nAnd there are other teams that want him to so I don't think he is going to be the guy that they go get a but there are other catchers out there uh\nThe name you know money around to all come up with the Dodgers catcher in the ... the ... and we saw him commit numerous errors against a bird is defenses are strong but he I think it's a switch jittery it over twenty so that could be a possibility\nOkay oh you you see we might get a Dodger and really you know\n[laughter] All right we're going to talk Packers will do that next stick with us\nYou're listening to start in the middle way to Andy Jordans then\nWe'll be right back nine forty W W nine forty W.
