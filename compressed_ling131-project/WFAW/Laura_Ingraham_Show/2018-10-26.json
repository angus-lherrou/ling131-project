I you know I've tried to stop watching it I might be able news is I have but I Want I'm fascinated by this case by this exact salary and really also how the media have been covering it All right\nSo did you did your head almost explode when you saw this uh yes it did okay\nNo one's blaming the president and the president\nIt did to your head almost explode when you saw this uh yes it did okay\nNo one's blaming the president and they were winning the president [noise] um but the president wants to make this about him\nOkay okay and so do you watch your OWN Network man's set aside for a minute that at that exact moment the headline on the bottom of the screen read quote Trump has no plans to claim any personal responsibility for inciting serial bomber\nAs he was saying that his OWN Network at a headline that says I Know yeah he he inside of these people or this person\nAnd then you wonder who could possibly be blaming the president for this John King\nWell yesterday it seemed like it was any sort of angle of shot they could take that we're going to take goes the other one was Trump has not reached out to any of the ex presidents that were targeted by this person [noise] right\nSo what what does that mean\nIt's like here is just something else about this president and that's what it is you know daily the upgraded his phone last week too so there's some transitional issues with the numbers\nBut this but went on with John\nKing did what no well I I was just going to answer his question when he says no one here is blaming CNN or he's blaming Donald Trump for those who could possibly be blaming CNN's been all over this for the last three days of Donald Trump's fault I'm\nGoing to see this outside of the context that residents [laughter] ...\nThe president and his allies need to dial down political rhetoric\nIs clear reflection on some of the atmosphere that we are living at\nThese are people and organizations that President Trump continually it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed\nOkay [noise]\nI forget what day it was and I'm not going to tell you I Am always the voice of reason\nThat's not it but the other day\nJust mentioning you know we can all look at ourselves everyone has a role in this\nI mean how do we know that families are broken up about politics over the last few years because of the stories because of what people post on social media and all of the fighting that goes on social media\nAnd yet oh it's it's solely trumped it's got to you know take this rhetoric way down everybody's got to look at themselves individually and then there's an organization like CNN\nYou know are we helping or we hurting as far as bringing people together because what is your real goal\nIs the ratings or is it bringing the country together its rating ... you're not fooling anybody with that so look at yourself in the mirror before you just blame one\nPerson or just one party I mean the Republicans they got to tell them this down I\nMean there's Maxine Waters there's Hillary Clinton uh there's Eric Holder there I mean it's one after another after another ball and not to mention panel is on cable news every single day somewhere\nCalling Donald Trump Hitler going Trump supporters stupid\nSaying that they don't deserve to vote talking about how they don't know anything about anything that's going on in this country right here not nobody's uniting anybody did you see all the a mega ... was wearing right\nExact right on the ice and in that in that case when you have the antifa conversation guys like ... say they're just misunderstood right exactly they're not a mob just people protesting peacefully\nOkay somewhat switching\nGears on this what can I just real\nQuick add something yes or just another one liner about the van yes covered in Trump's wagon all both he and Bremmer with the Eurasia Group manifest destiny\nOf funny you forgot you shouldn't take the president's name and van\nYou know the other thing I Know you saw the one sticker on the van it's just CNN sucks [laughter] yeah [laughter] well and see an inch of stops talking so much really yet I don't want that says that are right now I asked fantastic yes well I mean I'm not going to raise the pipe bomber\nVan Gogh what's what's your memory message of the snicker is fan [laughter] so basically you\nKnow our job to having a romance novel [laughter] what romance of each\nOther she want to reach out to I mean yeah say our junior hey man I denounce everything but once you get that CNN sucks that pretty cool I lowered and\nAs we look at the hot topic for that one as we look at all of us individually how we need to tone down their rhetoric and I agree ... I just want that CNN sucks [laughter] I didn't agree to that you did I Know okay\nI Know well the weird thing is and I know that it's been reported that it's just it almost sounds like it's all bumper\nAnd I appreciate the time you've given me and\nBoy one on one day one of the ... going to be standing it could be three or four of you actually\nHave no doubt who who in this room who in this room wants to be president some\n[laughter]\nHas the president and again David she was speaking to young black leaders today already planned it to be young black leadership summit that's happening at the White House today and of course there was a lot to talk about a starting right out of the game because of the suspect in the bombings or attempted bombings\nWho'd been brought into custody today yeah well I mean\nShe said the right things there's no doubt about that despicable there's no place for it well you know the one thing that he's going to get bank for right\nWhat's that he didn't mention the victims I guarantee you know ... of course before the show is over will have audio of that that he should have mentioned every single one by name but he should have mentioned all of them by name and he should've taken responsibility for it even though he can't Manny\nEvery nut job in America anymore than Bernie Sanders couldn't ... job from a well he was from the St Louis area right yes on the Illinois side of the rare but um yeah you can't you can't police every body or you can't control every nut job out there and by the looks of this guy's van\nHe's not well\nYes we we knew he was not just didn't know which side of the political aisle he was on um maybe if you don't want to maybe Trump should have called them up by their nicknames\n[laughter] when I first heard Hilary [laughter] toned down the rhetoric [laughter]\nOh gosh you know what I you know the other take that I'm waiting on this is how cynical you can get but I'll bet you what happens\nHe's talking to the young black leadership right saying hey moral view maybe three or four of you got to be up here some day not if he has anything to do about it All right I'm credibly races president tried to take Obama or the way he treated Obama I mean that that's going to\nTake that take has already been there by the way about the young black leadership summit that he's having today\nBut you're just using them as as props oh my [laughter] that's what I mean it's not he didn't individually organized this he says yeah what you want to come and meet the president come meet the president would love to have you would love to talk to you and all that but [noise] okay neither here\nNor there today or he also said we must never allow political violence to happen our\nCountry it's got to stop it now that would be about peace loving harmony even got to unify but yes that will be taken to task no matter what we said is there anything seriously that he could have said today that would not get absolutely criticized you know the answer no\nNo he said all the right words but even when he said all the right words earlier this week what was one of the big takes you had initially even on a place like CNN or was he did the very bare minimum do catch the criticism and you you you know you're expecting at all of that\nI think I'm more interested in finding out more about the suspects either say our junior or what exactly prompted them to do this why you know when did he start planning this what's his connection to the Russians [laughter]\nWell oh I think we have audio of this by the way\nYes Heidi that's what I Want to know what his connection is where the Russians construct figured it out check on him as a yeah I was on MSNBC\nSleepy eye is Chuck Todd\nGo wow it was they were talking about who could possibly be behind this yeah you know is this a left wing or person trying to paint it on a right wing person is a right wing person trying to put it on the left wing person and Chuck actually throws out maybe it's the Russian\nI I have this fear that it could be some Russian operation to and designed to do what's happening now more of this you know I think we in so in some ways we shouldn't allow um I'm getting into it ...\nIt is dividing is right it could be the Russian writer for that he blamed cling on [laughter] gosh it was it was funny yesterday watch on everybody go down the rabbit hole of this yeah because and I want to I took a note of this\nI didn't grab the audio in this particular case but there was a panel discussion going on on one of the cable news networks and they were ruined out entirely that this could be a left wing nut job trying to make it look like a right wing nut job they said that take is ridiculous it's not possible even though experts\nHave said no that is possible doesn't look like that's the case now but the possible um\nAnd then they went on to say it could be a right wing nut job making it looked like a left wing nut job was trying to frame of right wing nut job like that and made our sense because there are so desperate and Chuck Todd I hear worries if the Russians are like going back to what a time to be alive [laughter]\nI\nI Want to say this is [laughter] that wild that does sound ridiculous OK [laughter] no\nI Can't [laughter]\nShocking away but I don't know that I can because that's a premeditated take you know what I mean I Know\nThat's one that's recorded right it's not like that guy is doing a live show like we're doing and you're getting information and reacting to write because as that happens you're going through what goes through your mind and that first day as you're saying\nI remember the first time I said to you David [noise] is it weird that none of these have gone off you know there's like at the time there was like seven is this guy that bad\nAnd when that's fresh it's almost like a tank that sounds a little outrageous now until we talked to a guy like we did yesterday Clint Van Zandt it was an FBI profile or he's a pro and says this guy must be they're terrible for he's just trying to scare people then you're like OK\nThat take is not that crazy\nI don't know if there's anyone else saying well could have been some from another country or is it just won't we originally thought this person is that stupid yes\nAnd that's what it looks like you're getting any alarm clocks inside there too as information is coming out yeah arrested ten times once in two thousand two for making a bomb threat\nSo he is just that bad it it appears that it could be he's just that bad and ... and then I Want to switch gears for a second OK okay and I know the president said hey\nHats off to every one of the law enforcement found him so quickly\nOkay and I know the president said hey hats off to every one of the law enforcement found him so quickly\nIs it wrong ... fan or talking about packages in the mail they were mailed from South Florida\nAre you surprised it took this long because you would have known day one where that package came from right wouldn't you know through the mail where it originated\nYeah I suppose I I see I might sell something on email I send it in the mail right there is a receipt we know where it was sent there is a receipt of it well I Know and I I took the opposite end instead and I can't believe they got it as quickly\nI thought it was all together fairly quickly I mean given how bad this guy apparently wasn't he's driving around in a van that's basically a giant billboard saying I'm the guy\nUm and the fact that they they they found it pretty quickly I thought OK stars on the only one I got out a nationwide surged to in some regard you're you're wondering okay a lot of these bombs wound up in the New York area are these get right down the pipe bombs wound up in the New York area so maybe it's in the New York area where this guy is from\n... from the pictures I or is any postage anything by those packages right so that's when the thought was oh man or these hand delivered yeah how did\nThis happen so there's a lot of it the army will make sense that\nHasn't totally made such yet and I guess more than we are glad that they got the guy and I have is did he get mail in ballot in in time before they arrested him [noise]\nYou know [laughter] I'm guessing he probably did fury I don't know of\nThat will be something that we make sure to ask any authorities that we may talking to a later on I don't want to be taking a bomb and just drop that off to\nHere's my one of the same time as I said it's a mess I'm here representing Debbie Wasserman Schultz said either return addresses a right and the author and with three ... yeah [laughter] okay All right\nSo there's many more angles to go through with this whole thing as news is still coming out getting the guy's name a Caesar\nSay I can junior and also go over what the president had to say and reactions so far [noise] fish is the Mark Twain man came show thankfully in

a buddy Ryan who you're talking about movies there's nothing really great bottoming out and there's it's a breaking news city we don't want to get his buddy what does it mean Rhapsody you're nervous I'm very nervous\nMore on that later he ... from the failing New York times we're learning more about\nThe suspect that's been taken into custody Caesar say our junior gates\nFailing New York times we're learning more about this suspect that's been taken into custody Cesar ... junior\nGay there's all this stuff that we've talked about before them this lengthy criminal history dating back to Nineteen Ninety One includes a felony theft drug and fraud charges are accused of threatening to use a bomb all this stuff is Lazarus was in two thousand Fifteen\nIt goes on to say in this little piece\nUm that the white van reminded a guy by the name of David ... along with his girlfriend a of a van ... park in the parking lot of a local strip mall\nDown where they lived in Florida right\nAnd notice all the stickers\nAnd so I can say is struck me because of the crazy conspiracy stickers covering the windows it was unsettling and it almost seemed to be occupied sometimes the door would be a jar or a window would be open which indicated me that somebody was living in the van like I never wanted to get too close\nSaid I saw the owner at least once and so\nHe shared a cell phone picture he took the van and this was December thirty first last year it's like so that he sees the band of Asia like oh my gosh that's him I think that's that's the same band so that was just shared out there and kept it was New Year's eve yeah\n... van with Iraq and I'm sure [laughter] [noise]\nA big party going on everybody yeah\nI'm so we know it's not job we don't know did he want to have these bombs and detonate was he just trying to scare people\nYeah well I've seen some of the reaction uh to looking now that more images of these pipe bombs have come out either really he was really really bad world's worst bomb maker or he never intended for them to go off\nUm there was one reaction from somebody used to disarm bombs for a living in the military okay who said something like this is what this is how someone who doesn't know how to build a pipe bomb would build a pipe bomb so it could be this guy's just kind of an idiot because we know he was riding riding around in the ...\nAh with all the crazy stickers that we're all over it right basically a big sign saying hey cops look at me I'm the guy you're looking for\nAnd he is being dubbed the mega bomber okay yeah are you serious yes oh my gosh yes\nBecause he there's pictures of him up there with the make America great again hat song the man so some are calling him the ...\nAs well and I I I like the Trump and a lot of other people have come out and said law enforcement has obviously done a great job getting this guy so quickly and what was a nationwide manhunt yeah and Trump addressed that today as well uh when he was talking to the young black leadership summit\nThese people that work so hard and to have done it so quickly it's looking like a a looking [laughter] it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done incredible incredible job but I Want to congratulate\nGay\nMan I don't want to make it seem like man these guys weren't doing their jobs whining thanks so long it's a question I have if he's that bad and wouldn't you think you'd be caught like really quick [noise] then I'm\nAlone on an island with that kind of our because I'm I was when I walked in today I was like well they already got him I\nThink my question is more about the postage and knowing where it came from early on that's what I don't understand like it came out yesterday man they're looking at South Florida from the first package wouldn't they know where it came from that's my bigger question right\nSo you know all of this stuff is going to come out there are some other stories that are getting attention obviously migrate caravan ...\nContinues to get a whole lot of coverage\nBut what's going to end up happening with that because you hear reports it's growing and then you hear well it's it's actually going down in numbers because there is an offer from these different countries to take people back almost like turn themselves in ... and there's like Fifteen hundred that have taken them up on that\nThey got their new balance shoes by the way they're sponsoring the care of and they're not [laughter]\n\nI mean they get a whole lot of teachers that say New York Yankees ALCOA can't have [laughter] I'm not a ah\nI mean it is grueling because they're walking yes obviously usually you're going by freight train something like that and it ... were\nLed to believe that you have all these people that are seeking asylum\nOkay\nLooking for a better job is not seeking asylum it doesn't fit the rules\nAnd again you have a whole lot of young men saying ... were demanding to get in so Trump is sending military down there and they're getting some backlash I think that's really it it gives its what eight hundred troops as what they're planning on doing and what they're doing there is not they're not sitting along the border pointing guns south\nThat's not their purpose and that's the way you know you want to talk about toning down the rhetoric what's actually get the facts before I started saying he's militarized border it eight hundred troops right always that's the figure that's been thrown out there that you see the homeland security chief here some Nielsen yes actually had to come out and say their job is not to shoot people\nThat's not what they're doing they're they're they're there to help\nAssist in any way they can housing people helping to process people who are going to be coming over here and have a legitimate claims of asylum they're there to back up what's going to be an overt tax system at the border which is why this whole migrant caravan stuff\nIs going to be such a pain to begin with because you can't have thousands of people suddenly showing up at ports of entry and say or what are we supposed to do they're gonna have to wait and\nA lot of them are going to be turned around well just don't have the facilities to process everybody and not everyone is eligible for asylum\nNot even close well if it's not what it's about for a lot of these faithful\nTrump is basically said he's going to seal it\nI mean nobody's in nobody's out um\nAnd we'll see how that plays isn't that what our leaders supposed to do well yeah I mean you are military supposed to protect us\nFrom invaders and\nOther story that's getting some attention or the cover of the New York post is just called Kelly flop Megan Kelly Kelly out at NBC yes they're saying it all stems from the black face you know does it come as no I don't think any of us believe that that was the excuse but it was because of ratings and no one there liked her\nHe might be more than one one thousand Native American so I'm not\nSure uh interesting\nI'm guessing you or at least in the picture appears to be legit there um\nAnd we'll get to know more I mean there's all sorts of pictures of him at Trump rallies then you read something Scott where he was almost known at some of\nThese yeah he was known he was a character that some several of the Trump rallies I saw a picture of him holding a sign with like a half shirt on okay loved him some him\nSo we'll see exactly how this was all handled and I think we can all predict how the\nMedia is going to react to talk about that ah\nAnd then where do we go from here with this thing Trump tweeted out oh my gosh the Republicans had so much momentum and then there's what\nWas the allergy thing comes on them up and get in a way of our momentum I don't see I don't\nKnow and it ... it feels it feels terrible to to boil with the situation like this that is so fluid and obviously frightening you may know thankfully none of the bombs went off 'cause this guy's an idiot um but it feels weird to boil it all down to what is the political impact of bomb threats\nBut also I don't know if this is something that\nWould force somebody who was thinking about voting Republican to say you know what never mind I Know unemployment's down I Know there were great economic numbers that just came out from the third quarter uh I Know that we were getting all this great news but you know this one not down in Florida\nDecided to try to mail some pipe bombs to people and so I'm voting Democrat now\nI just I don't see that as the reality I think there's a lot of wishful thinking out there that this is going to somehow suppress Republican support yeah\nI don't know man I I tend to agree with you\nThink it's going to get played in the media as a you may have some independence out there that may like the the direction the\nCountry is going but all of a sudden they think you know what a some of these Trump supporters you know it's driving them over the yet GM I don't I don't really buy that either but I think that's going to be the card they\nPlay don't you have to be very careful though if you are a Democrat to not look like you're exploiting this for political gain or dissuade right in and do it anyway you would think you would think he would have to be careful what you really want to walk a fine line there like you know\nBut who calls them out well treated you know the burning bro the ... Congress people compared to this not giant exactly I think most people across America understand these are two not jobs it's not the fall of Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump that these people are nuts\nWe just have to deal with nuts and you see it all the time that would be my take on that so as we're watching all this news unfold and the reaction to it um\nIsn't that going to be one of the things brought up is this an accurate reflection of your Trump supporter right that's just ridiculous and absolutely ridiculous\nOr the president's rhetoric that he started the you know the mental attitude of this guy was he the guy responsible for that and I think about well here I think considering he faced some legal difficulties in two thousand two because of that because of bomb threats I don't think you can pin this on the president\nYou know yeah we don't think that yeah the ... you know and you you watch things unfold on line people are making the point man you noticed the difference as far as the flooding the zone with the coverage of this person social media accounts\nAnd the GOP softball shooter yeah\nYes yes I mean there is people are not dumb I mean they see how this goes you know I wanted to say this about that and I'm watching them as they're towing a van down the road on the flat bed to semi ... and I'm thinking to myself the guy in the semi\nGets up this morning his his wife could biases biases the kids see you tonight is going to deliver pumpkins for Walmart and then all of a sudden gets called uh yeah I Do listen to and we got another thing you've got to do you got to go over and pick up enough\nBalls van and [laughter] and all of a sudden you know how encounters you're following him and everything else just the typical day right [laughter] you never got blown out his yeah the guy driving the truck\nI'm switching gears want to bring up sometimes we do this but there are some good people in the world\nSome aspect I mean you're covering news you're you're covering a lot of bad things you know yes you brought up a baseball player what he did the other night after the world series game to\nWell you know what else I'm I'm not a Red Sox fan I'm\nI Am however a fan of ... I was before and now I really am apparently after the game was over east showers in his late I mean when these guys get on a plane is late yeah and it's like twelve thirty corner one move gig arranges for like a ... you know how you got the buffets\nAnd playing it's late yeah and it's like twelve thirty quarter one move gig arranges for like a ... you know how you got the buffets set up with all the spread all the food yeah brings it to a homeless camp and community\nSets it all up pays for it is in cognitive by the way so I wanted to you know want to know what I'm doing it any feeds all of these people out of his own pocket\nThat's in ... and I'm like you know what that's a great story man I mean if all this other garbage wages down sometimes you know your ... your lifted by stories like this I say that with all seriousness I like that guy oh yeah I only in Mali lawmakers hiring you and I were both talking about our mutual admiration for him the other day oh my gosh\nBoy just when you think here's something that could unite us off ...

think of the beginning I kinda bought him and it will be in the pre so\nWhile you hear the the er the thing that's not his secret he's got a different secret so if you think I blew it uh on on keeping their premiums and by the way that is in the trailer that he revealed that that's right so you can't get me on that one but he has a different secret altogether\nAnd he's kind of the main character kind of I think in many ways carries a film a kind of goes back to humans screwed up puzzle almost everybody in this film is he comes across as the the normal one at least a\nComing close to the voice of reason doesn't he\nWrites right\nAll right so then you've got Darlene sweet played by Cynthia anvil\nYeah that was a good one she boy she had a voice on her right\nShe was a singer or not she was a singer that was stopping by the hotel a\nMan of Jon Hamm this was a good what was it a vacuum cleaner salesman\nYeah yeah so that's the big suitcase you know and he carried it around [laughter] stuff in there again there's so many\nCancers that this thing 'cause you just always get it sounds like these people really aren't who they are right all of them in or they're bringing bringing a lot of is along with them so\n... in a while this movie is the perfect and it's not a ... it does if you like that kind of twist the attorney murder on the orient express type feel to it or there's certainly a delivers in that aspect doesn't\nAbsolutely\nAren't so you got Dakota Johnson uh and uh they she plays a sister to a ... a navy he's got some secrets\nLewis Pullman I don't know what he's been in but he's the front desk guy\nYeah and then Chris ... worth ... who he\nIs a um [noise] I'm sort of like this the person that people follow around you know they I mean I'm trying to think of a\nCult leader Collier thank you go yeah and and he gets people to follow him and he's very he's very charismatic\nRight and he gives you just picture him getting the script to sent to him and he reads it and he goes oh I'm doing this because he really fell in love with us\nAnd then and then the guy from in the Senate um which you don't really get to see his face a bunch of seeds in it\nFor five minutes maybe\n[laughter] All right so uh the leads me to uh to ask you this uh would you recommend a bad times of the ... to a friend\nI was yeah it was\nOkay and how about kids would you allow or what your kids to go to this no I yeah I'm Glad he said because I don't think kids belong here no one no 'cause it gets a little weird [laughter] wait a minute [laughter] um\nLet's take a look at the movie that's out on video and I think in many a TV services out there you can get this one it's a lot of them are running promotions for Halloween [noise] uh and it's hocus pocus it's twenty fifth year in existence I tell us about this movie I've never seen it [noise]\nUm it's it's about a small town and um they're all basically it goes back in time to Salem with the ... and um three sisters\nUm I'm trying to think of them do anyway these three sisters who are all which is um our our ... are killed and then they um there's only one way for them to come back to life and then you go modern dance this young kid who nothing around doesn't believe in all this stuff\nOpen the gate bringing them back and it can only happen on Halloween Night this one time so this is Sanderson sisters there you go and so this Anderson posters come back to life and the recon habit and they want to eat all the children in the village and go from there\n[laughter] so I I I'm kind of a modern day fairy tale right\nPretty much yeah it was in his Bette Midler\nBette Midler a Sarah Jessica Parker and\nKathy the Jimmy or the big three stars in it\nAnybody's steal the show a lot of those three\nAre well Bette Midler\nThat Midler okay that's what I was going to be my guess I like you said I never\nStars in it anybody steal the show a lot of those three Mettler that Midler okay that's what I was going to be my guess I'd like you said I never saw this but is it to\nGet a lot of makeup put on and so she was saying this is one of those roles in her life where ... you know she didn't have to really just rely on her singing I mean 'cause she had to become this one Sanderson sister um but three of them together like Three Stooges\nOh that's right and is this for young kids would you say\nOkay I Would say it is All right\nAll right what what movie is coming up that you're looking forward to anything or coming around the ... coming down the pike\nOld man and liquor and the gun okay that isn't a made its way over here yet is it\nNow it is playing a few selected theaters but um it's going to open nationwide I think in a couple of weeks so definitely want to check that one out um there's one with um more tense and I don't know if you remember that guy that\nYou are correct uh speaking of the president and Milwaukee of the uh the current president President Trump within Moses me earlier this week and I also heard that ms print outs\nAh on the air so it's interesting there's a lot of there's a lot of place names in Wisconsin that don't necessarily pronounce the way you think they might\nPeople up how did they mess up ... what a tone\nI Believe it was most city [laughter]\n\nI recall correctly All right well we got about what just over a week or so the goal was for the elections are what's making news as far as that goes well\nI mean obviously the the appearance of a of a president's past and present here in Wisconsin campaigning for their respective candidates I think was it was really the the big news\nIn Wisconsin today President Obama I Believe it's still speaking I'm In uh in Milwaukee at this point I I had a live feed that actually caused because I Want it to be talking to you\nSo that's a big deal I'm One of the interesting comments we got who was earlier when Mayor Tom Barrett ah took the stage at a\nAt the high school in Milwaukee where this is all going on at north division high school and he pointed out you know hey ah we had a considerable drop off\nIn people turning out to vote or two years ago\nAnd it if the the difference between two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen was accounted for in other words if we've been able to get all those people to turn out again Donald Trump wouldn't have won Wisconsin\nSo it's all about driving people to the polls and I think really when you get right down to it that's why the president was here earlier in the week as well as to make sure that people turn out and vote for Governor Scott Walker and US Senate candidate who come here it's all about uh it's all about turnout and I think what's\nKind of interesting about that Andy is that\nI'm In many years we we look at turnout as being in one party's favor and not necessarily the other\nUm during the presidential campaign in two thousand sixteen lower turnout was seen as really hurting the Democrat but lower turnout isn't necessarily going to help the Republicans this time around at least not Governor Scott Walker\nHe needs to get everybody\nTo the polls because he is as we know in a in a tight race with Tony Evers\nI talked to a lot of people ah pollsters and people look at polls both public internal\nAnd they always are very careful in the end of their findings they put in there but it all depends on turn out to these things could be horribly wrong and we've seen that happened last presidential election like you said so uh yeah they're very careful now that the turnout he goes through the roof the numbers they have a they go with them\nSo they're\nKind of spread all over and I guess we should mention to former vice president Joe Biden will be in Madison on Tuesday for an early vote rally at the University of Wisconsin Madison campus so another heavy hitter coming\nAbsolutely have early voting is a is a much bigger deal in each successive election I think are the more people get comfortable with the idea or the more it becomes something that you're going to see people turning out a big name politicians turning out to encourage people to vote early\nYou know I have for\nIt's something that you're going to see people turning out a big name politicians turning out to encourage people to vote early\nYou know I have for a good portion of my life by and I'm going to admit that is a is stupid as it sounds now but I always thought early voting you needed to have an excuse as to why you needed to do that so I just never did and I think I speak for a few people out there at least\nAnd uh Iowa early voting out all the time because I just don't know where I'll be on that day and especially when it was a candidate you just didn't know where you would be at that time and if you should be somewhere else so that's what I did and I think a lot of people are early voting in our state more than ever\nWell the other thing about early voting of course and is that a election day isn't necessarily something that everybody can easily participate in understand the polls open at seven\nBut I'm a lot of people have commitments that make it difficult for them to schedule the time it takes to actually go to\nTheir polling place in early voting is an option that maybe it's more convenient for people who might have multiple jobs or who have kids that they need to pick up and drop off at day care at the beginning and end of a work day so uh it's an option that it's a I think more practical for a lot of voters\nNow as a you make plans to early votes on the friday before the election is the last day that you can early vote you cannot vote that Monday before the election that is or something that does does take some by surprise and I was in the legislature when that got voted I voted against doing that because\nA lot of people are in like sales or they take a business trips and they don't know that they're going to have to do that until just moments before election day and they used to always kind of depend on the fact that they had that Monday to play around with who you don't\nSo just make sure that uh in your plans you know that you can't early vote on Monday before the election which would be November yeah\nAll right so I Want to switch gears now to or something is coming up next Monday or this coming Monday and uh that is a a a a debate that we're going to have in the\nFirst congressional district between in by the way this is the seat vacated by are going to be vacated by Speaker Paul Ryan and ah so two new gentleman really into politics at all on both of them are and accounts\nI on the Republican side you've got to uh Brian style and on the Democratic side you've got Randy Bryce and I'm Talking to one of the moderators of the event and that is Bob hey\nThat's right and I'm kind of a kind of looking forward to doing this because believe it or not um I have not moderated a debate ever before in my career\nTake this all you want but when I look at you Bob I I
