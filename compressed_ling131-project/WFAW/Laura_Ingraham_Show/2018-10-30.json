I was hoping to find more answers today and I'm just as lost his ever they keep changing it's\nPart of it [noise] okay so I see this story USA Today headlined Jamaican resorts facing a historic sexual assault problem than in Jamaica a couple of times every time like wow I haven't heard this before\nAnd so as the story starts out talking about a dark laundry room at a Jamaican sandals resort\nAnd this woman you know girls really teenage girl pinned to the floor by a hotel lifeguard and he's starting to bite her lip any rapes her whoa you know it is implied do not scream or say anything right\nWhen her mother found or after the assault trembling holding herself in a hallway the Seventeen year old couldn't speak she could only point to a metal door behind that door her friend was being gang raped by three resort lifeguards\nAnd that starts to tell the story saying this is the Jamaica that the U.S State Department has repeatedly warned tourists about have you heard that before\nA I have not 'cause I I've heard about\nAnd maybe from you wear travel guides will tell you well I don't really go outside of the resort area Benjamin 'cause you're a target yes um and they say the same thing about some places in Mexico as well don't really leave this area or you know do all your own risk because your target if you're American especially\nI'd not heard about that in a resort though yes that's terrifying\nA ... and you know as far as the warnings about Mexico I ever those over the last several months you know going back a few years have not heard about Jamaica but they say it is a pervasive sexual assault problem\nAnd this is the place where a couple of women from Detroit were raped last month and an estimated one American is raped each month\nOver the last Seventy or Seventy eight us citizens have been raped in Jamaica that's from State Department statistics and then it goes through the victims oh my gosh there was a mentally handicapped woman in her twenties in Indiana mother\nWas gang raped a twenty year old woman these Detroit moms I'm a King County teenager and are Twenty one year old friend\nAnd then it talks about the most alarming thing for tourists is that sexual assaults assault are occurring inside and the ... the resorts inside the gates\nBecause that is what they tell you hey you're probably find a going down the market's different things like that but don't go in when the sun goes down not good not going to be safe you always know that but you know than the resort fine that's what they say is\nYou know the most alarming part of the story so as an example the beaches or ... or ... I mean this was years ago but still um is a very nice um and that's where the lifeguard assaults occurred\nSo all of a sudden if you didn't know that\nYou're thinking yeah maybe Jamaica it'd be good you know winter break sort of thing that give you pause by doing it yes\nWell especially they say the state department is warned about this before I've I've really never heard of before\nThat's why I thought man should bring that up because that is not anything that I had heard either of soaring real\nThat whole you know question the Arabs and no and I'm the hate this guy do no one human yeah you know yeah ... where he's coming from but it's that whole trying to stay away from the hating of someone\nSometimes people face you can do that to a lot of the world that doesn't make any sense even to other people that have faith that have lost someone like that they feel like I've got hate my heart for a long time I'm just not ready\nTo forgive that some people can in a short amount of time you know what I mean that's like a different thing that people go through for just made up different\nYeah I Know in the long run but I Do believe to be true the more you hold the hatred it's it's affecting you more than it is the other person\nAnd so it's an admirable but man it's also remarkable and the man the four minute part of that to just happens to be on this day that he has to have a conversation with is housekeeper mhm\nOf course we don't have any idea what why the conversation you know but it was probably that conversation that kept him from being there on time and saved his life and so\nYou you know it's not quite the same what would you Scott having a couple of heart attacks and being you know flat lining for forty minutes and that close to death it's a matter of seconds here and there I mean is that go through your mind like why\nI well I think fear human it does I think you have I mean I still deal with it I still deal with it when I hear about people my age or younger than me even dropping dead of a heart attack who didn't get a second chance like I did\nAnd you wonder to yourself why me why did this happen to me and why not to that person they had a family there are people who loved him and cared about him\nRight up all of your friends Jamie you and I have talked about this yeah that are roughly my age or age around to be our age who just suddenly just drop dead of a heart attack the two guys that I I mainly\nBaseball to our childhood and high school and ... years\nOils and just to positions in people that were in play while I was having heart attacks by two I'm Alive today\nI mean I'm I'm I'm grateful I'm lucky but people will say well I guess got wasn't ready for yet\nTo which I sometimes I Want to respond what was got ready for this person right see this is weird area and you get into this thing and psychologically messes with your head a while so I Am I mean they're all he does you you can go in circles yes things about that it around all day trying to figure out why you're here and they're not hear what\nYou did that they didn't do\nWhy the circumstances played in your favor to stay alive and unlike that person\nI mean I could have been anywhere\nI mean I could have been anywhere when this happened but if I'm going to ask you personally ... do you think there was a greater purpose for you stay in the ... the question and the answer to that is\nI Want to believe that I think I Do believe that I just I Do I Know what that is no I mean has it been revealed to me no will it\nBe revealed to me I Believe it probably will be at some point in time I'm going to feel like okay this is it and there are times when I've been with my granddaughter's\nSome in tough situations with them ... then I said maybe this is it maybe this is why I'm Still here but then that doesn't explain why the guy who had grandkids or a wife and I know and why he's not you know\nSo yeah I mean it's a weird thing I mean it's the endless question right why me and not them and why them and not me\nThen you may find out ah for them\nYou know it it was part of a plan or it's just a following world and\nThey're in a better place and we're happier to get there sooner you know eat that every individual or trying to answer that question mhm and that's when you go in circles for one thing a real quick before we move on that I thought was fascinating\nAnd this was just an unfair conversation you and I are having a couple of weeks ago I said man if you had it all to do over again because you know where you were at before these heart attacks and people that don't know the story they didn't think you'd ever walk again let alone ever do radio again or you were going to be on dialysis forever you know all those things\nThat if you had to do over would you uh kept going on the path you were a great career path everything else and not have the heart attacks happened or because of the personal changes in your life\nBe added to do over again and you're like I wouldn't change it I Would still I I Wish you could have been a simpler way\nYeah I ... yes it's easier to get my attention I didn't have to get bludgeoned inside the head winds here would have been\nNice if it would have been a little more subtle however all that being said no there's nothing I Would change about it I I'm I'm probably healthier now that I have ever happen in the last twenty five years\nWhich sounds weird but it's true and maybe that's the answer to that question\nYeah I mean I end on that white happy yeah and I really I mean that's a tough topic but I think I'm here to re eventually become an astronaut\nSo that's wow that's what you want to be when you're a kid right so you're going to school [laughter] yeah it's all area let's start now the astronaut guy that can go through the self check out on his own [laughter]\nOkay I Do have a problem with that ... this is fascinating and David ... is a totally

he is my greatest fear is going to be like two or three items that are going to set the alarm off in the security is going to come running and somehow this is going to end up poorly for me\nBut I forget the scan them and then the alarm ... I don't even know what when you scanned them I guess something goes off inside that allows them to know you paid for it I don't know well I mean do you\nEnd up getting a receipt yeah I mean I get a receipt yeah same thing that happens when\nCashier does I Know you see I mean I Know all that but they're the antibiotics\nYeah I mean I get a receipt yeah same thing that happens when the cashier does I Know you see I Know and the ...

something stupid says something ignorant or whatever and they wind up losing their business or their job their social outcasts\nOr the people that I saw acting up on these trains in Chicago in

ship something out [laughter] and so it's me\nThere is a guy ahead of me and then two ladies they both look like they could have been on you know like the reality um NBA star housewives or whatever [laughter] I mean they're getting impatient because this guy is trying to reason with the lady from the post office saying he doesn't need to go through\nWhatever protocols to send out this direct mail it it looked like two thousand different pieces\nA restaurant opening and here's the menu sort of thing\nAnd she's trying to say there are two other steps you have to go through okay um and you need to do that on line and he's saying no I'm not going to do the accent [laughter] but he's saying no\nI I don't have to do that I Want to do what I did yesterday and I'm thinking well yesterday was Sunday wasn't enclosed ... whatever and she's saying no you did one step there are two other steps before we can mail these out she's trying to explain it and I have no idea what those steps are ...\nAll I Know is people are getting impatient you know and so I just happened to make eye contact with one of the ladies and she looked at me like what what [laughter] I'm like man I don't know how this has got a break you know but all of a sudden you know if someone has like a long fingernails and they started on [noise]\nLike this on the counter [laughter]\nI'm like why does it go to bars here today and\nAll of a sudden there was another lady that came out said I Need to take you down here sir I don't know how long that guy would have been there we were all gone by the way they were still there man I don't know if you get it all figured out and I was like hearing that hearing people argue with how the process works [noise] put all of a sudden she's going to say okay we'll just mail um you don't have to go through those\nBroadcast right now I used to have that all the time when I was working at the old Burlington coat factory which part by people try to return stuff none of those people trying to ask if they like because I worked in the shoe department and they're saying hey do you have this undecided eleven mhm will know what can you check back we don't keep any inventory in the back but could you just check [noise]\nNo we don't have anything back there and we take right if we take all the product off of the the truck ... put it out on the floor\nBut couldn't you just go back and check and then I usually would cause I yeah I could use it for a smoke break so I went out back I had a cigarette and I said bad checked all over the back and find anything in his eyes on him for sure if you tell them three or four times we don't have anything in the back and they insist on you're going back there I Know might as well take to break it's frustrating\nThat's that's all at our site right yeah\nThat'll escalated quickly\nAnd that really got out of hand fast\n[laughter] even better they can employ a U.S yes we just play clips whenever there's a question that the press conference from Jim Acosta [laughter] you know what I mean I'd be sent\nYou have the guts to address\nUs though [laughter] I don't think so no job but I don't think so All right so mainly pirate hooker\nOkay just mark the tape because that's promo material we're speaking truth to power it's the men are doing that's all that well I Know okay so then was Trump basketball too when he was talking to lure anger him\nHe went off I I did have to edit this down a little bit 'cause he kept talking about North Korea in the context of this and the point that he was making just so if you didn't see a point I was making is that oh they said everything was horrible North Korea then I go meet him and everybody says even meeting the chubby little nut job was this terrible thing that I did okay\nBut as far as Jim Acosta this hour we're going to hear\nWhen I say the enemy of the people I'm Talking about the news and you know better than anybody [noise] the last minute there this fake\nHousing fan here me to call them the enemy in the long lines I knew I should have so it was raining and I work for and they call themselves in an afternoon incompetent or longer and he always kinda\nLA but

say\nMr President there may be a better ways you could go about this bring unity maybe this isn't helping you know being\nYou know such an adversary of different media outlets okay\nAt the same time\nRemember every Republican candidate doing their best Ronald Reagan routine\nMen would mention Ronald Reagan eight times in a one minute clip trying to get the Republican voter on their side and Trump came in and said I don't give up bleep this is what people want this is what I'm going to give them any bloom all out of the water was a part of me that things for Trump really wanted to say there was I'm not\nReagan I'm unlike anything you've ever seen she should rush\nYou know what I'm saying yeah I think Trump's a product of the time at the same time I think Reagan might have\nBeen tweeting had he had that available to them I don't think it would look like Trump's\nC'mon\nLeading man yeah well no I'm saying I'm I'm with boring room there you can do that down but there's part of me also saying the terms like hey I'm my own\nPerson alright I wanted to throw this that you guys\nGoes uh just happen\nTo see it and it was the topic of conversation I was having with a few people

you were in trouble right\nBritain did they limit your TV or if you were older Internet hours\nJust in general not if you were in trouble right\nUh I think it's just in general yes because of

answers\nAuditorium is a an intimate a setting for sure and uh\nUh it was a ... you got a little ah a weird at times but they did settled back down and there were a stark contrast and just about every top issue you brought forward but there were times that they did they did agree\nWell there was at least one time um I we are and I asked them\nTo each identify a couple of issues where they felt they wouldn't be able to work across the aisle if ah if they do get to D.C\nAnd I apologize I don't recall all of the issues that I identified a ready price said that working to help veterans would be an issue that um\nThat both sides can come together on and I believe uh Brian style identified addressing a homeless issue as a as an opportunity I I may be wrong there but in any event that I asked the two of them to expand because\nUh we hear a lot and have heard a lot for the past several administrations about how Congress is\nCeding a lot of its authority to the executive branch\nAnd I asked the two of them whether they agreed with that and it was I think really the only time where they were both in agreement and said yeah a Congress specifically the house of representatives needs to claw back a little bit of its authority of from a from the president no matter who the president is\nSo that was maybe maybe the only point of agreement during evening\nYeah I got a little carried away when I buy a lead people on that there might have been more than one\nI think I might have been it uh but nonetheless uh I think ... if you did tune in\nYou did get a your ... and this was a really good debate and I want to compliment you and your co moderator a professor\nOf Susan Johnson from U. W. whitewater I think he did a great job uh there there are a challenge for sure but are you in this debate there are certain rules at each meat debate has and this one you had the ability as a moderator to listen to the answer your question if you felt that they needed to be a follow up you went there and I think\nYou did that a few times in the they were very much appropriate to do so so good\nJob of all thanks very appreciate the opportunity to\nYeah it was a you know I Know you made mentioned you were missing the bucks game for that and uh I Want to thank you for taking time out of your ah you know a life after work to give back to our warning\nIt wasn't the ultimate sacrifice because I was able to catch the last quarter on the way on the way back to\n... I didn't realize you were such a basketball fan well I mean how can you not be stoked about this team this year uh especially given the ah I don't want to get in trouble here\nBut things have been a little uh shall we say disappointing uh with the Packers us far this season um so\nWell what do you think about the Packers are now that you brought a mob\nWell uh uh ... Clinton picks has been traded and a timeout gum or he has been treated as of this afternoon so I knew\nAbout tiny Montgomery but where do you how to ...\nUh you know I Am I'm just now seeing this so\nI'm going to have to uh to have to see if I can\nYou brought it up so yeah this is I like him\nYeah I I kind of like the guy to a he has the latest let me see if I can find it\nYou know what this gives me an impression is my knee jerk reaction that they're cashing in on this ... they're they know the seasons aren't going anywhere so they're going to now start to rebuilding for a in the future\nYeah yeah a hot Clinton picks his on his way to our nation's capital\nReally yeah mhm borrowing wow\nAnd so he's going to be a Washington Redskins when she told me indeed\nAlright ... breaking news everybody didn't see that one coming but last\nSo are you going to be a Washington Redskins which told me indeed\nAlright alright ... breaking news everybody\nDidn't see that one coming but last night a stark differences on on just about everything I think at times to a ... I don't know if you agree but they did get a little testy ah than than some exchanges that they were talking and not to use the moderator anymore they talk to each other and and that's okay yeah that's what a debate is all about\nAnd ah they ah made some points that way as well so\nYeah and I you know I think that's really not surprising it's been a long campaign it's not a it's not surprising to see things getting a little a little heat it down the home stretch\nCame home former vice president Joe Biden was in Madison today did you go over in ...\nUm I did not actually go over a I took advantage of the miracle that his streaming audio I'm angry Andrew too I ... in order to to uh participate in that\nUm you know with the constraints of having a two person newsroom\nA that was a considerable time investment we reporters were expected to be checked in by seven thirty this morning for an event that really wasn't going to get rolling a for two or three hours after that um and with a with a ... you know with the constraints that the newsrooms have these days", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fort Atkinson", "day": "30"}
