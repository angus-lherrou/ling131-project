I Know I say there's a lot but what a time to be alive man I take it rocked trending on Twitter I'm like what the hell is going on here because we know Kanye West who's also meeting with the president today kid rocked apparently is part of the festivities he showed up at the White House today is decked out all black he's got the old classic hat on\nHe's walking in and reporters are shouting out don't ask me political questions\nLike why Mr Iraq the president fire Jeff Sessions we have audio of this\nOr get to hear it got to hear it you're fired Jeff Sessions\n[noise]\n\nHe says fire you back 'cause that's what Mr rock says and now I think getting rock is the leading contenders to replace Nikki Haley as ambassador to the United nations and what a time to be alive sir\n[noise]\nShould fire you fire you so is he crashed into lunch what's going on I guess he's part of it man they're gonna they're gonna they have a pretty stacked agenda they're going to be having lunch it's going to be a great time this is the second time kid rock has been in the White House\nIt's true the last time and he was only for it'll be the third he was with Sarah Palin\nIt was a yeah Ted Nugent Ted Nugent Sarah bail and they knew joys rare they had that famous picture where they're standing in front of the pill or a portrait of Hillary Clinton yes yeah\nSo so there you go so yes Kanye West is of course that is the headliner I think\nI'm for this lunch today they're gonna be talking about gun violence in Chicago all sorts of different things to say I don't know if kid rock really wants to say I'm opening for ... Jay\nOkay well I I listen I headline yeah I've been a headliner for yeah Kanye West is bigger than the world All right then uh then kid rock is all due respect to Mr rock I'm\nNot going to argue that guy needs a bigger name so already or do you might be the opening act I'll let you take that up with Mr rock are located at is fine okay and then he'll say fire you Dan\nI'm about President Trump called in to Fox News last night and this morning but last night talking to share and Bream about ah this Kanye West visit to the White House okay\n... White House during the day if you weren't does he tell you what do you want for lunch\nKanye West visit to the White House okay tiny black\nOr White House during the day if you weren't does he tell you what do you want for lines to him when he's been again for lunch when you get to order when he gets there were and I was\nJust because then you also get around this morning then maybe ever in the year round is a\nGreat great in lacrosse player there's somebody will say was better lacrosse player and he was the best one bomb plays a great athlete but he um round is going to be\nAble to listen man he's riffing [laughter] just talking about lacrosse and you've got all these I mean yeah it's a stream of consciousness you use like I mean we're all getting order\nFrom the beginning of the me then\nYou know when you look at the unemployment we're best in the history of our country black unemployment the lowest level never in history you getting the median income or African American that's ever been in the country I mean I'm doing things for\nThe African Americans have never been done by the Democrats that you know\nThe Democrats really hadn't loans they had that mode lockdown now a lot more you know because I'm reducing numbers they were never able to bring is so\nGreat in ... county is smart guy and he saw that show that a long time ago Jim Brown zone I get name many great a black stars an athlete that or you know they are they were born about him we had a lot of support and we have a tremendous amount of support\nOkay there are certainly those on the left it would not agree with that asserts she oh no and in fact I think they get very condescending to one Mr west\nIt's unreal dude it it is I Can't believe this terminology as you share commentators are basically taking away Kanye West black guy card or this was on CNN so Don Lemon at his panel assembled you'll hear Bacardi sellers and terrorists admire okay\nYeah I'm not that familiar with that data ladders to anybody out there because you may not recognize means they are both black\nOkay All right and of course time limits too but it's this is incredibly condescending okay\nWhat is what happens when negroes don't read 'em and\nOh okay that's pretty hot take\nThey we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in Riverton and he's going to have somebody who can stay with them and take pictures [laughter] that's not Don Lemon\nJust giggling along with it saying oh yeah that's what happens when negroes don't re imagined it let's say I would've could've should've card here imagine you have a conservative black commentator who says that about Jay Z supporting a supporting Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton\nJust imagine the fireworks the melt down that happens there that's all we knew story that's the only news story well after the hurricane that's what it would\nBe quicker than black folks are praying Kanye West in the race or draft K they've had it with him and he's an attention who are like the president he's all of a sudden now that the model spokes person he is he's the token negro then on the Trump them and this is ridiculous\nAnd no one should be thinking ... seriously you clearly has she's already been hospitalized he's already been hospitalized\nOkay when he's up stealing awards from other people [laughter] yes she gets a big passed right\nUh-huh but now that is what leads seemingly is politics have changed he's lost it would I don't understand and all of this gym round is a civil rights icon and has been\nSo what he says it doesn't matter either no they boil it down to just well this is what happens with black people don't read is that what\nThey're saying about Jim round I don't think I felt that it out for you to say that I don't think they've said that about Jim yet but I'll just make the point I made before your Kanye West\nIs crazy he's always been crazy and now suddenly it's this big deal for people on the left\nThat he's supporting Trump and now they're saying there's something wrong with ... he has always been this guy yes there is nothing new about Kanye West right now he likes to buck the trend he likes to push back\nAnd right now there is no bigger form of push back then supporting this president that's all he's doing and I thought I by the way I thought we\nWeren't so sorry for the real and [laughter]\nIt's OK buddy you get it passed I also really like how she condescending we just right off the fact that this guy's been dealing apparently with mental health issues\nThat everybody's rule real cool\nIt was a breakdown right he had to leave the door and the whole bit and\nThat's that's not a call to violence that's not a call to harassment of public officials that's just Eric Holder having some fun\nYou know timing counts for a lot mhm\nAnd when you had the Maxine Waters deal of you know you got to seek them out yeah you got to make some noise you get a get\nFace right yeah man\nThe shooting of Steve ... wasn't that long ago right it really wasn't and the thing is when you're appealing to a few unhinged people who knows what can happen that's the fear I think from a lot of people\nAnd you know I wouldn't be as worried about it now or wouldn't be talking probably personally wouldn't be as interested in it now as I Am had it not been for the fact that constantly we were hearing that Republicans were the ones who are going to cause a bunch of violence in the street\nNever mind the fact that the week after the election you had left wing activist\nBreaking cars and car lots in Portland shattering storefronts a storefront windows in Portland also in LA yeah I think in Houston Chicago had some issues as well\nNever mind all of that but it was Donald Trump and these right wing dunes that we're going to be a the death of a lot of people that were going to cause a bunch of violence yeah and then you have something like Charlottesville and they're saying well bears the proof bats it\nWhat if the younger one incident versus dozens of incidents piers where I think it was the real tactical mistake from the Democrats they should have been quick to say uh you know especially with the group and Portland hey\nAs we found out a lot of these people weren't even registered to vote right okay they don't represent us that it's just not the answer\nThat was and unfortunately a limited reported the story\nOh guy might of why you didn't register to vote try not to just totally go down ... memory lane for too long hair but remember that yeah it was it was half the people more than half of the people who were arrested\nAfter these rights in Portland were registered to vote in either Washington Oregon\nNo I mean sometimes you have you know just these idiotic people write that are looking for a reason to riot all the time it doesn't really matter what the causes yeah we're joined in there is a sense of what we're going out and we want justice didn't have time to vote\nWhich is I mean we are betting that day yeah that stuff's going on right the Democrats should have tried to distance themselves but they didn't they in a lot of ways embraced it and you have a lot of people in the country that just one law and order\nYou know just reasonable people do like I don't identify with that you know when they see you know Ted Cruz for a lot of people not their favorite politician\nI'm even talking about conservatives there yeah but no one wants to see what happened to him and his wife and a restaurant that's not cool to a lot of people that and that's a big mistake going into the midterms\nAnd President Trump was asked about comments from not only Eric Holder but we heard from Hillary Clinton earlier this week uh both of them seeming to suggest that you know harassment of public officials was okay at least until Democrats win that's what Hillary Clinton steak was\nAnd so on Fox News last night President Trump was asked about uh the general concept of this okay\nWell thank you starting that whole thing um by encouraging people can be you know Ron protesters and I'm going out to people with nicknamed in all kinds of things honey respond\nWell I don't think so I you know my rally regional and even for me anyway there seem to be on vacation paid people in this rather do rallies\nAnd when you knew that you know bad things happen but they were the ones who started everything's so no it wasn't us it was it was totally the other side I mean I Would at a rally and paying people going into those rallies causing trouble in many cases didn't work out so well for those being\nBuilding I don't know ... people were in those rallies\nJanet Janet I'm not done yet I'm rolling here All right [laughter] I'm Still here that clip my headlights and punishment but yeah but anyway when I hear oh\nThey're making a statement he made today I think it's a disgrace ... I really understand she can get it she never she never well I mean that's why she lost the election\nAnd made me going out and about yeah they do point out but there were people you know punched in the face and stuff like that that will remember the one sucker punch that happened at a rally\nThis was a couple of years ago now and there was on the campaign trail but there was a big one the ... it was an older guy a punching a black guy oh yeah but you remember on the way out remember that that was a huge frontline her front page story for a long time what they didn't cover at all or Trump supporters being pelted by eggs\nAnd being harassed as they were going into these rallies as well\nSo when you say you know when to take it as well Trump really started it because of in a violent at his rallies you're ignoring the violence that was taking place outside in a lot of cases not every case but a lot of cases I think the biggest one was probably maybe a San Diego to Chicago there was a Chicago rally but got shut down because of a riot\nYeah drone dark that riot it wouldn't be safe to keep rolling then yeah a lot of people were paid to go in there\nThat is true now this morning on Fox and friends the president responded specifically to Eric Holder's well\nBetter be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you raised beds for what he's discussing famous for him to be able to make a statement like that is a very dangerous statement you know they don't get mad at\nUs we aren't exactly opposite you know the rally is where they shouldn't be all I heard somebody else in the morning show actually don't get him out of my rallies\nThan my rallies or really calm and and well run and and the people we don't have the problems that arise but they have to be careful with the rhetoric because it's very dangerous who are older says an older is held in contempt of Congress\nLike thrown that went out there because she does while you're on that a very general held in contempt of Congress okay gotta bring us up and see if you've ever been a victim David okay sneezing\nI is that like a Dr seuss thing or it's a new dating term okay that is when a woman goes on dates with ... just to get free meals and preferably nice restaurants\n[noise] I Can't say for sure that I've been is it's needed yes I Can't say for sure that I have been just needed a it's possible one time it it's very possible but somebody was just going out\nJust to get a free couple of drinks in a meal I have known women who do that though and kind of brag about it to their friends\nGot old Berg hurricane Michael up the trail destruction in Florida and then I'll tropical storm is traveling up the coast it's already\nOver the soaked Carolina's FEMA says aid is now moving into hard hit communities\nPresident Trump says that while hurricane Michael was incredibly powerful storm didn't linger over the Gulf Coast but instead move quickly in and out\nThe one good thing we can say we were just discussing is that it was the fastest hurricane and they what they see it just was never was into the ... early nothing left\nThe president said he diminished ration is working closely with state and local officials to make sure they have everything they need for rescue operations and to help people in need ...

emotional\nOver a low white blood cell count which possibly a side effect of the kidney transplant she had last year so she was released but then had to be re admitted late last week because of her low blood cell count persisted and it just through er into a downward spiral yeah it can happen again um\nYou know when I first saw it I'm like oh does this have something to do with the beams again\nDoes that thing I'd I've never been able to follow it every once in a while one of my kids will be like oh yeah they're back to get no they're not back together now they are or who knows man\nUm but it wasn't that long ago to that she took a break from social media and so just remember negative comments can hurt anybody's feelings and do you also think someone on that level\nThey don't listen to the little noise\nYeah but the way if if you are going through depression or anxiety I mean the thing is you can hear a hundred compliments in one negative thing will just ruin you\nFor the rest of the day wow\n... just [noise] you know even though it's someone that seemingly has everything going on I don't know to me you can't help but you don't have compassion for that

started doing\nThe spot a fire and streaming stuff so maybe maybe you wouldn't make the top of the list but they were swept comes to mind no probably started to late in the gang yeah\nAnybody else or Michael Jackson no actually I don't know is he on spot if I don't know\nI'm not sure about that because he's one of those artist do they protect a lot of his music so I don't have to do it because

knew and just came out yesterday\nA professor Charles Franklin and or in the U.S Senate race a professor Franklin a leader who got some catching up to do now the way in today\nI noticed she had to billboards big ones side by side same billboard she bought both of them and then I went around the corner she bought the other side too well she's got some catching up to do against Tammy Baldwin doesn't she\nShe does a it's a three for ... forty three for ... fair\nThat's almost the same as three weeks ago when it was fifty three forty two so where's the governor's race within a Republican direction the attorney general had moved a little bit and a democratic direction Senate races basically unchanged and a pretty substantial advantage for Baldwin at this point still\nAll right uh some of the other things you look at and I how do you come up with another question you ask besides the the different races because whoever does it a ... up you really do a drill down and some of the uh different questions that are out there that are are very uh I Know to get my curiosity going who does it you\nKnow somebody may in collaboration with ice job bills um yeah so thank you for not saying they really are terrible ... their guns are\nAudits because first of all going to start out with a woman who does the ladies like and who do men like in our state yes they have to kind of figure out who's a speaking to who\nYeah and and you know partly this is\nYou like to know who to amend like in our state yeah just to kind of figure out who's speaking to who\nYeah and and you know partly this is\nThese are issues of taxes and spending and what our priorities are\nI I don't have to be that smart to seize it those are issues that have been around with us for a while and so I'm trying to answer questions about those health care is another top rated issue in fact\nWhen we ask people what's the most important problems in the state our kids K. twelve education followed by healthcare followed by highways and it's been that way so last year at least\nI'm so we tried to follow up with those with questions that you know business just repeat the slogans from the campaign commercials but tried to pull it away a little bit from the campaign so you know would you rather hold your property taxes down or would you rather spend more on public schools\nUh that was one that we've asked and it's one that has changed direction\nOr back in twenty Thirteen when we first asked is more people want to hold a on their property taxes and fewer people wanted to to raise school spending now that has flipped\nAnd is more people wanting school spending by fifty seven percent to just thirty seven percent primarily concerned about property taxes that's quite a change because property taxes have been a big issue in the states since at least the Nineteen nineties um so that's an interesting change that we've seen\nMhm and when it comes to the governor's race boy Scott Walker's doing a fine job for the white male non college group\nWell when you break out the group's this way one of the things that's changed and it's been evolving but twenty sixteen really kids gave it an extra kick is that the the gap by both education and gender\nIs among white voters our samples are too small to break out a non whites by age ... or by gender in education so we have to talk just about the white voters on this but I'm the man the white man who\nDid not get a college education have emerged as the most pro Republican group white women with a college degree is the most pro democratic group\nAnd then the the women without a college degree and the men with a college degree those two groups tend to flip a little bit a little bit\nBaldwin strength is in part because she's winning\nThe white non college women strongly as well as the college women whereas a pony versus just sort of breaking even with the the non college women so those are some of the\n... those two groups in the middle or a little bit of where we see some of the swing and this year selection\nYeah I'm In ... there is and uh let's take a look at the question just to bleep bleep are we headed in the right direction you snooze question what did you might\nAnd and that's the strongest questions for a Governor Walker or for incumbents more generally fifty four percent say we're headed in the right direction um that's up from fifty percent\nThat said that uh three weeks ago now that fluctuated it's been between fifty and fifty for most of the summer but it's a bit above a Governor Walker's job approval numbers um some campaign consultants thinks it's the right direction\nIs a really good leading indicator of where people will end up in their final votes I'm less convinced of that but I think it is an interesting indicator no matter what\nLet me ask you about action of the Olympics go I Would have people think about that\nYeah we're still very divided on act in right now to repeal forty to keep it forty three long we've asked about it a number of times uh back if Tony twelve it was forty three repeal fifty keep\nA and in twenty fourteen just before the reelected was also forty three fifty\nSo maybe you keep it has come down just a little bit but repeal has not moved up either they've just kind of come together and interestingly more people now say they don't know about that issue maybe there's a little bit of forgetting about 'em all up to\nA dispute twenty eleven\nAnd we just got through with the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings in your pool you went there to see what the voters thought of that would you mind they're\nLargely the Kavanaugh hearings reinforced people's partisanship they tended to hear what they wanted to hear um Kavanaugh's favorability has moved down a little bit but so I'm Sorry\nBoth Kavanaugh's favorable and on April have moved up since he was nominated so he started out at twenty seven twenty two favorable unfavorable last month there was twenty nine twenty nine dead even this month it's thirty a favorable forty one unfavorable\nBut with twenty percent still undecided\nUh we did ask if you um at a favorable or unfavorable\nView of Dr Ford that was tied thirty five thirty five with twenty nine undecided and finally if you had a vote for ... to confirm or a defeat Kavanaugh how would you vote forty three percent would vote to confirm him to the court forty seven would vote to oppose\nHim on the court mom even split\nA little bit more oppose but after all the hearings in two weeks of intense coverage and you know a very uh important that emotional issue it's interesting that opinion didn't split strongly one way or another\nThe Miller investigation you still have that on your list of questions and I'm Glad you do because you sometimes wonder people getting sick of it is are they still are going to uh uh you you know respect whenever the findings are what did you find out\nRight well in our case we've seen a little bit of a rise recently in the number of people that say it'll be a fair and impartial um investigation opinion has so much switched sides\nAs it's moved from the middle somewhat confident not very confident he moved to the extremes very confident or not at all confident\nBoth of those have gone up from where they were in twenty Seventeen right after he was appointed book recently the very confident has moved up a little bit\nAnd I think that's in the aftermath of the successful uh a prosecution of Paul Manafort and the subsequent ... deals that have come and and um perhaps also the Cohen plea deal though that's not Mahler or so it may be that the actions in the courtroom\nWhat do you deal with that of calm and and um perhaps also the Cohen plea deal though that's not Mahler or so maybe that the actions in the courtroom or signaling a little bit more confidence in that investigation\nAnd had a few people feel about the CIA also known as Obamacare in our state yeah we're all\nThroughout twenty and twenty six thing or more people had an unfavorable view that are favorable you\nAfter the the ... and the GOP Congress this year last year tried to repeal it um and failed\nOpinions switch and now
