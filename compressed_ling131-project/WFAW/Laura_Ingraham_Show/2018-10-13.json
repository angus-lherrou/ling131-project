American Music Awards last night it was a big night for these toys well right she opened the show one of ... or ... says all she was one of many celebrities who was saying go out and vote now\nBut also because you know I I'm Glad to be a amazed at something totally original but no other award show has done in the last two years by becoming political mhm yeah\nWell I tell you the short for we know that the backlash in two thousand sixteen\nShe just wanted to stay silent yeah because she didn't want to get involved in politics and now she has been forced into being involved in politics\nTrump had the line and I like her music twenty five percent less [laughter] now I'm by the way the am a\nNew record low for ratings\nI'm not surprised by that in the least and for a couple of reasons as we talked about what things like the Emmys Golden Globes even the Oscars is that when you have more ah sources to find music or entertainment\nYou care less about those award shows because we're not all sharing the same experience to the same extent we used to write\nThat is true used to be you know you turn on the radio and everybody knew this one song that was being played on the radio constantly it's now it's becoming less and less uh like that as we as time moves on that is true or\nThe other old man river like me like you know the the other part of that though is who wants to sit through a three hour award show when all they're going to do is ramp politics\nDown your throat better why the Oscars honestly and a lot of movie award shows have tanked yeah because the reality is is that people who are obsessed with politics may not agree with it and may also just want to have some sort of escape from it\nAnd then there's a whole lot of people in this country who could not care less about it this is true and\nSort of escape from it and then there's a whole lot of people in this country who could not care less about it this is true and when they hear a joke do Trump bad Democrat good all that stuff they're saying that shut up and play the dang song\nYet this used to be you know I just like musical artist I like music\nOkay I Know for certain that we disagree politically but I appreciate the musical talent but you tune in and then seeing someone Jim their views on your throat you're like oh I'm not coming here for that right but this new record low in ratings matched\nWell two thousand Seventeen which is a new record low that it now I'd\nWith two thousand sixteen except this one was twenty five percent worse than last year [noise] wow\n[noise] [noise]\nYou're not beating the big bang theory there no no you're not and she is in the news daily cocoa is just click bait this is a bogus story\nDo you mean go ahead and give me the headline oh well it's actor says she'd be fine of her husband's split\nWhat does that say to you know she doesn't care if he leaves well I think that is kind of what she's saying I don't think so it's not\nNo it's not it's not as a waitress as as of course the headline makes it sound and I think she's actually she's making some sense it's about the uh the financial security angle of it right that you would be fined financially he would be fined financially and that actually helps out their relationship because they don't need each other for financial dependence\nWell of course everyone knows she makes a big bank from the show but you see the headline beyond me fine of her husband's split [noise] [noise] [noise] ... yes financially she makes a lot of money yeah she just\nMarried a Carl Cook who's wealthy and his own words about three and a half billion dollars was dad's words about three hundred and have three and a half billion dollars or she did this interview with women's health and she said I Want to see I'm Talking about her husband uh I like knowing though that I'm financially set because I've taken it upon myself to do that\nI like to tell my friends always make sure you have your life going and that your number one so that anyone who comes into it has been boyfriend girlfriend however you roll that's just an added bonus to something you're already creating an I wholeheartedly agree with that\nYeah that's what more marriages need all about me\nNo way a recipe for success I I don't think she's saying it's all about me she's saying that you know take care of ... I understand I don't know it's not even that it's saying that make sure that you've got what you\nNeed in your life that you're set up and then you are actually choosing somebody because you want to be with them not because you're dependent\nOn them for something other than just the other than an emotional connection I Know and I I agree with that I understand that get it I mean\nBut the whole headlines misleading oh yeah point from like I don't care if he leaves fought to click bait world yeah that's right yeah so I see the headline even in the short run down I'm like really holy cow okay now I now I just feel duped\nNo big deal OK other stuff we got to get to all there's the lock her up chants that we still haven't gotten to yet oh yeah [noise] um we'll get to that coming up\nUh in just a little bit there is a story about a weight to lure a tiger that they went out and kill is this right this was written\nUp in the guardian wildlife authority authorities in India they're trying to catch a tiger and that is thought to have killed at least nine people and what they're thinking about using is Calvin Klein obsession cologne\nSo the tiger is preying on people uh and rangers have thrown significant resources into trying to get the animal\nUm so they're saying that what they want to use as this cologne the power of obsession to lure big cats was first established apparently by experiments that Bronx Zoo in New York\nIn two thousand three the key ingredient here's why is it a synthetic version of the mosque sit greeted by the civic maybe heck yeah this is a small nocturnal mammal who's glandular liquid his prize for its powerful aroma\nTo the base of the cologne is something that might actually attracted tiger 'cause they think it's a little bit or whatever it's called\nIt's Kevin Kline obsession yes oh yeah you know some people are saying\nWould you use it to attract cougars and the early nineties [laughter] this is a pretty effective so I could see where this work were you an obsession by Calvin Klein guy I was bought for me as a gift yes but you you are it probably yes I did and when ... when that ran out did you go to the brute\nUh\nThe criticism is ridiculous because Democrats were literally raising money during the hearings that were going on\nThere was a lot of stuff going on they were sending out fundraising emails about that hearing while was going on they were using the situation to raise money so don't lecture anybody about how anybody might turn this into a political quote unquote rally event\nWell I mean over time we're going to hear more and more things\nAbout the Democratic lawyers and how they influenced him Dr Ford and what exactly happened because there's still so much that doesn't make sense\nWe don't need to spend a ton of time on this but you know it's like a simple thought and I hadn't really had it before and I don't think I'm Alone in saying when you watch Dr forged testimony\nYou felt bad for her but at the same time you're like there's a lot of holes here yeah this doesn't make sense you know but of course be said that your rape apologist which is how ridiculous this thing has gotten\nWhat do you suppose it's possible that you know she wanted to remain anonymous ... that was true\nMan I don't know I I just don't know why you write a letter to somebody if you want to stay anonymous unless you're hoping be the only\nThe only room I can see for that is that if you're hoping that by writing a letter maybe if other people write a letter then the Congress person or in this case Senator Dianne Feinstein might say hey there's a pattern here we need to investigate this and then you could stay anonymous\nYeah ... million a lot of it that's hard for me to believe but if once her name is out there and someone leaks it\nRight yeah once they get a hold of Dr Ford they convince her this is the way we have to go because as we know there are different parts of the story that then changed mhm\nWere time but the thing that never wavered was Cleveland Kaiser her friend saying I wasn't there no recollection of any party like that I don't know Brett Kavanaugh\nBut at least we know that there was some influence trying to be put on her to revisit that story a little bit\nAre you sure you don't remember very positive here\nWell that's and that's what what was meant by Deborah Ramirez the the woman from the wagging incident yes ah who said I spent six days ... ah what was it assessing my memories that's what that means democratic whatever comes in and says could you assess your memories a little bit more and tell us that it was Brett Kavanaugh who wag it in front of you right\nSo you put all that together 'cause I'm trying to give for the benefit of the doubt\nEven though there was always part of me going this doesn't make sense how do you not know that your name is going to be out there\nI mean from all of your ... you're an intelligent person right mhm how do you not know this and then the whole part of her talking about the regions of the brain and how it deals with trauma you're going to put yourself in the situation\nThat you're going to testify on live TV when you didn't need to ... and your lawyers never told you that you could stay home in California there's all that stuff I just shut my own theory right now [laughter]\nI Can't believe it I still can't yeah but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt you know that was a anyway I there was a piece written\nThat I Am a sexual assault survivor and I don't want you to just take my word for it ... it's a longer piece this lady is saying is if belief were based on a feeling than Dr Ford's testimony would have won me over\nBut it's more than that yeah I mean that's that's the obvious thing\nYou have to have some level of proof that evidence or at least somebody who can put you in the same room together right I mean that's what we've been talking about for now several weeks with Brett Kavanaugh thing\nRight yes I mean I feel like we've already spent enough time on the whole thing um and there's other stuff that we need to get to um this is an important but I mentioned it to your earlier and our producer Craig millennial like you David child of the nineties\nDid you see this\nWhole list of normal things that kids in the nineties used to do that are already outdated life comes at a fast fans\nSo for some of us maybe early fifties were made to feel old possibly on the show from time to time mhm it's nice to see other people feel yeah but if this makes me feel old it makes you feel ancient not really because I've already dealt with it [laughter] you're still\nFresh for what a man this is making me feel old after a while you just get used to it and can learn to accept that yeah you're still in that part where you might find it a little\nNo I think the only time I ever really the first time I ever felt like oh man I'm I'm not the I'm not a young kid anymore still fairly young but not a young kid anymore is when I heard a colleague of mine on the radio and realized that uh there was oh I Can't remember what they were talking about oh they're talking about the home run race\nThe late nineties yeah and says well I wasn't born yet they're still on the radio and he says I wasn't born when that was going on\nSo soon McGuire yeah gosh that ... that's when I was like dang that hurts All right a low\nCraig ...

public place they are following the advice of one Maxine Waters\nBy the way it can you imagine if this would have been the Tea Party a few years back\nIn the advice of one Maxine Waters\nBy the way it can you imagine if this would have been the Tea Party a few years back saying these democratic lawmakers you go seek them out you know you go get their face\nOh no I mean come on man Donald Trump saying I'd like to punch them in the face was it called the violence according to these people don't know what's it called the violence like from all of his supporters instead of just Donald Trump joking around up there but I mean you have people like Maxine Waters saying no you need to go out and get in their face they should not be welcome anywhere in public\nAnd you're right if that's a conservative\nAll hell is breaking loose on Mars seeing industry concerned or any other major news network is concerned that is going to be a case uh but now because it's left wing activists who are blocking traffic threatening drivers as we saw in Portland over the weekend\nOr because it's left wing activists who are kicking out those evil conservatives out of restaurants are now it's okay and we have to tiptoe around calling them what they are which is a mob so Brooke ball and one was the\nFirst one on CNN or to bring this up she was talking about Louis who's with the Daily Beast I Believe

David\nVan camp on the other side of the country hurricane Michael\nIt turned out to be their worst fears realize yeah category for as its slams in to Florida and you've got some updates on that day but\nA hundred and fifty five mile an hour sustained wind is what they're talking about the most powerful hurricane ever hit the Florida Panhandle\nThe other part and and I'm sure right now the important part of courses where this storm is making landfall and Mad Men are making sure that people are are staying safe as safe as possible right now\nThe storm is making landfall and then uh making sure that people are are staying save a safe as possible right now\nUm but another part of this story that I'm starting to see some people talk about is you know the track of the rain is probably going to go through the Carolinas as well which is still fairly inundated from Hurricane Florence oh my gosh they're wondering if they're going to be more flooding there\nIt's a it's a bad situation and you're right it's it's kind of worst case scenario right now didn't think this was going to be this type of a monster storm a just a few days ago\nWas that was the thing about Florence is it seemed like you know what it's not going to be as bad because it'll be a category two ... and people didn't take into account the search right this is just worst case it seems to be all the way around right so obviously keeping an eye on that\nUm if you heard the story about the teacher that asked for someone to take it for the team and take out Brett Kavanaugh that person has resigned\nYeah ah there's a special education teacher in Minnesota put up a message on a on where was this Twitter saying so who's going to take one for the team and kill Kavanaugh\n...\nPosted that on Saturday after the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh so ah apparently a she has resigned from her position right now\nShe's been teaching our kids uh-huh\nWhat does she teach when they go low we get them all it\n[laughter] right [noise] Well Eric holder today said when they go low kick them [laughter] I'm not even joking that he said that\nShe said I think and will have will have to take more time to watch that out tomorrow but that's the the short version of that story I Eric Holder former attorney general says I disagree with Michelle Obama's when they go low we go high when they go low kick him\nGood Koch uh-huh mhm well you know carry the mob though don't you dare call them a mob\nCharacter is revealed during adversity ah we've seen a lot of character revealed in the last couple of years and it is true it is ugly no doubt about that um\n[laughter] this is never going to happen this fist fight between Michael ... and dined junior and gosh yeah because ... obviously this guy isn't attention\nOr he can't get enough yeah that stormy Daniels' lawyer mhm yeah uh but Michael have announced he wants to do with charity fight against Don junior\nThis was the end result of it I won't go through all the details here there's a stupid back and forth on Twitter or that he was having with Donald Trump junior avid ... says he's in for an M M A fight with Don junior\nSays and also to make sure that ah he's getting a social justice warrior credit in ... ah he wants to raise money for Puerto Rico hurricane relief and rain that's a non profit for sexual assault survivors\nWhich I think actually raising money for that through a fist fight with a guy you don't like to defend women isn't that technically toxic masculinity\nNo\nNo I think it is I think that you generally it when you feel like you've got to burrow down to protect women that's toxic Mac masculinity that's what I'm told all the time\nNo that is not true toxic masculinity is whenever the left the sides of this [laughter]\nYeah that's when it is you just got to know the rules\nSay Michael ... he's just that guy at the bar has too many sea breezes and wind up taking off his shirt getting involved in a fist fight you know sea breeze and it's a little shot there from the end came uh I like that wow no man don't give this guy anymore attention like we just did for the last two minutes [laughter]\n[noise] you know what would you ...\nIf it were a pay per view of and do would you pay to see it you know the burrow down between Don junior Michael I mean I\nKnow you're probably not\nMy my problem here is is the ... junior think there was another professional fighter though who came out and said told ... to basically shut the hell up you don't know what you're talking about right\nNow all of a sudden you get one of those guys the real fighters say hey how 'bout you do the same charity but you fight me\nI'd watch that\nAn avid out he would say oh because he's trying to shame done junior here right like he will fight me right so you get one of the guys say I have an Audi I'll Fight you then of course they know you're a professional is what you do\nYou could go grade school and say you can tie one arm behind my back will still go that sir I Will\nPay for when you yeah mine is still on the guy\nUp the stakes a little bit what's actually bringing round arouse e for it\nOh even better Michael you're saying you don't want to fight a girl\nDid not do\nWell yeah\nAnd then she says I'll Taiwan arm behind my back yes\nAlthough it was still ... that would be pretty cool\nUm gotta give props or
