I had nothing to do that I can guarantee you that hey I'm David I Love this story\nYou have the written up in the wall Street Journal\nSo there are three writers who describe themselves as left leaning but they don't like the academic influence of political correctness identity politics what they called grieving or agreements studies\nThey think the whole thing is ridiculous that a lot of times there are academic studies that are published in their published to push a certain narrative that is ridiculous to the average person because it carries the weight of somebody who works at university X Y or Z\nYou know gets treated very seriously whenever it makes its way out in the public so what they did\nThey they put together their own experience could they fool scholarly journals into publishing hoax papers that are\nSupposed to be a legitimate scholarship\nOr with a legitimate papers actually and it turns out yeah there are ... there are publications publish these things seven journals accepted these fake papers which were written by James Wednesday a mathematician Helen ... grows a and a Peter Bouckaert saying okay\nOn the last probably I'd probably booted that last name ... assistant professor of philosophy at Portland State I'm now one of the hoax papers is from the wall Street Journal published in April by the journal fat studies claim the body building is fat exclusionary and proposes a new classification terms\nFat body building that fat inclusive politicized performance\nThe editor of the paper's gone through the peer review and the author signed a copyright form verifying authorship of the article this author put a lot of work into this topic she said it's an interesting topic looking at weight and body building so I'm surprised that of all things they'd write this as a hoax as you can imagine this was a very serious charge\nI wrote that number down I don't know if it's the right number let's try to [laughter] anyway [laughter] [noise]\nSo you know two three four years ago so maybe it's an all lover [noise] to to the\nOnly remember the outrage machine at that time does that [laughter] and now when she's on team Trump I probably anyway\nSo Trump is making a ... I'm Sorry Lindsey is making the point I you know people including Democrats have said terrible things about uh accusers before and it wasn't met with the same level of outrage oh God I have no Trump is just pointing out in that moment inconsistencies and I said yesterday man and made me a little uncomfortable that he's going after\nBut it's not that anything he said was wrong you\nKnow like I said man it's like what would you teach your kid to do that now\nHe was\nAbsolutely pointing out Archie keep changing your story ... all of this yeah he could have not done that are we surprised that he did know and it is it the worst thing you know I mean if he would have been doing like an impression of her voice that would have been way worse ...\nYou'd not he didn't really do that you know I don't remember I remember yeah so Lindsey was explaining all this okay\nWhat do you like it or not I really don't cater here's the point I think what happened to these women in Nineteen Ninety eight and making for I don't like when the president said last night and I'm the first person to say I want to hear from Dr Ford\nI thought she was handled resettling though ... was treated like brown yeah who is now\n[laughter]\nBow yourself [noise] he's not the only one in America that feels that way right and then he also played the what if game oh good for you and see\nIf she were on the other foot in an accusation\nFrom South Carolina\nAgain they nailed democratic nominee and I got a hold on it and I didn't disclose it maybe\nI waited a lead to the brands against the wishes of the lame from South Carolina\nI Would be torn apart or and should the net and I remember her to conservative activists lawyer didn't tell her that the Democrats were willing to come to South Carolina here and testimony so she wouldn't have to go through this I wouldn't be destroyed and later on when wait a minute and the reason we don't understand\nWhy are you doing this we're trying to hold the seat opened the gate and then and then term so we can take power that the Republicans and then they'll science he is now without having a hundred reporters and you're saying\nHe's right one hundred percent right yeah\nYeah who\nIs now do you spell that Lindsey Graham going gangster rap there\nWell it's fine to the get the person\nFrom the Atlantic who's moderating the efforts to stop but what happened with the whole law yeah no man he's making a point ... do you really want to get at truth here or not you\nKnow good for him [noise] I got to tell you something that's frightening right and there are so many details in this story so I'm just going to try to give me the big idea of this and get okay and it's about hacking and David many times you like I Try not to do stuff on line you're terrified of it ... bad\nPresident has said that before yes\nThis was a story Bloomberg head and it's titled the big hack how China use the tiny chip to infiltrate U.S companies\nAnd if you've seen the story then you see the up close of a person's like index finger and it is this tiny little chip\nA mean tiny\nSo like a grain of rice that what did it okay and it starts actually will sort of in Portland\nBecause back in two thousand Fifteen Amazon started evaluating a start up called elemental technologies that was a potential acquisition to help with a major expansion basically for\nAmazon Prime video\nAnd elemental based again in Portland made software for compressed thinking like massive video files inform adding them to different devices okay so you could see stuff on your phone or whatever right okay um\nSo it helps with all sorts of things like streaming the Olympic Games on line I'm communicating with the international space station and funneled drone footage to the CIA\nIt's all mental national security contracts that weren't the main reason for the proposed acquisition but they fit nicely as a story goes with Amazon's government businesses like the highly secure cloud that Amazon Web services was building for the CIA [laughter] okay\nSo as they were overseeing this acquisition Amazon Web services they hired a different third party to scrutinize elemental ... security\nAnd they it revealed all sorts of troubling issues prompting them to take a closer look at the main product the expensive servers the customers installed in their networks they handled the video compression\nGay following along you have too much stuff okay\nSo the servers were assembled for elemental by super micro computer incorporated that is a company based in San jose that's also one of the world's biggest suppliers of server mother boards\nOkay now you've followed that you're like okay ... where does the chip come into play they found the testers found the tiny microchip I'm In the mother board it wasn't part of the original design\nAnd so Amazon reported it to U.S authorities quote sending a shutter through the intelligence community\n\nService can be found in the department of defense data centers the CIA drone operations and the on board and networks of navy warships\nSo somewhere along the line as they're putting these ah machines together these computers together they wind up somebody wind up adding those other my door trip microchip into the mother board\nIsrael rain arrives right yes and didn't tell anybody about it and they're saying oh crap the Chinese can spy on us now\nYou can ... them to shake [laughter]\nI bring that up to say gosh dang were as consumers\nYou can ... them so\nI bring that up to say gosh dang were as consumers you're worried about it right and it's bigger than that and you're seeing right now the you know\nPushing bowl with us in China ... and all this stuff that's going on that none of us really know about yeah it's like holy crap and at the same time\nYou know look at their stories today Reuters had the story that states warns of new ... free from group linked to China [noise] [noise] yeah\nYou got to protect yourself on line yes you do [laughter] yeah you do the Saturday carefully about it I mean this is why when you when you start to see all the ... you know everybody wanting to do all of their finances from their phone those people\nA lot of people I Know because it's convenient I dumped easy to do all of that stuff yet there is a real risk that goes along with that\nUm and not to I mean I'm I sometimes I Know I wind up falling on the alarm aside with all of that oh it's fun to make fun of ever know smart TV I won't be in the same room with it it's buying on me but it happened I Know that was our own government but I Know the Chinese didn't have to get involved in that part of it\nAnd then you have a story earlier this week about Facebook\nOh yeah we're ... fifty million accounts were breached yeah bad to own up to that last friday\nI noticed because a bunch of bugs and Facebook systems that were exploited by hackers now in the u._k. at least and you know there is probably going to be a class action lawsuit in the U.S against Facebook you for this because I mean they haven't exactly been known for protecting people's privacy no they they're good at saying sorry\nThat's on us they're very would again right this time there was a legitimate glitch in the system that was taken advantage of by hackers\nAre in the u._k. there was a story written up in\nThe sun but said that uh the hack Facebook users at least bear could wind wind up getting six thousand pounds in compensation now it's better if you joined the equivalent of a class action lawsuit there but I Wonder I Wonder when that's going to happen\nAnd now I regret that I've been Facebook's over for a year and a half by could possibly get a little bit of the the Facebook nugget you know for the rest of us

to\nQuit I mean they won't\nQuit because they don't want to disappoint you so they'll keep doing something for fear of disappointing you and they're just not very good at it and finally they come and
