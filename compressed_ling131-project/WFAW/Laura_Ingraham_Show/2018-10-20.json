us how you know we had a good way of preparation and then you know I think it's probably easier for players and coaches to turn the page and it is for fans because [noise]\nYou know we got to come back and and you suddenly you're back at it but I really was the way they practice and yet it's still then how do you come out and playing in a and it was a good weekend [noise]\nYour parents really

the plane but those are ah each show it a little athleticism a little reaction ability those those weren't easy you know he made them look that way right\nThey have that ability and it's a it's funny how in the good players come up with those types of players and fans EJ and Ryan they'd been planning unbelievable football and and that's been fun to see him for ... to get everyone gets excited when a little while to get their hands on the ball and hopefully injuries are bad but it was a\nTeacher and I said he he and rhyme them playing\nGreat football and uh they've been fun to watch a ball

part tickets through that\nYeah we were just a man coverage him I mean all week a coach both said to him that's on the quarterback doesn't you know movies I too well so ... targeting is kinda who's kind of made a break on the ball in a major player on it so I definitely happier China ... seem I think after that we just started my own so it was a good stuff [noise]\nTeaching is if they don't feel contagious you get that interception early and you force five turnovers from a team that has turned it over all that much and had to be violent I did it feel contagious out\nThere and I think that's the biggest thing with our defense you know I think once someone makes its way which kind of feed off and we we get things wrong on and ah today we were we were talking about you know who's going to make that first plane and it was going to target so uh you know when we get those things on like that it's always a good time\nThe back end is very young or in in some cases just not experienced you know and and my doctor has been around for a fifth year senior but when you have a younger group I Know you're a linebacker you got the responsibilities but\nYou talk to those guys as well just try to

that you know why you don't pass the ball down right now it wasn't enough for me the tip of south and I'm sure he disappointed you didn't take that back to the house calls\nFor sure I mean the guy I can do a ... ah I told them all a man you should probably should've caught the first one to say I know we're a much his party's trying to catch his breath and everything so I get that but no I mean what what a guy to make a play like that and a guy who basically jobs or keep a free so when he makes a pact that it's always some\nSpecial why don't you think the first time you saw the bachelor the\nBachelor yeah man I mean the Chinese Man I Can't do\nOne first of all that so that's kind of a little disappointing but to see him get up like that as a pretty impressive what side of that\nFinal

place no matter\nHow high really you can really tell from watching appear TJ understood where the ball was going in\nThe end to end up actually kind of getting out of the dating the rap out of the way because he was out in his film study and you could tell the coaches said man his eyes lock in he locked in on that and he picked that up and that's why you see that veteran that really understands how to watch film gotten execute which was not an easy interception of any stretch\nYep well by the way I'll just on the air if you want to hang gray if you've got to get the Milwaukee or get it and we

the drift again on the opposite side [noise]\nAnd this is where the frustration pretty when I said in his bedroom nation in general is that you start with the polls dark and there's a minute on the

got\nSome life and they came out after that score then defensively [noise] with some some energy and that that's what you want to see from the other side right so I'm going to be spent them I really like and what I see a great series of events right from that standpoint but I think the interception the one I gotta feeling when they look at it [noise]\nForty bucks at least the first one was reading something different minerals wide receiver [noise] I don't know that for sure but I guess that's why it just looked like [noise]\nTwo out of a path right right what you're seeing them ... and I I don't take that away but [noise] uh I think he read something differently or within his receive or the other one is\nA he tried to get up and throw you still kinda knocked gather himself yet that the wind and in another pick [noise]\nUm but the penalty was huge threat to the the five yards that's all it was but it was a huge thing 'cause you're sitting down and ready to launch this thing in in seal the deal I'm In the first half [noise] and then you come out a little ... the country and we just started the second half and that's\nThose are the things that again when when you look at it as a coach or or in the clear how do we get this team better if we have to be able to finish we got to be able to start fast and how do I as a player than what's my ownership and that whole piece mourning eleven but how do I make sure that I take care of my business to get it done and the reason\nWhy I bring all the scenario because what the sandals say they're going to start the quarterback hard because there is to pick the sequence pot [noise] remember now momentum can change quickly in his second right you have first novel yeah [noise]\nAnd you're ruining the Illinois is reeling ten years at all Henri on the earth but yeah\nI mean to me was when you look back at all that three pit bulls little things right now there is already there all the things that are just ... it's not enabling this team offensively to be consistent it always seems like it's one thing or another little things\nRight at least the big things because that's what looking I saw somebody asked me what do you what do you want to be honest I I Want to consist of the second half of all consistency wedding we didn't get it [noise] um [noise]\nThey made some strides and they made a lot of errors were you put it on a scale and they're probably balance each other All right but they got to take a step they got to grow because the sexual regret down the northwestern certainly not going to get easier for his banged

because everything is based upon what you did last year you you pointed out to me were during one of the commercial breaks in what you're looking for allergies to do to play like he did the Orange

whatever reason it has been developed yeah okay just hasn't happened to this point but here's the thing even with two loss of her right [noise]\nYou're still in the hunt too when the west that window

um we didn't play will break so does that hurt us [noise]\nYeah I guess when people look at the national level right are you reading and playing solidly against rank the we didn't last week we rebound industry but when you when you take a look at the rest of the schedule the ultimate goal right now is to win the west to get to the championship game right as they all talk for\nA debate Illinois did they did that they got northwestern Rutgers and face for new and Minnesota right so you have two more games at home three on the road you have to be solid and each one of those games you can't
