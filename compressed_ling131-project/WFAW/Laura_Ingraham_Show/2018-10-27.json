J. ... how do they prepare why are they there every single week and I'm up and down what do I need to do better and to to make sure that I don't have the the big peaks and valleys that I can become more consistent and\nReally that's just an internal thing that the players have to do with one another and then with themselves to to see what what they can do hum that moving forward I think for\nMe a couple of things are really disappointed me today was Jennifer Taylor troubles because oh yeah this is where he's not handling it hurt I Know he's a sophomore but he has plenty of experience yeah and and it looked like he has gotten past that that's been something that's been above people up here\nAnd I know he's still young but you've got a raw quarterback out there you've got a raw quarterback out there and look he talked about it during the broadcast\nThis team desperately Mrs Zander novel he's not coming back tremendous blocking tight and they've had to go to the jumbo look now because of his his uh his ability to do that and and the thing is is that when you go to the jumbo you need that extra block her up there\nThey're not running on catching passes you can't make many variations of that and I thought the other thing interesting during the game today the loop talked about in talking\nWith wide receivers coach Gilmore that this group a wide receivers does not block well down field and that really impacts of running game\nAnd the other thing you said too is that regardless of why they miss quintet seafood I'll watch\nBecause he was abused when it came to down a field blocking he\nWas a deep threat he'd open up so many things for them what you're seeing right now is you're seeing a lot of young guys under fire who you know don't have a lot of experience in you know you were in that position that the debt it takes time and you and you want them to go right now\nBut the speed of the game it just takes time and that's why you're seeing so many mistakes being made\nRight on the phone book and the one that Taylor had in some uh is learning to measure the new quarterback ride Cohn holds a ball but polls and handle quicken Taylor may not have a warning broke may stay with him a little bit longer\nStill has to take care of the football running down to feel that he's going down to the ground a great job by the defense of I think it was an outside linebacker came and literally punch the ball and he did you notice he never tackling can write off the ball there and wham you have to know what to expect contact to secure that either with another armor squeeze it super tight\nGreat play on his part but that's something that Jay TSE a better for sure\nI'm walking down the field those are young receivers yet right to somewhere rents are freshmen summer truth or maybe Richard sophomore\nMay be a true sophomore I'm a figure that out because in order for our own game to be solid the online as to perform better our guys on field after perform better so when we get to the second level it's the one guy that you have to make miss that you have to account for as a running back\nThere's too many guys for free that the plug the gaps in and we can never get the run games are on track to the\nOther piece to them and still another line from looking today I thought he was just not that he's not dialing but he also send in regards to the special teams teams have got to be special when you have you they they failed in essence in all three phases today and you can pull a game out if you have you know maybe one you know they're not playing\nWell one that's kind of hanging on and then you have one that's special special teams were not special at all\nGagliardi is struggling with field goals I mean the thing that was that was that was a shock to see if indeed to where there's no cease to yours yeah that's right I mean you have to like to do it um I mean three key special teams penalties today\nIt just has not been good and I I you know you can you can point fingers wherever you want but hum something's gotta change gotta change now\nAnd and and quick ... in in more by what you guys have to buy into that role frightened you in a lot of times when you come into a program like this year recruited you're not on a lot of special teams in high school here's an opportunity to have an impact but you got embrace that you've got to want to get out there and play and you want to do your job of the best of your ability you can't just go through the motions people are too good\nAnd will expose things if you are are you talking about it too because you played the ...\nOf the best of the ability you can't just go through the motions people are too good and more exposed things if you are well you talk about it too because you play the position with Evan ...\nIt's a great story and an interception other first possession for northwestern today but got be a couple of times and he's inexperienced and perhaps there's a reason why he would just pulling special teams\nPlayers like that who are not quite there I'm physically they get exposed ... physically I think that he's got the tool that's one thing that is the hardest to train is your eyes she caught up peeking\nOut a little bubble screen where he broke up and the receiver just rented go route and then he's in the ... same thing on the touched down at the back in the end zone\nHe's looking at the ball coming in instead of first closing to the man to get there to try and make the ballet where the ... to ... to ... heard them for sure and and that's one thing that if those guys can get healthy then you see maybe a jump but\nThe whole aspect of now playing as a team right right you have to trust which are being coached you have to perform that way you have to execute\nThe little fundamental things and when you do that now you're game starts to grow if you continue to peak cannot trust what you're saying\nAnd that's one mistake continue to happen well the thing too is that the guys that are playing now in some key spots it's not seen a lot of things yeah there's a lot coming out on a lot of different play action they can they can disguise different things and you get caught up more in high school it's a little bit more simple here\nQuarterbacks look off to come back on the fire because they trust the receivers going to be either running backs can jump cut him make moves that you're not you're not seen before\nIt all comes together and then defensive backs are much more physical so I was younger receivers you have to learn to fight off of that ball technique things that you have to trust again what you're being taught\nBut you're the one that has to go and execute and that that's where you have to look yourself in the mirror and say I'm going to do all I can to get better at this and if if I don't I'm not helping my team in multiple guys on the team don't do that now you see a an issue across the board which\nOut on the field have seven eight six six eight nine to eight to five nine one eight six six eight nine to eight to five nine also hit us up a badger post game a Gmail dot com\nAlso love to hear from you on Twitter to our handle is that better post game we hope to hear a bit from Keller inside the locker room from Evanston more above Paul's post game press conference and more thoughts from you were trying to make sense of it all today in a while since we've had a dissect the game like this the badgers thoroughly dominated north at Northwestern today\nAnd a lot was lost to the game will talk about that too the badgers with the last five and three on the season the tree and two in conference flight thirty one Seventeen your final from Evanston more as the Ford wrap up so continues after this break and this was bedroom football\nAnd I don't I didn't see black enough on TV but just one of the Syrian state is it is certainly some games as a starter now it is it's unfair to rip tone today either\nLike the people are saying he's got to play well he played today All right but listen you and I were talking about these two guys start because bart Houston was struggling because Alex showed in practice that no one gets to see after training camp wraps up right that he deserved if bart continue to struggle he was going to get some snaps\nObviously jak has not shown that or they have not lost faith in our ... yeah and I\nThink there's a lot of trust with the guys are on the on the field with him right I can see the frustration in a jail for a couple of times he was over shot right or already over a table to do so and again all kinds of you have to be able to produce ... I think we were thirty percent on third downs in northwestern was fifty percent\nThat's how you keep drives going you your progress than you and you move on if you can't move the sticks on third down\nIt's a long day for your office and even longer for defense because you keep putting them back out that we talked about a two week we were we read you the stats for the two quarterbacks today they are virtually all the other differences that source in may place when he had two\nAnd a cone just did not yeah three three interceptions that we didn't capitalize it humanely to indulge in this game today we're sure and you know play defense\nIf you have to play defense with the team starting in the thirty compared to a team to ... to get the five when the ten or Fifteen as much as it is in in even in your own side of the football right to their inside our fifty a number of different times when you start and that's\nThat's a hard spot to be in your ... against the wall already I thought the defense for as many places are out there\nUp as long as they could and let's go back to Evanston a few minutes ago pump Chris met with the assembled media\nPlaces were author held up as long as they could right let's go back to average spend a few minutes ago pop Chris met with the assembled media [noise]\n\nTime I checked in on the line as far as what state you're in a plane is when it's over I\nThink that every time we play and it was something on the line and you know whatever happens at the end and leaders last year every year coached for that you know the conversation might be what's on the line right now but it's not until you're done playing the season that's when you\nAre in the right for whatever unions and so\nUm I think in our when you compare all week and we'll get to play this game and you put yourself all out there you know that's gonna hurt but like any player of the matter of\nWhat's on the line you know and we're into whatever [laughter] and and the ... player season and we got to make sure we do a good job of plant one game at time phone or your impressions of Jack and his first started\n... you know certainly are\nSome good things and yet you know there's some uh you go back and look at the film as you can be some [noise] some areas where you can learn from it and uh you know what\nIt's the same for any player on this team right I mean you want them to play ... and then sell them happens with any player and so um I was proud of the way he played in and handle that and I'm approached a week with the uncertainty of whether he was going on than as\nWe progress kind of had an idea okay if you own and that that's what he did a great job preparing that way and competitive and certainly those whom we should plays and like back in ... as I Do some good things to you\nKnow I'm not do you have to uh feel you had to scale back some things and not not use the company went off in the first time so\nI think this is the you know there's probably a balance there that\nYou know felt like we got to make sure we got a good plan against this defense and ...\nAnd early ... general what's the status would be\nUm but didn't feel like you know and that was part of the new Jack had worked with the ones all week and and so I didn't have anything in there that you you felt like wasn't appropriate for the game plan and but not in early you know you want to be smart and make sure that it just seemed calling it the get a little bit of a a rhythm and\nAnd um\nBut not significantly where he said what are we going to change it or didn't feel like it would be a dumb down or anything like that and and so on and then sell to these [laughter]\nGotten a ton of work throughout this year in the first actions you know game action this year but um I think you know you adjusted a little bit for each player but not\nLike we had the skills I didn't want her to some more that was probably just not being as efficient on third down and you know you know you're a rhythm going off and landing zone affected are run game and that should try to you know we saw coming as a defense\nOr didn't think it would be easy by any means but I think those are probably impact as much as it was important for us\nAgainst some thoughts and Paul after the last two they never stunned um it's interesting when he talked about never got a rhythm going out on the fence outside of maybe maybe one game this season that would apply to virtually every game this year for the badgers off in ...\nYou can maybe even go back a just a one drive with Iowa right with the right to drive at the end when it rained afford for um that's a that's kind of a drive that I look at that I would've expected are often it's to be like again you can't do it every time I'm as much as you want to because there was a very good defense you want to get sort of really good players you face [noise]\nUm and they might not know it'd be a great defense but there is individual players that can can make an impact right\nBut that's kind of what I expected our guys to look like to be able to one they had to put the hammer down to do it and that's the only time I've really seen that as a as a consistent drive from start to finish were able to score like they're supposed to win\nSome guys have to play better they gotta they gotta play smarter just like Paul said and again that comes down to accepting the coaching or maybe some of the criticism you get as a player but the coaching that you're going to be taught to the game plan to end your technique and then you're the one that has to go performing I'm I understand their young right um they're Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old\nUm but you got recruited here for a reason and you gotta figure that out pretty quick uh guys have to challenge each other and support each other on top of that too but again you have to be able to take that criticism and move forward [noise]\nAh gathers tweeted about your post game this kind of sums
