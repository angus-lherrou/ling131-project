Twenty one\nMy daughter she's looking a little pale like struggling you know and really ... you can do this you buy more miles you've got this you can do this so proud of you and it goes off in my

come on it's just the home stretch\nPushed through and you're like wait a minute I couldn't do that right now\nAnd just as I'm having that thought there was another group of women that were cheering on their friend that was running in the race yeah they're like you got this you're pretty much done you got it and all of a sudden the friend yells back at them I haven't been finished yet\n[laughter]\nYeah you're not used to love God's Ears still around with guns and roses but when you have the band is just you just like to make fun of them just a little bit but somebody making fun that sexual tribute [laughter]\nOkay what other vocalist can by bringing out at any time [noise]\nBut land these ready to go on on the campaign trail and go against these Democrats\nAre you man when you I Do wonder how this is going to shape up in November because I thought last week you know if if ah if Brett Kavanaugh if the confirmation that failed I think that would have been rocket fuel\nFor Republicans Republican voters would have got out I Wonder if you can sustain the\nEnergy that we've seen come out for Republicans in the last three weeks I Wonder if you can sustain that for another four weeks\nI'm not sure that people are going to forget this as far as Republican voters Republican women\nHave you ever heard and it's all very anecdotal and I mean we do have different poles who say that enthusiasm voter in through the enthusiasm is up certainly the highest it's been since Trump took office mhm but I have heard anecdotally just people saying I've never voted in an election in my life\nBut I'm I Am registering to vote I'm going to vote in November because of the way that this all went down and that's true for both sides of the aisle but I'm hearing that a lot more from conservatives right now\nWell do you think that it's possible but when Trump gets elected president okay there were even some conservatives that really supported him there were still\nA little scared like man this guy is a loose cannon who knows\nYou know and you could almost understand how people were frightened to have three not so much\nFor your like the entire country I'm not a weeping streets but kind of an insurance\nAlone it that's that was me and a lot of ways provide okay this guy that we can and I think you can do some good things and maybe he'll be a change agent that we need but man he worries me sometimes\nBut you fast forward to now\nPeople can see\nIt's again man it's not that people did not have compassion for Christine Ford is that it doesn't add up\nYou're absolutely destroying a guy and his family over this and I think a lot of people saw through it it wasn't just Brett Kavanaugh is bigger than that and yeah and it could go down to roe v Wade\nAnd all of a sudden it's like no they're they're destroying people they're capable of doing some really damaging things and this guy was done wrong mhm\nWe're done with that I think it will turn people out\nIn mind for Republicans more than it will help Democrats\nAnd I think the other thing too is that if you even try to defend Brett Kavanaugh or even bring up the point\nWhat will definitely motivate conservative voters is bringing up the point that nobody can corroborate her story and you're called a rape apologist and there is no better way to drive somebody to vote against you\nThan to just called in that type of name\nYou saw it on Friday after she was in college gives her speech why she's voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh and it's her picture and its stamp on it that says rape apologist you know\nPeople see that in there like those people have lost their minds yes I think it's going to have an impact well and then you've got people like this woman out saying what she's saying\nRhone ow ow Mazie Hirono democratic senator out of Hawaii been out front on the Cadillac he's Asians and it hit a new low yesterday so first in responding to Senator Susan Collins argument that they're simply wasn't enough proof or evidence that anything happened\nA while according to her own oh that's just insulting oh come on\nDown to the mountains or for I think on the line from ... will come on her little before and they ...\nThey ... from ... who I can move on to around ... or ... forming a Mormon or something here that are calling it insulting to protect us when they see things from Memphis for folks\nOn ... what am\nI I I I did like just real quick what maybe runner's said was the one thing that she is one hundred percent certain others if it ... it was Brett Kavanaugh you're right that's the argument against using this to St gives nomination because that's the only thing she apparently remembered\nRight that's it don't remember the house how she got there how she got home that day to all of that stuff\nThat was the only thing you remember\nThink about what Mazie Hirono as saying seriously she's saying\nAnyone could tell the doctor Ford was telling the truth meaning you have some sort of truth knowing brain that can just see it by the way someone delivers a message for Democrats to remind so you know that more than evidence more than evidence\nThat watched it wouldn't know she was telling the truth no that's not the way it works people lie on the stand all the time I don't know what Dr Ford was lying or not\nWe said this I don't know how many times the only people that were really know what happened mhm Kevin off for God gave but there's no evidence right that's the problem and that's what we base the country are now to run I was also\nTalking about corroborate nation and she brought up the fact that you know Brett Kavanaugh no one could corroborate his innocence either listen to this non semi gosh man\nYou don't fold on there was no crime or a\nRobbery or an arm in arm in arm bomb bomb Iran people around for an interview with her for a number on November ... they're going for her options highly whatever compromises on race and then I heard\nThere was a very common among others for harming our government or a little different like North Korea is\nNo no no no it really wasn't but OK okay\nYou sound like an emotional person that doesn't use reason I Know I'm labeled sexist for saying that that's a fact\nYou're not taking evidence well it's it's absolutely gr operation because she told the therapist after she helped write a paper about jarring your memory through therapy and hypnosis give me a break with all of this it was Thirty years later and even in those therapists notes which they would not release\nDid she really used Kavanaugh's name there because that's disputed\nRight no that's absolutely nonsensical alright are we done with Renault\nHis name there because that's disputed right no that's absolutely nonsensical\nAlright are we done with her own oh ... really say something that we get in trouble ... who'd oh it it it's not that's all there is to say again it I'm going to put you on the stand David okay go ahead as Mazie Hirono come off to you as a person of great intelligence no\nThat's fine\nI can just also bring up all the things that everybody on the west has written about Susan Collins saying gee only voted the way she did for Brett Kavanaugh because the\nBoys told her to which is just despicable\nI was listening to some of the coverage an idled okay I can get worked up about it some time now I don't want

and especially campaigns\nAnd there's a ton of I'm going on in our state right now\nAs there are and just about every other state but ah we've got a\nOnes are the the whole nation or watching a like a governor's race or the race for a Speaker Ryan seat that one is a catching a lot of people's eyes well so we'll talk about that with Jay our Ross and we're going to talk with a guy we haven't had in a while\nI as a guest and that is a Jeff plainly he served as two things you might remember state senator from Milwaukee a and he is also the ah\n[noise] ah the commissioner of railroads in our state under a Governor Scott Walker\nSo we'll be talking to him about all kinds of things one of the things that want to talk about because we brought it up last time he's on he's got an interesting new line of work I'm not going to spoil the surprise but it's [noise] I mean why don't you in your mind take a guess as to what it might be the guy who's been in politics pretty much all his whole life\nAlthough that really has no clue as to what he's doing now it's something completely different so just you know maybe he's doing some farming maybe that your guests maybe he's a\nCollecting a you know a Lionel Trains but you know it might make sense it put something in your head you're going to be wrong but anyway we're going to talk with a Joanna key a former state a super ... states it's another state or a senator and Joe is a also was the\nParents you're you're exactly right and if you get a good zinger in maybe you'll make the news as well I mean I Would like you said you're no Jack Kennedy and it was a big zero we all still remember I remember a President Reagan ongoing real bad backfire now are you when he went well there you go again you know that was another one we all remember\nA tonight to tell us where it's at and ah what is the expectations\nAre debates in Milwaukee so the fence that I've gotten is that we're going to get a lot about health care or\nJust look this week we're ... we're uh can you hold them or cut our going at it again on Twitter over health care issue the books I think are important and quite frankly Democrats were first time and\nI Want to say like seven or eight years like they're on the healthcare they're really pushing hard against Republicans on protections for greater than you think these lawsuits over the\n... the upper by Congress to repeal it that those things give them a but opening the tri into voters\nRepublicans want to repeal this protects and then you got away whereas Republicans you know there will be on the Bernie Sanders you know kind of Medicare for all Korean and try to say that this is bold and wants to be thirty two trillion dollar I Can't remember a trillion dollars\nAnd then I went to the classroom man woman and child in that you know Democrats will take over health care supportive of that stuff I'm overly Ken Baltimore's knock and we're on the print edition and stuff where it's pushing back on that and I'm sure we'll get water thing that I think part of it\nI I yeah it could get a little vicious to if you look at the ads are there is a response to as a senator state senator who has she looks kind of angry about being accused of\nYeah it's a there is a response center as a senator's senator who has she looks kind of angry about being accused of something and she says his way off the mark and so that made a you know it'd be something that she tries to perpetuate tonight could be any way\nRepublicans say\nLook if a fair thing here is the perfect spokes person on health care because you have somebody who's a nurse you know she she had a perfect platform challenge Baldwin embolism and try and take health care actually a weakness for for fear about stuff like\nPrevious and conditions about things like her votes in the family and the fed funds bills to for example protect\n'em or require coverage for a coke or implants and uh for kids or you're treating or chemotherapy famous intervene yes chemotherapy things like that they're trying to knock her on her record\nTo say here's somebody to try and take away things that you're white or against Democrats playing off and on the health care issue\nWell let's take a look at the governor's race and the governor's races are heating up and it looks like our governor is trying to change his message again if you look at his commercials anyway right\nYeah the latest one is another line about basically your calf or Tony givers um you can't afford to go back now than this one is about more about taxes that you raise\nProperty taxes are taxes on the farmers\nRaise the gas tax by a dollar up to a dollar which I guess the point of contention is race um if you recall the day after the primary\nThe governors are raised the prospect of Twenty years wanted to raise the gas that five dollars and he said no that that person that they're turning on the table then later that day said no it's not going to happen so they go back and forth about that issue but\nThe bottom line is walkers move on message of you know you you can't trust Tony ... to keep you safe because of this issue with his teacher at a middle school um to wanting to release prisoners\nCan now you can't trust him to take the checkbook safe right that he wants to raise your taxes and that's going to cost to\nGet the impression talking to folks that there is a a want it up as a base thing for Republicans we've seen various polls were\nRepublicans aren't as it is yet to turn out and vote this fall Democrats are so this may be a message for the face about taxes her fur lined them with their language Democrats being in charge too you know when the Walker campaign started with the whole as about\nThe middle of the teacher I'm doing one at work and that was his wife and we were told this is the best parts they how does it look as Tony ridge back\nAnd it has it for the questions that punch not work or to soften up the universe at all for this new line of attack about taxes that but I can start to see that that told me to watch the markup poll Seattle one day to see it already ... numbers for favorability and that kind of stuff\nAnd I I I've seen it sooner you respond or two and he gets real dark and the governor real quick and then he switched to a you know good things about Tony ... and his message if I'm not mistaken is kind of like you know you let me have a chance to give someone else a chance\nTo lead in our state is that what you're you're taken when he was from\nA part of it is the Democratic Governors Association has a group called a stronger Wisconsin and their layering and a message of that Scott Walker's basically just another politician in a foreign so and you're seeing that kind of consistent theme that talked about pre issues\nHealthcare education and roads at all kinds of ties into Walker did this for himself\nSo like the one I got an ad from the PGA going about\nYou know roads or they know\nI'm starting to medicate for example Walker to expand health coverage because he thought it was part of her campaign again reminding people that this guy ran for president saying always sit well a lot of people confidence to either career politician who did it for himself and three here's an issue that you know rather than people about healthcare\nYou care about and they\nThink that you're not going to like a Walker is an issue\nAnd they in fact not mistaken him to to be since we're going to bring it up a a ... and what do you know by any chance any time we ask you this but you know in their first comes around the corner\nThe nineteenth and a twenty six\nOh you get a gold star who could you are right the nineteenth in the twenty sixth and again I'm not much gets decided to not recently this anymore maybe one day that beats meant everything but people are so polarized unless someone really hits home run or a gap set up\nA you know you don't hear a lot of all these debates you just don't do ya\nYou know people like you know I live and breathe politics as my job but I don't know the foster care to ... an hour watching this stuff is unless I'm really into it so I think it's a very\nSmall audience and this is very important stuff I mean I lost the argument that people either don't appreciate how important states government is because they think about their local city council now mayor and the president they forget that state government is really a lot of thing that comes to your life\nOn the kind of lose touch that sometimes but if they're not very big audiences for these things and so it's watching for that gap I think as a watches a made a big mistake is the base of the next three weeks that could really kind of impact of race if the other side can exploited or through at\nNow you had a state senator majority leader Scott Fitzgerald was on my ... show up to over the weekend and uh he is optimistic about what's going on up in a box with early clerk and wanting any one hundred\nMillion dollar a tax incentive package and he's optimistic no this is going to be a ... will be taken after the election I any idea why you saw some optimistic about it\nAll you know talk to people around the Capitol I think he kind of has to be he wants to put on a positive processes are we going to make is there for\nThe issue is you know we have three Republicans who have already come out publicly so they're not gonna vote for the bill\nThey have an Eighteen Fifteen majority that means if Israel would need every single Republican left their classes plus two Democratic votes to pass the bill the problem is that I've talked to people on the Capitol I think there are more than three Republicans don't like the ... either would oppose it don't want to take it up for just for what's going to go away\nSo I don't know how many votes me now typically if you want votes from the minority party you're working with them to strike a deal if you ask Jennifer showing the seminar later she is I heard one word\nFrom either Scott Fitzgerald Roger raw fish are from apple friend whose district includes a this plant is pushing the bill or Governor Walker so it can I ask you for Democrats what they need or what they want at a compromise but you need their votes are you really being serious about trying to reach a deal and ask for them to support it\n... the capital that this is all by political cover because Roger ... you know could be a tight race the state Senate Governor Walker Christian goes well\nThe capital that this is all but by political covered because Roger officer that could be a tight race for Governor Walker's I. goes well Fox valley indeed do all this area of the time and say hey\nWe're we're fighting for you give up the time it's going to work out and if it doesn't work out to watch and they you know their past the electoral peril of not having a deal done but I just don't know right now that you get to the bath pretty electric posts watch them actually done well\nYeah you didn't give us a much evidence released captains Gerald in a ... give us a lot of evidence is why he's so optimistic\nHe's optimistic should be an optimism should be coming from hey I've got three a Democratic senators who say they're going to vote for it so let's go back to the three senators a Republican ones that say they're not going to vote port of ... that would be a senators are deep Craig and then I think it's a senator cap and go who's the third one\nWhat what we're doing with this organization gift is tackling the three ... that had the science base that has to be scalable\nAnd it has to be secular we're talking about religious transcendental kind of stuff or anything like that but just the power of of of of using meditation in the workforce a large companies are doing this all over\nThe country all over the world and\nAnd it it's just go our way of people at work or to or to take that Fifteen minutes to\nTo a cutter regroup a quiet the brain and and the science is fascinating because didn't in workplaces where this is Don productivity is up\nAbsenteeism is down morale is up a workplace rife is down all the good things that should be up are up in all the bad things that should be down our down and\nAnd it's really fascinating we're we're kind of focusing in on on two groups here in Wisconsin a boys and Girls Club\nUh and uh as well as best friend and the Veterans Administration utilize is this a lot so it's not that it's kinda goofy out there kind of fringe thing is it's really something that\nUh the the psychological community the addiction community\nOr the medical community has has greatly embrace than what we're trying to do is bring it bore into the mainstream and again keeping in mind those three tenet of secular it it's not religious base it's gotta be scientific and it's got to be scalable\nAnd other work it out to be measurable there has to be result but that can be traced back to introducing that's and it's really a very very affordable a way of approaching healthcare\nYou you send a couple of times and the science is incredible and the sciences beer which is the science said\nWell it it is that the whole genome project was was was opened up back in back in the late Nineteen nineties or the whole area of brain science left brain right brain\nA addictive brain to the researchers and again a lot of this is being pioneered at our own University of Wisconsin is is showing that that being able to\nTo kind of tap into that energy of the brain to to the ability to calm the brain and and see what what uh how that affects people who are uh who are struggling with addiction\nA Marquette University is championing this this this ah project right now trauma informed the care you've probably read about it there was a huge article in the journal sentinel a couple of weeks ago about it and uh and this is very much in the ...\nAll of that in in uh in in just delivering no tangible results and in health care for people who suffer trauma\nAnd I think if you if you don't have to Google far and wide but there's there's an awful lot of literature and just that whole issue of calming the brain\nOr the Milwaukee public schools have used this now for years uh with school called worse with a with classrooms reducing school violent or their first attempt to his Bradley tack\nWhich was a school that was known for a lot of gang activity it was known for a lot of bite the police\n... Bradley tack which was a school that was known for a lot of gang activity it was known for a lot of fight the police were always there and ah the school districts that let's introduce mindfulness meditation\nAnd there's a wonderful person in Milwaukee a ah her name as soon as the sole day you may remember from political circles her father is a Sheldon will bark\nAnd she does a lot of the training a foreign Milwaukee public schools are north western usual is doing this now a Lutheran social services integrated it into part of their\nUh employee a a part of their handbook and and some of the stuff that they do so it it ... I Know the first reaction that a lot of people have is somewhat knee jerk and it's like well what what's that going to do but I I think if you stay to your this is going to be something that it's going to be\nIt if you're going to see it in a lot more work places and it's it's certainly something that uh you know as we get to understand the science of the brain better uh is is really very practical useful and inexpensive\nAre insurance companies coming to the party\nOh my gosh yeah at not insure and I'm Glad you asked that question of the head of that non shirt\nSuffered a very devastating he actor I'm blanking on his name\nBut after that they wanted to put him on some pretty heavy duty opioid painkillers and he said no and he wanted to try\nThe or the whole the whole mindfulness meditation route and because it worked for here um everybody and I don't know how many thousands of people work for ... nationwide\nBut as part of their daily routine it built right into their calendar that they do Fifteen minutes and you know it's not for everybody I mean I don't think you can mandate somebody to to do this but I I think that\nIt strongly encourage that ... not so yeah I I think good insurance companies and embrace this that's why northwestern mutual was is embracing it because they see the wellness they see the health benefits\nAt really very little cost and you know it's really easy to put somebody on opioids and I think we've seen in Wisconsin but the just\nDevastating effect of\nThe over prescription of of everything from a\nA ... bike it in to every kind of anti depressant type of the sun well this is a a a non medical there's no medicine involved is tapping the power of of inner strength and and the power of the brain just something that we're really in our infancy and understand that so\nIt's fascinating it is it something that like I said if I hadn't bumped in to a\nA ... from from Delaware and there was a political angle here he ran for a for US Senate in Delaware law [laughter] but uh but he's still very active\nAnd in projects and and this is something that that I could really kinda think my teeth into a lot of fun\nAnd now if somebody wants to know more about this or is there a place to go ... attorney should Google to find out more\nIf if if you could if if someone is interested or the the name of the person who founded at his name is Sam beard\nBART and then the acronym of gift so just go Sam beard gift and it will take your directly to ah to the website and different publications in more links than\nThan than you can shake a stick at ... he's done a lot of work in in Delaware Delaware miles they had to Wisconsin\nWhen it comes to this and we're hoping to replicate what a what they've done in Delaware uh\nHere and it it's got a great buy in from the business community uh from the medical community from the veterans ah the universities that it's not just this kind of fuzzy thing that's out there if it's real\nMind that you need to I talked to you so you can talk to all of us about this because it is something that\nI think we should learn more about at the very least and even if it works\nI I'd be as you said fascinating and or something like ... yeah\nYeah it it's it's a it's a simple and cost effective approach to ah to health care and you know I I think if you look at the businesses in the school districts in a different veterans groups that employ\nA ploy this I I think you'll you'll see you know they'll they'll be very quick to tell you the benefit of it\nAll right well I'm not going to let you scapegoat on talking politics who just could stick around and will do that I Know you've been having a bowl of popcorn and your lap watching all this one or two I was\n... why do I do [laughter]\nAll right we're going to take a break be back with more I was a former state senator or cleanly and a former ah the railroad commissioner under Scott Walker ... to do that after a break can be back with more and stuck in the middle ... forty W.
