that one was a very well reviewed but they mentioned the way we were I saw that when I went to the theater and saw it though\nWhat do you think that thing is we because we hear this a lot teachable moment ... ... is special even today what is it\nWhat's the teachable moment what is it to you I Know what they eat age will moment is something where you and I learned when we were young guys young kids which is just because somebody says something doesn't make it true that is one of them I mean that's my teachable moment from all this\nThe other one to me is you're trying to teach kids that's boys and girls ... if someone touches you if something happens to you please no there's no shame minute tell someone about it yes\nYou should start in my opinion with the parents and then go beyond you can say generations ago things weren't talked about whatever but if it's the teachable moment yes you don't want someone\nThat is carrying something for thirty five thirty six years none of us know what happened with Dr Ford a lot of people said she was credible\nAnd even Grassley said I think something happened to her I don't know that it was Kavanaugh right and there's no evidence to suggest that it was other than her saying so but\nFor someone to carry that around for that long you don't want that for anybody to have a freedom and the teachable moment especially young people if anything happens make sure that you tell somebody so it stops because you hear about especially situations where it goes on for years and years no one wants that\nMean and that's one of the things that as far as the media goes they want to paint this picture of anybody that's conservative oh they don't really care about a woman story\nThat's a load that is absolutely not true because if you don't buy it hook line and sinker then you are the enemy you're the mortal sworn enemy\nYes and it and because of ... we have to blindly just because somebody accuses somebody of something we have to blindly agree that the accuser is right\nOne hundred percent right and if we say otherwise we're the problem is that whole that and that's where I that's where I get off the boat here man do I believe it's serious he yes\nDo I believe sexual assault is heinous an awful yes do I believe people should be held accountable for their actions yes\nDo I believe everything everyone says that's why we have trials that's why we have a jury of our peers that's why we have a court of public opinion well there's so many holes in that story but the but again I mean if if I don't you swallow the whole thing that I'm that guy\nI mean that's the problem and I hate that\nI Know that's why so many people are upset right now I Know has it I Believe Dr Ford and if you don't you are wrong and it's like you there's there'll be a area or there's no grey area\nWe're talking about a lot of people you know women men love their daughters love their sons you don't want anything to happen to them maybe they're conservative you think just because of that they don't care about sexual assault you're out of your mind\nLove their sons you don't want anything to happen to them maybe there are conservative you think just because of that they don't care about sexual assault you're out of your mind but\nThat's where it is I Know that's where we are told anybody out of the damned will misery of it where you live some exemplary life and if somebody accuses you of something heinous you're guilty that sexual McCarthyism there we go there you go thank you ...

is born\nYeah uh this one has been getting by such a permit earlier this year or just a couple of months ago actually [noise]\nUh you know this this is actually a remake of a sort of a it's been made three times before the first time being in Nineteen thirty seven so it's one of those Hollywood Story that kind of comes back to the big screen every issue decades or this time around though it's Bradley Cooper both behind and in front of the camera or ethics stars on his own directorial debut\nWhich he also co produced and co wrote the by the way a and critics so far say it's a fantastic debut a thanks in part to his co star Lady Gaga or in this version he plays an alcoholic veteran rock musician who\nStumbled upon an incredible singer in a bar decides ticker under his wing and they begin to fall in love and of course after an impromptu do wet\nOr one of his shows goes viral out she rockets to super stardom and the rest of the movie deals with the strain on their relationship as a one of the star rises rapidly and the other one fades out ah you know it it's not earth shattering stuff at its core and and and biased definition that this remake story's been told several times before but\nBoth Cooper and Gaga are so good and their chemistry together is so real and and the music that they make together so rock solid\nOr that it's already got people you know talking about\nAwards are at the very least or for the big headlines followed the movie called shallow [noise] um uh people are saying this is a showcase for Cooper as a director and and for Gaga as an actress and I think they're absolutely right uh I generally don't even really like musical but this one is pretty powerful and it's a certified fresh at Ninety three percent\nWhat are you more surprised by the fact that Bradley Cooper can sing or Lady Gaga can act\nUh uh the fact that Bradley Cooper can sing quite honestly [laughter]\nAnd we were some of it earlier and it's like it's pretty good yeah\nIt's not bad right and then the thing is got to you know she's kind of theatrical and her music videos and and on interstates performances so I don't think it's that much of a stretch to see her as a great actress but hearing Bradley Cooper saying it's like okay this guy's got ... got some shops\nThat is never usually works on paper I mean the the pop star who has to act as usually terrible and the actor who has to sing is usually awful as well as and usually they only running their own songs they just ...\nWell did you see like writing about this earlier this year people it

Parker and then later to a a disgrace journalist named Eddie Brock\nAnd and then the comics any block hold a grudge against Peter Pan that sort of fuel has raged a but he also becomes a complex character who sometimes fights alongside Spiderman so he's like understandably one of spiders most famous and then well like adversaries\nBut the movie has absolutely no hint of Spider Man in it you know due to industry politics and all that sort of stuff and I think you know it suffers for that or the character here is that he brought but it's played by Tom Hardy and he's a Web journal is to catches the wind up some shady practices by young billionaire a\nGoes researching the story inadvertently becomes attached to this alien parasite and spend the rest of the film kind of learning to coexist with venom and fight off the bad guys at this movie is weird and it's often unintentionally funny\nIt goes for a sort of a shuttle and hide effect and top you know what Tom Hardy goes at it like a hundred percent with the physical comedy and split personality type of thing\nAbout this movie is kind of all over the place and doesn't seem to know if it wants to be like a buddy comedy or a redemption story or a superhero origin movie so it really feels disjointed and\nAnd the climax with another typical you know hero fight fight say a different version of himself kind of a battle and uh and it's presented in ... almost entirely in kind of hard to follow CGI so right now it's at at thirty percent I think and and\nYou know Tom party is so committed to it that it's kind of fascinating to watch but there are a lot of bizarre lines a lot of bizarre story choices and and even an interesting story elements that aren't explored enough so I think are probably going to make a killing at the box office but I don't know how long it's run will last once word of mouth gets out\nAnd Ryan is there some confusion of whether or not this is from the marvel universe because this was through Sony has not through Disney marvel it breaks are people like thinking this is a marvel movie\nI think I think people who don't follow all that industry stuff probably could be confused or fooled by it because it does have the big marvel thing at the at the front of the movie when it when it starts\nUh this is a marvel property but you're right it's Sony owns the rights to make the movies off these characters and since they're currently lending Spiderman back to marvel\nUh they're not allowed to use Spiderman this movie so people might be confused and think oh this is you know this character is one of Spiderman bitten villains I guess we're going to see Tom Hall and playing Spiderman\nNone of that absolutely none of that in here uh so this is completely disconnected from the marvel cinematic universe and it's just the first movie that Sony has plans to roll out of Spiderman adjacent character is\nThese women simply wants fair treatment of the accused as well and ask for proof before condemnation they wanted to hear what she had to say\nThat I heard so many people say I really felt bad for her\nBut there's a lot of this doesn't make sense it just it's very it's difficult to believe it was especially when her friend so she wasn't there and doesn't know Brett Kavanaugh I feel really bad and I think something happened to her I Can't tell you how many times I heard people say that\nBut if you're on the coast it's like you you do hear that from anybody well and also a ... year putting every once in a corner broad brush and that's the ...\nYou had the argument that what does she have to gain by coming out like this the object of scoring by so many on the right why did what did she have to gain or family was threatened and she was threatened\nAnd when we heard all this well eight hundred thousand dollars to go find me campaign later who is a ... who knows that money for lecturing on a circuit that she will certainly be walking with bold open arms in book deals movie you name it\nThere's a lot to be gained here so the notion there's nothing to gain is wrong well and also\nAnd I'm not saying that's why she played it I'm just saying the same blanket late what does she have the game from this\nSeriously she started going off
