for\nNight as violent considered violent and I think it's a violent video game yeah getting our producer Greg CNN us so much not not\nLike grand theft auto recall duty ... grand theft auto taken to a completely different level\nYeah well the big new study you know we've seen this before confirming a link between violent video games and physical aggression yeah kids international study so is this a surprise\nNot ... well I mean if you're playing games like grand theft auto for ten hours a day that probably isn't helpful to your mental health\nI'm going to go out on a limb and say as somebody who has done that ten hours a day I'll eat well not ten hours a day no never that much\nTime I would have killed me if that if I had done that no I'm I'll just say there have been times when I played a lot of video games my summer here or there or maybe I played more than I should have you come out of that like\nJust your ears are buzzing a little bit because you've been focused on screen for that long so just like I Can't say I'm a better person for that I'll tell you that no that makes sense you know some people say well they're just harmless you know it's a cartoon violence others or you know more graphic\nYeah I mean I don't I don't think that you can blame video games on somebody who would shoot up a school for example I think there's something also deeply wrong with that person but it wouldn't help somebody with those tendencies\nIt could help push them over the edge maybe\nThat would probably makes sense [noise] sometimes it also seems like when you're looking and I'm not talking about Ford night 'cause it's its own phenomenon right now there's nothing out on that right now but with these other games like if you knew a kid that was in grade school but he's a fourth grader and he's going grand theft auto\nChances are his parents aren't the best [laughter] oh yeah I mean that's a great point\nTo say when you look at this study that for example what is it they looked at Seventeen thousand kids age nine to Nineteen ... over the course of seven years twenty ten to twenty Seventeen led to increase physical aggression over time yeah you can't really look at all about in a vacuum\nBecause I think you're you've got a great point if you if you're in a household where it's okay for a fourth grader to play hours and hours of grand theft auto there might be other things going on in the home that would contribute to behavioral issues\nYou know who you're judging anybody you're saying that little cycle you telling me out of ...\nI I totally agree with that a hundred percent by the way real quick crank Collins why would you say\nThat for night is not violet or you don't consider that to be violent but I mean okay you shoot people but it's not like they it's not graphic when they get hit and they don't bleed out and stuff like another video games but you're\nTalking about the difference between door and violence and violence is its own thing\nAnd again during an ass buying them it it doesn't it doesn't feel like heads don't explode like in some of their video games so it's just you know you you got hit and now you're done\n[laughter]\nAnd you're running around trying to kill other people and be found in a live\nOur cartoons violent is Bugs Bunny violent money smack somebody in the face that's the level of violence we have it just you use a gun [laughter]\n[laughter] it's not at home or fun at a gun right and that we don't need to have a gun ... running mate I won't do it in my mind going off and now I mean that Congress [laughter] hell knows if I'd had a gun I'm going to get to see here the mayor [laughter]\nA series of another study out there saying that if you do limited kids' screen time it will improve their brain function that's good that's positive and this was done with kids between\nEight and eleven and it's all ... not only the screen time but also the amount of sleep till you get and physical activity so if you meet the guidelines which is nine eleven hours of sleep one hour physical activity less than two hours of screen time\nThere will be improvement and brain function\nStudy found only one and twenty kids in the United states meet all three guidelines not surprised um and almost a third ... none\nOf them while out\n[noise] [noise] yeah it's depressing holy smokes man\nOne hour of physical activity that doesn't seem like that much to me\nOne hour a day now for a kid eight to eleven\nMaybe nine to eleven hours of sleep that seems like a dual bowl\nThat that seemed like it would be harder to do than an hour a day a\nMan in our jail rather than I'd like to know but I mean okay you're going to bed at nine even if you're waking up at six you know you're getting nine hours that's true yeah and I think the big thing is the springtime because less than two hours\nI think to me at least I'll just speak personally ... the two don't have anything to do with one another\nI don't know that it does with me either other than\nA lot of people you just can't help the way your brain works mhm and it's sort of like ... there's a few question marks with Dr Ford like this timeline doesn't add up there yeah I mean there's so many different things\nOr not wanting to fly that was you know all of part of playing the time game for the Democrats yes um and someone expose her\nYou know as far as her identity she wanted to remain anonymous\nThat didn't make sense to your friend doesn't say she was there that doesn't make sense there's so many things that don't add up and it's like are they just using this person to go after Kavanaugh\nSo if anything the sweat and the story doesn't help that you know and if it was going through your brain like well it might just buying into some sort of conspiracy here and you see a story like short ... you're like okay what is going on here I read a lot of inconsistencies yeah doesn't make sense\nAnd I think it's really interesting because if you bring if you can front Michael ... her lawyer about this you know his response was how dare you questioned a sexual assault survivors story\nAnd you know well this guy is just her ex boyfriend wouldn't be the first ex boyfriend ally about somebody which I for one I'm tired of Michael Evan ... saying that all immigrants are liars\nOr playing the game now this is how it goes this is how you got to base it on ever since that's what it comes down to put so many people don't want to do that okay what\nAbout the evidence we'll switch gears the president talking about the new trade deal that will get to the media's reaction as a second but trouble talking about\nIt yeah it was fired up at a speech in Tennessee last night talking about the new trade deals made with Canada and Mexico\nWhich is a big win good deal for the U.S I Know the biggest criticism I've seen of it is well it's ... right it's an update it isn't that positive it's a if if you if that's your biggest criticism of it it's an updated version of NAFTA but still a good thing for the country\nWhen it benefits the country yes my guy\nReplacing the job killing disaster known as a\nCandidate workout\n[noise] I don't want\nUs to see a lot more now [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] and you know we have two wonderful doctors are now their partners Mexico and Canada and listen to this and I love you to\nHe doesn't sound like my time you know that voice is very strong\n[laughter] he's rolling man him I guess I'm I this was interesting I fell out of my ... fell out of my chair when I saw this headline on CNN dot com written by David ... he's the national security expertise to write for the New York times I'm Sorry the failing New York times and CBS now he's with CNN and\nHe says what if Trump's confrontational trade stance actually works what\nWhich means he'll probably be fired from seeing him in the near future as an actor to bono agreement or us MCI is Donald Trump wants to call it bothered me sending chills up the signs of diplomats and trade negotiators around the world Trump largely got his way and now no one can tell him his bowling a China shop away won't work\nBecause it did in fact from this perspective he's he's writing from France why are you from this perspective across the Atlantic this NAFTA ... only reinforced the newly apparent reality trumps unhinged from precedents in your face negotiating style actually works\nAll three countries the U.S Mexico and Canada or characterizing this is a win win win but the leading French daily Le Monde\nCalled it like they thought their headline was Trump imposes on Canada a new free trade a guard [laughter]\nThis is the second trade pact that Trump has managed to strike because here in March following months of bluster and threats of torpedo knowing the six year old Korean us trade agreement Korea consented to a new agreement saying it wants to slash its average annual steel exports to the U.S by thirty percent\nAnd habits aluminum exports to the U.S tax better ten percent level at the same time Korea agree to double the number of American drugs that could be sold their two fifty thousand per manufacture each year Trump is winning\nAnd like John producing we share [laughter]\nSo they say I mean look you keep hearing this is just not how it's done but there are positive things happening with this guy and Trump sometimes the style of it even myself I get a little worried sometimes\nOh I think we have lower to be honest yes and but you know I mean ... if you look at the writings of people from around the world and it's not just one interview saying Trudeau from Canada got worked yeah\nAnd you can certainly make the argument we had been getting worked for years this is one of the reasons people voted for the guy so that ... that is wild\nThat it ... your winnings mind\nThat CNN had that it's very surprising I don't know if this will be coming to the states anytime soon um but this study says University of Oxford\nThree day or a weekend if that happens yeah we'd all be better at our jobs keep hearing about that you do that is one of the big keys to becoming a better more productive and happier society because\nDarren about that you do that is one\nOf the big keys to becoming a better more productive and happier society because the employees\nAre happier than talking about Fridays off every single week I miss that to where people test those out people are more productive when they know they only have four days to get it done it\nDepends on what mood you're in you know what I mean if it's just can you get everything done and that amount of time cool there's other jobs that you are I mean you just have to be there you know what I mean I'm\nBut this kind of a sudden ... for most part I Would argue the four day work week is spot on and striking that right balance between improving the work life balance it unlocking productivity gains outweighs the net reduction in productivity from working day less\nAll of a sudden I'm like man yeah that's kinda cool ... do you ever see the other studies that say we actually have more leisure time now than almost ever right [noise] I'm like okay what do we believe we're right at we try to fill it with a lot of other stuff\nMy biggest point of contention with the four day work week and don't get me wrong I'd love to have a three day weekend all the time ... again not that we have the most taxing job in the world\nOf course that friday five we do every Friday that's tough okay are you kidding me that nose to the grind kind of stuff now but uh\nThe problem is after a while you get used to the four day work week and then you're saying well why not a three day workweek why not a two day work week went on a one day workweek why don't we just have the government get ever give everybody a check for nothing\nYou're ... you're going slippery slope as we get used to things we wound up I mean we we wind up adjusting to our current circumstances in finding problems within them\nThat's just that's just the thing about human nature it's not an inherently negative or positive thing it's just something that happens while you're trying to kill fun I don't understand three day weekend for a lot of people\nKind of cool I mean if you ever get to some people do this they get to the point there gig where they can actually do that you know different people whether they build their own business or if uh you know some people in the sales industry they\nPut up huge numbers they told the employer hey I just want to go four days a week and I want to take pride it's awful absolutely not well then I'm going to take all my skills out the door as I could hold on a lot of times people have more power than they

one of the top government funding mechanism oh there is on the property tax and it's gradually ... gone down over the last Fifteen Years and this isn't this isn't just the Scott Walker ... problem

the starter\nUnlike you know say the ... the other side of our guys can go but then they say but then they're both in the craft beer so but I just kind of have the same powerful nobody really knows what to expect from the brain it was\nA lot of it is for real tough it's going to be obviously the closer to play a lot but with a whole hell is that is that the that is a defense the brewers haven't always has the second because all of it\nAnd it's been welcome ... ... for the ... so we shall see I I don't know if any of the national league is playing as well as they are going as well\nI Know
