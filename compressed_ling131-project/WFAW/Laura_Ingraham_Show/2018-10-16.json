Stormy Daniels 'cause if you didn't hear the story a judge's tossed one of the lawsuit to Stormy Daniels has filed against President Trump basically saying yes First Amendment freedoms to talk about her\nOr in any way he pretty much chooses nano so she's going to have to cover his legal costs as well while so President Trump gets on the old tweet machine judge federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump Trump is entitled to full legal fees quoting Fox News [noise]\nMaybe I does own commentary saying great now I can go after a horse face center third rate lawyer and the great state of Texas of course he lives or she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total con or space that is the president of the United states going a porn star horse face\nWilbur load of this story [noise]\nOkay at the time to be okay but I say it\nRight the first reaction when I heard that um I shake my head and I laugh I'm like oh my gosh I'd say a Mr President Bush said man I'm here to help not hurt that that's not helpful James I'm just saying\nNo to the president saying oh First Amendment protection All right I'm I'm bringing out horse race now\nHere we go ... ... ... ... that's ... that's not a household\nNeed me to do that you really don't need never expect to hear that from you know they're saying\nBut you laugh\nOh I'm a total hypocrite yes listen there was a buddy of ours that I just saw in the hallway\nThat from you as saying but you laugh\nOh I'm a total hypocrite yes listen there was a buddy of ours that I just saw in the hallway is what's going on today and I'm like Belgium just called Stormy Daniels ... oh my gosh that was the first reaction but now I mean you say your [laughter]\nI suppose the people that hate Trump you know there's nothing that can be done the job or going to change that\n[laughter] I don't think so [laughter] when you go to somebody or ... you know those that support probably at the same reaction like oh my gosh he actually did that [noise] but yeah it's it's you don't need to do that\nAgain when you teach your kids to do that sort of go back to the hypocritical thing is yeah you laugh about it where did you teach your kids act that way no yeah\nBut if you got to know from the principals saying that he called ... that your son maybe called somebody who\nWas saying bad things about him go their horse face would you chuckle a little bit on the inside\n[noise] well you would understand it I mean yes I mean the the thing is and we all know this from her book she really took a shot at the manhood do you know what I'm saying right if you remember\nThat whole thing I can guarantee you know I Know I Know I Know I don't smoke is on that thing it looked like toad Mario ... to say that either\nRight so yeah I mean I I get it usually you're wanting to take the high road [laughter]\nAnd and to feel hypocritical even saying\nThat yes you always bring up that would you teach your kids that's my biggest fear about ever becoming a parent is that if my I Know my kid will do some stupid things oh yeah I Know that and I also know that I did a lot of stupid things as a kid mhm things that I Wish I could have back\nYeah\nBut at the same time I'm I'm so afraid that I won't be able to stop laughing if he does something like this that do you know from the teacher called a girl horse face the first question that's going to come to my mind is welders you got to have a worse fate\nNo no no no that's terrible you\nKnow the worst is when it's something they picked up from you I'm not one of your better qualities that than they do ... that you really would rather than not that's one of those things\nMeanwhile an antelope named Taylor Swift completely different story [noise] this

city\nOkay to where I got it right just so you know so anyway\nIt was a zoo keepers we are never ever getting back together [laughter] you could name hair every Taylor Swift song now in the ... maybe that part of it uh I was able to shake off her handlers for quite a while\nAnd we say every time this happened to\nBeen able to generally guy the guy down the halfway\nAnd up the back road to her off exhibit holding area recaptured only after about Fifteen minutes all\nAs well they're well it turns out that this Taylor wasn't so swift\n[laughter]\nDavid Campbell reporting for you on your side [noise]\nBy the way Roger adultery and the news that you see this\nHow's that for a Segway that's a great segue yeah the well he apparently he has a couple of kids he knew nothing about now he found out about this about twenty four years ago it was on its fiftieth birthday but he's just talking about it now in an interview with the u._k.\nSmear Seventy four now but when he was fifty he found out he was the father of a woman he'd never met\nSo we got in the mail this photograph of a woman's mind went back at him and he says the resemblance it was uncanny than to more women later contacted him after finding his name listed as their father on adoption papers so we had a one night stand with somebody\nGot a good guy at least three women pregnant while and then winds up years and years down the road these women were given up for adoption and so ... years and years down the road they do to contact and they find out who their dad is and they say oh my gosh Roger Daltrey is my dad\nMy fear is then it's going to be a war and marketing and the ads are going to get crazier [laughter] it's not just me and the lady you're going to be in this tough looking at a sun side\nBut with this pill\nIt's like three times a day [laughter] I don't I don't need any more the crazy yeah it's just the price is fine now now now now farmers\nAre saying what we can do is we can direct people to our website that will have the sliding scale of costs and all that stuff no man put it on the freaking TV ad\nNo I mean listen man\nWhen people can go online and see how much it costs in Canada and it's one sixth of what it costs here they're ticked off there like this doesn't make sense it's not about well a company you know shouldn't be able to make money no absolutely uh companies should be able to make money\nFor something that you need you shouldn't be held hostage for it I think that's what Trump is being been saying and that's one of the things that has resonated with me now I Know he's about this so you know we'll see where it goes\nYou know the whole healthcare thing man we really haven't made much games there but a lot of games in different areas but not so much um in that area [noise] ah I don't know if you saw this story very interesting\nThat if you have a late model Honda watch out somebody might be trying to steal the airbag outta there\nThis was out of USA Today I didn't realize this was a big issue stealing airbags yes and the reason is because these can make a whole lot of money when the stolen airbags\nI didn't realize there was a there was an airbag black market\nYes there is they tell the story of this one woman in the California that went on to her car two thousand seventeenth civic parked in her driveway she's like what the heck is my first reaction was shocked like what the hell why do they need an airbag that's\nThe story goes on and she's not alone criminal throughout the country are stealing airbags out a relatively new Honda cars for a parent resale to questionable repair shops or unsuspecting online customers\nAccording to police records and this little bit of research from USA Today this is Miami New York DC other parts of the country they've noticed a flurry of recent deaths the national insurance crime bureau estimates that fifty thousand airbags are stolen every year\nI have never in my life covering news are doing this show or just in life heard of anybody stealing an airbag\nAnd why it's lucrative they're expensive prices sometimes topping a thousand dollars and then they used ones\nAre easy to portray as brand new okay 'cause I was I was that was my fall on the question is are they of course there the you've so they're not up front about anything but are they selling them as they used their bags 'cause I don't know if I'd want to buy used airbag\nSelling his new okay but\nCould you tell the difference I Me personally right you know\nMost people can't 'cause you gain entry and then you cut open the steering wheel and then extracted device\nThat brand new [laughter] sold on line\nAnd\nYeah I mean so they said it used to be ... stereo it'd be the thing that would be so yeah right well for the most part a lot of factories stereos are pretty good compared to the way they used to be so those are tougher to get out than the ones you just have installed yeah\nOh man my sister one time living in South Boston it was like two times in a relative's apartment complex car got busted into for the stereo you know it sucks is the first time she just got to replace got the window replays got a new blower in stereo system sure enough she's in the parking lot what's been a week\nOr gets broken into again stereo stone I said maybe you\nAs long as you're living in this place maybe you should just not replace the stereo\nI Know well and sometimes it could happen in a place you couldn't believe I'll never forget this Nineteen eighty nine Rolling Stone steel wheels to her I'm going on a road trip is about a three hour bus trip before we go we're in like a bigger shopping sort of plaza\nOr to get some much before we get on the bus and I was driving a pickup truck at the time had a nice stereo in it park it lock it going to grab lunch come out I mean this is like Fifteen twenty\nMinutes later oh man windows broke stereo gone\nIn broad daylight you're like you gotta be kidding me man you know and all my cassettes to oh no not the cassette she I saw it might get set ambitious goals I didn't buy cars singles I was a guy\nYou know why it had some mixtures you know because I had those up one albums you transfer those set but then there were originally bought cassettes right\nThe original appetite for destruction God [laughter]\nIt was hard to enjoy the stones concert what I'm thinking about my stereo and then what's going to have\nThe windows still broken my truck I Hope it doesn't rain it's all that stuff yeah hard to enjoy a concert that way but back to the original story of the stone airbags\nThe question is why behind as why the late model Hondas authorities are not quite sure\nI don't know if they're the easiest wants to get out\nYeah there has to be something like that I mean I Would think like that and ... they're not quite as tamper proof 'cause my biggest fear if I were going to try to steal an airbag out of a car would be that the airbag was going to deploy\n... to the phones and that's that can be a pleasant experience yeah especially if you're holding something sharp that you're using to cut open the steering wheel you don't want I Would assume there's something in that data easier to get out you can't trust them as easily or something like that\nUm it's also because there's been so many airbag recalls yeah in recent years that the demand is up I bet so there you go watch out for that or something else out there you're more of a fan of Louis see gay then may\nMhm\nHe lost thirty five million dollars an hour when everything went down with him\nI bet the whole bunch of creative projects all gone\nHe lost his movie memory had that it was oh it's called but it was about to for me or my goes about started making the rounds and everything and and and so his movie wound up getting pulled from everywhere it was going to be shown and you I I'm not surprised at all that he would lose that much\nYeah everything was get bowl at that time [laughter]\nHe said it's been a weird year [laughter]\nCity [laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter] no one can see my facial expressions of show as well it wasn't the only they can take it [laughter] he jokes he's been to hell and back you know\nNo one can see my facial expressions I show as well it wasn't the only they take it [laughter]\nHe jokes he's written to hell and back you know when he tried to raise the comeback ... sorry\nThat you that you're feeling that your careers ended because you used to do that in front of women against their will here the real victim era where we\nGot another show you said it's been a weird year I've been to hell and back and I met Hitler while I was down there [laughter]\n\nBut Hitler angle always always good yeah I don't know why they keep doing that but yeah he said I lost thirty five million and an hour and when I brought that up to you all very you're like yeah that sounds about right that could be\nThat is\nIncredible I just assumed that it was maybe not thirty five but tens of millions probably uh other stuff that we got to get you out there well there's certainly more on all the Elizabeth Warren stuff with the DNA test\nOr this battle between Stormy Daniels and the president goes on ah\nTheir royal news that I Know you're going to want to know David okay so Megan my will want to get into it I guess ...

marketing van cam show\nThe marketing van cam show\nI'm Jamie markedly that saved man camp why\nSaid it was not a great idea\nThough the horse race thing so yeah Trump cold Stormy Daniels horse face on Twitter and yeah looking up at the TV monitors its war on women at all that stuff and he adds predictable\nBut it's also bringing back Carly Fiorina\nOh [laughter] which I thought she handled really well if you remember that there was was it Rolling Stone\nFor the Daily Beast I one of them had this story about Trump Card with the arena during the primary um\nAnd saying look at that face could you vote for that face right and I thought she handled it really well because it the next dad was a stroke of genius\nWhere was it was featuring a lot of women in professional settings a lot of young women as well in school right and saying look at that face and all this and and I thought Carly Fiorina did a great job it wasn't panicky wasn't hand wringing its not saying can you believe about bad Donald Trump is it was about empowerment\nBut what a choose for his fields like see how he uses toward women and going after their looks and all of that stuff yeah\n[laughter] you know it that's why I'm like OK yeah a lot of a show like oh my gosh you kind of laugh you know like is it helpful\nThat's all I'm asking is you know I mean how not to hurt\nJust asking if it's ... that's ... ... range back in the news that can't be good and\nUh no I Can't read was booted off of a flight from LA to New York she apparently became belligerent after she was given the wrong so he didn't get a pillow either until she was very angry\nAccording to TMZ she wanted a window seat you didn't get a window seat that you wanted a payload and get a pillow\nThe plane was taxing when all this was going down wind up going back to the gate and she was escorted off I listen I Know she's not and they list or [laughter] she's not going first class that was the surprising thing to me it is that it looked like at best economy plus and I'm thinking jeez\nFall from grace maybe she just wants to save some money that's good okay\nBut I mean you can't be than demanding a seat you know hey I'm ... ball then go first class right so yeah there was this video of course we go to the world we live in a flight attendant was talking to her\nTelling her she have to gather all their belongings when she got her bags and a little dog the jihad weather and walked off the point you didn't really put up much of a fight when she was going off but apparently a got a little rough\nWhen she was interacting with the flight attendant and it's been tough times for recently\nThey meaning what the last ten years maybe if dean that's that's why I keep saying I just I Want to have a ranch where we can take a former child stars are pop stars and they can just go like ... a grow soy beans or something like that\nAnd just walk away and get away from all this pop culture nonsense [noise] because that would save them maybe\nOh are you going to play the audio of her\nOh yeah this was on Australia's today show just a couple of months ago remember oh it was a disaster\nAnd I'm all for a hair and I will tell you I mean this guy asked have had a Volvo or had a hand in hand I rarely went out of\n... does this make you laugh or make you said\nKind boat but yet it does make you said this is again why I Want to have like the ranch rehab branch yeah just go buy a plot of land out in Montana or something\nYou you know it's almost like ah [noise] this is what you want to teach kids you want to take a picture of terror read in the late nineties okay and then you want to take a picture of her now and play that audio okay she and tell a young man okay looks fade okay character matters\nThat really does hot as will fade mhm okay [noise] same way you can show like a picture of Johnny Depp\nHere's Johnny handsome young she's these eccentric here's Joan Johnny now beating women allegedly well the thing is that what will matter and push back on the\nJob Johnny Depp thing 'cause the consumers don't seem to really care much about Johnny Depp as a white feeder\nNobody cares about that consumers don't but if you were dating him would just like no I care I never see another movie as long as I live as just an example of character matters that's all that's all [noise] okay\nOther stories out there what is the story if you could tell me how cops used to read those to solve a problem\nTo there was this big pig the size of a mini horse they say wandering around a string of San Bernardino county sheriff's office gets the call about this the pigs running around the neighborhood people are freaked out 'cause pigs and get aggressive all that\nSo the cops come out they don't know how to get the pig lower the pig into a pen till they wound up using the readers that one of the deputies just kind of hat or a car because you get to get a bag of chips out\nAnd leaves a trail of chips and the pig follows step by step and that's how they got the pig [laughter]\nI don't know if maybe the pig got into a weed farm somewhere nearby\n[noise] no word on whether or not it's cool ranch or the nacho cheese we don't know we do not know that\nPart of it you know speaking the ... the other day I forget the story I was reading it had something to do with a\nYou know eating better if you're on the road I think it was because we were on the road and I saw a piece that there's an app and I downloaded it about what to eat if you're gonna do fast food what's the healthiest option at all these different restaurants right\nAnd I look in there's taco belle ... and so I go on or tacos the second healthiest taco at Taco Bell is the nacho cheese to wrote us logos taco\nReally yes crunchy talk the crunchy taco is the most healthy then the nacho cheese Doritos third is the fiery thrills logos taco fourth is the cool ranch Doritos logos taco and then the soft tacos after that there's a prize\nCars that goes there but crunchy corn tortilla shell is better than the the flour tortilla show that's what I'm told us calories or saving on it yes\nSocial flat a flash points in our country right now one of them of course his race relations\nAnd the other being the me too movement yes both together\nAnd here you have now a woman who was claiming that a young a nine year old I mean not that it really mattered ultimately by nine year old was a black kid and she says you touched me you grabbed me I'm calling the cops\nOf handling this like a mature adult and if you think this happened you can turn around and you could maybe say something to a kid or to the mom or something or you don't have to call the cops no no\nI have no idea why I don't know this person I don't know if that happened because of the nine year old was black or it would've been the same if the kid was white Asian whatever you have no idea but I mean she immediately like freaked yes\nAnd this is one of the things that I Know this this gets a lot of flak whenever somebody brings this up the president has brought it up others have that you want to make sure that in the meat to era you're not reaching hysterical levels meaning you or not it doesn't become literally a witch hunt\nYou know this is a danger of you know the women need to be believed heard yes automatically believed no because sometimes people do either misunderstand something or lie\nBut those ads and when the president and others say it is turning into a scary time for young men this is exactly what they're talking about cars that nine year old must have been free Tibet hell out because he's got this adult claiming that he groped her\nHe didn't he has no idea what's going wrong saying the cops are going to get called right\nThat is terrifying stereo down about it and when you bring that up that doesn't mean we need to keep covering up sexual assault and rape no but we also need to make sure that we're not throwing people into a state of panic where they're going to scare the hell out of a nine year old over a misunderstanding\nWell and another learning lesson of this if you're ever in that situation most places such public has a security camera because then she was shown the truth yes it's his backpack or do you get a ... now she is also getting\nThreats and all that and of course that's nonsense as well leave her alone she's an idiot leave her alone yeah now she's apologizing now Teresa climate climate is her name this was with a inside edition\n... what I thought was [noise] across all I Know what was happening I regret that I thought it was over ... I should send flu shots so I said\nOkay well ... she owned it to him I didn't need to know both cheeks and I got the idea from the video I'm just saying you\nCan't tell the difference between a backpack getting your button somebody's hand grabbing your but\nI don't honestly I don't know if you could not excusing the way she reacted but if it's brushing and cry on it could be a hand it could be part of the backpack\n... you know I don't know I'm not testing it out the butcher backpack away crying [laughter]\nI'm not doing that [laughter] me does not do it at the gloves are way too man I don't know why you're leaning over there and this is weird you know I just made me think of this\nAnd I didn't touch anybody with my backpack okay but on a flight out of Dallas\nI mentioned to you to this the other day was the whole thing with American Airlines now\nThe whole day you lose an inch in front of you with your seats yeah only packed in yeah the c._e._o. last week said I flew in their seats are more comfortable [laughter] that's a long no one's believing that oh my gosh I mean it's and\nI'm not like one of your taller\nOr polish people who have six to man it is so cramped but even walking down the aisle I was sitting there thinking just with a backpack on you're trying to walk in a straight line I don't know how you can hardly do it without bumping somebody up rushing across somebody from your right or left\nIt's that crazy by the way I also forgot to give you an update on how the uh [noise] what is the politically correct way of saying stewardess now flight attendant thank you uh where shaming people before they got on\nNow\nDon't just mean ... when you're going to put your overhead on now we're trying to do this in a good amount of time so don't just stand there\nMeandering around getting your carry on and get it started and then get seen it in ... I don't I have no problem with that and the funny thing was I could hear different people within earshot going mostly shaming us great it was just the reaction was funny and so then the announcements over\nAnd then it's within a minute she comes back on [noise]\nOther thing there's only so much room for the carry on now if you have a purse you have something smaller don't me putting it up in the overhead\nOne other thing there's only so much room for the carry on now you have a purse you have something smaller don't\nBe cutting it up in the overhead storage [laughter] because other people have bags that you need to put their I also don't have a problem with that either it's the\nTone it's just customer service Oh thank you so much for letting us fly\nWith you today [laughter] any requests you have we want to make sure to make it easier for you I Can't wait to get in there and get cramped up cash\nThey have a tough job and you have to learn all year you had to deal with people who don't\nIowa freaking ... uh-huh\nGash alerts from customer service for crying out loud there are other airlines the don't treat you that way and I love that you have several choices out there\nAnd we know that's why you're important no I don't have other choices because in the book through the group but it's up to me or I wouldn't talk with you [laughter] okay I just felt like a challenge got Robin ...

in our state I Know that a candidate for US Senate or leave a mirror has mentioned it that she would like to see the president come and campaign for her uh she's running of course against the

Jorgensen thanks for joining me and we're going to talk to one of my former\nColleagues now serves to the United States Congress congressman mark Pocan how you doing mark\nHey getting anything\nWhile the show is called stuck in the middle is there a middle left mark have you checked out\nThere you know even a left or right\nBacterium continuum issue that we have right now\nDonald Trump is become a cult leader\nBroken the Republican Party and now it cult of someone who has a few issues they talked about some devoted followers earth a functioning government so\nYeah I don't even know if there is a left right secular Mandiant yeah the problem is nothing happened to ... you know they're ... they're in charge of everything\nIt even more broken than just along those lines\nI haven't talked about it but yeah you know now he's tweeting he called somebody just shouldn't matter who it is but uh it's Stormy Daniels a person and he called her a horse race\nI mean and then I hear a Trump supporters are friends of mine say oh he's the most picked on President of all\nEverybody's so critical of uh what would you go around doing that uh you know calling someone a horse race was trying to remember what I have a lot last time you use that to name call anybody probably about ... back in fifth grade but I don't even know that I did then I mean as a U.S congressman\nAnd last time you use them to name call anybody probably bother you back in fifth grade but I don't even know they did then I mean as you as congressmen and you hear these things out and about how do you feel when you hear that our our president's acting like that\nTaking a step back\nHow many presidents have had public fight with foreign start [laughter] that's the first problem right that there is a guy keeps these things up\nAnd uh you know today he had executive time which means you didn't have anything on a scale under\nSo he watch Fox News in the morning get wound up he's been tweeting all day and all sorts of subjects but this is the most on presidential behavior of any president says I remember in my life size so you know I I think the first problem that not that he's calling someone a name but why are you picking\nSocial media fights with porn stars if you're the president of the United states\nAnd meanwhile people are suffering and part of the United states from a hurricane and uh you know that ... just does not use I don't think very welcome but you know ... and let's talk about who's going to shift\nTo your house and Congress a lot of interesting races going on one very close to home\nRandy braces running against Ryan styles are for the seats are occupied by the speaker of the house Paul Ryan you know I saw that killed her ... brace uh he's got to Vermont senator and presidential pool I'm not too long ago Bernie Sanders\nComing to ... to stump for him do you think ... deliver him President Trump Komen a campaign for him\nYeah [laughter] well I I think uh I think he's trying to hide as much as possible you know it's funny I'm Brian style is running against Washington and he says you know we have to bring a ... Wisconsin to Washington he hates wash it in style politics\nAnd yet this is the guy who went to law school in Washington he worked for Paul Ryan as his driver in Washington and and now he's trying to play\nA some different role at bottom line is you know Brian style is really a quite a bit Washington style and that again he is trying to lie to people about that but my guess is\nThey'll try to distance himself from Trump but you know I I'm going to be at that rally as well on Monday to help out around your bright you know they are spending so much money\nTrying to attack him personally distorting his personal background\nAnd yet they won't talk about health care and they will talk about a good paying jobs and they won't talk about the corruption in Washington After the Trump Administration because they know they lose on all the issues people actually talk about so\nA Paul Ryan superPAC has been putting out all these unbelievably over the top are lying negative ads and a good old Brian styles says well I have nothing to do it that those are third party ads\nAnti you know because you are in politics that total BS right um you know this is his his former boss or his support or in the primary and the general Paul Ryan's superPAC and he acts like it or alien from Mars who came up with these and then he has no idea how to call them up and asked to have them take him down\nSo you know if you're white Washington dial a politics he get it with a Brian style I think that we that two hundred and Thirteen lawyer to go to Congress who\nNow wait a minute and he says you can as a manufacturing being background he's helped create jobs are smart\nYou know actually what's interesting and I wish if I if I could be in the debate for them I Would love it\nBecause that you know he keeps saying that but the only thing a lawyer does when they worked for a manufacturer like that it's figure out how to legally\nOutsource the jobs that both the company he worked for in his adult life as a lawyer or that they send jobs overseas so he's not in charge of recruiting training developing job\nHe's in charge of legally figuring out how to send jobs overseas and Mexico that Ryan styles of you watch um the stereotypical a Washington style person to go to Washington I'm Dave Ryan styles your guy but if you want a you know take an average person\nThat just like the rest of us to go to Congress who understands what it's like to sometimes live paycheck to paycheck you've got another alternative Randy Bryce\nLet's switch over to the governor's race you mentioned no cure the governor's talking a lot of health care these days you and I served under Governor Walker and ah I don't remember him talking a lot of pre existing conditions in wanting to bring that back then what's changed ... voted no\nYeah what's changed is the polls are wild about people don't want to give up\nA health care if they have a pre existing condition that made you know if you need health insurance everyone wants to make sure they and their family members and their friends and neighbors have health coverage and the problem is Scott Walker is a part of a lawsuit that's trying to right now break us from having protections for pre existing conditions so\nAll of a sudden he's but once again reading the whole\nI Try to change his public stance but the bottom line is\nEasy to avoid the action he can show us he actually wants to protect preexisting conditions that just dropped the lawsuits that would rent or preexisting condition coverage and yet he wants to say everything bought that so I Know where Scott Walker that he's in the pocket of all the big\nMoney special interest the big insurance companies and big pharma to make an awful lot of money I add right now until November sick is going to be a champion of the people and on the seventh I'm sure he'll be back on that same plane a visiting with the Koch brothers Sheldon Adelson or some other big special interest but a lot of money\nWell one question is uh you know because he is or not you're bending on or not to go into a gas tax returns like Dan wonder roads that he may run for president again do you think he might do that\nWell I think that this guy and it's clearly that's what he has wide said he's made a lot of decisions that were not the best interest of the people Wisconsin\nBut we're in the best interest of the big donor class for the Republican Party nationally when he ran for president the first time and you know clearly with Donald Trump right now at\nA national lows the popularity and the more investigation going out and I think he's hoping there might be an opportunity to ears are once again but you know we know what happened last time he ran for president he forgot he was governor of Wisconsin and we didn't get a lot done for the state\nYou know when it comes to health care or you know you hear a lot of Republicans talk about we gotta we gotta get rid of Obamacare and start over what what was the problem a mark why couldn't we just\nI I don't think anybody even for those who were in support of Obamacare a son who is perfect for things to fix how can we just didn't make those things\nThat would have been the logical approach right I mean part of it as you put something out there you find out\nWhere the ale various affected industries learned how to find loopholes then you fix that cleared up so that you can make sure that more people have health coverage and that we're trying to lower the the high cost curve of increases in a health care and prescription drugs\nBut set of doing that the Republicans wanted to play this other games to protect those special interests\nAnd in doing so they were willing to risk our pre existing condition coverage so you know to me it's pretty easy um\nThis other game to protect the special interests\nAnd in doing so they were willing to risk our pre existing condition coverage so you know to be pretty easy to know what they're up to get America are a lot of Republicans say they are they also understand what the Republicans are really up to when it comes to health care\nAlright and finally uh five thirty eight dot com for all your political junkies you know what that says it's a a website to there's a guy named Nate Silver he really gets into polling although uh this last presidential go around and do such a good job but usually he looks at some things get a few things right\nIn Wisconsin are made it into the category under where Democrats could break a Republican trifecta and he mentioned Wisconsin in Iowa and they say Democrats best shop shot in a at busting the GOP monopoly is also through the governors offices but one state legislature a cheaper could fall and he stayed\nNeither one of those I think we'll have a concert so\nIt's going to be interesting crowds have been nice we had eleven thousand six hundred and twenty eight there are a couple of weeks ago uh for a family day now that I'm not sure the crowds and will be quite that big this weekend but you know will be under six seven thousand range if all goes well unless of course the weather turns miserable than people tend to stay away and actually listen to already and Gary\nSimon to check the forecasts but if it's a day like today be perfect day for football absolutely\nBut I I'm I'm hearing maybe a little bit of rain late friday afternoon friday evening late friday evening in some of that lingering toward\nOh I Want to say I'm a Saturday morning but uh\nYou know the three weeks ago or whatever where we are no but I'll ask our last one way and we had rain leading up to the game with the Oshkosh at home then it stopped it was it was it was cloudy and you know a few drizzle here and there but it was pretty nice for the game so hopefully we'll have the same conditions here for Saturday and a good crowd\nAll right now that that's one forty hour broadcasts time ah you know the whitewater versus River Falls and\nCool or one of six point five FM and or I should mention to a Thursday it's more on the air I should say Thursday night after night I'm not on tomorrow CMRT Russian things to have a it is a rex is hosting the

point five FM this Thursday night All right well let's say kind of go around the horn here all the different things that are going on\nA lot of people very excited about the Packers win last night but that was one of the worst teams and put all of them was well it almost appears\nOf the Green Bay Packers made them look like one of the better teams in pro football but uh uh you got to give their coach Shanahan a lot of credit because he uh he he ... to ... I I don't know if he was redesigning the often says they play the game last night but he ... they they they were nice being through the Packers left and right and they made some critical mistakes of at a savvy veteran I'm\nA ... and Richard Sherman I Believe his name as a he committed a very a foolish penalty with time running out where it could have been going to overtime or you know you've got a chance at a flip a coin and ... of the coin and maybe getting ...\n... in overtime if he scored a touchdown first the game's over if you take a field goal the other team gets an opportunity to go down either tired or go ahead with a touchdown\nWell that wasn't going to happen because with forty three seconds left Mr Sherman committed the no no gave the Packers an extra pilot yard at John the penalty and a\n... a what a what a turnaround for kicker Mason Crosby while while he misses for the week before out of five many makes for the for last night so great to have fifty one year it's the one yard Sandy I Can't kick the ball\nFive yards wide [laughter]\nWell maybe the shoes I wear a baby yeah ... that's all about the issues as well that was the hackers they have a by next week this comes at a good time\n[noise] um well I think so in in ... not so much ... by virtue of the fact that they've probably got some people who are ailing ailing from you know they hit the constant hits that are on your body you're every part of it in practice and everything else back there\nThe fact that they probably got some people who are ailing ailing from you know the hits the constant hits that are on your body you're every part of it in practice and everything else back there a lot of coaches are starting to go away from tackling and practices or at least a lot of tackling um practices but uh\nYeah they've got to daunting road games coming up they go to Los Angeles to plan on being randomly now now they may still be on beating we know that I think they played this week the rams I I'm not sure and then of course you're going to go to New England um that's\nThat's a tall order Detroit meet them and they didn't yes yes yes and and the New England has two losses so\nTheir readable ah they were beat them all the other night until Kansas City failed to stop them at their what scares me about a New England is that off and on Saturday and Sunday night I always saw about the last quarter maybe a quarter and a half of that game\nThey're starting to click I mean they're starting to move the ball up and down the bill almost that will in Kansas City has\nA fairly decent ... from what I Know I mean they're not what they've been in the past\nBut they have a fairly decent events in New England rolls on them\nAnd and the bears we need to thank them they they are doing what they can to keep the conference close sweating all boys or he got an eleven point lead with the eight minutes left and you lose in overtime nice job nice job bank you've ... you've got to say thank you and nice job Rudy Rudy gets your whatever his name well no he's a little farther back then\nThat's when I grew up on Packer barefoot ball Rudy ... was the best quarterback and hello and Jack ... and then a wall my goodness well wow I'm showing why where\nYeah I guess you are and Rudy ...
