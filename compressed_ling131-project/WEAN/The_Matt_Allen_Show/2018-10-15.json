I filled out or I got to tell you I I I was you know these stories of days of your in the back and forth in the accident with funding and that that that are\nYou know it's all news all part of the the the strategy of running for office what\nPeople are doing but when I read the quoting the Kathy Greg's story of ... saying if I take two percent from the guy to keep them from governor that's all I care about type of thing it's me paraphrasing we read it more accurately suicide is what it says so I'm not putting words in his mouth that's how it felt\nI'll stay in this if I got two points as long as they take them away from him now I don't ever want to see him become governor\nAnd I tell you I loved Joe ... is the fact of the N word I've never heard him say anything disparaging like that about somebody I've talked to him in person many times that's not the guy I Know that stuff is not the guy I Know not him I don't believe he said it I'd be shocked me did\nI I just thought the person that I Know and I don't know him personally well like in terms of being best friends are anywhere close to that but the years that I've known him and had him in Studio never saw that and even people he disagreed with\nAnd thought it was political enemies never said anything like that ever\nUm nothing like that vicious ever but\nWhen you tell everybody basically and and when everybody sitting there thinking your spoiler and that you're going to be a spoiler and you're trying to convince everybody that you're not a spoiler and then you basically admit in the quota Providence Journal article that you are now going to be a spoiler whether that was your original intent or not if that's what's motivating you now you shouldn't be doing it\n\nCan't imagine I can kind of imagine on a smaller scale if somebody says something about you that\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the here for only one Ninety nine process will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars from us only at flood forward and he joined Narragansett\nPhone is there man whatever\nAnd then the uh you know the ... little thing that's going on has gotten vicious and ugly and has gotten insane and you may have a a guy who is ah just revealed themselves to be a spoiler although he says he's really not\nAnd so there are many of you out there the kind of going what the hell am I going to do with this is a story in the journal today in the political scene about the ah you know we lose the Nick ... says the circular firing squad he said that the Republican Party said the same thing I'm\nUnlikely experiment this past week with home almost comical one o'clock by the way it's gonna be interesting to report and we'll talk about it after one and\nSo you know the idea is I've always said that's the thing about the about the Republican Party is that it's made up of a\nBunch of people who\nAre independent minded they have their view of the world and there's really nothing to unite them other than their view of the world and if their view of the world changes a little bit or alters a little bit those rips\nOpen up wide and they open up in public you know the Democrats they have a machine set up they control everything they control the purse strings\nMaking the speaker controls the house budget not only the state budget but the house budget there's what the ... with a humble said was that one times like thirty nine and unfilled\nA lawyer positions in the house of off the Jaycee LS some ridiculous amount of I think it's like\nForty I think almost forty if not more than forty positions that are just sitting there and that's all candy to give away to your buddies and they know if they stay in line it's a long game for the Democrats when you control everything\nYou stay in line and you know even if you get drummed out on corruption charges or you leave but you don't if you kept your mouth shut you did a good thing eventually it will come back and you'll be rewarded with a cushy you know a house a legal status or you know house legal uh\nWith what they call them um you can basically an attorney for a lawyer you know legislative affairs you get another cushy job\nOr you you just all these handouts and how much money is being spent of yours to keep the political structure in line\nRight it's a it's everywhere\nAnd so with that comes a certain level of stay in your lane keep your mouth shut and you'll get yours to\nRepublicans don't have that stuff so the only thing keeps them together they're good will and they're uh they're hopeful desire to win something on it it'll be a logical basis or or or personal relationships and windows go shower they go sour real bad\n\nThey go sour real bad because there's nothing to lose and there's a certain level of freedom that comes to that in a certain level of\nUm [noise]\nThere's a certain level of not just not just freedom but there's a certain level of of legitimacy and authenticity\nThat can come with that because you're not going to buy anybody off you can't you get nothing about him what if you know whether this is so the Republicans are always going to have this until they have some power once they have some power and they can pull some purse strings\nAre and they get some general assembly stuff than ... you'll you'll see less of this\nSo that part is one thing the other thing the other thing for me is if you're not going to if you're going to tell everybody now let's say let's say this let's say ... says if I get two percent of want to take it from Allen I don't I never want to see him become governor let's say he says that the fit of rage as a screw you\nYou can't take it back\nYou can't take that I can try what people aren't going to take that back that's what they're always there was that they were worried about from the beginning that's what they suspected from the beginning and you're just confirmed with\nYour own mouth so what are you gonna do if somebody tells you who they are you must believe them\n\nRight I mean that's what people think if you tell me who you are I Will ... that's my philosophy ... tell me who you are I mean I Believe you know I understand that this is more complex issue and that maybe it was a a a momentary lapse of\nOf whatever and you get angry and told\nCathy Greg something you regret it saying that can happen to but the fact of the matter is the cat's out of the bag man and there ain't no getting that cat back in that bag now you gotta wonder you're gonna make the you're going to make the you have to now make the determination well how much more of your own personal money you're going to start to spend on this thing\nAnd it's a shame because I think Joe ... in general would be a great governor I really do I think he would I think he's got the stuff he's got the uh it's got the backbone he's got the the point of view and I think he's got\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator was Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury him ...\nWPRI Steve hey man I don't know if you're going to put just as much blame on Patricia Morgan or a drop it on board the a shrill oh train cars you know you can't have two people ganging up on the person running against the person you want to leave office these people should be saying\nI Will not hold on because Steve I Will tell you right right well let me just say this to you um did you probably thought this way before this weekend right\nOf course okay to me\nBefore this weekend [laughter]\nI if you have a right you have a right to support who you want to support\nYou have a right to come out and say that somebody is better for the office than other people if that means you break ranks so you do whatever listen that I can understand that and I respect it and I think that the progressive movement specific and I don't think Gina Raimondo quite frankly as a progressive I think she is a a mercenary\nAnd she will take whatever support from whatever ... political ... lunacy is out there to get her into and stay in power she's surrounded by progressive ... from Russia's stack her her office she's not really\nI don't think whatever they say yes he's got them they have proper and her up she's got radicals that worked for her\nBut when you're running for governor you want to help you why you want to be ... the other person running for governor has not worthy of a job right that's why trailer started right from the beginning going up the phone go after a month ago and I still think that's a judgeship\nComes into play because he left the Republican Party and and Patricia organs jumped on board with them which doesn't say much for the Republican\nNow I think you know what it tells me it tells me that for whatever reason either people on the ... side on the phone camp have done something to those people\nThat makes them crazy\nUm I've seen too I ... I can tell you I've heard from multiple people on the in the Republican Party\nThere there's things that have been done and I don't know what they are but there's things that have been done or something that's going on that has made it so that Allen is is a very polarizing guy within the party and I don't know what it is I really don't know what I like\nMy family has lived in crafting all their lives and they have nothing but good things\nTo say I hear that too yeah I Do have people that are being his praises they love him\nSo I don't know what he does behind the scenes but it's obviously take an awful lot of people\nI don't know what it is I don't know maybe it's just maybe it's just uh I could just be sour grapes and pettiness I don't know I don't I got to tell you the the interactions I've had with these people\nUm they don't they all seem a decent human beings behind the scenes here and what they see on the IRS what they say behind the scenes of no double to face nonsense that I've seen um none of it I mean Joe ... was it I give the guy is a nice guy\nHas always been a nice guy pitch to Patricia Morgan nice person it's been nice to me\nUm you know Alan ... always been pleasant to me so I don't know what's going on there but now that it's become about that rather than about what the ... with the state's going\nTo vote people over ... that's right that's what it's about if the people of Rhode Island fighting this person a nice guy that or not if the other guy has a problem with the guy because he did step into forty years ago at Thirty years ago right has nothing to do it that\nYou know I think that you're going to come at a time where this has now become a focus of this has now been presented the the the dies been cast that this whole thing has become about a personal death match between between a joke for low and the people who support him like\nIn the meantime she gets reelected which we don't want\nWell I don't want it uh but you know and by the way and by the way even if none of this happens it's an uphill battle ... anyway I mean really I don't say no I don't I don't\nThink well I think it would have been as bad as well\nMaybe I don't know maybe not as bad but I can tell you I think that she I think you're going to see\nI don't know I mean I'm I'm not going to make I'm not going to make I have no there's no really have that I'm not in Rhode Island\nCountrywide while to vote Democrat I Know other people that are just going to vote Democrat\nOr Republican I'm Sorry a Republican ...

around presenting herself like a black woman was what you that's what she identified as your identity ... she was ... born redhead with white skin\nShe's a change your skin color I mean the reason why she said she was a black woman she had two adopted brothers are parents came out and said you know she she's weird she keeps telling everybody that she's not black she's white she was born white leaves a picture of her [laughter] she looking ginger\nIt's a weird ginger your ... that's super white\nYou know what I'm saying\nLike late get sucked into your do whatever you know Ben and Ben's around you that's how what you are\nAnd\nAs she had to black brothers who were adopted brothers and there was a regular regular guys that go into Lyman look I\nAlignment on the football like a ... a worker like like a line worker and puts a hypertension electrical wires they interviewed him is that guy I don't know it's just I don't\nKnow what's going on here is adopted her adopted brother\nAnd so she took on like this thing and so they're walking around up there are black brothers walking around his Rachel does all know walking around living his life me and left alone I don't know what to tell you and she's out they're pretending to be something that he is\n\nAnd her thing was what identified as being a black woman so if this is the stupid world you all want to live in to quote the great Tyler dirt and sticking it feathers up your but does not make you a chicken\nUm if this is the world you want to live in good luck to you I don't want to live in a world where we fake each other out and say things that aren't true are true\nAnd that's where our politics is going\nBecause if you want to live in a world where the non truth is the truth\nOr it will come along and bite you and your bum I guarantee you\nSo uh we have to say what's true or at least as good as we know right as we have evidence to the truth and and and you can see it and then we talk about the same things and we're talking about this what you're doing politics and disagree where we disagree\nBut at least is be talking about the same thing and what Elizabeth Warren is done with this little DNA stunt is to try and turn this thing into something that it's never been not about her mom lying if not have all this nonsense it's about you claiming a status you have no claim to\n\nAnd I can go all day with you about whether or not anybody claiming that status that it can actually clean that's that is actually has\nThe agreement or the actual ... actual ah you know whatever this evidence of agreement from that status we can talk about that all day long that depends on the person right on the individual not on the status\nThis everybody's an individual everybody lives in a unique life while they might be some similarities there are some vast differences that determine whether or not somebody successful whether or not to somebody that can overcome life's natural of burdens and ah and that's where we aren't twenty Eighteen in America folks\nThe individual should bring Supreme an individual individual experiences I should help focus on who they are not on their status within within a group\nStart going down that road and it's it it's all out ... nonsense and shenanigans till the end of time so\nI Love this today when I saw that she took him to get a test and it was like one zillions of uh [laughter]\nAnd she's like search pulled ya well I watch when he told ya if it said fifty one percent and say All right I get\nYour your majority that but even that I grew up and what you looked like
