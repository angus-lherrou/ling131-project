with\nAll kinds of stuff like this protesters at the um at the state house by the way\nI you know what I can tell you this do we talk about this for a second the protesters at the state house you know marching against Marxism you know are fanning against fascism whatever the hell they're doing all those two groups were just tell the police to go home\nWatching I don't have to go home just make sure that none of them can leave\nYou know what I'm saying let them give them like a a pen like I was like ... into the the front lawn of the state house and let them do it just let them go after after each other let's see how far these guys want to go\nAnd the police just to keep it from spilling out to the normal everyday you know innocent people were just basically trying to get through their day and do their own thing just tell the regular people folks you know you're trying to go to business or have a weekend for yourself just stay off the state house one for a little while while these are all these people work it out\nAnd let them work it out together and we'll we'll see and just let them do it\nYou know people shooting fire extinguishers at each other the wearing like a they look like the guy you know a fan of Walking Dead they looked like the guys walking did wear catcher's Mitt snake ... catchers outfits as as armor\nAs they look like your shin guards and to get the masks on\nLike what are you ...\nGet the hell out of here or don't stay right here and just you know don't stop 'til everybody's on the grounds either ... or ... or passed out knocked out or dead\nA couple of missing chromosomes or whatever just let them in the extremist have got to be putting their place\n\nYou know nobody's honest about what they're really stand for their own making things up and all the way of senators are just going to you know I'm going to war I figured it out gentleman\nWhat is it I watched this jet this Brett Kavanaugh would the volume off bomb bomb\nAnd I found the truth this is the kind of person that like will literally watching a national treasure and think that there's a treasure map in the back of the declaration of independence\nOr put his legs up when songs backwards looking for the Senate committee [laughter]\nThat's true right now send in the high camp\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impassable surface\nThing in a way that they're really not\nAnd so you take all this so we can constantly bombarded by these extremist messages from people we know when people we love and but and I'm sitting here thinking you know ... it's how much of this is this this new era where in\nIn ... in in politics is due to the um the psychological manipulation that comes along with social media and if\nYou don't think it's there I mean are paying attention it's where I'm actually looking forward to where I always look forward to and I'm looking forward to my conversation I'm going to have tomorrow in the ... down on cut podcast so they started off you want to check it out on our website six thirty WPRI comments on my page\nJust go ahead and and and and just you can subscribe I tunes I'm going to talk to Brian Lamb rose is actually social media attorney about all these issues he actually left Twitter he told\nMe Twitter's the worst place for it I mean Facebook and Twitter are like number one is Twitter number twos Facebook and then like the other ones as far as I'm concerned about Twitter is like the fifth level of hell if seat and lived in the digital world he live and Twitter\nAnd ah I think he doesn't live in Twitter quite frankly [laughter]\nAnd it is it is an evil place\nAnd\nBut as a place that you know for somebody in my business I kind of have to occupy even though as adults we very much\nAt all\nUm but I'll tell you it is a demented place where people acted demented ways and it creates a concept in people's minds that reality is like that and I don't know because it creates that perception that then becomes the reality\nAnd so I don't know how much of this is dedicated I mean social media in general has ruined many average everyday occurrences in the world I'll\nGive it to that little bit later out Ken's and hope valley killed Ken you're on WPRI can't\nHey I Know what I mean I'm good I Love your show you all the time so I just wanted to comment one is you know it was not gonna take it you have to figure out who's guilty\nRight you might as well you might as well [laughter] well some of the tea leaves wholesome bones in a cup and you know ... [laughter] I don't put your hand with the blood sweat as we can read\nThem whenever they were picking all we're ways people can find the future of the divine the future through body language okay\nYeah yeah the thing I Want to stay here you know the techniques you're turning the volume down to get a read on people I tried it with your radio station that doesn't work [laughter]\n[laughter] ah it doesn't work in radio and no it doesn't work\nIn Reno thanks can appreciate the call shades of protection senior WPRI saying\nHey Matt how's it going to joke about what that guy just it too but um you know one thing I I I ... the king of the Facebook and Twitter and everything which I just don't aren't even linked in I've noticed people are starting to like share their\nThoughts and feelings new and linked in is supposed to be more of a business and networking and it's just like okay are we going that far now too yes it's like I don't I don't care that like you do this for a living now you have an opinion on this no no no no that's not what I\nWell hey listen man there's a whole market out there evidently for that look what's going on with Nike I mean they social justice a business model is one that I scoff at and and hate\n'em because I Would just love for the love of God to go for four hours a day or two hours a day we don't have to be bombarded by some political message but evidently people respond to it I guess I don't know\nIf you know and it it goes back to like what you said earlier to you know the one thing you remember like everybody the narcissism that goes out and because of these two and they thought that Europe in matters more than anybody else's and that you always feel like I don't know if it's fight or flight either but you're always on guard or not always but people are on guard\nTo react to what ever they might disagree with as a ... hearing the the other side yeah they react immediately\nWanted social media is a place for for ... I think and I don't even know if these people are legitimate but you know the people that you hear from\nYou know the people who are will criticize your come after you leave the Caitlin tones as a reporter on CNN and I don't know if you saw this enough it over the weekend I guess they went back to her Twitter feed from she's twenty six years old this is a seven year old seven year old tweet so she's Nineteen\nAnd she's in college she evidently um said she she doesn't know she's comfortable rooming with a lesbian was one of her tweets and then she tweeted to somebody and and called them I think it was the word fag called them effect\nOn on Twitter ... and so this was she had to come out you know I used ignorant language when I was in college\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln and Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury him ...\nPost or commentary from Thirty years ago or actions from thirty five years ago or ten years ago is going to be enough to do a news story and to\nEnter drums some you know some anti wave against somebody for some public point of view or some job or impact people's jobs I guess that this is the world we're going to live in I don't want to live in that I don't think that she should be\nCriticized or or or thought less sub because she said something stupid when she was a kid um you know it\nI don't know if I watched I'm an old Seinfeld of the other day was episode or lane but she could\nTurn a gay man liking her mhm an egg one but the way that they describe that episode\nEver aired like Newt today all the way of converting somebody\nI was like oh my goodness this would never fly in the Nineteen nineties\nRight and it was funny because it was absurd\nYeah it's yeah it's funny 'cause he's not possible it's absurd and the joke that joke being led was they that's why it's funny you know and [laughter] and people who don't understand that I I don't get it man Ida Shane thanks for the call I just really\nBizarre um\nYeah I mean it's bizarre and it's so this this is where we are I mean we just we were going round the bend and I and I don't know if it's a legitimate I think that maybe there are people at what point frankly I'm pretty sure that somebody seen that show today would laugh because it's absurd and taking the way that was meant as men does it absurd way that is funny and none of their\nYou know or would see ... pounds tweet and go to God she must regret that\n\nAnd that's that you know like oh\nGod that's you know she was Nineteen so it's stupid things I said when I was Nineteen years old we stupid things they said ten years ago\nYou know luckily I didn't have Twitter back then\nBecause there was a time in my life that lasted a very long time quite frankly where I said the most outrageous things the more outrageous things I said the funnier it was just because you'd say outrage and that was the ...\nThat was the comedy that I that I came up with I was I was a Howard Stern fan either Howard Stern's reason why I got into radio I thought he him saying those the outrageous things made me laugh because most of it was just oh my God I Can't believe you have the guts to say that\nWas that was so out over the top it was funny that's a major component to my humor\nStill is the stay more compassionate person after becoming a parent and living a little life and and so you realize that some people say some things have just like you know some things that are older you get just aren't funny\nBecause there's so much pain and stuff attached to them that's just not funny but that changed with time\nAnd if you're a normal person you realize that you realize that when people are young and this and they're just saying things just to see them\nThey're just doing things just to do them\nYou know they're testing the waters and that you know holding them responsible even you know ten years later is is stupid but listen you want to set up this game and lived in that world then everybody's going to play by it so that it's you know the log cabin Republicans pulled it out and said let's see if we can take a swipe at a Caitlin Collins and she came out just apologize the by rote ... ignorant\nAnd ...\nAnd supposedly that coils everything and believe me it's um [noise]\nThere's a if you're a perceived to be a left wing or you're going to get more of forgiveness real quickly than other side than the other side would that's a guarantee but I don't want to and if that's the social media and social media has ruined a lot of things\nAnd I used to think that on par that it was a more positive force the negative I don't think that any more I think it's more negative and positive I had this whole ... so funny I go on these rant sometimes and uh I don't think my in laws no the\nIt because politics isn't everything I see it everywhere\nEven where might not be\nI watched the most ridiculous garbage marvel\nCartoon this weekend with my son to the point where I started going off and my wife's looking at me like I'm a crazy person and I started talking I said this cartoon sucks this is the worst\nGarbage I've ever seen it was all social justice warrior you know women heroes men stupid can't get anything done nonsense I mean he's never going to watch it again\nBecause of that crap that's gets it gets in ... and everything we see and do it's everywhere you can't escape it and social media just makes it worse they ruins everything\nI'll tell you it's ruined the apple picking\nHow many have you gone apple picking this year", "show_name": "The Matt Allen Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale",
