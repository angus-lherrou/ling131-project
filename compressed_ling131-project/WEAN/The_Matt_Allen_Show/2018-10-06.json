auto job\nAnd Alan ... for a long time I like Allen fun in fairness I probably know Joe ... better than I Know Alan phone I'm I sat next to him in the general assembly for six years I Know he's not a stupid man I Know he's a smart guy\nOr and I got an I I got to believe that he's smart enough to know that you can't be elected as an independent\nIn Rhode Island by getting more Republicans do indoors you that's just not how you do it if you're an independent you got to peel off Democrats votes and the only way you're gonna feel a Democrat votes is to get prominent Democrats to stand next to you and say you work as because think about if you can't convince an elected official\nTo come out and stand with you to go against the sitting Democrat governor then how are you going to get the loyal democratic voters who are going to vote for that democratic governor because they're Democrats in because I'm a governor you can't convince the elected officials you not going to convince the end of those voters you're just not\nUm so that puts Gino where we are she's got two million bucks she's going to get forty three forty to forty four percent of the vote\nAnd the rest gets split between Alan and Joe and Joe is actively targeting among voters and Joe I get a newsflash where you've got to get 'em all\nYou've got to get all of the phone voters and I got a double news last for you that's not going to happen\nSo what are you trying to do um it's pretty transparent to me that his goal or or at least that's going to be the outcome is to reelect governor among do for four more years\nSo you know if we have we have that outcome which um you know again you don't have to be leaning to see this movie and uh then you can take jokes furlough because that's why it's happening or three eight nine Seventy and you can make all the case you want ... you know he's corrupt up yeah sure okay\nAh but I'm the fact of the matter is the joke wouldn't beat him in a primary and he recognized that\nAre so he decided to destroy them in the general and the result of that is one more years Gina Raimondo\nAnd and it's and I hate to be the one to break that to you but you know it's ... it's just math there's nothing you can't get around math\nAnd and if you look at the numbers are and you look at what's happening in in this electorate that it's it's should be plainly obvious you that that's what's gonna happen you think about it a bad Republican candidate in a one on one race will get thirty eight percent of the vote every day all day twice on Sunday\nOr so if you can figure a bad Democrat is going to get\nA I don't know maybe forty forty one percent all day every day twice on Sunday then it's logical assumed that if you give that same Democrat incumbency and you give that same Democrat two million bucks three million bucks they're going to be able to add a couple of points to that that puts them in forty four to forty three\nSo then if you add to that total that leaves fifty six percent left to be split up between the other two\nAnd and there's no way that you know Alan's going to get the the loyal Republican base that's going to turn out for him or they're going to you're definitely give him more than thirty percent\nSo that leaves joke Grillo at sixty percent and then that's like given Joe a lot of credit a lot more credit than he deserves and and you know you don't like I said you don't have to be a rocket scientist to see this Bobby is dial the broadcast from Barrington Bobby you are on a multi ...\nI don't think it goes all ... all the votes or yeah you look at the history of the last four years or what's been going on I mean all these big that means they're going to put her back in office\nWell you know the thing is is a tremendous value to incumbency a and you can't discount that in in in a normal race where you might only get the thirty eight if you're an incumbent that gets you to forty that's if you're an awful incumbent a\nYard I mean it's just think about it think about state of the state right the lord I mean yeah and you're going to re elect they seem young people ... ... what do we think we're\nWell that's that's just the key we're not [laughter]\nProbably argue for the call appreciate for three eight nine seven seven six he always area died Bryan his dial is from the bunker annex in Exeter\nHey John yeah yeah upstairs

and I'm a family friend and I have respect for you I don't share as politics a sand out who ah right I was one of the progressive candidates who ah ah who in the primary took out a long standing a democratic senator although the lower rent yeah and so I was at that victory party\nIt is of course it it it it's you can imagine what was it was ... you know I always think I was up for it\nWhat auto

commitment to ideals and uh\nAnd their principles all of that was president and the second the primary was over ...\nPull the plug on with life\nYeah so what do you think do you think she gets forty two to forty four percent and the general\nUh uh yeah no no I think that's it and they'll look at number the number is still alive and it and it's particularly ... I mean fine Joe understood that he wasn't going to win a primary so what's the point I'm not going to the general election\nEgo is going to be ego and that's the only the maintenance\nThe fundamentals of course I mean that the national economy has done well\nA ... despite what people are upset may be upset with the ... are among those ten year you know a few things have gone right I'm not I'm not advancing whether that's the broken\nClock being right a couple of times a day or she's actually a cop show in general you know the national economy's coming along a you know we only Arnold ... even though we're concerned about how Rhode Island just set for the next downturn\nAnd the kind of policies that are being set now I mean people aren't eating dog food shelter ready the fundamentals are cutting against\nA song candidacy a and a ...\nEven where she had even where she has a cap I I mean the point is\nIt she has a ... I mean we we look at that cap and trade that people say they support but she's never been in a race it's not been a plurality race to begin with Iraq\nAnd uh and so it had and and I do I agree with Joe ... that that that phone would have difficulty beating her man I met but Joe go ahead call a block get the heck out of their race and and if Alan doesn't win ... minor then you monitor what am I on a\nDay in your state you see I told meals and it ate he couldn't get it done up next time around it's an open seat and let's have a good candidate that you know Joe wouldn't be my choice but I mean you know it seems to\nMe that he's never going to do that because I don't think he's goal is to go to take down Alan yes for reasons that I don't even understand yeah uh and that is goal in but I mean do you think about a brain if you're an independent right and you're going to appeal to the people that were the same bell reception you want to be standing next to a bunch of Democrats\nOr wouldn't want to be standing next to a bunch of Republicans that the people in that room don't like for other reasons\nNo exactly I mean this is like that we're having a ... you know we're having a circular firing squad only everybody's face in in\n...\nIt is absolutely ridiculous and uh and uh you know and I know uh you know big believer in uh you know uh and fungus some kind of ... you know first while as strong a definitive personality\nUh that uh you know that would be ... it would be striding through a when a were it not for all of this uh what's going on\nBut I I just can't I just can't support this uh uh\nPeople who cannot set this stuff's aside you know a a do a do get under my a\n... year not hit the nail on the that's the big difference between the Democrats and Republicans and that's one of the reasons in this state\nThe Democrats continually when because they recognize that you know an imperfect candidate that has to be in front of his name is better in under all circumstances and they they put aside their ideological differences in their personal petty differences and they jumping in support and that's what happens Brian thank you for the call appreciate it\nMore three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one W bureau coming up next\nReviews of movies we haven't seen with radios personal Adams a professor professor David you say in your humble\nHost Juan ... and we'll be back to our own [noise]\n\nKnew the secret to having enough money in retirement tune in every Saturday to WPRI ... from six PM doing ... for the Rick middleman show for more information visit ...\nThis is your daughter ...

Jed Jed from Johnston is on on my child well John welcome\nAnd thanks for taking my call my pleasure thank you for calling I ah I think that more in control may be remembered in Rhode Island political history as the two\nRepublicans one former won a president Republican that gave us a democratic government I don't go down in the annals of history searchers are\nFrankly\nThere won't be thought very well if they were going to being together to do any\nWhat they should do is to port Ellen ball and put pressure on no legal to straighten out the voter rolls and to get some sort of rational a realistic voter I\nRequirement so that people that are actually citizens of the U.S so they are the ones that are able to cast a vote because\nWe know that there's a\nClose relationship between room window in a war zone and there are a lot of illegals in Rhode Island is just an actuary state\nYes the you know that's got to be a you know in an a natural you know a fresh of breath there was another government we'd get rid of this get rid of this uh illegal sanctuary\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new borders games for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like blood out over time\nThat I [laughter] I said\nTo friends I said we have Gina Raimondo four more years and really I Want you to think about this what did President Obama what message did he give putting\nHis emissary on boy whatever deputy a president whatever his title was he gave him a message tell who after the election I'll have more flexibility listen to what I say more flexibility don't you\nThink that Gina Raimondo knows that this will be her last term\nYou'd think that the wrote tolls or something wait until you see what happens and next for you\nThen we're just talking about when John has nobody to answer to especially the motives um yeah the very very dangerous um should us and and that's that's very ... you know or to be determined she probably wouldn't last for years because\nShe's looking to pack our bags and get on a dodge again she does not want the governor's job she's running for a job she doesn't\nWant to just be nice or his beneath the ... one of the fifty most influential people in the world not just one island but the world so she wants to you know does but you're right a wishy if we thought what we got over the last four three and a half four years um was bad boy\nGina Raimondo ah on on on accounted sought accountable to anybody born one show yep\nWell she'll just expect more global his policies rather than policies that move Rhode\nIsland you write shanty she want to thank you gentlemen for what you and it's been doing\nAnd we appreciate that they can learn jak you you're in a good point ... gonna be the the uh the the standard bearer for the\nGlobal policies in a very good point this will end this little state will be the inconvenience for all those reckless policies and she's a really good programs right and some of them is not as friendly to the next week to see from uh ... who's been holding on to repatriate sizes while now Mike\nHi how are you guys doing fantastic um I Know that I'm\nAlan ... has been on your show in the past and now I Know that he listened to your to your show so I have three points I'd like to make in order to tactically beat Gina Raimondo [noise]\nNow do do do you want me back up for a second no sure so people don't get the run up and how long\nWas invited on the show just like everybody else was [noise] like Matt Brown ... done like just like everybody else was so we we ... I just want to get that also known a little a little misguided issue is broil Iran is a kind of\nGoing by the wayside but but but I Will correct you on more than one more thing before you you get your point and I and I I think you're right Alan fungus listening but not just on a song they're all listening to trust us\nWell I don't care about them I I'm just calling about al ... Fong vacuum if if\nYour view back because if he doesn't win just as the last caller said boy Rhode Island's going to be in it like they've never been involved in it before as far as ... concerned she'll have nothing to stop her for her or her agenda which is not good for\nFor freedom it's not good for a free market and it's not good for a representative alcoholic so my three points are first of all Alan ... [noise]\nI don't know who's helping him with his campaign but I'm seeing similar mistakes that ... that were done four years ago and that he should be advertising this is a point number one advertised on WNPR oh in one hour during the week between one hundred and one hundred and ten thousand people\nWithin the boundary lines of Rhode Island and over eighty percent of the vote listen to death row if he advertises\nTwice in our maybe three times in our\nHe's going to be able to say whatever he wants to say and Gina Raimondo was literally at war with WNPR ocean will come out in the ... one advertise\nSo he can say whatever he wants and he can he can say whatever we watch and he's not going to be challenged I my opinion if he does that for a month right up until the election he's going to get three to six thousand votes which could switch the election around\nYeah you're right on it very valid point I went back to your point number two I Would if I were Mr fun I Would have adversaries\nTo mail a all wars I and I would say with I Know you've had your disagreements with remind do in the past if you just have your people not go against me if you just have your people not actively campaigned against me\nIf I get in I Will do everything that I can to work with you I Will do everything that I can to make sure that Providence get grants I'll do what I can to help ... that that for this\nHow would you like motor drenched twenty gene truck to be here for only one Ninety nine brought will say hello to forge twenty eight gene Ford F. one fifty best drug for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a blood forward and he joined Narragansett\nOf component him so that I did but but but that said I I if if I was putting the same shoes um perhaps that's the Maxwell wouldn't give a clinical trial I wouldn't give a crap about his Ira she's got a short yeah I guess so okay he's Irish let's call it is okay here's a mean is he got his Irish half\nAs good as Irish and that was my next thing okay so let's senator Collins was the last holdout a main\nAh people are threatened her that they're going to protest or a twenty four hours a day seven days a week around the clock whatever till she moves out of me this is the type of lunatics you're dealing with so here we are in two thousand eighty I think people need to reform a couple of things we'll just let me go here for a second okay All right\nHillary Clinton lost she did yeah believe it or not Hillary last\nSo the Democrats lost the president is on the TV all the time I yeah yeah I Know I write but let me just point she said last yet contrary to popular belief she lost\nNow granted I don't agree with everything that comes out of Donald Trump's Twitter account by I I Do believe it's a little bizarre but right now I'm going to tell you right now you can't argue\nYou cannot argue with the lowest unemployment since Nineteen sixty nine\nForty eight years or best economy gross domestic product is going to be back up we've solved the tires issues\nOkay a little boy is better than what a lot of nothing what we had before\nYeah some people saying oh it's the same thing we got a little more we've got balance between the country's puts the moratoriums against Mexico to stop the shortfall labor alright and help our economy from our economy is booming right here right now All right I think everybody's having pressed\nTimes trying to find people to work All right\nWe're in very strong economic times the interest rates went up which means that trying to slow the economy down right but\nThese judicial hearings took on a life of their own and you know we talked about hatred\nThe hatred that's been run out in the division that's been put before this country is awful I and and I I make a mockery of it at aspects of of\nWe've lost the value of Democrat Republican we stand firm on things but we never had hatred involved now there's just evil being an accent and the accusations of of driven towards people and and and taking them men\nIn treating them as guilty before innocent is just screwed up the whole system of balance so my question is\nWhat what if it was their son what would happen if that was there one of that child who are in a court and that's the way they treated us how how how would this go and you know what we're not setting an example for young kids this is why they don't even know which direction to take that even though if they want to come out of the basement anymore\nLook look what's on the X. box for crying over ... ... you got the impasse young young ladies kitten I don't I don't mean that blast me but I mean you\nKnow these you know young young girls I have a Fifteen year old daughter ... year old son what messages as

first day well first base is you know I mean it it it's almost discretionary now it's almost a subject of what first base is now\nAnd and as it is it at a point where any any any aggressive court aggressive action by young man against a young lady what what used to be courting and maybe trying to get the first base is now a subjective issue where\nHey you know what I'm not sure you know what I'm not sure what that boy did to me last night I'm I'm gonna take it over and then see it's it's it's just it's not a healthy situation where the railing we're dealing with the railing a new old fashioned\nValues and and I was gonna leave it at that I was listening\nTo somebody yesterday it's funny because I I forget what show is less of a two and the comment came out when I was young when I was a young boy I got a swat on the bus is today you did that they called the ... you know and and and uh you know\nAnd I'm not saying that if a if a young lady why though as I'll tell you fire up as a young lady went up\nInto a room and and and two boys jumped on her and cover mouth and look I said you know I I I Do draw the line but I think this woman was was was traumatized a and maybe I I I
