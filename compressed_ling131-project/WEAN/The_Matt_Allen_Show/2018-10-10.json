[noise] yeah you know I [noise]\nThat to me this morning when I heard when I heard thriller going that way with ... that was from our interviews last hour but I heard him go that way I said\nI cringe to myself and said you know this is why people think that a lot of people think that he's a chauffeur Gina Raimondo 'cause it's a joke and you didn't miss it said that when you come after him and he perceived this story about the Nick Matty yellow thing forty years ago to be an attack on him by the ... campaign um\nAnd I just think that you know for a story that I was actually kind of funny and interesting in terms of the the ... yellow connections a trailer when he was younger and that whole thing to me with that and that connection happen when that thing come if it's a it's a kind of a cute story\nUm I don't know who are over wherever that story came from ... who is promoting that story thinking that was going to look negative for Joe's stupid um because it's actually kind of interesting\nAbout but to to you know to take a ... to uh fly swatter where ... would would work would have done well I think um\nI just I I just leave it leaves a bad taste in people's mouths and I told Joe that I told him that today I said you know this is one of those things where I don't know because it's\nBeen it's been meted out and unless you have evidence to the contrary just throw in mud and then if you just learn that if the guy was just thrown in Allen Fung then you know when the when I that's the answer to the question was that the question that was that that led to that answer was you know in the end of the day Republicans who he has been friendly with who supported him and we supported for years of sitting around looking at this going\nThis guy's going out there he's working to to make it so that Alan ... got got the most dirt on him and can't win and so at the end of they would if Gina Raimondo does win which is looks like it it probably gonna be the case if that happens\nHe's going to they're going to blame him\n[noise]\nUm\nAnd that's not necessarily true it's not necessarily fair I mean you have to look at the totality of the of the race\nAnd it seems to me the Gina Raimondo is running a highly financed highly targeted specific race Alan ... trying to keep up he's way underfunded compared to her she's got money and and ... and you know resources coming out of rear end over here he's trying to keep\nUp a joke troll keeps slinging mud at him and so it gets into the mud with Joe ... and this that and yet I mean if if Alan ... is out there listening to this enjoy if if this poll is anywhere near legitimate where Joe ... has five percent I wouldn't even talk about him I won't even mention of\nYou know\nI don't think he has five percent but I'm just saying but this looks like\nTo me that there are extenuating circumstances that would make this a near impossible lift for anybody running running against Gina Raimondo\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln and Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nAnd so you know so the the I sure as you know the back and forth a tit for tat that goes on with neighbors they call the cops and it sure Lois to go down to the police station goes down there and it gets to gets the charge the whole thing he said he felt played no low\nContender which means not going to fight it and you know just that was it was filed for a year and that was the end of it well according to court records that that Tim white dug up from back in the seventies the court records actually say after a trial he was found not guilty but Joe says I don't know I don't remember that but okay sounds good with me\nUm and then there's you know all sorts of phone calls going on from WPRI during the tower grainy and show people saying oh what did you find out who else Joe turtle assaulted\nSo I called ... who else would you assault because I don't know the only thing I can think of is a situation I happen to Larry Larry Earhart former state representative okay\nAnd said you want to tell the story on the air and let everybody know about it and he said yeah I don't know I'm a I'm I'll call you he calls me up he says I Want to come in and tell the story okay come in and tell the story is what we do here WPRI you know that was one wants to call me and tell me a story on the air tomorrow that's like this one in some of the story and come on the store\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they're all in for Steve we own condition at what point and he's really Janeiro or against it that's right over two hundred and three on cars all makes all models had incredible prices love onto flood Otto John calm now\n... seems like there's like this uh this thing where they did get into it a little bit Joe ... says chooses the Earhart poked him and his eyes [laughter]\nBut two fingers like studio style you know three students but you know one of those deals\nAre air ... air hard says no no no I was trying to tweak his nose my ... my for finger so Joe felt that he was poking him in his eyes and then he found a whacking Adam\nAre you know hit 'em like four or five times what Joe said and this was like the whole thing that was you know there was this one incident happened in the minority office or eight years ago two thousand ten Cornel area and he was holding AOL is not a big deal is no police or anything like that involve blah blah blah so you know that was that\nSo I use the opportunity to ask them about you know above being the acting as the spoiler and the whole election\nAnd he bristles at that and I know what to tell people that you know chances are it's going to be spoiling the election if you know if it if\nTraditional wisdom is traditional for a reason if that's what comes to play it could be if he comes out on top like uh or or or comes close to it it would be a historic thing\nIt would be historic will it happen I don't know I have no idea\nBut you know I I think in general everybody's going to start talking about issues\n\nActual issues that matter to people rather than this back and forth nonsense about stupidity\n\nAnd this is you know this is what happens with campaigns they do this they come out and they give you all the information\nThat you that you know to put it on people and they they whisper it to people they try to get the reporters to talk about in depending I mean this specific story I think is an interesting story the moon would Matty yellow 'cause it's just the Rhode Island stories in human interesting more than anything I don't understand and I said this to join us know when he gets so upset about it because it was actually made him look good\nBut he took it as an attack and he's a fighter he said a path\nForward is now than speaking of politics Mr Ford from the Libertarian Party hari ...\nGood good good and you know I'm I'm right with the with the issue thing\nAlso believe that there's you know as important as the governor's race is way too much attention span when the real issues\nAre going to affect every day Rhode islanders are happening right the general assembly and um I I just want to put a shout out to people I meet a lot of different ...
