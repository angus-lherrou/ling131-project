I've already asked the question let's know about all these deals okay I'm aware that there were a bunch of sight deals made in east Greenwich ... between the fire department and the people who ran east Greenwich a couple of years ago\nA and those ideals had monetary consequences and they were not approved by the town council\nRight so now the question is how frequently do our municipalities engage in this practice\nWell here's a question are you going to be any record of side deals I Want to call them side deals right there a week and a nod to done in practice there's no actual record so so he'll remembering if there's no record of it how can you possibly agree that\nWell if it's a practice in that that was one way and then stopped being done they can do the I mean this is\nMy Kmart labor attorney I have no idea of his budget or not I mean I'm just thinking that if you know past ...
