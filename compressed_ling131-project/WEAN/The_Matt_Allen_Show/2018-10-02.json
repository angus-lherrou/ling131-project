you're sitting there advocating for any kind of war you really have never experienced anything close to it ah [laughter] and that's from somebody who's never experienced anything close to it ah let me

try to maybe I don't know turned the social media off before the civil war\nAbout that 'cause I think Ninety nine point nine percent of it comes from that the world to tomorrow would improve tenfold if social media just disappeared that is I Am a hundred percent sure of that doesn't mean they wouldn't be any downside to it but the downside is way\nA way by the good side so\nToday I'm looking at

pollster said it's going to be the largest gender gap in modern American history\nOf the ... troubles with women are likely to hurt the party most in the battle for House Democrats need to put the least twenty three Republican held seat to get a majority many of those competitive races are in suburban districts that have a large number of college educated women a group of relatively high turnout ... of the more than two hundred and fifty women in on congressional belts and November more than three quarters of them are running as Democrats\nSo what's gonna be interesting about this is going to be you know the ideas that one party is more friendly way more friendly place to women than others ah determines what you consider it it's determined by what you consider to be friendly\nI'm and I'm always amazed by the assumptions that are made and I've said this many times in the end we talk about a female politicians Rhode Island who say we speak for\nWhen when you do you have any idea what a ridiculous statement that is because it is a blanket\nAssumption that because of how you happened to be born what's sexual born with that somehow you have a monolithic view of the world that goes only with one party for the\nOther it's unbelievable there's no there's no room for individual identity\nYou're a member of a tribe and shot up\nThe most bigoted thing you've ever heard but yet it's it's amazing how this is what put politics can do to people you can make bigotry sound like open mindedness\nAnd so obviously I Love to talk to ladies are called to the show today to talk to me about whether or not you are someone who is going to be voting your gender\nTo thinking that they cause you have to have a certain level of screw you I'm outta here\nRock the boat mentality which a lot of people don't have not just women but overall women tend not to have it because they like things to be chill\n\nThey work hard and they just want to be recognized and they just if they want their hard work to show for itself\nOf a hard time with that that's why that hold\nThe seat it was a CFO of Facebook was at a Sheryl I'm Kevin Kevin ... name\n[noise] she wrote that book lean in 'cause that's all about you know women deciding to take a to take chances of women deciding to put themselves up for promotions two to advocate for themselves more to speak up in the workplace and that's a show Sandberg thank you and so those are things that are\nHappening more often because you know there's been focused on women do more that\nThat doesn't come naturally to a lot of people\nSo the women I Know know that the the pay gap thing isn't necessarily a buds and they it's not necessarily about or not at all about or very little\nAbout discrimination I'm sure that exist someplace as discrimination for all different reasons will exist in some places this anti male discrimination out there um\nYou know they exist these things exist but when you when you actually take into consideration the types of jobs that women take or the or the amount of hours that a work the types of jobs a dangerous nature of jobs and things like things like that the the the pay gap disappears\nKUHF it disappears and so\nYou know you have the women I Know that but they will they supposedly they'll buy into the fact that the pay gap as a thing and that politicians who ... were you know want to create phony pieces of legislation that do nothing to really help the pay gap the real honest to goodness pay gap it causes are never impacted by legislation\nNever talked about like that but they never impacted because the cause has nothing to do with discrimination which is already illegal now they want to change the standard\nThey want to make it so that it's a you know it's it's a comparable work rather than equal pay for equal work\nWhatever that means so I Know women that do that but yet they still get wrapped up in this whole idea\nOf like you know of this there being a female party out there or a a political party that has more friendly to females\nThey get wrapped up in that idea but yet they don't they know that that that doesn't impact their everyday lives so I sit there and I wonder\nIs it the experience of women that creates the narrative or is it the narrative that creates the experience and the woman\n\nTo the point where there's like is this social pressure I mean I see these people all the time in politics the state reps in these states senators who come out and they they pretend like they are not just representatives of their districts which which they'd been duly elected but they actually come out and pretend to be representatives of everybody that shares the genitalia\nTell you I Would it's really bizarre\nI Would never be able to sit here and say that I represent men anywhere\nEver you have any idea how stupid that is I could never do it I don't think you could I Would never want to\nVisit some scum bags out there that I don't want to be represented by\nAnd there's some people that are better than meets the point where I couldn't even possibly have enough ego to say that I represent them\n\nAnd so for any politician who happens to be female it's more like you know what women want we know that is is is the automatic assumption that because you are female that you think every dead one specific thing is the most important thing to you and that one specific belief system is something that you have to in ... when compass you\nAnd if we all know what it's really about it's just a code word\nFor both agree with me or there's something wrong with you because we've seen it before as a matter of fact uh you know situation is going on right now with a guy who's running for attorney general Minnesota's guy Keith Ellison he's the head of the ... was one of the marketing boxing the de ... Democratic National committee\n[noise] he's got all kinds of allegations of salt and everything else against the woman you never hear about that story do you\nGuys are alleged to have done things that are worse than a ... I'm trying to get the details your force you can just I just thought of as\nUm\nYou know there's all sorts of stuff that's going on here domestic abuse things like this\nAnd and it pales in comparison to what's going on with Brett Kavanaugh\nBut the reason why you cabinet gets mostly because everybody's time this whole Robie waiting thing to him\nAnd it's convenient for a certain party in this country to tie his party affiliation\nTo a war on women so that women go out in droves and vote as if they're voting for the very survival of their gender\nIt's an absurdity\nAnd what we've gotten here folks went up to my point it was on trying to even bring this up to you is that we've gotten so that the political marketing that are that are our country has now adopted has now gone to the point where they don't give a flying you know what what records they leave behind so much so that they\nSo that so that as long as they get control\nLooking for a car credit not played well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log on to what Tom\nPower and so let's\nConstantly be at each other sort of like like the relationships between men and women have never been about cooperation have never been about creating a life together have never been about raising families or or building a a spiritual bond in a in a physical bond in a marriage bond that that to to to help each other to live and survive\nThat's never been the case it's always just been about subjugation and power\nThis is where the demented stuff comes in this is like a really demented impact of all this on our social structures well this is why ... are out there trying to adopt dogs and cats rather than having children\nBecause they think the only real genuine love comes from animals rather than fellow human because why would you ever be able to say the real love comes from humans it's all about power and influence\nBecause that's we've all we've all been ... we've just been boiled down to\nLittle emperors and ... we're just going around trying to control each other\nAnd grab you never never cooperating always\n... and ... it got to tell you is that your experience let me ask you this is that your experience that you're into has your\nInteraction with the opposite sex been nothing but a power struggle in your life and I mean seriously I Want to know is that true or\nHas actually been you know a a a system by which you have created for yourself with your spouse or whatever where you know could be also mother's sister cousin or whatever it is you're you're the relationship you have the opposite sex there where there it's not about power it's actually about cooperation\nIt's about building something together it's about about a uniting for a better future because I I Would imagine that most of you have experience that and your life rather than the alternative which is what the politicians want you to believe that everything's about a struggle for power and influence in control\n\nSo I see these these oh the big gender gap coming up in the like of course it will be because we've created a power structure where where you know it's\nIt's us against them I mean I don't know how you survive this I don't know how we survived this\nYou know day to day basis I mean I should say survive survives a bad word I don't know how you live with this\n\nNow my phone numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI email we met at six three zero WPRI dot com\nBecause I see I mean\nThis is not a day that goes by that there's not some mentioned about you know some politician trying to claim the mantle for women some politician out there saying this what men do versus I mean for ... her own or if there was any justice in the world and anybody had any sort of\nOf especially in the on the left in this country\nBecause they don't seem to have limits they can pretty much do whatever all\nWhack a new thing they want and nobody they either get ignored or\nThey get an braced there's no like condemnation ever you know but to people on the left like this Mazie Hirono who is unbelievably a demented\nWith our commentary like men shut up and step up and and you know just just completely whitewashing in ... broad brushing all men condemning them\nI just uh\nIt's amazing to me it's amazing what goes on\nBut you know what I mean maybe maybe there's something out there maybe I've just been lucky one that that my relationship with with the females in my life have been about cooperation about trying to figure things out not about trying to have power over each other levels and Cranston WPRI Leslie\nHi Matt how are you talking about a lot of things that I could I I Would love to have time I don't have\n... you know the reason
