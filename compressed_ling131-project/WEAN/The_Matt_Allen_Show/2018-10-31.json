yeah that's right get punched in the face is one of the most shocking tumbling painful humbling and an unforgettable experiences of your life\nAnd mitigate what you say what you do with Eric Kandel is you're going for punishment there are people out there who have never been punched in the face and so they have no idea and I think that they could do well to get one of those once in a while you know what I mean\nYes I Do uh I don't know how old you are I'm sixty four year old man the word entitlement wasn't in our vocabulary when we were growing up\nYou know we were in a ... we didn't have entitle right now we just get what was correct what was proper what was the right now we might want to set certain thing at a certain time but we said no this isn't right right but today it all out loose\nWell there was you had those standards by which you were judged and not necessarily ... legally judge but you know society we judge than judgment was harsh and there was discrimination not in the ... not in the way we talk about it now with racism but it was necessary who's just we discriminated against\nYou for what you said what you said how you acted and the and it wasn't just because we wanted to be tyrants it was because it kept everybody in some semblance of order well part\nOf that was a there was um\nWhat's the word I'm looking for an account of accountability yeah yeah you know what your parents or you know I I I just had one parent back into your there was no accountability nominee or some ...\nBack to the lack of it doesn't work\nThat's the only on why right John thanks for the call it just doesn't work it doesn't work\nIt does not work not because it's\nYou know because we just want to bully people who want to be able to tell them what to say what to think and all that stuff I mean that can be part of it um for some people but I think ultimately you have to look at whether or not\nThis stuff leads to a more orderly uh society and I think a lot of ways it doesn't do the same whatever they want because they have a right to it leads to all sorts of viciousness nonsense and polarization and take a look around yeah tons of these credits Tom you're WPRI ...\nWill not make the subjects stakes always dress or what you just need a dog up for Halloween\n[laughter] I don't have a dog\nI Want no I don't have a\nDog and if I did I Would not put anything on

twenty and we play them on Fridays it's leave a message so he got to do cells in situ would sell your WPRI so\nGood afternoon mattered afternoon sell her okay I'm\nPoliticians yeah the most\nOf the time they'll tell you what you want to hear ... most of the time to get your vote ... they'll say okay I agree with you and there's so much they get into office they do the opposite effect me personally I Would rather have somebody told me that\nThey were they disagree with me that they don't agree with me if they want but at least I'll have respect for that individual right that they're actually telling me the truth I'm sick and tired of people lying\nYou know that it just happens so so much now that they'll say one thing and do the opposite in ... in it and it's really hot wrenching that this is taking place in society that people actually lie to your face for a vote\nWell I think what's your what's your focus what's your you're hinting on which I think is something we really have to take hold of as well I think we are\nUm [noise] ... when we talk about quality I took my responsibility for what you say we were also in a in a day and age where words don't mean anything

percent if you are for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log on to what I was on top\nOur own manipulation of words\nYou know what I'm saying yeah that makes sense to you\nGot to give you an example I today I was looking at my Instagram account ... for the show and I follow\nGood morning America and they wanted they had a story of an Instagram about these two twin girls who transitioned into boys are right that transgender people they wanted this river girls into boys what they wrote was these two individuals assigned there's they're female sex at at birth\nAnd see what\nOther what [laughter]\nSigned signed signed sex\nIt's something I mean there's there's conditions that make it a little bit more difficult to giving one but you're signed your sex you you you make the dishes but but this is the world we live in where things are not\nReal they're all imaginary construct [noise]\nAnd so do so words can mean whatever you want them to mean so you can manipulate whole populations of people with ... political speech because you don't have actually have to tell the truth you tell kind of something that looks like the truth\nOf the world I grew up in the fifties and sixties and in the sixties you know you ashore all the\nAh hostility and aggravation in the world was changing and everything else and things like that things changed in the seventies and eighties and now in the nineties and in the new century it seems like things are going back which they things or who\nTo hateful it's a hateful society now people just don't care about one another I N shake doesn't mean anything anymore you know your word\nWell listen when ... when you live in a world south thank you for the call where you live in a world where everything\nIs is malleable that there's no construct there's no there's no reality that there's no objective reality right so if you're leading this construct this is something I'm I'm just starting to educate myself on this uh this idea and I mostly read critics of it I haven't actually read proponents of the philosophy this post modernist philosophy\nAnd so I I Can't speak completely to it but the way that it's been presented to me this post modern type of way of looking at things it's a it's a philosophy it's a way of looking at art literature\nPolitics everything I'm\nLike get the name of the person who who who's the ... well there's a bunch of different people who were um the founders of this philosophy French came out of friends mostly I think in the sixties and seventies um they're shipping it out of there but it was a post World war two type philosophy that basically says that you know um\nBut there's about deconstructing everything but there's no real there is no real objective truth because human beings we're all a bunch of by a bunch of bags of bias and power struggles and so they're they're reality and what they tell you is true is not necessarily\nObjectively true because you can't find objective truth right that's that's that's my my early understanding of it so subject to change\nAnd so if you have that and you have this idea and this is this is a philosophy that his ... you know very much in our universities it's talk to people and its in its influence on our politics is is in our our social construct and the way we talk about things that we would talk to each other as a parent you know that that idea that everything is\nIs created through words and created through power struggles between people and that there is no objective reality and that everything is just the way that ... one person controls in other in politics you know\nI'm not there is no there is no quality of art that are can be whatever you want it to be same thing with writing and that all writing you have to look at it through a lens of of who was trying to get over and so on who and this one it's a very weird way of looking at society there's no magic to society and that\nPoint there's no nothing there's nothing there's nothing but just people trying to constantly use each other's no cooperation is nothing\nAnd we're seeing that in our in our politics where you know every other word on somebody's mouth can be looked\nUpon as some form of bigotry or racism and people who come out and actually say racist things\nThose people are not depending on who they are like you know the words themselves are not racist it depends on who's saying them\n\nRight and it's ... it's a weird time in and it's very bizarre and there's a lot of\nOf traditional institutional ways of doing business that are just being tossed because they're being called out as being you know a form of tyranny or form of\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lighter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nIn some way shape or form right they might have helped keep us alive\nAnd we just want to throw him out like the family like marriage like a you know with two parent homes and and uh and all this stuff right just throwing it
