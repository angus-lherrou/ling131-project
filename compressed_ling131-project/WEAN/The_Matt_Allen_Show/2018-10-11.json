I was critical of them the entire time and I've said that so far and you know what I was hoping would be that this would be an anomaly this is kind of like a reaction from the public that a guy who does this kind of an accent is kind of way\nI'm is something that you know people did as almost like a as a as a screw you to the power structure and allies in the manipulation and all that nonsense\nUm\nAnd and and that the people would react to go you know we went too far let's back off now and I guess I I thought that that's what's gonna happen but I guess not I guess we're going full on down this road and I can't imagine it's very good for us all I I don't think it's going to be good at all for anybody sheen to talk of change your WPRI washing\nAnd that I started worth watching the Netflix series of World War two I think it's a it was originally BBC but it's one of those theories that combines both historical um uh\nYou know video and also they they have the actors that play like you know Hitler herbal like that I got to just do it but so as they're showing some of the stuff you know of the Nineteen twenties and the rise of the Nazi Party of sitting there watching it I'm like scratching my head like my goodness it sounds quite familiar as much weight you're familiar\nAnd the fact that ... wanted byland\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our high car buyers are tough\nBrowns shirt and that God Forbid that we have some kind of a catastrophic\nSituation whether it be financial or global or what that causes people to do kind of like a three sick or one eighty years me and go the opposite the rest of the opposite direction toward more progressive and keep a pipe politics than we can be in trouble\nBecause this is what they want they want ...\nYou have a violence as useful right the more desperate and more you get I mean they listen there is a um there's a philosophy out there of of the construction\nThat has existed at that as it was first um if you look at some of the histories of it does is post modern movement where you have this concept that that was first ah you know it was first created are incorporated into the university's back in the sixties and seventies mostly in the seventies\nAnd then it's become almost mainstream now everything is is basically is meaningless there is no real truth there's no real meaning everything is mediated by words everything is created in in in uh in power structures are all that exist and so when nothing has any meaning nothing has an a utility\nThen everything can be deconstructed when everything is just the tool of the\nOf the tyrannical government or a tool of the patriarchy or a tool of some kind of power and nothing is useful to humans then everything's up for grabs\nAnd so on and when that happens when you see everything through a lens of power like I said the other day and you're listening to talk about the matrix you know some people would look around and they see people in humans and women and red dresses\nAnd other people when they're outside the matrix or at least always code when you just see the code when you see only power struggle back and forth then that's all you care about and then and therefore that's how you talk that's how you think and that's what you hear exhibited there with Eric Holder it's just it's becoming more and more desperate it's just about the power struggle\nNow they may have deep in their hearts say this is ends justify the means right they think we're going to do something good with it\nBut sometimes the ... the the the means make it impossible to have any any other ends ever yeah you know I think it's\nBeen going on for a lot longer than that I can fix is are they I mean historically you look back at this at look at the ride all government ... and then you know throw especially throughout Europe and find just\nYou know I'm an ... but the one thing I still never gotten Matt and we use if you can get an answer to this I never understand why these groups believe that they will be more free when they are more dependent on the government that just I Can't wrap my head around that won\nIt but I I mean I don't understand I can understand his you know this is very interesting because I can understand the need there are people out there on the temperament it's in this you'll find if you look at the science and this is actually is a biologically based in certain people born this way\nWhere they are more ... because of their disposition because they're just stuff that just the way that they're either raised or biologically made up of both of which probably a combination of both they're more open minded\nThey're more ah they're more concerned about people who are downtrodden poor who are left out of the society you know we set up these rules so that the most of us survive or most of us prosper like in the United states of America a vast majority of people participating the prosperity\nThere are people out there who don't and that's you know that's that's nature I mean there's going to be you know for God's sakes people's ... new story about the about uh about squirrels today they're squirrels are going to do really well and there's gonna be a couple of squirrels it don't it in every system in nature it's just the way it is does\nThere's there's a system is put in place people do well some don't and there are people in the system that are doing well so you know what about those people\nAnd those people would kind of be more and more ... um when they were looking for is a temper mentally left wing right what do we do about the poor what do we do about the sick what do we do about the elderly what do we do about these people they're not they're not doing as well as everybody else\nAnd so I can understand that I get it\nCan appreciate it I tend to lead the other way um because I think more that the systems in general have created a place where most of us benefits so let's not let's not get too crazy ... and those systems by the way\nI'm recognized that human beings need to be able to be free to live their own lives and live their own consequences that to me is that it's a fundamental philosophical belief of mind that that free will and ... and relative freedom is good for everybody where where they got I'm Sorry\nI'm Sorry I Know you pick out the your point you take out the elderly you take out those who have some kind of physical disability those who from from the beginning are are going to need to be taking care of by the rest of society for absolutely no problem with that but if you looked at were all kids on the playground back at one point mhm and then all of a sudden something began\n... group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\n... or ... ... ... when you add some really wants to pursue you get a book that's about ... ... all of it requires us to go and that's what it's all about but

Narragansett\nYou know it it it wasn't a sneaky one back on the weekend this system as we can develop and all along the hurricane center was forecasting landfall\nUp on the Florida Panhandle uh I think her you know early in the weekend we had the distractions of the trial going on to judge Kavanaugh right I and I think that took a lot of the national attention away from what we saw ours meteorologist developing in the Gulf of Mexico\nAh we knew this thing was going to have to pass over what is known as the loop current which in the Gulf of Mexico is an extremely warm current of water that provides a lot of fuel mhm ah if there was anything that was under forecast it was that this thing was going to be near category five intensity landfall\nA early in the week um Monday Sunday Monday\nA we begin to see the hurricane center forecast the intensity to about a category three um and I think after Florence's experience I think people had an expectation\nOf what that damage might look like ... uh but it continue to rapidly intensify it went through a couple of cycles of\nYou know remarkable drops in central pressure uh it to the point where it looks like Andrew if you ask me well the wind damage looks like the scope that we had an Andrew and or as we get more drones up there and you begin to see more aerial footage or you're going to see more parts of the coastline looked like Mexico beach\nWhich is interesting to me about this is that when I heard that uh the meteorologist from ABC talk about IRS popping not uncommon\nThe central pressure or well look at it this way that the wind speeds this thing had over about a forty mile wide Carter were at three F for wind speeds\nDramatic wind speeds and it was not over a city block or over a neighborhood like you typically see or to an Asian or here's this was thirty to fifty miles wide of wind speeds and wind gusts of you know\nHave four in ... through you win\nAnd we're talking ... ... miles per hour winds is one hundred and fifty\nYeah we uh we had a ... we had a wind gust of one twenty nine at a temple Airforce base just to the southeast of Panama City itself\nOr not far from Mexico beach uh that was one of the few confirmed wind gusts that we actually measured but our top weather radar out of Tallahassee are about an hour before that I finally came ashore their Doppler radar Matt was measuring wins and access that's\nTwo hundred miles an hour oh my God about a thousand feet off the ground\nHouses don't stand up to two hundred mile wins know in lieu feeling on ... and that\nAnd that's why you're seeing is structures that were just literally blown apart the roofs peeled off the the exterior walls collapsed um it it it's devastating you know down there in the Gulf we always say prepare for a category stronger than we forecast\nJust because we know how challenging it is to forecast the rapid intensification look what happened to Florence\nShe got a little bit of strung up all of a wind and she dropped the category in a matter of six hours ... this system had all the ingredients in its favor and it just continued to deepen right up until landfall we saw Harvey do the same thing last year on the Texas coast\nRapidly intensify the day before came ashore in continue to strengthen as it moved inland\nAnd unfortunately that's the worst case set up for that area but for any area when that happened\nWhen I'm not at all surprised by on energy that the amount of\nDamage yeah and the storm surge now they had a we've ... confirmed reports of eleven or twelve feet of water above ground level down there which equates to that storm surge of nine to Thirteen treat that was being forecast\nAnd we talk about that just talking about storm surge or image because it was fascinating that is when you said twelve foot storm surge you're talking about from sea level there's an extra wall of water that goes twelve feet above that write so well\nActually it's not from sea level you know the surge itself is simply the difference in the water surface elevation\nFrom whatever the tide would be you know when the when it came ashore in this case it hit close to high tide and uh it's so it's whatever the differences in in this case we're projecting you know Thirteen feet of additional water level above the astronomical tied\nWhat we try to convey to the public is what's that going to be the depth of that water above ground at your house\nWhere you are standing and they were consistently forecasting nine to thirty nine to twelve feet above ground level water that and that doesn't include the weight so what you're seeing in parts of Mexico beach\nThe frontline homes were destroyed by wave energy and wave action with a huge thing\nLooking for a car credit not braid well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in each bring a generic ended up the best financed reason they don't rises in cars with zero percent NPR for Seventy two months you could be driving on a board salsa models interest free log on to what Tom\nLost over miles the beach from\nHow many ... we we talking about population wise given the idea was that the area how many people are now displaced\nNo I don't and I and I haven't seen anything reporter on that that that's a great question do I do know just to the east of the Tallahassee Mexico City area there's a lot of natural preserve in wildlife land there so it's you know part of the area that was the impact that really was not developed at all of his more natural preserve\nBut that area from the Mexico beach Tallahassee Panama City you know to the to the Alabama border that was a fairly densely populated coastal areas so there are kind of compartments where you've got a lot of development on either the barrier islands or right in the first you know sort of a mile of coastline where they are just packed in\nWhich always always of the areas that really got hit what's always fascinated me about this when you talk about the recipe that that that that fuels hurricanes it's warm water right I mean that's the the maintenance the gasoline engine\nIt is it is these things that heat machines that feed off all motion water or I call a Turkish bath water right and they were this thing we're sitting over sea surface temperatures Matt eighty six degrees Fahrenheit jeeze okay\nOn a on a warm summer up here we might get into the mid seventies just for comparison purposes now it's not just that the water's surface is eighty six degrees\nIt's the fact that over the Gulf of Mexico with that loop current you couldn't go down several feet or tens its feet and\nHave that same ocean temperature and the depth of that water is really what provides the heat in the energy for the hurricane\nNow one of them this case it had everything going for one of the things that hurricanes do is very true and if the water and get the cooler water that's underneath did it come to the top so it's kind of what is it it's kind of balances out the water temperature\nWell only if the system is slow moving if the system moves very slowly then yes you'll get what we call you know like mixing overturning of the ocean surface and we will up well or bringing the colder water from the lower deaths in the ocean up to the surface in gradually cool things off so that there's a little less energy for the hurricane to use\nThis system began to accelerate as it got to that loop current and got to that one pot of water so it really that had a chance to up well anything companies in the warm water is so deep\nUh it really didn't have much of an opportunity to get cooler beneath\nThat and the reason why I asked the question is because at least if you have in my mind I'm thinking to myself if you have a situation where that does happen\nAt least the um you'd hope anyway the the\nThe water's now cooler so should there be another storm a week from now or so there wouldn't be that much fuel for it right\nThat is that right so the average working\nOr that is correct in what it does is it leaves a cool wake behind it as if a multiple went through and you see the wake behind right about if you look at the sea surface temperatures now that this thing is going by I'm sure there's going to be a residual cool you know a little cool Carter in there\nBut again you have to realize the Gulf of Mexico is kind of a closed system right and it's not like the open Atlantic the water comes in South Florida and that's the only point the ocean comes in and out of\nEverything else is pretty much contained within the Gulf of Mexico so it gets to be very warm body of water what I'm really having a hard time with not between you and me is that this was the third most intense hurricane to hit the U.S\nIn our history and it did it in October ... not\nAugust September when we typically think about when the most intense hurricanes would occur so that that that just\nDid not really because things aren't cooling the way they're supposed to cool\nYeah at the oceans are a little warmer I'm In ... you know and we're seeing more of these types of storms these slow moving jogging on it that are viciously intense like Lawrence like Harvey like Katrina I'm In this one's in the same category I'm\nAn ... wouldn't be talking about the Harvey and I think even Florence too I mean they they uh what was it ... I think it was was foreign to just just they just idle right to me to come across the move around a little bit with ... and they just dumped tons of rain this was a quick moving things you had it was like a hammer right hamburgers and it was out of there and an hour and a couple of hours\nI'm next day the sun's out but I mean that's if that thing had meandering around for a while I mean yeah they would\nBe dealing with the right they would have dealt with cat category for sustained hurricane force winds for a day instead of six to ten hours\nThe forward motion of this was a little more akin to what we're accustomed to up here mhm like a hurricane Bob in Ninety One moving through it you know twenty five miles an hour or it looks like crazy and that all the damage from about ten in the morning to five in the evening\nAnd that's about what they saw really most of the damage was done from yesterday morning 'til about the early evening\nUm because of that forward motion but again it you know it's it's a balancing act if this thing hits", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Matt Allen Show", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "11"}
