know all about propane and they know that it's a cleaner burning fuel source and it's much more efficient than oil\nOr if you've got an oil boiler in the bottom of your your basement than you probably already know that you have one of those giant oil tanks\nAnd that ruins your basement and I can and they all leak they they have like leeks you had to put a kitty kitty litter or undermine to pick up the oil it's just a mess and in in in to get the oil Iran and plus that's all that tank does it it's all it's war is to run your oil there you can't run anything else with with propane\nYou got the propane tank first of all the tank is outside and nowadays they bury them\nSo you don't even see the tank all you see is a little periscope sticking up where they feel it\nThe propane can run your boiler you can cook with that you can run a whole home generator with it you could even run a little ... out to the deck to run the gas grill so you never run out of propane and propane plus you know there's a leader in this this is what they do they've been doing it so long that they actually have other companies call them and say how do we do this whole propane thing because they honestly don't know\nAnd so they they will get them and they're such nice people they tell them I Would tell them where to get off but the people who propane plus it's so nice they tell them what to do but then they they know that they're never going to be as good as propane plus they all know all about service\nThey know how to make sure you delivered they've got to have a complicated computer algorithm or that figures out when you need propane delivery so you never run out everything is all set and you get all building males perfect\nRight these two phone numbers that if you're in southeastern Massachusetts

over the show and it's just like jumps in the driver's seat and you go on [laughter] oh you want to keep up here that's right you got it [laughter] so uh round business competition\nIs is a great great a vent we we've been holding it since about two thousand spin around about Eighteen years but we've had Fifteen competitions\nAre we are one of the largest community based business competition I guess you write up into the Mike there right up into my car I one of the largest ah community based business competitions on an annual basis we give away approximately two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cash prizes to three to six winters and finalists\nUm we have approximately sixty sponsors each year always looking for more and and we're very happy do I have ... one of our pills sponsors is as well as cumulus so\nUm [noise] what we find is that the growing ecosystem in Rhode Island for entrepreneurs is is flourishing and I think to get started event as well as the business competition event is really open to any one and it pulls all the various a\nVertical lines if you will write for whether it's med tech food based social based uh we pull them all together and anybody can participate in ... come away with prizes how\nHow do we compare in the state compared to other places and you know you always hear about Silicon Valley and you hear about how do we compare in terms of entrepreneurship and and Noone budding businesses are we doing or towards the top of the back or\nYou know I really hard to tell I think what we find in the competition which is amazing\nIs that while we've done this Fifteen Years um in in in the middle of that we had a major recession right in the government or you know in the country but when you look at since that recession the amount of companies that have come through the competition as well as get started and they are still flourishing in Rhode Island and hiring\nEmployees in Rhode Island buying and selling to around businesses\nUm we have a great alumni list that we share together and when you look at some of these companies where there's people that came to Rhode Island and stayed in around I think that's really where you see the value and we're seeing some of these companies come back and be sponsors of our our protection that as a way to estimate\nThat says that he really that it's come full circle and ... you know as the uh the new market editor for you know I'm you know what do you think about this this whole entrepreneurial spirit if you will in Rhode Island\nSure ed so Rhode Island and now we write about local packing innovation or Detroit media company we're in um ten other markets across the country that thanks to my colleague parties\nI have a little bit of insight tell other markets are grow excellent um when we came to Rhode Island we wouldn't have happened to a market if we didn't think there are some level of contact and write about\nDoing it we would be a but in the year and a half a little bit that we've been in Rhode Island for a ... ... and now that given either never seem to be enough\nHours in the day it cover what is going on\nIn the ecosystem and the being here over like I said a little over a year and a half or Britain right under three hundred stories on the east coast than while I'm with that and nearly Seventy two weekly newsletter with you know tech ... that pertains to what's going on in Rhode Island\nI feel like we haven't even scratched the surface and it's really fun about this particular ecosystem is okay everybody wants to support each other is incredibly um\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln if there were against it on parallel Marjorie impeccable surface\nLift all boats situation right he it's incredibly diverse I yeah talking last we just did this huge editorial project and\nTwenty five hundred twenty five that we're talking to a really interesting young entrepreneurs and the various you know high schools and top notch educational institutions in Rhode Island\nBut I'm also speaking with you people out of college or people you know deciding that they didn't like their data and wanted to change the well to their start up\nThrough a variety of interest rate so it's always interesting as a writer and editor [laughter] you just oh it it's a treat and\nYou're you're always looking for that story that's going to be compelling and and and excite you readers to to read more\nAnd a ... nice to know the Rhode Island is a fertile hunting ground if you will for that sort of thing exactly well but\nSo what's the um what's the future of the business the business competition wins a window of people get involved in in one of the requirements\n[noise] you just have to have a business or an idea for a business um you know to get started alright dot com to find out a little bit more about the finals last year and we usually start a recruiting for a finalist or pictures\nIn may and so we're we're in between right now we just wrapped up um but the road out of business competitions they're just gonna gearing up right now so that's good yeah\nWe we just had our kickoff event in a couple of weeks ago right and we're going to do a pitch contests are in December on December fifth and any participant that wants to participate in that doesn't have to enter the actual\nUh business competition it's a it's a one shot event where we welcome people to come in and pitch their business and winners go home at some prizes\nUm and then the competition will kick off again in January we have a series of workshops one a month of January February march\nOn different ideas such as defining your business idea and find funds and it all culminate with applications do the end of march beginning of April we have a great group of judges who get together to approximately a dozen semifinal is\nWe didn't have those semifinals come in and and pitch to us with a their business plan as well as a presentation we pick six or seven finalists and we have a big awards ceremony in may where we invite everybody to come out and see the actual final is pretty their business\nAt the end of the award ceremony we as I said give approximately two hundred and fifty thousand in prices and services and\nAnd this is a question for either Ross or maybe coordinate 'em ... if you're a budding entrepreneur and let's say you know you're you're in the shower one day and all of a sudden than I Do strikes you and you're like oh my God this will be a perfect business why isn't anybody doing this\nOr their support services are there are people out there that can help you to get from the shower to an actual comedy obviously drying off and getting dressed being part of that\n[laughter] record ...\nEra on yeah most definitely a good ecosystem\nIt wanted to find his health is that it has it's our writers incubator co working space is ... ship opportunities\nIn Rhode Island has said ... on\nThrough the university and of course being a great ... to go\nIf that's not your bag I um you know I think people finding a lot of ... social enterprise greenhouse Providence\nOn and and just even meeting fellow entrepreneur at like one of the ... seemingly trillions of parking spot I'm across the state so there's no reason to feel alone as an entrepreneur if you're if you're feeling it gave a great idea and\nIt got started a competition and the Rhode Island as it's thank opposition just go to the pitching network I was at that the um get started that a couple of weeks ago and not an incredible people so yeah\nYeah and and like you said there's so many um accelerators and in a business incubator is out there that can take you from idea if you're\nGoing to write a business plan and you're right because it goes into ... where's the market our way to get funding right and that's usually that's why most of those great ideas that people have in the shower go down to drink because they don't really did not grant writing\nYou know so that and that's what we're all here but we're here to be supportive of each other a different organizations kind of create a spotlight on on this ecosystem these entrepreneurs\nUm you know we can't be the best kept secret in Rhode Island is we've got a great community the business community um we were just talking earlier about uh Michelle Peterson and you know where she came from and then we're she's saying\nI mean ... great stories to um our winter last year in each and we dropped plans from the name it's business\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own tradition I bought bought any religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood Otto John job now\nSo if the parents are in a battle defining balance ... divulging personal [laughter] but I I think we show is a great story that represents a Rhode Island success because she\nShe's not from Rhode Island and she came I Believe from Michigan and and she came to school here and we hear about the the drain where people come into Rhode Island and come to one of our fabulous educational institutions and then leave ... well she came here and and she formed a business and she points on building business here and\nShe was a winner in the business competition last year she went on participate in and get started\nUm she's part of the Rhode Island mashed challenge group\nAnd it's great when you hear that story if somebody came into her own loved what we had here the beaches that the close proximity of non fragmented ecosystem I think when you go to the bigger cities that the entrepreneurial communities very fragmented\nWe all know each other we all work together or we had a winter several years ago similar story identities from ... who came down from Canada ... and he went on competition and and he tells the story how have you participated in the competition won't you wouldn't be in Rhode Island

few Democrats are going to jump vote Virgil trailer maybe you're going to get a few Democrats are going to vote for Alan funk yep maybe you're going to get a few Republicans sitting in the hope Regina yeah maybe and I bet you they'll call in you know but that's the that's the way it goes in\nUm the the plain fact of the matter is Joe ... is is not going to be governor and if he stays in the race nor is Alan ... and those are facts and and there's no way to get around facts facts are or what we call facts and they're stubborn little things Christians in Cumberland Chris you are on the John ...\nHey John while about that last caller yeah\nYou know that's that was one was you better get on the phone and call that show tell them you're a Democrat and you both for me [laughter] that's what

which is which I always have already forty four percent of the ... the residual goes wherever that other guy yeah what do you think\nNow it's all it's possible it's possible but here's what makes that unlikely um you know everybody knows the gene has got you know millions and millions of dollars and we see a lot of it on the television but what we don't see is the get out the vote effort she is going to get people out to vote that have never voted in an election ever [laughter] I mean and\nBut you see that's the kind of credential you need\nTo get the attention of the national Democratic Party that's the kind of stuff they look for and they're rising stars Indian she'll be featured at the convention\nThis is the governor of Rhode Island she banned all weapons would detach a magazine you know and that's that's what the kind of thing they're going to be looking for Allen is dial a broadcast from the beautiful city of Cranston Allen you are on the John Lawson show good to have we could just say one second okay bunch of Alan\nAlan\nNope that's Kenny there's Alan hey Alan how are you trying to fight our Christmas go crazy back then she answered the phone I'm calling because if you ever see the Ed Sullivan show the guy spin in the plates on top of the sticks you know everything's good that yeah that's that's personal thing I don't believe a lot of balls ass indeed well we keep we keep a crazy here on the John Lawson sure\nJohn I Want I Want to again most times they call I concur with what you say they do it again\nI I don't know if your travel but I Know him through your when the show and through with some other shows I'm like in the morning with a you know with your other hosts that you're very young but I think you're right I think he could be a big hero and he's still may be if he if he um if he does pull out of you for your door says\nAllen fun and and the reason that you didn't mention before that I wanted to add in it because\nI'm sure that Washington is watching this you know they're watching all the states closely watching all the reelection closely and they could get Joe trouble ever dropped out and really truly support me right now in foreign and he\nDid win ... and then they knocked off the um they stopped the sanctuary state stuff\nYou know where that wasn't an issue here anymore I'm sure that he would have this president so darn gratitude of course you would it would help in that and not only that but it would help the state let's say if our farm appointed and resell position in the state yeah I mean they would have agreed in to Washington which we don't have right now\nWe might have if we get the judge we got to get the judge or at least a lot of votes where am I Hope people come out for them now because\nI'm you know we're getting close to this election I think your ... or follow your advice I think that he should uh 'cause you'll never beat Alan from\nWay no no no he's going to do that Allen Fung doesn't win that's that's basically what he does what that is he even said that's what he wants to do\nIs um which is you know I you know everybody has their own\nBlood legion is southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln MTC Lincoln Lincoln MTC and the only twenty eight gene Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of never against such funds here alone luxury ...\nSuicide for the people that he wants to represent right and this is his time to shine he could really do something for the state and you're right it could be a big hero not only here but what the president that he supported the last time around here\nYou absolutely right you know rent one you'll make a difference\nOh one other thing I wanted to mention John is your first caller the guy from Worcester yes he was talking about George Soros yes in theory George Soros is dirty during those two were like the great Britain for example he just or what he does he's short for dollar\nIf you look up and George Soros now on the Internet you could probably look up at George Soros shorting the dollar and you'll see that that's what he is\nTrying to to you made a billion dollars by destroying the English economy he wants to do the same thing here that's why he backs the open societies and all those 'cause he knows it's just going to drain our economy he summoned happen\nYou know over the last uh administration so I think that there's something to that I think George Soros has a a money incentive I don't think he cares about people at all and he just wants to make another billion or to\nRight yeah you can be right now and I've got to do more homework on there 'cause somebody's paying the bills right now people are moving you don't know four thousand people you know a couple of thousand miles without somebody paying for potty stops in sandwiches and you know something like that\nIf I was a betting man and I mean I'm not in that case I Would say the point where it to him and maybe at times sky or anything to hurt the Republicans because they want to have their gender crux they're not doing it for free they're doing it for a reason you drive\nThank you very much for me or ... you\nKnow appreciate out thank you very much for the call let's grab a Donny in North king sound Donny you are on the John Lawson she'll be happy\n[laughter] hey John good afternoon long time listener first time I've ever called because I think I'm I'm the same Donny that the wrote that both those picked up by go local probably would have been going back and forth on\nThat was such an incredibly for those ... home Johnny wrote this um this open letter to George ... basically saying hey joke please don't do this they must save us from two point oh Gina and and it was very very well written and we may well received I I'm not sure it it made much of an impact on on Jay Z but I Will\nI get some feedback I mean I think it's I think my favorite part of that red was a member of what somebody with the last name pillow comment that that um that the job was the right man for the job and I I responded with a mean from GI Joe that that I spoke to cobra commander he says that corporate command is the best\nPerson for the job [laughter]\nBut you know in in ... Joe probably wouldn't have made a great governor but the way you do that if you're a Republican as you go in the primary you make your case in the primary you win the primary and then you go on to the general you don't you don't do this to just destroy the other guy and what's not all about\nI got to say I ah\nI appreciate you spreading the message and it isn't like world against Joe I I I I've also like I said in my letter I think it was probably a great guy we have a some crossover circles or fears of employment\nAnd he could be so much better for the state if you took the ... not just me but not a lot of people think that he's got to understand all he's doing and securing dean is packed with that\nYeah ... I don't know if you've heard the call from David or from talking to was on earlier I'm David you know basically said the gene as in favor of a ban on all weapons in the state of Rhode Island they haven't removable magazine\nYeah I Know that we're done or is your credentials for the national nationals a lover\nYeah and and you\nKnow I I what what part of that I wrote the Joe I tried to keep it as a political as possible but I did take a swipe at the end I don't recall exactly how a reference\n[laughter] I think the word drone writing was yeah that might have been yeah\nResume padding and and really that her agenda from what I understand the rumblings from other people have spoken to you know it was sort of curious when a when her girl did win the presidential election and and the rover the\nRumor statement which I I don't want to read something he wasn't happy and being stuck in Rhode Island they think is what the what it all boils down to\nAnd she she's not just stuck here we're stuck with her and then all of the few in lifting honesty told you think they're not going to pull cars they are yeah we need a savior and I in the early ... I Believe\nJoke could be that savior if he did the right thing and ruin with Alan and said look we may not like each other but we're not here to help ourselves we're ... we're here to help the people of Rhode Island and if you're in that business if you're a politician you know but this year responsibility the public at large we just want to be held were being\nKept on I wrote the being stepped on by this overreaching empire that we have there and I could I just want\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood born in east British and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nPublic and party because you'll have decided that he can take votes weighed in Rhode Island state is it about Alan it's about a\n... ... ... it is in in where the oil to\nGive it up with it but I Know it goes but they do is help but ... we we really really ... leaving your more\nIf you do this one sacrificial thing for everyone that voting on a a threat than normal the from the ... the I guess I'm I'm I'm at a lot but we're not because I I really actually emotional about this younger than\nI I Am as well done if they give you the quite they forgot letter and ah for those of you who may have missed that you can go on my Facebook page which is I don't know what it is done to face before and the Facebook page and or you can see the letter that are done he wrote it was a very heartfelt letter an open letter or the joke shrill oh let's see if it has an impact you're listening\nTo John often show coming up next reviews of movies we have yet to see which is always a fascinating segment on the show back with more after this [noise]\n\nHoliday parties at cafe new wells out on the river walk with a festive atmosphere stores cuisine and service so brilliant even the brightest lights flash cafe knew of his day for five days your medical Holly Bailey\nLegit kale engineering design and install a carrier infinity system for your home or business today the scarier systems have the highest rebates in the market they are quite an energy efficient you could save over fifty percent on your energy bills just by having\nJay kale replace that old clunker Jay kale engineering also specializes in complete commercial rooftop systems from designed to the doctor worked insulation and service replacement some of these units can be done in a matter of hours as well as the duck was split systems called J.K out today for a free estimate beret factory\nAuthorized carrier and now being dealer for installations an service licensed in Rhode Island and math scans and improve national grid BP I install there plus financing is available Jay kale engineering your cooling heating and water purification experts\nI'm Tony phrases from Jay chaos engineering give us a call today at Fort hole one two three five one Seventy six hundred\n... a select quote agent with the true story that could save you hundreds of dollars a year\nA woman named Linda just called her husband re has a three hundred thousand dollar group life insurance policy but it's changing jobs and can't take it with him well I shocked the many highly rated term life insurance companies we represent\nMm [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nNow you know\nThing [noise]\n[noise]\n\nReally mail by\nGoing to be from the New England truck solutions to the news talking I mean I whenever I Am six thirty WPRI accumulate station [noise]\nJournalist death brings to protest I'm In ...

far closer or they get along or is a lot of this stuff you just need to ... it was the same thing with with Hillary Trump they did was almost a similar\nSituation that uh there was the Hillary so
