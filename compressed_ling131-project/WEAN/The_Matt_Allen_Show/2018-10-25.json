right or the other Donald Trump's with the media needs to stop there have to live with that and I said yeah they're All right\nEverybody's right everybody's right\nSo who's going to do it\n\nAnd the up certainly part doesn't bother me so much because there's going to be a lot of absurdity in the world and as long as we recognize that it's absurd then I can handle the absurdity because all of that stupid thing ever goes yeah it's pretty stupid ... it's what I worry where and people who wouldn't you would think our normal would see something that's absurd and go yeah it's a sort of started go well maybe not\nWatch yeah get a get on board with this man this is not a this is an absurd what are you talking about oh yeah no no no no\nWe'll see you come from a privilege point of view your privileges of what you see are you you're allowed to call that absurd because if you're a privilege\nWatch watch that's when things start going haywire\nBecause at that point at best we have now

don't need it\nThat's where we get so that's where you get the president reading the teleprompter yesterday these are cowardly act they do not do well and then you gotta then you get Hillary Clinton she's sitting there all of this is a tough time in our society now I mean so they're not really being genuine they just got to check\nThe box because the media says you should check the box\nAnd then the media will be like oh we didn't do any of that we don't do well not biased where over objective reporters looking for the truth okay sure you are please so who is it who's going to lead the who's going to lead to who's going to lead the revolution in the in the political discourse they make any ideas marks and comments remark WPRI mark\nHow're you doing to thank you\nI don't think anybody's going to be you know I mean\nHe's like you know will back off when we when we regain power and stuff like that you know and I mean my whole thing with this bombing thing\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine from us blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like flood out over time\nCan bond and none of them go off one guy opens up lock the bomb and carry that out of the woods and getting calls like now and I think it's just to bring attraction just the same as the dusty a you know it's the same animal and ah\nWhen you think that but you don't have evidence of that [noise] no no no that that's\nMy thought I mean it it you know there there's\nYou know but you know the homeless and you know that you're not going to get over it well you know they don't you you know that your thought is based on your own assumptions in and and bigotry is about the other side of the of the political out right right okay I Want to make sure you know it'll it'll take that for what it's worth\nWhat's that worth ... what's that world are doing\nJust bringing you know it's great to themselves and it's not you know there's no way to overcome it you know they're just people like that it was the same way uh when the slaves are free you know I mean\nThe KKK come out of the woodwork you know and a ... that's ... ... a Lincoln was the father of the Republican Party and um and that's what brought that about\n... went to a dance and down the criminals passed now I have no idea where we went we we meander down in a place that I have I did not follow my point was saying what's it worth what is your what is your opinion worth see this the other thing this is the other thing and I will once again credit doctor Jordan Peterson roping in my eyes to this one\nWe've we've we've\nBeen in this is you if you don't know Jordan Peterson is look him up on the on YouTube please and watched the fifty thousand hours of videos that he has please below God listen to his podcast because he talks about and this is this is twelve rules for life book and all that stuff it's great read\nHe talks about the steady diet of rights and privileges that we fed to ourselves to our young to our children who are people that we all talk about what rights we have we have a right to do this we have a right to you have a right to any crackpot opinion you have\nYou have a right to think that there's been some kind of you know a sinister conspiracy\nHere you have a right to that and I'm not going to tell you know you have a right to that\nYou don't have any evidence to it and if you don't have any evidence is not based on anything other than just your own assumptions about what you see\nOr your theories about what you've seen what is that worth in other words what's the quality of that opinion you have a right to it just because you have a right to it doesn't mean you have you don't have a responsibility to make it worth something\nYou know we don't have a we don't have conversations about responsibility around here and responsibilities and blame responsibility is saying look there's something wrong here I'm going to help fix it\nI'm going to take responsibility for this I'm going to say All right give it to me I'll take care of it at the very least you should take responsibility for your own opinions and make sure that there is high quality as possible\nWe are inequality crisis like the likes of which have never seen and because of all would everything's candy everything's just flipping nonsense and blow V.\nAiding and blew that ... that's again social media just throwing things out there just because why not if you're going to have an opinion that there's a conspiracy out there tell me the evidence that's real\n\nNow I'm not saying it's not possible that's there's some left wing crackpot out there is that in order to that you'll see you know brought before a judge at some point why did you do this\nI wanted the people out there to know that Donald Trump was focusing their little as possible it's very possible you never know why people do this stuff is just as possible that there's some crackpot out there with\nA with America had ongoing we're going ... minimum wage jobs\n\nGame we all lose that game because eventually the bomb comes to your house\nYou just a video game\nAnd so if you want to take the temperature down and start to come together on some common ground stuff we've got to take our eyeballs off the fun house mirror start to see reality from what it is and tell the trolls in the margins to go away back under the bridge with you\nAnd that starts with expecting better from ourselves and actually having an opinion that's worth something rather than just my ... ...\n... oh\nHow would you like motor drenched twenty gene truck to be here for only one

and he joined Narragansett\nDebbie Hi Matt you're original question asking if we thought of anyone out there right now\nYeah who is the credibility to to leave the discourse change in this country\nRight and as far as the Republicans are concerned I think they should send Mike Pence out there and I think\nThey should utilize him get him out there and get them on the air because they can't I mean if you say the vice president\nWell here's the thing you know unfortunately one ends up happening is he'll say all that stuff and then Trump will come on and say something completely undermined everything you say so [laughter] you know what I mean\nTrue I I Know what you're saying but part of Mike Pence is job when when I Believe I thoroughly believe when they picked him as a vice presidential candidate Trump it was to balance it out a little bit\nWhile I'm usually traditionally it's quite the opposite what usually you do is you get a little firebrand is the vice president the president has to be presidential the vice president to go out into the rise\nAlready knew what they had with Donald Trump yeah yeah so\nTo kind of balance that out a little bit I think Mike Pence I think a lot of people do respect him from both parties but definitely the Republican I think doing right now it seems like these bomb attempts that coming from\nThe middle night Democrat anyways\nYeah or do we don't really can and that's what it looks like from the outside and if all things are what they are then you you know you'd be right but I don't know that they are where they are\nAre the
