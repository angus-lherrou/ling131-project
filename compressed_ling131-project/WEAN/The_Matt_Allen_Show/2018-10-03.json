Republican Joe troll now who is didn't have enough courage to run in the Republican\nPrimary medical independent right who is going to single handedly give the governorship back to the Democrat who we all want out so just think that you're a Republican for Thirty years\nAnd you are single handedly gonna run as an independent to take another folks just the way from Allen so we put Gina back in the off\nRight this is not a new theory we get it was ... one\nReason he's gonna one ounce tomorrow he's going to tell us the real reason that he sold out which most of us know why he was too chicken to run against Alan man to man and if he lost\nHe could work together or what the other woman who is wonderful to instead of the three Republicans in the state\nAnd deal with another municipal union that's going to drive the buses run that have the city manager buses\nFor some strange reason that makes my skin crawl but yeah there's a case to be made I Love to hear it that to me the energy needs to be spent on how to get the kids out of how to make it so that there's a there's the children can be used as leverage\nRight now the kids in Providence being used as leverage in a job actually between the bus company and their employees so what do you do about that you're just as good as mine Williams Newport William your WPRI William\nI'm good thank you\nI don't think it was yeah\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen trunk of the here for only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to forge twenty eighty four to one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a flood forward and essential Narragansett\nAre pretty equal but you know this is where I think in a you know he didn't believe that because they're they're not being at all real it out you know what that could actually hear it and they're not going to get anywhere no one's going to get anywhere you go back it really middle ear ... someone you understand\nBoat died and ... you know and they go on for another month but um if that's what it actually resolving that throwing out Cokie and I\nYeah I mean I'm looking I think this is the too you're talking about simple by always running for state legislature he's running for the he's the head of the ... the um the progressive Democrats or was for a long time and he started to read ran for office and I think he's a state senator in Providence is what he's running for Senate office in Providence\nUh yeah that's right you want a freeway primary yeah\nSo he says this is a series disruption to so many families the city needs to force first student come to the table and agree to the unions very reasonable\nAsks time for ... to show leadership and we should stop picking contractors who treat their workers badly or a year to find all those things are you going for somebody to come to the table\nHow you're going to force we would what would you want the ... award privately they'll go in there and take a for student by him and do something I don't know what power the mayor has the force anybody to come to a table and then on top of it\nUm stop picking contractors to treat their workers badly there's a there's a disagreement here about post employment benefits\nAre they there's evidently a lot of money for per hour on the table here treat people badly I don't think is the is the issue here outside of the the rhetoric\nOr that you know did they use to negotiate with each other but you know to sit there and say we want a pension versus a more money put towards a uh towards the four one K. plan a defined treating them badly\nOr right yeah I don't I don't know what he's talking about it's probably just campaign rhetoric or I don't know what that means\nYeah well that's a problem with the unrealistic and you know put the onus on one side and granted you know what we're really going out what's fair compensation in your economic security for driving a bus that you're\n... and ... and ... and here's the thing not the city's problem\nRight the city's problem is getting their kids to school and hiring a place it's going to bring those kids to school what they make in the ... and you know what they consider fair wages if that's a free market thing and they're they're working the free market thing out if you want to have a situation where you're going to be\nA you know if you if you don't want to be at the mercy of any sort of job action when it comes to your buses I don't know what privatizing amid privatization you know are you going in the opposite way and and and what and making these guys public employees you're still going to have him unionized and you still have the same kind of problem\nRight only an American or whoever me that they're going to counsel I get rid of your your school committee whoever it is that you know a lot we don't like that on because of the weight because we you know the way\nFor you to drivers on air though as a result we're not going to argue the writer right we've already heard there's hardly any\nU.S companies out there or maybe you don't know whether it's a contract anyway so yeah it is that what the dialogue or Syria I'm On the Web and more and that it ... the ah you know the company I even as a union first and my dog growing up in that environment\nWorking class that right as I Know I'm pretty sure yours on that you got out and the reality well you got to look at the\nOf one of the benefits would have done it one of the reasons why I've I've always been a while since they supported by less critical of public sector unions is because there's a natural\nAh ... there's an actual there's ... there's a natural consequence like you know if you want to band together and negotiate with the business because you're in through union if their collective bargaining the end at the end of the day you can't make that business and solve it\nOtherwise everybody loses and so that's the that's the mitigating factor or however public sector unions you know when you have the power to tax taxpayers\nAre until they're dead or [laughter] there's less of that that that are natural uh you know stopping point that that you have to go towards so William thanks for the call I mean in this case you gonna have to let them work it out and then if they decided to can't come to a new to a\nAn agreement on it now on the city is either going to figure out a way to get his kids who have literally a constitutional civil right to get an education\nUm and sometimes when it comes to that the the legal rulings interpretations of that that deal with are kids who are in an ... which is an individual education plan usually special needs are special education or whatever some of those things contained you have a civil right to get to school\nYou know those rights are being fined technically being violated right now and the mayor and the the city of Providence is not equipped to quickly on a dime turn and get that\nHow would you like motor trends twenty gene trucks with the here for only one Ninety nine process will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars from us only at flood forward and essential Narragansett\nOh okay okay the last one you had before about Gina enticing or bribing him I think it was quote but miss\nThe mark because there's an element that you would have to check regarding legalities and criminality because if that were the case it'd be confessing to a crime by taking the bribery enticement to do it what I'm guessing is\nHe's going to come up with some information that Alan ... campaign came up to him and he kept proof of that to drop out\nSo your theory is tomorrow Joe true lo see what's interesting if it's if you can read into this thing about a thousand different ways because you you're saying he's gonna so you're going with the idea that he would\nCome up with something negative about one of his opponents about Alan fun Alan ...\nTo pay him off to get out of the race which I again I'm not sure you've got a lawyer with they maybe they can comment but I thought it was a criminal act to somehow bride or in tight someone to either on or drop out like when they have primaries that usually comes\nI mean it would depend on how it works and what was done and what was said to me if it's like hey you know drop out of the race come work with me and then we'll find a position and the administration I don't think that's a problem a lot I Know that if it is right no I don't think I think that that's a bit of that I don't I don't think that that's an issue\nUm I think that what what is an issue I guess that depends on how it's done it issue is oh by the way your property and Cranston it's got a big tax bill on that can make that tax bill go away could be that if you if it's something like that then maybe but this I don't think it's that because it wouldn't\nBe it's this is seems like it's more of a positive thing just because the way it's word and not so much like\nA big news tomorrow that you know that will show Allan Fung for who we really as something like that you know so I don't know I don't I just don't get the idea of that I think it's going to be something more like a\nAn endorsement or or like the the one uh email I got here says about him spending a ton of his own money for the next thirty days I think that's a big that's a big thing that can be in a landscape changer\nOn our stand by my predicts and right\nNow we'll see tomorrow call me back tomorrow all righty alright teaching in Providence coming thing just to be some kind of corruption angle here\nThat that would be I mean that would be a game changer I just don't I don't know I don't get the feeling of\nThat I don't get that take but who knows\nSo if you're just joining us what's what happened is jokes are all about an hour ago put out a press release saying the tomorrow's a big announcement\nOr let me read it to specifically something to the effect of a a big big ah landscape changing as the quote\nI read it to you Joe ... to make major campaign announcement at press conference during a press conference Thursday October fourth\nRhode Island independent gubernatorial candidate Joe ... making a major campaign announcement at twelve noon and his campaign headquarters antics located at six forty to east avenue and work Rhode Island this is directly across the street from the main campaign headquarters\nQuote my announcement will change all my notes that will change the landscape of this year's governor's race central\nIt'll change the landscape pretty sure he doesn't mean like grass [laughter] er and he's the he'll be on the smart one o'clock right after the whole thing to to talk about whatever it is\nAnd if it's if it's not a major league thing that changes the landscape than our mocking merciful mercifully\nWe'll see you better be good you're wasting my time\nBut we'll see what's going to change the landscape because they get needs to be a landscape change I'll tell you what it's been a very underwhelming have you gotten to the point yet where all these these ads you've seen these political ads have become white noise I see a gene or a Monday Alan ... out on my own health care we go\n[noise] fall asleep they become complete white noise and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Matt Allen Show", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "03"}
