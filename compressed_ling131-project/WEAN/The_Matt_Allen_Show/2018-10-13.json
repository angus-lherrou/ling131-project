supposedly happening this weekend on the school bus or a strike that we perceive is now\nComing to an end your for your comments on that are obviously to play you know are\nWe going to bust burn and a good ... was related or not we believe it is to the end of the strike but you'll sorts of their\nOkay so you had the buses destroyed and I think three other areas that can be salvage and a\nWhite lightning red lightning strike or anything or or or battery faulty batteries something like that yeah\nLightning struck nine times out of that particular case and boy are we are lucky that every other bus didn't blow up a sure I'm not mistaken they did have fuel and\nSo on that no I don't know how I'm just going to go back three weeks how a mayor in all seriousness could say I'm staying neutral when he\nHas nine thousand kids not getting the school not being able to find transportation to school\nAnd then he has the audacity this day well taken over are left you know the little elementary school kids or middle school kids and uh when the rules for Wilbur as clearly no we're not under Eighteen is allowed in so that shows\nHis forgive me his ignorance and has arrogant and you know this is another reason I through my head and enough is enough of someone being at the helm and not being able to step up to the flight\nWhat are you would you believe is going to be a settlement and and there's ... gym the kennel\n... claim some semblance of victory on this I I Believe ... did not show any leadership I think this circumstances that we won't get into the contributed to this or this quick settlement but ah you you obviously will claimed victory but are your thoughts near\nWell of course so claimed victory but two days before it was going to be in our is the correct correct could have taken months I mean again I said that's the other day I don't get it I don't understand it but I don't know where he's coming from deviant plea don't understand it\nAll along the same lines I gotta I gotta I Am I going to put you on the spot here for about ... or ... the teachers are the same thing two years with no contract how would how would you fix this if you're going to you\nKnow again so these two are related I said once before I went to rep that if they if they could have supplied buses whether it's the right thing to put elementary kids school on it I don't know what they said certainly if the mayor had come to them\nSix weeks before when he knew they absolutely could have had buses and they certainly could have had the ride buses or the kids who have to eat pie and a special needs\nSo that's one thing and if he went to have done that then he could have gone to the other cities in Rhode Island and ask for their buses after they did their drop off if he had a relationship with the teachers the\nTeachers could have staggered opening and closing but how can you dare go to someone and ask for a favor when you literally flip them\nUh for close to two years or\n... literally the finger yeah I mean I don't understand it and you need your teachers a city and I know you guys are absolutely into business and a well functioning a environment\nYou cannot have a city thrive if you do not have an educated population no business will come here when they see the schools\nAre operating the way they are they're not safe they're not ... they're full of mold and you'll have to you\nHow would you like motor trench twenty gene truck if the here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eighty four to one fifty self destruct for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at point forward and he went into and there were against it\nYou know let your doors down the street I mean I remember walking is really in the olden days walking to I'm a school we walk at least two miles and we grow I was five years old walking kindergarten\nYou know it it's awful you brought up the point this is a different time\nRight and what and you know you're a little older than I Am but both within the same but what I'm saying is within that same generation will fifties and sixties births okay well let's let's let's call it what it was\nThey was racial cultural divides throughout the city and stuff like that right okay and and and and I and I by no means means to any insult anybody but you had\nWhite Irish Catholic over here in LA and her to have the Jewish people on the side and you have the Italians on federal al and we all had our own little cliques\nThat the city now is it's become so racially diverse was and then this is the point there's no longer the need to send your kid halfway across the school because you know ... anybody a shelter it\nRight now and and I and I think this is all going to change and and and you know that that would be a big undertaking if somehow know the back of get done you'd save a lot of money right off the bat\nUp I've still got a wonderful\nWonderful to be able to accomplish\nI mean people say how do we have heard this is one way we differ\nYes it is yeah and it's ... and ... and I think it's still creates a divide amongst people and and if it needs to be it needs to be addressed it needs to be straightened out um you know the Providence is ... it's a good city it's a great city when it's running functionally and it's cleaned up and and and I hope\nI Hope the fact that you're a breath of fresh air that you get in there and then you can bring the some life back into the city\nI Hope so we're trying hard and you're going to be on T. V. next week and uh I'm doing everything I possibly can you have any ... ...\nYeah I'm Sorry to have any debate scheduled with the laws yeah\nWe had one debate with the downtown neighborhood association which was a great debate\nLast Tuesday then uh we have one is telling friday jak wrong I think we have one on November I second\nNice good now as far as to what\nYour back your back so

last minute push and therefore you know wonderful okay yes entail okay All right that's my promise to you and that you know clean and anybody else who wants to take it through naturally because we

gets in um I don't think people people know\nThat I'm living on one of the ... the governor is tough of this thing not to be in the mirror prominence in the state\nYou know a lot of people don't live in Providence they shelter themselves from that what goes on in Providence\nAnd it's it's amazing the financial mess that's ... yeah uh uh the the pension system or a is is so grossly under funded a you've got a teacher's without contracts I Know what I'm friends with some of those teachers you know okay um\n... it's just funny it it it he just can't keep pushing this crap off the site is not going to go away you know my brother my brother's a saying like people like I was like the ostrich they have they said they spent six to\n... it's it's a it's it's taking something like a duty Williams who who doesn't need it but wants to genuinely ... committed ourselves to public service\nIn ... in some black and white situation in terms of who who those people that want to commit to a public service and those people are just doing it for for for for whatever it is a self promotion self gain a you know she she doesn't need this and and that's really one of the most compelling points in\nShe's not a little bit low types of she lives in New jobs could have a half a million dollars or all money right yeah you know she's not going to the strip paycheck you know and you know and and like she set out of ... when he we had around here I\nShe she loves prominence yeah and and ah it you know ... book CNC love Providence ... and and when and a lot of good things\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nYeah you know because right now they're scattering scattering out of prominence and there's very few reasons other than\nBut you know even the culture you know ... you know and I am talking about changes to change the diversification of the culture you know in a lot of people don't realize if I'm going to give them free plug you there's a restaurant on trucks to an avid yes there is okay and I haven't been to it and then and it's tough to get reservations Colo Sandy sweep and you know\nWe've

calls\nOr some people like you like you did a gave the governor a kind of a pastoral lifeline on the person that's okay I get that but those calls kind of gave her lifeline in that we had we veered away from\nThe fact of the matter that Gina Raimondo right now with hurt abysmal record 'em is right now courage to walk into the end zone if things don't change and I think that the lessons of the news cycle the last three two or three weeks off into the awful and they have taken their white\nThe issues those issues we do we just set forth again Petra reforms are used to do you have these the
