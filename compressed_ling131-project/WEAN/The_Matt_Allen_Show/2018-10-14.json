Joe so you heard the stories that how it went down in according to your memory\nWell yeah I I a little ... a little different a lot of version a and I\nBy the way she said she called this morning I went up on the legislative website and went back and found out a a\nTrack down the bill that had been the cause of all of this so this ... this was back in April of er twenty ten ... little little on eight eight eight eight years ago a\nAnd I had put it in a bill or to eliminate what I had felt was a pretty ridiculous piece of legislation that we had a place that basically require people to go around it it's by boat toilets every four years you know are really anyhow uh and\nThis was why legislation eggs eggs exactly well here I had a you know yes anyway go ahead and do you have\nYour your heavily invested in the marine toilets at the core so so you know and oh and by the way I did not come forward with this story Joe this is a I'm a I\nI I I Know you didn't let me I had totally forgotten about you and I became friends you know I never like you I don't think we hold it against each other it was just a bad incident that happened but they're all trying to bring out every skeleton they can find well I\nI I I certainly didn't want to get on an airplane to have to come and testify so but since we can do it right here uh\nThe the the the major ... distinction if you can just to keep the record straight because I I I Would not want to have a my record that I\nInitiated into an assault by poking someone in the rye or a ... my my my recollection of the other point is is is very specific uh we we we'd had words over over over this\nA bill that I that I was trying to advance and these were very tense times by the way April\nIf you recall April twenty ten was when we were doing the deep water ... uh when bill and the and the uh what's his name the thirty eight studios so those are those a lot of tension that a lot of pressure in the building but anyhow so so we had we had our disagreement\nOn uh on on this bill and we we had stood up from the table and Joe ... had come up with really get in my face you know like ... ...\nIsn't heated debate you're eating a heated debate now and I can be\nA little light hearted at times ah and if you've ever watched Joe you don't have the full out for the house you know how how excited\nHe ... I like the description\nBefore about about arm waving a and uh I I was just looking at him and and I\nJust couldn't reach resist the temptation and I remember very specifically because it was two fingers but it was my thumb for finger and what I did was I reached out and I tweaked his nose or I attempted\nTweak his nose just because I thought this situation was so ridiculous at which point\nJoel went wild as you say the arm waving now bear in mind that both of us are at that point or over sixty five were bode well over Seventy now are so this was a couple\nOf old guys kind of bumping into each other and I stand physically I stand head and shoulders\nOver Joe uh uh you know ... six one uh over two\nOver two hundred pounds ... I was never in physical danger that ever got this whirlwind going in front of me and I just kind of put up my arms to fit to defend it off like you see in those cartoons and the result is you know that he hit\nMy arms a number of times a day I think they were fish but who knows\nA and I ended up with a quite a series of bruises or between a man elbow and shoulder on on both arms but that was the that was\nThe so is he took you're tweaking ... let me see if I can get this out what it was kind of boils down to listen so he took you're tweaking or as the nose as an assault of some kind and start whacking out you're waving his arms at ya and that\nThat that essentially it then we ... we we left the\nYou're talking about this this you took this this bringing this story\nOut as an attack from the fund campaign nor I Know that's where it came from I Know that's where it came from because I was I was warned that it was coming [noise] um but you know I Would like to talk about the issues and\nWhy don't you 'cause ... very often people say to me all the time George furlough goes after Alan ... all the time goes after him never goes after Gina Raimondo always goes after Alan takes take shots at him\nYou can't say I never went after June or a month or what I did the general Monday when the debate I probably went after her more than I went after Alan I didn't I didn't add up the time but I hit her with a lot of things the problem is Alan fungus that's a dirty bird\nThat he plays dirty politics in his dirty politics are trying to intimidate a twenty year old girl that wants to come and work for my on my campaign trying to hurt her with their political future that's the kind of crap that comes out of the phone campaign\nBut what about what I have about ... I have no choice but talked about things like he killed somebody in an accident he shot the body Ninety six feet and the fire is sealed open the final exit let's find out if you were on drugs let's find out what was going on he was\nNineteen years old and a grand jury for the grand jury said there was nothing that it in a diner um if there was ... he was then what do they charged\nHe was initially charged with killing homicide his family at a restaurant across the street from the police department so he was in with all the cops in France thing he went out in ... the mafia lawyer to defend them\nLet's let the facts come out okay open the file let's find out where you drug test and were you were you under the influence of al ... of alcohol you hit you knock the body Ninety six feet in the air\nThat's not easy to do he claims that he fell asleep you fell asleep you black dogs from alcohol ... let's see the details if this is the truth this is this is the kind of stuff\nThat Alan ... just wants to sweep under the rug and say or took responsibility for it the same way he took responsibility for the police departments running his police department like a crime syndicate and and that was not me saying that was colonel Donald ahead oh they were putting\nSomebody in the report that he had that they put the yeah yeah what\nIs the so you know I I'm sitting here thinking to myself I hear you drop that bomb today this has been discussed them kind of disposed with for a long time and in in a response to this you know perceived attack from the phone campaign and I'm thinking to myself gee are among those laughing her ear and off right now\nThis is probably is what are you saying that the people out there sitting there going Joe you're making it so we get for more\nYou hygiene and choose the direction that the campaign is going to go in Allen fungus choosing it by ...\nAll his minions the as calling into talk radio swimming me viciously on on social media every chance she gets\nGuys like Brian Newberry coming out in in in doing this other assault look when you put me in a street fight that's worrying I'm gonna come out slamming and that's what I Do well you might you might win the street\nFight with him but you know when the election well I'm I'm hoping he used to want to be governor right absolutely\nAbsolutely you know Matt I Am what I Am I'm a fighter\nFight I fought for the taxpayers for Eighteen years you want to hire a fighter they go in the state house and fight for the taxpayers I'm your guy you want to hire a pin Zee it's not going to change anything he's your guy\nSo don't compare the two of us because that's what I Do when I ... and nobody walks over me nobody so I'm not going to get pushed around by the unions I'm not going to get pushed around by anybody\nThey gonna run into a stone wall when they start to deal with me I'm not the one that's taken millions of dollars from\nThe lobbyists I Will stand up to any lobbyists and I don't know them a nickel when a lobbyist raises you fifty thousand dollars for your campaign he owns you he owns you and they're both bought and paid for by the lobbyists\nWhat do you uh you know it it does this poll comes out today gives you five percent of the vote\nFive percent they got a you know a a fungus behind double digits from Gina Raimondo\nYou see that Paul what do you send me the all these polls have you in single digits basic\nYou know initially I I I I've said that I didn't believe the polls I still don't believe the polls in the last few days we've said I've sent people out volunteers up\nRhode Island's number one for dealer is setting the standard again and again flood foreigners over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont flood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\n... question who would you vote for for governor Gina Raimondo Alan ... trailer Porter simple these polls they're all complicated they want you to give them your history before you answer the question [noise]\nAnd and what I'm seeing from the people on the street that we're going to use the Joe Joe is in this race very seriously pulling way above what what the polls are reflecting\nSo you know all I can tell you is that what I'm doing is not scientific but I'm going out there and taking it to the people and the people are saying that they're going to vote for me and believe it or not I'm I'm I'm leaving in that poll\nWell I mean the people got to take that for what it's worth\nI Can't imagine what it's worth but what I'm getting at is I Do it for myself if I thought I didn't stand a chance I wouldn't have been this far\nBut I'm In it and I said it from the beginning I'm In it to the end people think that you're going to just get out get out I've infested hundreds of thousands of dollars in spending your of your own money in this campaign right now\nI don't even know because I didn't add it up you know I went out and bought motor homes and I didn't run them through the campaign I bought vehicles I I've done a lot of stuff above and beyond the campaign\nEstimate how much do you think you spent\nOh I think when I'm done probably right now I've spent about four hundred thousand ... maybe with another two hundred thousand to spend so I don't know I'm just guessing\nYou have a limit [noise] um\nI I never put a limit on this at the beginning and I'm Still not putting a limit on it no\nYou don't have any idea what you say you know what I don't I'm not going to\nThis miles but I don't have the money to buy two TV spots in every\nHalf hour of TV I mean that's a ridiculous amount of money Gina Raimondo an Allan Fung habit um you know I Can't do those kinda buys but I I Am out there were TV ads\nUm I'm going to be up on this station in ... in another week I'm going to be up on other radio stations um so I I mean social media I'm doing as much as I can with with limited resources with hundreds of thousands of dollars\nWhat is going to be your answer ... election night Tom and Gina Raimondo wins and the exact ... monitor that she wins by the exact amount of money amount of votes you take and the Republicans who you of worked with and worked for and worked around for years look at you and say I can't believe you did this\nAs far as I'm concerned I don't know the ... Republican Party any explanation and I don't know anybody in explanation I got in this race because I hate the Republican Party and I think they're totally dysfunctional and they resent the fact that I that I dislike them\nAnd if you look at what's going on in Washington between the Republicans and the Democrats the both of them should be ashamed of themselves\nSo the other reason to get it I got it is because I could never support Allen fun I Know too much about his dirty Bertie activity the fact that he threatens people that don't support him that he goes after the jobs\nI mean there's just too many stories I've heard about Alan ... ... ... ... of turns me off I'm let alone the police reform bought and the fact that he killed a guy and he's got the files field\nIs this I've asked this question out loud it's just something personal that happened between\nYou analogy no not at all I don't dislike gallon personally at all I mean I just like when ... when he represents but I've never had even a personal argument with him\nIs there is this issue that people calling all the time of the deal between you and a reminder\nYeah what's the deal that's gonna make be spend this kind of money give me a break like I'm going to try to help Gina Raimondo a she's got a better shot at getting landed on the moon next week [laughter]\n\n[laughter] and be paying for it [laughter] well\nThe issue is there I mean whether or not there's a deal to be done I mean that said they look at\nThat is that just is you know what what is there a boat you ... I Can't support him I Would I support Raymond patriotic I Know I Know that's an exaggeration but you're asking me to support a guy didn't morally I think is very bad for the state I think he's corrupt\nAll right well you told the story you told us about unit Larry Earhart this doesn't seem to be anything there there's nothing else to do it by the way that day was there any drinking\nWhen you're together no no we never drank ...

out to get\nIt for zero one three three three eight thousand again for zero one three three three eight thousand I Want to start our shows by speaking in hypothetical here for a moment now let's say a doctor gives you a diagnosis and he recommends a treatment for\nA very complex medical condition now obviously\nThere's a lot riding on your condition being accurately identified and treated because after all this is your health your wellbeing is at stake right it's a good idea to go out and get a second opinion just to gain assurance that you're on the right path you've got the right diagnosis and and the right treatment plant\nAnd the numbers back this up Jeff there was a recent study by the Mayo Clinic or report as many as eighty eight percent of patients who come to the clinic to confirm a diagnosis or get that second opinion\nThey go home get with a new or refine diagnosis that changes their care it changes their care plan and potentially their lives only twelve percent received a confirmation that that original diagnosis they received was complete an absolutely correct that\nAny credible number to be a credible\nAnd it underscores the importance of this I could have been\nGot to get it you had your health is important and I think most people listening and say well that's a no brainer I of course I Would get a second opinion on may help\nJeff you talk about second opinions quite a bit on our show and you mentioned how important to getting that financial second opinion is and I want to talk to you about that in fact you brought with you a very simple seven item checklist and you're going to share this with me because\nSecond opinions correct me if I'm wrong they can really proved to be valuable not just medically but also when it comes to handling our finances leading up to and during retirement right\nAbsolutely you know in talking personally about medical issues of second opinions years ago I injured my hip not once but twice\nAnd the second time really just did me and I went to the doctors who I mean every place and I'm like no I'm way too young to to even consider a hip replacement so I just put it up put it off because another opinion\nStill felt it was too young so I got yet another opinion in the the the finally the doctor said look\nHis words is it look tough guy I watched you walk in here he said I Know how much pain urine he put my uh ex right on the white box or the light box and he said you are bone on bone he said you have no choice you need to replace and I went okay let's do it because by then I was in so much pain it was\nAwful are you glad you did it or you know the funny part he said to me to look after the surgery you're going to have one question I thought okay what's up he said why did I wait so long\nAnd he was absolutely right because of course right after the surgery you're on so much pain meds than your ... and that's a whole nother story we can talk about with law which is\nWhat their Chevy GMC hub to hub daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they're all in for free on condition I bought bought any religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred for your own cars all makes all models at incredible prices fall onto flood Otto John job now\nEra when you're making that determination how what's the third item on that checklist\nOf the third item on my list has to do with the lens through which a financial professional looks at their work\nWith retirement approaching you need to gain the shore and say your financial professional is looking at the entire retirement puzzle not just one piece of it\nI firmly believe that at least in most cases pre retirees and retirees too for that matter need someone with the knowledge and experience to understand how all the various pieces of your financial life it together\nAnd to actually put together a coordinated comprehensive financial strategy that incorporates all of those different puzzle pieces\nNow that's something not all financial professionals are qualified or prepared to do\nYou know some have a narrow focus maybe they're sweet spot is more insurance but they don't look at the investment side of things or maybe their focus on just investments but can't really offer much help with the insurance side of things\nYou want to avoid situations where you're getting advice about a certain aspect of retirement\nFrom a professional who maybe it's an experience in that aspect of retirement you also want to avoid situations where the advice or getting may not be on target because the financial professional who is providing that advice isn't seeing the entire picture I have a simple analogy for this\nYou know if you just do insurance based products or if you just do investments it's like hopping into a boxing ring with one arm tied behind your back and you can only swing with one hand\nWhile you're at a disadvantage so if you're working with somebody that is singularly license either insurance or just investments\nYou may not be getting somebody that's looking at your entire puzzle so it's important we are of course insurance license and we're a license for investments as well\nSo we can offer you what we feel are the best attributes from both sides so we do think it's important to keep money invested in the market but we also have a biased towards preserving some of your assets to avoid that next big\nPotential downturn in the stock market so that's how we look at if we feel as a result of our dual licensing\nWe can offer a better outcome to our clients\nGet I think when I hear you saying here is that a financial professional who is not inclined to look at the big picture they might be overlooking something in a really key area of our financial life\nNot just inclined but also perhaps not appropriate lived a license to look in those other areas so you have to look at that too so it is certainly possible there are all these different parts to preparing for retirement that need to come together into a coherent\nOrchestrated strategy so when I say big picture what I'm Talking about with can dig into the weeds a little bit\nYour current financial picture will that includes your income you know not just the amount of income but where's that coming from is it a inflation adjusted is a guaranteed or not\nYou know those types of things then we look at your expenses\nBut again what are expenses well you've got the necessary and then you have the fun stuff you know [laughter] that's that's more important in my opinion we we always want to handle the necessary but we also want to account for the fun expenses the travel the gifting the helping your kids are grandkids et cetera\nAnd then of course cash reserves your net worth your debt load\nAnd then from there what are your goals both near term and long term your protection needs do you have insurance where you should\nRecently met with somebody that had an enormous number of an investment properties yet they had no umbrella policy at all to help give them another level of coverage now that's for a couple of hundred dollars a year I mean it's very inexpensive to get that\nSo if you have rental property and you don't have an umbrella policy please talk to your insurance agent and talk to them about adding that to your plan\nA and then continue with insurance get health insurance get disability insurance your home your car et cetera et cetera long term care insurance and then there's investments and retirement versus financial independence you know this could be two levels one could squeak by and when you can feel very comfortable with with your plan\nAnd it's always important to look at the taxi fish and sea\nOf the assets that you're working with and then later on or depending on what your age is a when you start working with us we look at well preservation\nAnd wealth transfer in the most tax efficient manner possible when you're ready to transition what you've worked their whole lives for to

A. S. S. E. Y.\nI Want to continue with your check list that you recommend we should run through jak to help determine if we are indeed receding good financial advice for our transitioned retirement what's next\nWell this next one has to do with how the financial professional goes about their business\nYou should determine if their focus on and overall process\nNo strategy in addressing your individual needs or do they seem more intent on making product recommendations are giving advice before really understanding your goals and objectives note I recall a case a few years back where a large company was offering 'em\nAn early retirement package and this lady came in and she had worked with that from for like thirty plus years\nAnd she came in and we talked about as well look we need to go through a process and determine if you should take the lump sum offer or if you should take their pension and then we'll come back\nAnd we'll we'll give you the mouse will let you know if it would work or not I said but on the face of it I don't think it's going to be in your best interests to take the lump sum but we want to do the math look at it look at all the options will come back and report that to your next so she came back to the next appointment and she she said you know why I came back\nI said well I guess she wanted the outcome she said no because you told me right right up front you weren't sure if I should take a lump sum or take the pension that they were offering\nThe other person I met with before knowing anything about me told me that I said absolutely take the lump sum payment well who was who was that person looking out for the potential client or themselves themselves and it's unfortunate because in that case\nWith the lump sum offer we would've had to generate twelve percent per year to match the pension\nHow in God's name is anybody going to do that in today's world now that was like three years ago but still you know even products or even less effective three years ago to the interest rates were lower\nAnd that's the unfortunate part out there that there are too many people that will look at look at a situation and in his case he said oh take the lump sum\nWhy because then he gets to work with all that money but it was unfortunate and I'm grateful that she came in and then she referred her sister in and then they referred somebody else and because when you do the right thing for people you know where it gets around and we're grateful for that because we are produced shares and we take that to heart\n... I Wonder if you could offer as any red flag things we should be looking out for when we're finding financial professional to work with especially for retirement planning\nSure you know it's always important to follow your gut instinct you know if it doesn't feel right or you don't feel comfortable with the person if you feel like they're not explaining things in a method that you like or they might be using a lot of industry jargon and things like that if you are comfortable with it will you might not be a good fit\nAnd you need to have a good fit there because you're going to get married to a device or so to speak for potentially the next couple of decades they could be helping you out through your retirement years so you want you want to have somebody that you're comfortable with and that can explain complex issues in a simple matter know beyond that\nCredentials I Believe are very important for instance if you're looking for just just tax it buys\nYou know seek out a certified public accountants because they're at the top of the game now there are many other tax advisors\nBut they don't have the the training that a CPA does and they have proved their their expertise through testing as well they go through a ten hour exam and it's friday afternoon Saturday morning Saturday afternoon if it's a lot of work kind of like a certified financial planner professional\nWhen I was again my certification back in two thousand three\nIt was four hours friday afternoon three hours Saturday morning three hours Saturday afternoon and it was comprehensive after all the college level classes I had to take to get there it was a comprehensive exam so it's important to know what the credentials are\nSo if you're checking somebody out go to\nWhat their Chevy GMC ... Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for free on tradition I bought bought any religion or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all make all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto job now\nExactly does it mean to have transparency from your financial professional\nSo it's about our team you're amassing associates I being up front so you know exactly what we're recommending and how we're recommending it it's about us being transparent\nAnd leaving no mystery about how we're being compensated because we lay that all out for our listeners when they come in because it's important for you to know that\nAnd it's about us being ethical and having integrity in every aspect of our dealings with your listeners\nAnd it's also about being readily accessible to you know I Do have a lot of daily meetings so we have a team here so if I Can't get back to one of our team members might get back to you and we we try to get back with everybody in the same day\nI Will say we don't always get to do that because we are very busy but we are looking at trying to make sure that we return those calls as quickly as where you can with the right information that you're looking to hear back\nYet glad you mentioned what you did there I Want to just clarify a little bit more they'll how exactly in the financial professional someone like you how you compensated\nSo some professionals such as investment advisor representatives are compensated by clients sued the fees that they charge\nSo we are investment advisor represented so when we handle assets there is an advisory see that's charged what we hear from our from our listeners when they come in the middle of this is their amazed that we can bring so much to the table\nFor the level of fees that were charging\nSo that's I Love hearing that because we know that we are absolutely providing a huge amount of value\nMost advisors are going to charge you like one percent for investment consulting and that's it\nNo wealth management it's not just investment consulting but its advanced planning and this relationship management as well and it's the advanced planning where we feel we bring huge value to the table\nSo we look at wealth enhancement and what is that well that's helping you with income helping you with Social Security strategies helped me with tax mitigation issues\nA regular investment advisor isn't going to handle those mostly because they don't have the have the credentials or the background or they're from won't allow them to talk about those topics they only want them to sell investments\nSo we take it much further than that and then this will transfer and we help our listeners with the state plant now estate planning sounds like you need to have tons of money to do with state planning but it doesn't matter any assets that you have that you want to transition to somebody else\nThat's in the state plant it could be simple you might only have bank money well as long as you put beneficiaries designations at a bank which they call\nTable and death designations\nThen you have an estate planning because you've decided in advance who's going to receive that asset that's all it is so it doesn't have to be big and fancy now for those folks that come in they do have larger estates well we can get as complex as we need to be\nBut that's just the will transfer report now part of that is should you should you not have a trust and then Dr legal documents now London attorney but we work with attorneys\nAnd they tend to suggest financial powers of attorney healthcare powers of attorney living wills last will and testament set coordinate with the trust if you have any trust centered us they plan so that's just on the wealthy transfer report\nAnd then well protection I mentioned earlier in the program a simple thing like an umbrella policy that you should have on your on your home especially if you have rental property because of higher probability that you can get sued so that's a simple part\nAnd then there are so many other aspects of that and then lastly for about a third of our clients it's about charitable giving and we help people that are charitable reminded as well as to how they can leave some of their hard earned the assets to a charity that they really care about whether that's their alma mater\nOr I had a client that wanted to make a large donation to a hospital that helped his wife with her cancer treatments\nSo we have all these different things that we can do and their relationship management side just us you know us in the client it's working with attorneys if we need them working with risk managers if we need them\nWorking with attorneys if we need them we bring that all to the table for less than what most advisors charge just for investment consulting\nSo if that sounds like the level of effort that you would like expended on your behalf our number here at massing associates\nWhat their Chevy GMC ...
