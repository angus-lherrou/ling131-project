times people have a lot of stuff while we talk about the ... always talking about is discrimination this blanket if you're not with the program you're a big it that's the only logic that exist in America today you would think this way which is usually a construct built by radical left this\nOr you're a bigot and end the word bigot and racist and all that stuff has become a political tool not a tool of reality\nIt's become a tool for ah the media the national news media to create click bait you\nSee that with all these stories about people who are oh this guy or this woman accused a a young black boy of touching the rear end\nIt's got to be racism or she's just a jerk by the way I thought you supposed to believe all women what happened\nUh you you can get crazy with this stuff\nSo we we conned by the way the new one is this this jerk I mean this woman is insane the woman the story with this woman who is a wouldn't let the guy in a in this building\nYou see the video this\nYou know the media is trying to make this a race thing to the woman's a white woman she's blocking this black man from getting into his building but she's like you know to prove that you live here why you hear and follows him up to his apartment I mean this woman is lucky that this guy didn't deck her one because she was being obnoxious\nAnd blocking his ... his Ford progression getting in his face and ah she called police all this stuff they're trying to make it a racial issue the woman was married to a black man formerly\nThe guy is is like a lawyer or something like that did a video you deserve vowing are saying we haven't been married for a year a and there's was married to a person of color but I mean how much of a racist can she be some people are just jerks\n\nAnd that's just the way of

have a camera and everybody's hand that the first thing they do is pull it out and record it so it seems like it's more prevalent than it did it than it is now the vast of the fact of the matter is ah the amount of people that do this kind of thing every day to each other\nProbably as big a percentage as Elizabeth Warren's native heritage\nWhich is non existent\nAct\nNon existent basically see that's the thing about this whole thing it's not that I mean this is what makes me laugh and they get people all over the goalposts now you know there's no goalpost moving the fact I've been talking about limits Warren ... Elizabeth Warren's or a fake\nUh Indian heritage says way before Donald Trump was elected I was on at night when I was talking about this stuff six and I don't know it's the talk shows all the time\nBy the way Elizabeth Warren is also the author or the originator of the ridiculous you didn't build that nonsense remember at the ... we had that clipping their somewhere\nWhere she's talking to a bunch of supporters of Massachusetts you didn't build that most ridiculous philosophy and logic on the planet\nTalking about why the white people have a certain percentage of their income that's due to the community because they didn't build all your schools and roads and all this stuff it's incredible\nAbsolutely incredible so remember borrow bronco\nBomb if you didn't build that you didn't do that you stole from ... yeah you\nStole from Elizabeth Warren and so she did that years ago I think it's twenty of Lebanon that that happened that she made that commentary on the campaign trail and so she's\nObviously I mean this is this is all about her DNA like our DNA so what I mean don't get you into a DNA test I think I'm gonna do it if it goes into a database I'm clone for nefarious purposes I don't have to tell you\nI'm or ... whatever I'm going to do the DNA test and I'm going to see what sort of ancestors I have I've been told\nSupposedly\nCertain things about uh about uh you know the lineage and whatnot I don't know if they're true\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason prices in cars with zero percent NPR for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nWrite if we're all going to play a game of stupidity where where reality isn't reality and that the person's individual experience doesn't count next to the experience of whatever group that they might happen to have happened to belong to that I'll play that stupid game\nIf it if I can get in there\nIf I can find some stupid way to get ... I mean can you mean we don't we're not going to sit here and look at reality\n... blonde hair blue eyed white woman and if you buy into identity politics and that blonde hair blue eyed white people have an easier than everybody else on the planet than her individual experiences in her life don't count whatever accounts as whatever sort of of of\n... story you can ... up or create based on on all the other people that did that look like her and then she stuck with it it's called being hoisted on your own part\nAnd that's why people are get offended about this kind of thing it's rampant in our politics\nWe take the individual take their complete and total life experience no matter how\nTough a noble a evil\nI'm I'm just all the extremes right no matter how strong week I'm a smart stupid\nOr good choices bad choices you had your individual experience does it matter ... in our politics today modern politics in America and especially on college campuses you wrote all that stuff out the window because the individual doesn't matter it's whatever group they belong to\nAnd that means that inherently they are either more and more all their morally superior they're ethically righteous because uh they they occupy a certain group\nVersus another their ideas are more valuable their thought process sees and their information that they they provide is more or less valuable all based on the on the group that they that they that they occupy gee I thought I thought the whole civil rights movement and all this stuff was all about getting all getting away from that\nSo is it about equality and justice oh isn't just about reversing the tides\nI thought it was about equality and justice\n\nSo you'd ask yourself about these people there's a whiz with Warren really want equality or does she just wanted to reverse the tide against whatever group she thinks that she's fighting against that day\n\nI'd say it's the uh I'd say it's a ladder because you don't make up\nA a false

firefighters situation or Russell without trying to\nGet into too into the weeds about the numbers and the numbers are important because they explain the the the ... the the issue and and what not but I don't want people to like drive off the road so let me\nLet me just give you the typical contract language which is very easy to understand so historically this is what the contract says\n... pertaining to payment on you sick leave after you accumulate that maximum bank ... what it basically says is a in any case where an employee is accumulating his or her maximum sickly entitlement under section one now is what's really important language listening closely he or she shall\nAt the end of each year\nBe entitled to be paid one half of his or her unused yelling sick leave entitlement not to exceed ten days such payment is to be made based on their second point they they are the daily rate of pay and shall be paid to the employee by the thirtieth day of march each year may\nThe only thing that's changes percentages they increased it but\nHe is the is the verbiage that's important\nHe or she shall at the end of each yet be entitled to be paid that percentage of is on it you really sick leave entitlement\nHistorical contract language this is what they did in two thousand twelve they changed it to say he or she shout at the end of each year be entitled to be paid for one half of his or on your yearly sick leave entitlement\nProrated on a monthly basis and Shelby paid to the employee by the last day of them are so which is it your ... your he or she shall be paid at the end of the air or shall be paid at the end of the ... right right so what it does is it takes\nAn annual benefits and it stops to monetize that monthly but no scenario can you be paid more than Fifteen days right well\nIf you take five days sick time you can only be paid eleven point two five days but they're still paying everybody the maximum\nThey using to go after the ... choosing to do it on a monthly basis which gives everybody the ability to do ...\nSo that's the other thing I wanted to ask you about or if you're doing it in your what are they taking all the time the last month what are they doing\n[noise] oh yeah you got guys for example the fire chief he took twenty four sick days right last year he took twenty four sick days but he was still paid a bonus for not taking sick days right so he took twice\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nTwo thousand nine hundred and sixty six dollars and eighty six that's so this is a stark example where the contracts says you can be paid Seventy five percent for your own used well he had zero on used but he was still pay right\nBecause he he your months where he was he did have one used\nRight so he actually because it says he or she shout at the end of the year it'd be paid not to exceed Seventy five percent he was paid a hundred and Thirteen point seven five percent\nSo simple math\nSo let me ask you this question so this seems to me that that this is the gym but use language in the contract Cajun because when he was in the contract you say you your president in ... contract law says you supposed to go to the original intent was when it's when it's conflicting\nUh they didn't do that they went with this other way so at the end of the day when it's when the article says the spokesperson for the money for his union says that there was a sign an agreement with the previous administration was married but ... what is he talking about what the side of humans just to go and do to find a month\nSo so evidently you what you have to understand we have a city solicitor who oversees the contract negotiations Peter Gerald\nRight Peter and hero\nOversold these contract negotiations he's supposed to be an attorney and and you have a contract that has such loose language in it that they manipulated it so what the union president has said well we had a side deal with the mayor in other words you get them the mayor said that we could monetize a hundred percent of it\nWe had a verbal the city charter specifically prohibits any type of verbal contract\nAnd under section to dash Eighteen it specifically says that any contract negotiations any benefits that are given out in the contract must be ratified by the city council and all those contracts have to go before a public hearing so the contracts says one thing right mhm but\nScott avid Asians said yeah but you know what guys I'm going to turn my back on it and you guys can manipulate it to get what we call the for compensation maybe you're going to get this benefit no one's ever going to find out about it so it leads me begs the question\nDid the finance director know about it well if he didn't\nThen he's pretty dumb 'cause you couldn't see\nWhat's the constant hearing my I'm looking at this stuff is sign agreements hoses legal I mean how do you know it's not it's not rounded when\nYou get when you get people that represent the taxpayers coffers the municipal dollars that is being taken from the taxpayer\nAnd you enter into aside agreement where you have your attorney the mayor the fire chief the fire union president you know the city finance director the chief of staff and you say OK guys you're going to do all this stuff that's okay we're going to present it in the contract as this way with this language\nBut we're going to allow you have this ambiguous language so you can actually get more than what the contract actually isn't tending to benefit from\nRight that's called conspiracy\nWhat's called fast I mean it seems to be that\nIt's fraud it's conspiracy and they need to have an investigation and these people need to be brought in on the road and Scott ... needs to be sworn in on the road and he needs to answer for this because this is hundreds of thousands of dollars\nFor well here's my question what's the ... in the winter I don't know no no no you know what's the who the investigative body the attorney general either on sleep well they come and look at this kind of thing or I mean I Know there's an on going on right now right the the friends are gone and having to do with\nThis well no this is not a forensic or there's an audit going on about this particular issue\nOkay the city councils on it right\nYou have to remember that for the state police to get involved they have to be requested to get involved by the mayor of by the ... and now thankfully\nCouncilman Solomon has seen is after Ken and I made our\nNumber may or may and he's now now the acting mayor interim mayor after\nWe may not presentation may asylum and looked at this and he immediately stopped this ah this behavior of how they wouldn't ... manipulating the contract\nWhich they've now well you'd say no complained about the union is as far as the grievance filing agreement\nSo it because why not if you if you've been allowed to steal for six years why should anybody stop\nYou well if we might not committed knowledge of contract languages or labor law would be like when past\nPractices you know if you start to um you start to do something in practice even though it's not in the contract the union can then say well you always done it this way so now it's part of the deal\nRight but the union cannot circumvent the city charter and the\nOwner right right but I'm just saying they're going through their processes because they say hey we asked for they gave us was when you want from me\nRight and so but the the the point being\nWhat all do group lunch your car any make any model blood pays more than any dealer around because we're a sort of by buying center and we'll buy yours even if you do by hours logged onto our
