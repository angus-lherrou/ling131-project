I tell you about um [noise]\nSome of the people I follow online these days they call them they've they've been loosely form into a group called the intellectual dark Web as a bunch of people out there and they're they're they're I think in general they're commentaries that you know this is really a cultural ... you know the change that happens in our country needs to be cultural\nNeeds to be socially needs to be psychological um it's not\nPolitical because the politics of the results\nOf the moral of the ethical the psychological the sociological the social or whatever\nAnd so ultimately when you change yourself the rest of the world's follows right you'll be the source you're the source and I thoroughly believe that and anybody who thinks that you know some um that some politician someplace can change the moral fabric of the country\nUm is really overstating\nIn my opinion the power that any politician has usually that person if they happen to be the focal point of the change of some kind of morality is usually the result of the change that already happened it's just the first time I've actually talked about it you know what I'm saying like it's the symptom that shows up\n\nSo that's what ended up happening ... there's no way ... so the absurdity of the rhetoric that goes on in our politics today it's one of the main reasons why we have some we have delineated ourselves into little camps the tribalism\nUm I'll give me an example of it there is this I was reading the Providence Journal over the weekend now in Roseburg was the executive publisher whatever's the title is um\nTalked about this Sunday column talked about his\nIs a form he's going to take part in ... D.C and some other political people it was under the headline can't we all just get along and it was all about it's all about I guess they're having some form of this forum someplace in the public occurrences thing at the Providence Journal does to talk about political polarization they've got some some political experts they get some people that are going to come on\nThey're going to talk about the political polarization\nAnd then there's a there's some Twitter nonsense going on how could you have this a vet was out with all white people on this on this panel with\nThat kind of a headline granted we know can we all just get along came from Rodney King\nLooking for a car credit not played well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if you are for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto Josh how\nCan we just all get along\nAnd so to use that as a way as a\nKind of a a you know whatever I guess they're all ... I don't know if everybody in the world decided to to not know what the what the actual form was about to think it was about race it's about political polarization as if because there isn't somebody of color that didn't happen to be included there that automatically the ... the the forum is worthless\nBut there's nothing a value to\nBecause you have to you know it ... your ... any pain or you have already form you have has to look like a box of crayons\nOtherwise forget it it's worthless I mean it's it's unbelievably stupid\nBecause what does it do it stops judging people for who they are and what they're about and starts judging people for basically what they look like\nUm\nWhich is you know fundamentally the wrong way to go\nBut I guess we can to try this again\nI just got a dopey email from somebody named Jerome or Jeremiah excuse me John my sense is since this email to me\n\nTime's up for white male ... AK the base and there was or in the words of the board you will be absorbed it's assimilated you will be assimilated does the word not absorbed you'll be assimilated\nTime's up for white male ...\nYeah 'cause nothing's ever gone wrong by judging people by the color of their skin or their gender\nAnd putting them in a box and excluding them from ... from the society nothing's ever gone wrong that way\n[laughter] they don't even hear themselves and this is the kind of nonsense and went on for eight years under Brock Obama\nRight that kind of crap that kind of talk that alienated a bunch of people that made it seem like oh yeah nobody gives a damn what we're doing here I'm working hard nobody cares they don't have a job nobody cares against what all the corporations get taken care of\nBig wings were bailed out banks were bailed out they got as a matter of fact the big banks got bigger and all this stuff that gets what they passed what\nPassed a a against the wishes of most of the people they pass the A. C.

judge was a quote frequent drinker and a heavy drinker\nAnd he thought that was his quote civic duty to tell people about this experience drinking with Kevin\nI'm reading from story here from the News Observer you know what I see a redo the exact quote I knew Brett ... at Yale because I was a classmate and a varsity basketball player and Britain joy socialize with athletes indeed athletes from the core Brett social circle\nUm but he was deeply troubled by what has been a blatant mischaracterization by Britain himself was drinking at Yale what's the Fox news interview the testimony Judiciary Committee legion set I cringed for the fact is it yeah I can speak to you know other times Brett was a frequent drinker at a heavy drinker\nI Know because especially in our first two years of college I often drank with him on many occasions I heard Brett slurs words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption not all of which was beer\nWhen ... what is your thing with beer and other drinks excuse he drinks we drink a lot of beer mostly been beers exposed to be better than than as hard alcohol or something I always wondered about that so if I was thirty five beers not as bad if I took you know five shots well it's a\nIt's a different kind of drugs over the George Carlin the or the George Carlin bit about that I don't believe it's a different kind of ... well you know he's a comedian people I mean people who drink while those of you know there was a ... a kernel of truth in those people drink beer tend to to do to be more ... militaristic march but people who drink wine don't wind it was on march\nPaul's and Cranston\nHi Matt I'm good thank you\nUm you know I saw down\nObjectivity but not all the sides on object if you're a Republican you can't say\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nIt's like look at the issue objectively and say okay is it right or wrong and we don't do that anymore we don't do\nWell he can be cars because that because that posturing now determines what's right or wrong right yeah ... we don't have a shared view of what's right or wrong we have a partisan view of what's right or wrong and what right or wrong ultimately is determined by whatever ... whatever pushes our ideological point of view that's right and wrong I still see\nWhen we look at different issues over history over time she only had nine eleven mhm okay that was a time when the country came together\nAnd said let's look at what issue is here okay when they look at okay let's try to make this country more safer in terms of like security security all over the Democrats or Republicans look at\nThe issue it wasn't a democratic issue or a Republican issue it was\nA security issue a state where you don't do that anymore we look at say out is if I'm a Democrat I get a vote against this guy I'm a Republican I get a warrant saying does this guy has to be on this or\nWhat what ends up happening is you you look at the smaller you know the guy that this guy as a win over the whole right so\nIt it it it starts to become when you start to have these tribal wars that go on in politics ... individually said individual situation start to become symbolic of other things and so you start to swallow a whole bunch of crap in order to get a symbolic victory and you know you add up all these symbolic victories in like middle stones around your neck next thing you know your drowning\nUm because you don't care as long as you when Paul thanks for the call it's a scorched earth\nUm and that's what we're seeing here this is the Supreme Court nomination process is going to be more and more scorched earth because it's not going to be about whether or not you have a decent judicial philosophy it's about winning over the other side\n[noise] and then when you do something to win and beat the other side that's that's like a you know from not taking the guy's a nomination Sears and not even taking it up or giving giving it a hearing\nTo to know what to to to to waiting to leaking a letter of allegations of sexual impropriety a week before the before the actual votes that takes place that's what we're doing now is what we're doing and\nYou know I and and then when you start taking everything that somebody does is symbolic of a greater injustice [laughter] you won't be able to eat cheerios man you understand for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred

P. R. O. [noise]\nAllen's show news talk Ninety nine seven of him and I am six thirty WPRI\nI think it's fine if they do I don't know that's up to them uh\nI think that he spoke very conclusively and very well I think it's been a very rough period of time I guarantee you never had a period of time like this [noise]\nThat's the president at me and ask questions about this investigation a quick question charges as much as the White House's involving itself from the investigation of us in the White House or to the beach I remembered Jeff Flake seeing limited\nIn scope and limited in time\nNow what does that mean it's just you know\nI I don't see this and I don't I don't see anything getting more clear view with this\nAnd and the things that the the the the things that have become normal that people are just accepting out of this whole situation like if you make one decision you know we had these these activists that corner Jeff Flake in the in the elevator what yelling at him and whatever that help them and we had some kind of impact on his mind that day um\nYou know they were evidently survivors of sexual assault\nAnd so you know do you know what you're saying to women in this country do you know what you're saying the da da da da da da da da da du ... things\nAnd there are people who can't wait to ascribe all sorts of types of motives in in in meaning to those actions based on the ... the acute issue at hand versus the larger issue at hand I don't know how any of us are going to be able to act ever\nBecause when everything you do is symbolic of something bigger or more more uh you know more patriarchal or more bigoted or whatever it is like oh you're wearing Nike\nThat means you must hate the country because they're they're Colin Kaepernick is that that\nI these issues man I just like your shoes I just looked issues you know what I mean\nOh you're eating chick fillet you must hate gay people\nNo I just like chicken chick fillet\nTo get all that this is what goes on in this country so that everything you do end up becoming some kind of political statement whether you want to make one or not I used to live like this raise and we feel right here in WPRI re\nBut to a certain extent it's a dangerous path to walk down because of everything you do dealing with an acute issue is symbolic of an overarching\nUm it it becomes I should say symbolic of an overarching take on all things or to a certain level it's that's true but you can't take that like in other words if you're dealing with a specific set of circumstances in a specific case in this specific case specifically um\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common there are all in for Steve for your own condition and what for Denise religion there were against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John John now\nThat's an individual I'm Talking about you don't support\nOr this specific initiative you hate all immigrants\nMuch\nHappens all the time in our politics is dangerous\nBecause then you'd see everything you do become symbolic of something else and therefore you just never move you know move you can never make\nSharon's in grants and sharing your WPRI Sharon\nSharon ... Hi Hi Sharon I'm making a list here okay and so far I'm up to about thirty boys who molested me\nThirty yeah about thirty between twenty five and thirty now\nI I'm I'm kind of kidding and yet I'm not why don't you read about something like that guy but listen so\nSixteen Seventeen Eighteen and maybe Nineteen I was one of those what they call good girl so I'd go out with a boy and he get make cast and then next thing you know his hands where like kinda creeping along the side yeah\nAnd um and of course I I'd stop that right than that there but he made the attachment so I mean you know what I guess my point is can you imagine the amount of men or that are now men that were boy that\nEvery all in fact when they did try you said wow why didn't they try you know an ... and are they not\nWell you know that's why you know it's interesting because that's that is like the um it's one of the ... of the modern day right so what's happening now is you have literally people they're asking\nAnd you can think this is a good thing or is a bad thing what's happening is there's you know consensual\nYou know grow it when they call it they call it um [noise] something consent um\nI think it's actual escalating consent escalate so you know can I escalated I write you mind if I guess you [laughter] yes go ahead okay yeah mind if I put my hand on your back yes go ahead you might have now I Am by stroke you back you mind if I put my hand on your shoulder yes go ahead and they have this whole this is what people are doing now because they want to make sure that there's\nYou know there's consent going out for you to the entire process because you're right because the way that I was raised in the way that we did things back in the old days would you try to see if you can get away with it and if you if you were led to do but at that point you already tried it and if it was unwelcome then under the new standard of today's relationships that was\nConsensual touch well I had a son and\nI'm consensual touches but I you know it's your choice you nip it in the party you don't but beyond that I Am making the joke of it because like I said all\nThe boys back then always tried and it was up to you to make a determination right um but what I'm thinking is that um I mean I have really no loss in this race I really don't because uh but what I'm thinking is that maybe a policy that they should come up with\nThat they had\nAsked me what who's seeking me kind of political seat do of thirty five year FBI check\nOkay you know across the board and then let's see how far this keeps continues on because there's no one is going to come up clean and in fact it might come up so bad that people will be out of their minds when they hear I mean I I at Seventeen I put my sister on the hood of my car\nAnd drove down the street was heading out to the windshield wipers\nWhat was I thinking I was sixteen that was the problem\nYou know you weren't thinking you know literally a six year old brain is not formed [laughter] let's\nGet an a policy that says everybody gets a thirty five forty yeah FBI check and let's see how you come up and how are people who are sitting right now\nWell that's you know that's another part of this we have never spoken about thank you for the call it it's it's you know if\nWe have spoken about a little bit here and there are these are these actual events a disqualifying you know the ones that took place if they are something that took place when you're Seventeen years old I don't know you know who's gonna who's going to be honest and that in that consideration John's\nWhen socket John you're WPRI John\n... thank you well you know the bottom line\nGrab it or\nConservative\nOr the most\nBecause a court order one she ordered put your show in the ... or ... or ...\nI mean as one of those things I think you are my judicial philosophy is similar to yours and the way that I think that you know we have a process by which things change very slowly and if you\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they're all in for Steve we own condition and blood for Denise religion they're against it that's right over two hundred and three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John John now\nSeeing is that this is a whole oh there's this whole other ball of wax where we just have this this eighty a logical back and forth ping pong when it comes to the Supreme Court um\nYou know it's just it's over are in in in when everybody looks at it as basically the the final line of\nOf a fight when it comes to winning the hearts and minds are for forget you even have to win hearts and minds in America you just gotta when the Supreme Court and you can get whatever garbage you want the throne through whether you want it or not because as long as you get a majority in the house and the Senate and then you get the Supreme Court on your side\nIt doesn't really matter you can push the envelope all over the place\nIt's a lot easier than getting the the populist together and letting them in ... in changing things and convince them that they need to be changed John ... and John you're on WBFO\nWell as far as the sexual part of this conversation let's just move on from that and automatically assume that jump from crafted is a ... to ... if you're a hole in it for what it is\nA member of fraud but go ahead yeah yeah because everybody was everybody was on the edge of their seats wondering about your sex life what I said everybody was on the edge of their seats wondering about John from Princeton sex life\nIt doesn't happen too often but every once in a while most of the broadcast goes Baptist puritanical on it can you please explain to me your thought process on drinking again because I didn't quite understand how many what what\nSaid it depends on your perspective as to what you think a lot of drinks is I think if somebody has a I think if you're drinking age in alcoholic beverage every single day during the week that's a lot of drinking\n[laughter]\nAnd I said some people do that all the time it's no big deal so I'm just saying I look at things differently than most people so somebody saying the judge Kavanaugh was bulldozed drunk all the time depends on your perspective what all the time is what drunk is\nNow\nConsidering all the PS he's going through is probably not getting drunk enough\n[laughter] anyways well how many drinks did John from ... I'm having a new kind of side hey hey hey hey hey hey what how many drinks is John from Cranston partake in per day\nUh it depends on what I mean but if I'm having like a pasta dish with people definitely wine yeah a glass of wine or two and then maybe a couple of beers probably on the average every day\nPretty much here so every day you're having at least five alcoholic beverages\nCouple of beers and a glass of wine a vice versa yeah sure\nThat's a lot of booze man holy moly so\nYeah you know trying to think what's the last thing like it that was totally out of control I was asked by you'd have to go back to let the night in Ninety I\nWas at King Richard Baron during the jousting event I tried to\nAttack or one of the horses [laughter] [noise]\nAnd then as they carry me out I said a free Northern Ireland Bobby ... and that it all go to jail\nAnd that was the end of that they banned me for life\nI Would just tell you not only we would you be banned from King Richard fair you would never get appointed to the Supreme Court [laughter] just\nMake you a which I was there though Joe's encouraged the choice of WNPR oh the horse sort of one by the way John anyway Joe what's going on\n... and they are not you mentioned Nike a few minutes ago odd that they they they basically won the battle ... a Nike calling ... ... ... people of color they they took the national anthem away from us they don't play it no more Nike sales are\nWay way way but you know they don't play anymore what are you talking about they don't get there is no more nationally\nAnd ordering football game you know they don't ... I think I think they stopped airing them\nWell that's what I think that that that that's it so they they basically won the battle [noise] okay I mean I don't know yeah I mean I ...\nAnd ... seizing everything managed is killing me I'm so sick of hearing about it [noise] my early ... I mean everything you do is politicized with everything you do is symbolic of some kind of either open mindedness are closed minded in his patriotism or anti patriotism sometimes shoes or just shoes\nSometimes you cereals just your cereal\n[noise] but but cook in a way the national anthem from from sporting event you know for the TV audience I mean how much further we're going to bend over backwards for a bunch of bologna you're not", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Matt Allen Show", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "01"}
