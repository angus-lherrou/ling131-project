[noise] you know they're going to the war reality\nUm to fit their needs\nBut this is one thing in my mind that we have to remain confident in and and and really\nIt's too it's for the it's not for

terms of you know try not to say anything stupid because she's got the supposedly just must they must really should get the lead but they're still very aggressive\nIn their uh their campaigning on line and whatnot and I'm just sitting here we got just pulling dean is coming out I think I'm a dance or Dan York is going to have Joe Fleming on this afternoon at some point I think five o'clock when they are rather new the new poll comes from channel twelve and Roger Williams\nI'm and I'm always fascinated by people who don't know where they are yet what they're doing it\nUm so if you don't know where you are and what you do and yet tell me why that's number one weekend a day left to go\nIf there's something that you are trying to figure out you can listen to your thought process what if you're locked in and you're ready to go to know why do you may have to do this again on Monday next Monday before the day before the do we have the day before I'm that way you can figure out if anybody ... change their mind\nMuch in riverside Mike you're on WPRI might\nBe a good ... good afternoon how are you I'm good thank you and then on the brain because you're talking about over though yeah\nI'm not sure you'll hear about him during his show at five o'clock to me\nSo I'm going to go on 'em because the who what about that with a messed up I mean we all know what they are just going on mhm\nI'm watching in a while and then that's when um she doesn't really I Believe in my own store a ... ... ... ... ... ... she's looking you know the gender\nBut on a on a normal guy called up to people from voting\n[laughter] Hi\nCrow Corey okay man there that are about ... ... ... do you want to talk about it and no one wants to do it\nWell here's the thing well hold on to say how do you spell rumors of something that that that may or may not have happened right so what happens is you you can assume this and people have assumed it Joe is said that's not the case it's unbelievable that in\nThe rye right when I was thrown out of one of our question today right yup Sunday yeah\nI go by war started they mhm why why it out on a beautiful Sunday driving that are around while\nHe was probably ... he's got two of them and he was probably out campaigning that RV if you're sitting where where'd you drive where did you see it\nWhere we quoted\nOn who die while I don't know man and it can be a bunch of different reasons why it was there I don't know if it was in a high traffic area I mean I wouldn't go by that I mean I can understand why people I can understand why people are frustrated with ah\nWhy why they point to the joke true I mean that that quote in the journal a couple of weekends ago was it was devastating for him he had agreed to walk that back when on the weekend he tells the Providence Journal that he hopes he just takes two percent from Alan ... a you know when you basically are verbally admit to what people most people were criticizing you for doing to begin with\nIt's hard to walk back from that\nSource culturally burn right because they are and who can outgrow emotional gr go well okay\n'em and Joe is going to be on the day and at five o'clock this afternoon to talk about what the latest results are the kind of read read did or re re pulled to see if anything's moved\nUm it'll be fascinating to see what the results are but also whether or not these are does any of the ... the undecided number has dropped at all or will be funny if more people become undecided [laughter]\nIt was about ten percent last time there actually now twenty percent I'm with the way the politics are in this country now that I'd be shocked I Can't figure out where I'm going to go but I've heard from some people and I don't know that this was would this anecdotal sort of take it for what it's worth\nSome people like you know what I'm just not going to vote in the governor's race I'm done I've had it I got nobody that I really support nobody that I think can win or whatever the reasons are and so there's not going to vote on it they're gonna leave a blank\nI've heard for probably about [noise]\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nYou know there's a week left a lot can happen in a week a lot probably will happen in a week you know the governor is going to go underground try to stay away from any hot stove loses as as many ... as possible she won't touch anything but you know there may be something that she has to touch and then what do you do then you voted already\nYou know what I mean\nWhat does a corruption scandal that pops up in the next week you're already voted\nTo bad too late\nSo you can't decide who wins the debate in the middle of the debate you gotta wait till it's done it'd be like last\nNight watching the red Sox game oh eighth ending all said that's it all over done way on a second now now know donate it\n\nHalfway throw up their ... to at all do set all finished you got to finish the thing out and then that's the way you put the say look this is the is the end no arguments to be made we all that said we've said all we've got to say\nAnd that's it\nBut the early voting thing is is like drives me crazy I Love the ... it's just like this it's this uh the virtue signaling is though is what I like the perfect word for it\nTo go out there and make it easy for everybody to go ahead and vote\nWho's who's got the worst time voting people who are like physically unable to get to the polls they probably have the hardest time you know people don't have a\nRide your elderly people can try that can't get to the polls but even then they get the you know they go out there they scare the seniors up they read they rent the vehicle to keep people get rides and it's just all kinds of things you can do\nWasn't finding these polling places nearly impossible unless you're in the bubble of knowing what's going on\nNow finding them what do you mean\nLike for people that I don't follow the political circle that you know\nLet's so point it was just so out of the loop that you can't find your polling place yeah a lot of votes\nGet out what are they putting in the top of a building\nWe dug a hole and put the polling place underneath a whole\nGood luck finding it walk around a circle to a trap door falls down there you go into your polling place\nIn public buildings this fire stations you got to know where they are allowed to tell\nYa good God [laughter]\nDrives me nuts oh hard is it you go in there are people there to help you out there to give you a ballot as people stuff you go in and you mark down when you want to win that's all\nOr you know you can get these weird\nQuestion some day of course sometimes they have questions that um there's one in Massachusetts that has to do with transgendered things and bathrooms that I got to figure it out I I I got to be able to do it on the air out of the budget kinda figured this out where if you vote for it then you get rid of something\nSo voting for something means you're actually\nAgainst that type of thing you know what I'm saying like you're against the thing that they're trying to achieve so your vote to repeal the ... it's ... you know get one of those things it's confusing where if you don't want something you have to vote yes\nBecause the way the question is worded those are always fun\nYou get those then you get the ballot questions by the way which we you know we have to spend time on this week because about questions which most people just say yes to because it's like\nYou know it's it's they're going to borrow money to spend money on things the quality of stuff around here is always been so traditionally traditionally it's been like highway stuff and the the quality of the highways have been so poor that anytime there's infrastructure spending people like yep yep I don't care if it's going to cost a lot on doesn't matter\nDoesn't matter so that's where we're going to be I Would imagine what the school bond\nYou know with the construction bond to borrow how you know what it was a two hundred and fifty the first was the first month two hundred fifty million dollars to fix schools up there so badly but yet the problem is to put that on the credit card you got to get that done it with the ... it was was what's a treasure said we have the the the capability to bonded out its yet yeah the capacities All right\nNo problem most people just vote for that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Matt Allen Show", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "29"}
