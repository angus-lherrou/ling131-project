just is an\nInnocent people out there who are motivated by every day by a career by goals by you know surviving and whatnot you better come up with a whole different motivation and if you think satisfying physical urges is going to work it'll work for a little while\nThen what if you assume you survived those drinking drugs party and relaxing chilling out or at least a year or two of that then what\nNo I don't care offering or an outline well you know based on a past experiences seems with what people do they figure\nOut how to lose it all it's amazing how many people that win the lottery and bankrupt and then which is worse\nWorking the rest of your life and figuring out your stuff and getting stuck together and being able to put your own stamp on on your own life\nWinning the lottery and living living in comfort in management involve possibly ... isolation are holding onto your money and dying you know pretty wealthy and do what you got to do with it\nFor winning the lottery and then losing it all\nYour H shades of production change your WPRI washing\nAim at first off I'm going to call it the mat Alan ... and have that\nOh thanks and get them on the Internet and have fun I forgot that I Know but all the it's\nFunny all these people they're all that are calling thing I'll throw a party or only get my ... yeah you're all creating active all of that that's how people go broke is they think they're doing good things by giving people money but they don't realize you can't just give people money doesn't work like that the IRS\nSo you know what is it what is the limits of ten grand a year it might mean thousands like Thirteen South Africa yeah so\nYou break the Thirteen thousand dollar mark and knocked the recipient but the ever get ... so these people are gonna get crushed it it's interesting if you look at like what rich people do especially when you go back in history look at Vanderbilt guy at a hundred billion dollars Cornell you\nGave Ninety million of its a one kid\nThat son William turn the Ninety into two hundred million which today is like over five billion and he realized your point I agree with you hundred percent a lot of money like this not cool for anybody to have this much money\nSo he set up so many trust that ended that's why the Vanderbilt family like there was causing the nephews and you name it like it was humongous\nSo the key thing is if you set up trust that like let's say if you look at like you know I'm not giving you the money because you're just gonna come back after you blow it and want more money\nSo you set up a trust and say okay you can have the income every year generated by the trust mhm so it's almost like you're just giving somebody a head start right what you're saying okay like let's say the trust generate just around number a hundred grand a year you're getting a hundred\nBy the way forget my siblings I didn't know why would I Would ruin it you know what I mean I don't know why no that's the thing is you\nUsed to be right away I think spiritual rent for family you start a Van Allen\nYou know after ... profit fun dog is going to spend a lot of your money so I mean you're kind of all worked out ... but you can I mean if it's possible to do it because people have done it in the past but you can't you can't just be thrown like everyone's like oh I'll do now you can't do that doesn't work that that way\nIt's possible but it's right you know it's gonna end up happening though read what was the last big one what if people went\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they're all in for Steve free own condition and blood for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred and three on cars all ... all models and incredible prices flood onto flood Otto John jobs now\nWorthless to buy a ticket when it's only a hundred million dollars I Know it sounds terrible it will take\nIt all I mean technically it's technically if you're going to play the odds if you actually are are are you looking at odds here it's worthless to buy a ticket ever\nRight 'cause you'll never you know supposedly I mean two hundred was wanting to give a better chance of getting struck by lightning so more often than not you're not going to ever win it's fun to think about it though that is why I Love what if we do like we talked about instant tickets for the lottery and stuff like that that's the good stuff I mean I've known people who've won a couple of thousand dollars in scratch tickets\nI Know about one thirty grand and ... you know what I mean that's that's and that's a nice little thing\nWhat would be your daily driver car that's a good question that's a fun quite\nI wouldn't have a driver I wouldn't I Would have to drive me I could give to fly and you know what's about cars I don't care I don't want to drive and I want to be in traffic\nI Would go into the woods is what I Would do it I have a compound in the woods accessible only by helicopter and that's what I Would do a driver on ATVs and things like that for for convenience but that's it I don't care about cars that's the thing I they don't bother me I mean they don't then I as long as they get from eight to begin to fix it it doesn't matter what it is your car guy\nNot really a card guy but it always seems to be like someone's always like well you know I just want to you know my pickup truck one of these days I Do just to have one\nWho got to pick up truck that but other than that it's\nFunny like I don't have any other mass desire to do this or that it's just one of those things where you know if you're not happy in life before the lottery water is not gonna make you happy after\n... well see the thing is for me I have things I Want to get but I Want to earn them it's a weird thing I Know some stupid but I Want to be able to say I don't know is is the thing is is there nothing to unite do people might have pride in what they've earned like\nI Want to turn it into if I get ... let's say it's nine hundred million dollars yeah I Want to turn that nine hundred million into three billion that would be Michael\n... see us something you want to do with it right you have a feeling you wanna do see that that if you take that ... that's what people think they just want to live the life of a vacation it ... it doesn't work Shane thanks would call it just doesn't work it's like it's against human nature to get your biology\nIt'll work for a while a couple of years like that it won't work after a while telling you I'm telling you\n... say man what about like retired people\nWho are how do they survive\nThey have a hard time getting um they have a hard time getting uh getting acclimated to it some of some end up going back to working part time jobs like take care of kids they they always have something to do one of these people I Know it was my father in law's retired\nHe's always got something going on always you have to but you can you can do stuff with your when you can do more stuff would you better be prepared for it now and how many people have thought that through um I'm just saying Stevens in Providence even your WPRI Steven\nHey like philosophical friday's came early and I get a hundred percent\nWere with your your dire for voting sense of of of dark evil this modern equivalent of the fourth in deal with the devil\nAnd archetypal a theft of your soul further glimpse of a of one point six billion does it come out that kinda money would exert such a psychic influence on you and everyone around you that you will never wake up to the same person you ever were\nThere are communities there are places where you could go right now where the the the necessity of someone going to survive to to pay for their own survival has been removed\nRight they're not living in the lap of luxury\nThey have the basic needs that they have to get have been ... you know I've been taking care of housing heating assistance food all that stuff or you think they live in happy lives\nMaybe if they get they get no problems again nobody worried about you know all these things you know I don't think people understand what goes on\nAnd so ultimately this is one of the crazy parts about this the more\nAnd we're going to see this in our society by the way it was why this conversation you is a very I don't even know if it's been mainstream or not but there's this philosophical conversation goes on about a universal basic income because as automation takes over more and more of our everyday you know jobs like factory work and and what not\nOr less and less people who are you know low skilled workers are going to have anything to do\nAnd I don't think you want a bunch of people sitting around with nothing to do\nRight so ... that out too or or what's the opposite of extrapolating something out or you know just just focused on to one one person you know when when it comes to the lottery and the people around them you're going to have a bunch of people that had some purpose when they woke up in the morning all of a sudden have to find their own new purpose\nAnd I don't know if people are capable of doing that at some maybe seems an extra call it's a philosophical conversation same thing like it's the same thing with atheist you talk about atheists can do just uh\nHow would you like motor trends twenty eight gene truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty so desperate for the best price anywhere just one hundred and

in a higher power right some people say Oh yes they can\nUh I don't know where they've never done it\n\nRight where where's that ever been done what's happening right now on people are living off of construct it was created the based on religion and our belief in God and you still living that construct there's a lot of things that you take for granted that are based on an assumption about things that are very religious in nature and if you take those assumptions away\nAnd you take away that belief away it ... after a while people start to go well you know\nI mean look what was the guy I was thinking about this this morning this this stuff I think about driving into work who's the guy was um [noise] rama Emanuel's brother that was I think he worked for the national organization of health

rather wrong there but it's important to explain all this that's the voice of in regards to world famous Rhode Island famous labor attorney\nHere in uh in the state where where basically he's explaining that these side agreement so we've been talking about a ... in in the context of the city award\nHave um [noise] have\nUltimately a you know been found if they're not ratified and they don't count I mean when I first\nHeard this I'd never heard the term site agreement in the context of\nA of of labor relations or labor negotiations\nAre but what a basically refer and until I talked to in yesterday and he told me you know basically when I heard site agreement I thought side agreement denotes the fact that we just turn on the side and nobody was actually ever give you okay to things like this and you you in order for most places unless there's some kind of a weird set up in a city or town\nIf you make a deal with a collective bargaining unit you could be the police it could be fire it could be I don't own janitors it could be cooks help or is it could be anybody you need to have the negotiation with the with the unions and more often than not a um\nYou know the collective bargaining a group has to agree to it but then also the the the the contract has to be ratified by the rhetoric ratifying body like a collective bargaining um excuse me like the city council\nDo you is there any ability for you and desire for you at the council to call for an investigative body to come in and look at this as a result well\nObviously we have and now uh you know when you say investigative body we've hired in accounting firm and every day it seems like a war accurately every week uh the\nThe task that CPA for changes as their investigation goes deeper and

out um and uh it was very upsetting\nSteam role as the city council president ... so what about law enforcement here at this point the attorney general's office state police is there some are going to be some kind of ah you know recognition yeah I\nDon't I'm not going to jeopardize any investigations but he's talking about what ... what may or may not be going on that's not my role my role is to approve things\nUh and there are other agencies are that look at this and make determinations as to impact and uh I don't think it's in the best interest of the citizens of wall work that I\nTurn around and said that uh\nThat there is an investigation or there is an investigation or we're assuming that someone did something wrong or that's not my task as an elected official like\nWell how am I saying what do you mean by that others will hold on a second that's why that doesn't make any sense it is a city council president ... represented the people it sure is within your purview to say listen uh we see some sneaky stuff here while I was going on here so it's called the police are being on ...\nIt looked like we have an I I've already made statements we have active investigations happening and I'm not going to talk about potential litigation matters because I don't believe it's in the best interest in the city as to what could or could not happen\nWell hold on hold on to say when you see investigations you talked about in order that's being done is law enforcement involved in looking in this\nI Can't answer any questions regarding any pending investigation that's that's up to the agency\nHas the city council officially gone off to any law enforcement agencies and presented this and say hey maybe you should too\n... group wants your car any make any model flood pays

came up with regard to the to\nThis contract I'm sure that people are working and I'm not going to jeopardize investigations by saying that they are are they are not um you know this is a very fine

pest quite frankly and you know as a council president I Would be too\nBecause you know they voted for these contracts\nThey go ahead and they decide whether or not these contracts legit on behalf of their constituents and they get the runaround day to day where they were you served there was basically this might sound a little bit of hyper ... you know little ... upper bowl a hyper both

mayor's administration either with his knowledge or without it I don't know\nBut you know at all I wanted to know as to whether or not anybody in the city council the city council president contacted law enforcement and told them about this he responded with I'm not going to talk about investigations that are going on so you don't have to talk about the investigation I Want to know whether or not you called them\n\nKnow that they're supposed to get ratified from the city council or you got a bridge\nTo sell you on top of that this afternoon at five o'clock in the here and then your show Gail

mean you've been gusty yesterday don't you think we have a clip of it someplace in talking about how this has been a culture in Rhode Island as a culture of these side deals and if they're not ratified you know it's almost one of those things when you're when you're sitting there and your um\n[noise]\nWhen you're sitting there and you're negotiating a contract it's a focus of news right you may have local media that looks into it you may have look reporters looking at it you have systems watchdog looking at it\nWhen you're in the middle of the contract\nYou know it's kind of like doing Obama said if after this election not going to get a little bit more room he's talking to was Medvedev that time talking about give me a little bit more wiggle room after his election it's kind of like once we get past this contract negotiation will\nTake care of it with a side agreement well which is all willing good as long as you get ratified by the ratifying body assuming you have one in war that's the city council Wisconsin rules that\nThat's the city council\nSee counts as opposed to ratify this and he seemed legitimately livid about this 'cause now he's gonna have to be you know you know has some some skin in the game here because you know this is going on and he's gonna have to react to it\nAnd you know mayor Solomon has to clean up the mess and there's some and should be

we speak\nMuch in riverside make your WPRI Mike\n... a man that I Want to thank you\nThat's just what do I want it on to them I don't know what I was going to that some of these contracts going out
