although maybe she has she well you know and and I guess that's their opinion\nYeah but my ... the the the bigger question is here is\nA you know are people out there are we at a point where you know her generation that's come up she you know she said it in the interview a lot of people have turned Eighteen in the past couple of years and they are\nYo yo influential so these people who just turned Eighteen or are we are they just slowly relying on Taylor Swift to tell them what to do or are these you know people do in their own research you know it's kinda like you\nReally don't know that it's how they're being brought up and what they're being taught in school or what they were taught to all their lives we don't know we can't you know we can't judge them on that right you know\nIt's true but it's certainly like you said it's very interesting timing Michael very interesting timing so when I Am in his everything\nIn it right now I don't think it was proper timing like I said they had done a very very powerful song when George W. Bush was in ... but that was after the fact after everything had gone down there\nAnd and it was a powerful statement and her words and I'll\nSure no I agree pink is I mean if you wanted to talk about

of whom [laughter]\nWho concert oh my God I Love her she's really I mean just\nThe beside the ability to sing the the entertainment out aspect of it really like\nUnbelievable she's you know people kinda while he got ...\nI don't want I I didn't want to take all your other\nCallers out there I just wanted to put my word across to say that music you know what would life be without music I like I said if he ever get a chance to look up the train back in the eighties when it difficult days are going on what would life be without music and that's that's where most of us are generations or most generations get their\nViews from you know whether it's ... or Dr Dre or ... you know that's where you get your news from you know it it's not like it's brainwashing you but it's just it just it just the music the word ... something whether it's country or ... you know I'm trying to\nSay I I hear ya exactly I've always been a big fan of Scott music myself but that was just one summer in Nineteen Ninety six Michael you know just one summer I was ... and\n... even the ... you know oh yeah\nThe ... you know the the band Perry being there they they got words and the lyrics in some of the stuff really makes you wonder about things\nIn the ... the Beatles had songs in and John Lennon after the fact they all had they all I mean when\nThey start ... using the words as as weapons when they saw weaponize music it's it's I don't I don't know I think sometimes it turns more people off and it can be very ...\nBut it you know if you think about it most of the song come out after\nThe facts of certain situations right now I mean I like Taylor square I think she's a great artist but I think the crime and is or she should have waited a little bit\nThe timing may be often time will tell Mike alone it\nAll right well I have a good day and I hope I didn't tie up much retiring\nYou did just fine Michael ladies and gentlemen Michael from or give them around or applause thank you for one four three\nNine seven seven six we have the applause do we fire the audience already there off taking a break happy Columbus Day [noise] yeah it's just it's\nKnow he brings Michael brings up a great point of our you know the music is powerful I agree I I've I've been a musician since the age of five laying the accordion drums and keyboards in plain and bands playing shows playing a variety of things I work with a lot of musicians just last night was with Emily Luther up there at the autumn best\nIn the rain and we losers out there performing\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's for me or luxury

really hope that it it's it's\nSomething to the fact of okay if you hear somebody talking about this stuff you know really you've got to start digging into it and and you got to dig into it the right way you got to find out the information is so much\nI hate to use the term but there is a lot of fake news out there Facebook's trying to crack down on all of that by the way they they of ah they've they've rolled out a system where there are people who if you report something a as being a false report or false story\nOr and if they if they find it to be true they trust you a little bit more on
