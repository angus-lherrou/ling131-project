has some great tips and strategies you beginning to think about this next phase of life\nWhile you're in the right place\nThis week is going to be no different we're going to share some really great nuggets of information for you as you began this journey to and through retirement that never again to reach out to a job for zero one three three three\nEight thousand now most of us did learn in physics Newton's third love notion right for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction it shows is really great symmetry in nature forces occurring in pairs and housing interact with one another\nIt's great to understand how that can be applied to everyday life you know there's two sides to every story so to speak\nThe cool thing is it can also be applied to finances in other words there are forces out there that can boost your financial portfolio there are also opposite an equal forces were going to call the what if today ready to bring your finances down\nThough with that in mind just going to help us walk through some of that get financial strategies to help protect their retirement savings against eight ... what is so ... we're going to get the ball rolling here maybe since we're talking Newt and we should get the apple rolling what do you think\nA good point that's a funny one you're clever your Glover\nYou of course like a law of nature the what is a really more of a when you know the market will go down we don't know when prices will go up eventually and so on\nToday we're going to start with some mackerel events that can rein in our bottom line the first is what if interest rates continue to rise\nWell most know that the risk of interest rates going up as a bond prices will move in the opposite direction of the interest rate so if interest rates go up ... come down and she says her dumb blonds always go for free like with like a seesaw or teeter totter\nThe other issue with bonds is the maturity or duration you\nKnow how long before the bond reaches maturity and you get your money back\nThe longer that is the father out that is the more price sensitive the bond becomes if you have to unload that bond prior to mature you know the good news is if you are able to hold on until maturity you are entitled to get all of your original investment back so if you bought a ten thousand dollar bond\nEven during the term it could lose value because interest rates going up but if you hold on to it to maturity you'll get your ten thousand back from the bond issue so that's always important to keep in mind\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in East Berlin a generic ended up the best financed refund prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a Ford's also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nOr a duration that's further out\nBut the market really started coming down in October of oh seven and went down substantially went down through all of a wait and then continue down through early March of old nine now when you look at the S. and P. five hundred for that Eighteen month period\nIt lost two thirds of its value that is a huge hit for anybody to take\nSo if you've got all of your retirement funds\nIn the market directly at risk in the market will then maybe now is a real good time to take a peek at other alternatives that you may have\nTo help avoid those big losses when the market does have its next big correction now we know it will likely happened nobody knows when you know let's let's be clear about that you know my crystal ball and in the closet for a long time\nBecause [laughter] it doesn't work [laughter]\nDrive but there's no real value and looking at it [laughter] it's kind of left out that\nUm so it's important to understand that market corrections are typical you know you should expect them you need to be positioned accordingly I'm a nice thing to do is to have a cash reserve so it's a market where to drop down severely and that's where you were drawing your income from\nThen you can shut that off and maybe drawdown on your cash account instead\nAnd that way you're able to take care of what your what your financial needs are without invading the account that the market is taking down and down in value Mm\nOkay so I'm hearing you talk about the market you're saying stop panicking right don't chase trends don't get worried when you flip on the news and everyone's in a tizzy right exactly\nRight so it it's so important if you have a will lead plant in the market corrects you really should not cause you to lose sleep if you have a well laid out plan just conceptually we'd like to take a portfolio and split in half\nHalf we want invested in the market directly so we can take advantage of those good years in the market but half of it we want to have it in protective positions with the market does drop substantially that half of your portfolio doesn't go down in value so that's that's very important and we do that by mixing\nYou know insurance based products with investments and we think that is the better way to go and you know recently a Yale professor from Yale or Roger habits and and the people follow the market the recognizes same 'cause he's really a big name and investment world\nCame up with a report that showed that the bond alternatives that we use\nOur the place that you should be considering placing your money as you go forward because of bonds having a negative impact with rising interest rates which we know are happening\nWe've had increases already we're expecting more this year we're expecting more next year so I've been positioning like that for years so you know I kind of joke and say well you know Gail finally caught up with me [laughter] this is the way that I've been doing it for a few years\nNow they have they act yeah for the exact same reason so now I just\nTake this report say look you know here's a report from a professor from Gail that says what we're doing is what you should be considering as you move forward\nYou know to think about that there's a lot of power when I'm somebody of his stature and his team did research over Ninety year period of the stock market and did the analysis and came up with yeah these are the places you should be putting your money so it's I think it's pretty cool because it really\nBacks up in third party information in a very from a very credible source some let's say you know they have a pretty good and then\nI got to get people might say oh yeah I remember them yeah [laughter]\nWhat it's all good so if you like to hear more about that that you report specifically a number of years for a one three three three eight thousand we'd love to hear from you have you in for an opportunity conversation to see if we might be able to help you and your family with your retirement planning\nAnd hopefully with some tax mitigation some income planning perhaps some legacy planning whatever is important to you at this stage of your life\nOur number here again is for one three three three eight thousand if you have two hundred thousand ... retirement please call\nBoy you mentioned Roger edits and I I'm familiar I have followed him wow what a brain what a guy you know he really is I just take a cut above and I've been really impressed with what he's he's sad especially lately about the market\nHe has a son and husbands credited to doing so much very detailed analysis about the stock market over decades and decades of time and ah you know thankfully I had the opportunity to be at a conference where he was actually\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island for a mere luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lighter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV

interesting that we pick on the nerves in high school but those are the those are the people that everybody else ends up working for you know so [laughter] it's kind of interesting\nI have to that reminds me of something I'll share this with you and our listeners quickly before we move on jak we were beating a team in high school in basketball pretty badly and they were known as the really really top tier school in the city\nAnd there are students sections started chanting that's all right that's okay you're going to work for us one day [laughter]\n[laughter] oh that's funny to talk about in your in action right or that that that is funny though [laughter] and probably true\nYeah [laughter] God\nBless them they they they understood the bigger picture [laughter]\nIt's not just about winning a basketball game and although you know being a competitive sport says his can really help people develop\nAs people and have a good sense of\nYou know it takes effort to get what you want a I think that's the bigger picture when it comes organized sports if you want to win then it takes effort it takes practice it takes rehearsals you know you've got to be there you go to put in the time just like being a good financial advice this does not happen overnight\nYou know I've been licenses Nineteen eighty seven so I have a wealth of knowledge and that's why I wrote a book recently you know it's a messy on money how to plan protect and make your money last for life your guide to retirement and that's the book that that if you'd like to get the book you can go to Amazon dot com\nOr you can download a Kindle version for a hard copy version whichever you prefer\nA short money it's like ten bucks or sixteen bucks roughly um that's pretty cheap when you look to retirement plenty of the wealth of knowledge that are kind of poured my heart into that book so that I can get as much information out to our listeners as possible\nI Love this book get it it really is a wealth of incentive for people beginning to think about retirement just a great place to start if people want more information about that book about what you could do for them in their retirement future what would you encourage them to do today well\nThey can go to Matthew and money dot com and there's the spot to buy the book without connect you directly with Amazon\nAnd I think that would be one of the best investments you can make you know even if you don't want to work with a professional it gives you a great deal of information that you can actually tried to put it put together a plan yourself and obviously we don't recommend that because obviously we have more experience than you would on your own\nAnd a lot of our bigger clients this is interesting one of our bigger clients who handle their own investments up to retirement realized the amount of time that it took them\nTo watchdog their investments\nAnd this one case comes to mind specifically and there was a big case and it's kind of an unusual case where he gave us a million up front to work with he finally retired and he's had his four oh one K. where you had another million and he just slipped out across the table you suggest I Want to retire from taking care of this too so I Want you to handle is for me\nHe said I Want a golf [laughter]\nThat's what I Want to golf and he golfs like every day I remember calling you went back home on a cell phone it was in his mid February now obviously that's cold around here and you know he answers the phone and it's kind of breathing heavy I said do you okay\nSo yeah I'm On the golf course I said it's forty five degrees who do you mean on the golf course [laughter] now you will see me on a golf course under like sixty degrees because to me I'm a farewell the golfer\nAnd I'm not going to go out and try to prove my ability to withstand cold playing golf I did that in the army I said my cold weather training in the army I Know what I can do and what it takes to survive but you know I don't put that to work on a golf course [laughter] oh I was like\nWow he was serious and so he really wanted to just enjoy retirement and part of an animal is giving up the investing that\nIn in for me you know so heartwarming when we have a case like that\nAnd we know we're making a dramatic impact on their life\nBecause in his in his mind I fried up hours per day that he would spend watching his investments looking at this reading so taking care of that we're now he's just hands it off and go here\nIt's not worth it for me to do it on my own I have much more important things to do and then since he retired grandchild now on the scene so they have more time to enjoy their family so it it's just hot one has just love that kind of stuff because if they're happy\nAnd my goal is to help people achieve their financial goes for retirement so that they can be as happy as they can be so I Know we kind of went a little off track on the the topic of the today show\nWhat their Chevy GMC ... Toyota and super all have in common they are all in for Steve free own tradition I bought bought any religion or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all make all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto job now\nHere's for one three three three eight thousand we will take you through our trademarked proprietary process start to finish which begins with an opportunity conversation can we help you if we think we can well then we get your financial statements do a deep analysis of your current holdings\nNow a lot of people have misconceptions about annuities and it's really unfortunate\nBecause in the right place a portion let me repeat a portion of your money\nShould be considered for an annuity because of what it can provide you it can provide you safety against stock market downturns it can provide you're guaranteed lifetime income you can't get that anywhere else but in those types of guaranteed insurance products\nCause guarantees are always by the claims fang ability of that insurance company so you want to work with a good company know our listeners they might be real sharp with what they're doing but\nYou cannot go directly to an insurance company and buy a product you have to go through an advisor so it just makes sense that you work for the professional because then you've got everybody you know as a as a professional taking it like having arrows and your quiver\nI have a lot more arrows and Mike wherever then you have access to\nBecause of our licensing that allows us to do certain things that you as an individual can't do so it's important to work with a professional that you feel comfortable with that you feel you can trust you know ask your friends who are they working with get a referral\nOr give us a call we'd be happy to give you a second opinion as to what your uh current advisors has been doing and are you on the right track and you might very well be and on occasion we doing analysis and we say you know what you're in great shape you may be tweak this week that but you're good to go\nAnd isn't that beneficial either way and we're if we find that you know things really aren't right for you to maybe it's time for change and maybe just the the planned didn't keep up with your your timeline heading towards retirement\nOr number here's for one three three three eight thousand if you save two hundred thousand or more for your retirement\nWe'd love to hear from you come on in and have an opportunity conversation with us\nAnd it is complimentary so there is no charge for the process that we take you through and we have a trademark process soup to nuts as the old saying goes so we can show you exactly where you are today and then potentially build a planned for you to help you achieve your financial goals\nGap you mentioned securing our funds from are guaranteed source of income that worried guaranteed I imagine there's a lot of that on that list that addresses a scary thought as not having enough guaranteed find whatever may arise right\nLike you know and that's it seems like a simple question but that can go into so many different offshoots um you know the real issue\nThat I see is the biggest major unexpected expense would be medical you know what if you or your spouse gets really really sick and retirement\nYou know did you protect yourself I mean what I mean by that is when you reached an age sixty five did you sign up for Medicare and when you actually retired did you sign up for Medicare part B which handles doctor visits but more importantly beyond that\nDid you buy a supplemental plan because the supplemental plans really cover all the other expenses the Medicare part a and B don't cover\nThat is a dramatic\nProtection that you can build in what in my opinion is pretty short money your part B\nPremium right now is about a hundred and thirty four dollars a month a very a supplemental plan for somebody sixty five is about a hundred and fifty dollars you need a drug plan which might be twenty or thirty bucks a month and then you've got everything covered I mean that is an amazing coverage for what amounts to about three hundred bucks a month\nWhen you look at buying their own plan might be eight hundred nine hundred thousand a month plus you got co pays and deductibles and everything else where for three hundred a month under this plan it's going to cover all the ... and the co pays\nSo it's very important than the other part of that if you get really into his long term care\nNow nobody wants to go to a nursing home let's face it nobody ever wants to go there we want to get care in our house if we needed and then maybe move onto an assisted living facility and then at the final\nStage of life so to speak transition to a nursing home for hopefully the shortest amount of time so it's important to not ignore what that expense could look like right now\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit later of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nInsurance plan now we ensure our cars we ensure our homes we ensure our lives in case we pass away many people insured their income in case they get disabled\nBut why not insured this risk which government statistics depending on what source you look at say somewhere between Fifteen Seventy percent chance that are of a married couple eight sixty five fifty to Seventy percent chance that one of them will need long term care before they pass away\nThat's a huge huge risk so why not him that risk over to an insurance company in exchange for premium just a simple way to look at it we do like the hybrid
