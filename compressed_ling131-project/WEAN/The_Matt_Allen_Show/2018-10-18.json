probably so old blinking career\nI'm just thinking about it may in rages me because what tough guys they must be if they if they're one on one I Wonder if they'd be so tough\nBut anyway uh and then when later on as if that was worth it was called I called the Capitol police to having come down here I Know what these guys were threatening us that we're sprint things to us and everything else of course cowards doing it quietly so they can't hear\nYou guys are probably never been in a fire in a life by the way they probably don't do any of the hard work they're probably the the ah oh God they probably haven't been coffee\nThe tough guys but anyway and\nI remember leaving that day packing it all up and are the guys complaining when the Capitol police came over to kind of separate everybody from us they were yelling at the capital's\nYou guys a union or July sides you guys you you you don't really like the chattering\nMonkeys right so anyway um\nI'll never forget this as I'm leaving\nI

way and hearing that way I'm sure there's some of you out there laughing you're as well I think it's great that people on my Facebook page or a firefighter type guys and they think it's wonderful you think that's wonderful that's the that's the that\nIt's wonderful until it to you\nAnd when the mob\nComes for you then you like freak out in the\n... and the whole idea of you know strengthen numbers and all that other stuff you know what I Believe in the strength of the individual in the right to the individual and if the individual see something wrong with a firefighter contracted a waste of

WPRI hello Bob\nHey Matt how're you doing this is a Christian Oh hi Bob how are we gonna go actually\nProbably the poster boy for I guess uh the example of some bad behavior by a a or fire department you know ... years back when I made a a presentation before the city Council on the pension system and just trying to alert people to the problem and\nBasically I had some er or firefighters union president\nOr wrote and emailed the top executives have CBS where I work\nMy lunch break right now I just want to clarify endless or they're trying to get me fired you know or you know hair and and and let me just say this I I think one of the problem why this is ... war it just becomes sort of a strange you\nKnow you have a a former mayor would call people such as myself up Cody and some other people the haters and they just let situations like this poetry he did\nA you know Joe Solomon who is now the acting mayor kind of feel bad for him because he's heritage it's real tough situation\nAnd don't feel bad for the job he's running for the always right no no no\nBut what I'm saying it's going to take some time to kind of ... change the philosophy over there you know I remember a couple of years ago I went or Nestle pension board meeting and we were talking I was with another resident at the time and we were asking questions or the ... the man this before you and your president\nAnd the guy basically started screaming and yelling at me and ... you said you know why don't we take this outside\nSo you know this is the kind of thing that you know it's unfortunate that you have to deal with the war it yeah why not what let me just tell you what other aside and when\nI was out of college for about a decade ago we were thinking about you know privatizing the crossing guard and the the the individual coriander crossing guard the private company has his head off to war it\nFor a long haul when he started talking about you know possibly providing the services but next hey guess

time but don't worry about the Social Security numbers just click through it\nUm which they were not comfortable with the same kind of weird because it looked like the system didn't just put a a place holder or Social Security number in there\nThat actually looks like a real Social Security number and so there's questions about that or the governor's a campaign spokesperson\nMike ... says this is a big stunt without offering evidence that makes it clear that his campaigns increasingly desperate you hip is turning the corner applications are being completed more quickly Rhode Island is making payments faster than any other states in the region the system errors are declining whatever that means\nSo that's the big you know and what the truth is God only knows because\nThis administration

I ... here's my worst nightmares\nThis I should say worst nightmare but one of the nightmares of political nightmare for the state of Rhode Island is this that I have that\nYou're going to see a blue wave this year that's going to come home to roost in this state like you wouldn't believe Sheldon Whitehouse wind\nRhode Island's number one born dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont flood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like flood out over time\nGovernor's race you may see this is my this is my worry and then I ... and I don't think it has anything to do with troll or anything else\nUm you may see a an overwhelming above fifty percent win\nBecause the identity politics of the day that Donald Trump effect and all the other crap to people from the media and all this crap I I think that there's the people in this state that ah that are overwhelmingly motivated to vote\nOr left wing or ... and that's the state's gonna move more and more to the left they've fallen ah for for the nonsense more and more and uh and the ... machine is humongous and we'll have to get out the vote look you won't believe they'll go they'll do inundate Providence\nAnd uh and you might be right but I don't and I don't think it's going to be a trailer thing I I think it's going to be just the the circumstances and the money\nWell it is\nYeah well and also the economy right and people are working if we have three point nine percent unemployment then people are working more than ever now because you'll see a national economy's finally recovered that's usually what happens in Rhode Island eventually we catch up to the national economy where\nThe first one in the first ones in last ones out when it comes to recessions and whatnot um and this is so this is nothing new and um what happens is you got this and and you know right now people they vote with their with their attitude is if they're working they're not paying attention they don't care\nI don't know what it is where we are not wake up at our our climate that we are not better than I write\nAnd I don't believe and I don't know I think it was just recently that we recovered all the jobs we lost in two thousand and eight ten years later and by the way that was the production back then if you remember during the financial crisis one of the things they said is that Rhode Island will recover for ten years\nAgo I went out so I guess what she's saying it added spank a little what and that's a good thing but it's still OK to say\nI think what she's doing she's going to benefit from the current conditions that are happening in the nation\nWe will not it will not change that we have that that will be the first ones in the last ones out when it comes to a recession when the next one happens it'll be the same thing\nIt's because the the philosophy of one off one off ideas and one off or uh payoffs to companies to build an economy doesn't work we've been doing it over and over and over again this stuff doesn't work how it's amazing to me how Democrats do this they'll tell you that low taxes do not spur the economy\nYet here in Rhode Island they'll say well low taxes for certain people\nWill spur the economy the economy that I Want and the ones that I can take credit for Bob thanks for the call it and it's just it's amazing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Matt Allen Show", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "18"}
