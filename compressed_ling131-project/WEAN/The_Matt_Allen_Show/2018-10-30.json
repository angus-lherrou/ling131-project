this is like the this is you have to be a ... or a verbal surgeon sometimes with the things you want to say and so you don't say something that you don't meet\nI have in comparison\nTo somebody who was a victim of sexual harassment getting justice in a perpetrator being put where they belong we there whether it's in a a civil proceeding or or at least um public exploration if not jailed depending on what they do right\nComparing that to the political machinations a that come along with a a week out a election season type nonsense um I'm interested in the former not the

hearing and do whatever is uh is is all the speaker can do\nNow remember this represented ... so far publicly has not said anything about this hasn't commented publicly that the speaker didn't take advantage or didn't excuse me do it what does she wanted to do it seems to me that the speaker did everything that she asked\nAs far as we know\nAnd so with this story you know people saying you know this guy's got to go you've got to I mean he had the Republicans want him to get out of the race um you have you know the ... the the the does the fries who's the speakers a opponent in his district race to say you know we have another scandal here\nUm what I Want is I Want there to be a situation\nWhere and I think you'd probably want this to if somebody is sexually harassing somebody\nThan the person who's either harassed or somebody who knows that the person who's being harassed steps up mix of pronouncement of it goes to the authorities wherever they may be in this case probably the speaking but also you are a an elected representative\nYou can feel free to hold a press conference feel free to stand up for yourself or your colleague and demanded independent investigation and then ask\nFor a process which I don't I Know that this came up during the Senate from a a from a senator um ah what was his name the Senate was charged with a bunch of a of a bunch of criminal activity voyeurism and watch it all the stuff like that and uh for one of the pages up there of what the hell's his name is Republican\n... but you know there was there was a warning that there was and he actually resigned remember they were like what we get rid of them are going to get rid of you know have a process is you know ... what do we think of is it is a duly elected member of the ... the house of representatives is people put them there his constituents put them there\n\nAnd so his constituents have to you know their decision you can't just willy nilly pull somebody out this has to be a process and so you know in a perfect world we would have had allegations made investigation done information in the investigation then leading to some sort of a process which with with which somebody gets removed\n\nNone of that happen\nSo instead it's a new story it leaked out an email confirmation a bunch of rumors swirling shots taken at the speaker blah blah blah so ultimately does the Rhode Island voter get an accurate portrayal of what actually happened here doesn't seem to me no\nI should say not ... not an inaccurate incomplete that's more that's more a proper not because we're not seeing the pet store he's wrong and the waitress incomplete because all the information we now\nSee an incomplete picture what's going on here you have the you have the speaker who seems to me with this and this case anyway has done what is what was agreed to or have you managed it\nFairly well based on what we know\nAnd all this is now is what's a political rumor type stuff and then again in the Arab me to an all this other stuff weaponized me two things what this appears to be\nRight it seems like the the the only fallout from this is is political slander and political smear rather than actual real determination if there's if there's a perpetrator and justice for real life victim\nCan't have this\nSenator kennels by the way was the person and to kill\nSo that you know that's my take you you had to take on this love to hear from you what you think I mean it seems to me that that's what's going on here and it's frustrating as hell my phone numbers for three eight

we should know but this is what this is one thing that's frustrating and ... as a listener to the show or somebody who's out there listening to this and trying to figure out what the right thing is trying to figure out the truth you know these these dribs and drabs and the weird gray world of\nOf politics\nUm creates this distorted view of what reality is the fact of the matter is this is this is what should happen and I think this is the reality if you are a victim of sexual harassment you need to speak up to speak\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with

or you get told you know ... ... and especially in specific or a specific political situation political context um if you're an elected official getting sexually harassed elected officials have a big old bully pulpit they can hold press conferences and I'm telling you if somebody in the general assembly is getting sexually harassed they say it out in\nPublic that people will pay attention that's a beautiful thing because the benefit of the doubt or at least the desire to to to find out what the truth is is always on the side of the victim more oh should say more often than not Ninety eight point ... night and it nine nine nine percent\nHelps create the the opinion I Know it's contrary to popular practice in the modern world were opinion takes information and spins it the way you want it to me so based on what we have right now based in the reporting attendees he's done and everything else it's painted an incomplete picture\nWith these allegations that that um that have come out that I guess there's been a according to state representative kept them because they're in that there's been years worth of sexual harassment\nAgainst her by ... by by current enough foreign how does your committee chairman but current state representative ... up for reelection\nNow um whether or not these allegations are real in terms of you know a national say real\nAre like cut and dry black and white or if there's some kind of weird relationship according to the speaker there's been a relationship there was a relationship that was that went south here some kind of either professional and in closely personal relationship um\nAnd representatives area and confirmed the email this is all about an email that that tendency obtained that was sent back in the spring that she can from she sentence basically she didn't want to present or bills in front of him in committee\nAnd so they had an arrangement according what the speaker said they hadn't arrangements that and you can see that's confirmed by the uh the the video on a over at the at the Capitol television that when her bills came up he would leave\nNow according to the speaker that was an arrangement that was satisfactory to represent ...\n\nNow if that's an arrangement like you know stay away from each other and you don't have to look at each other and that kind of thing\nIs enough to quell the complaints of a state representative who's been allegedly a victim than if you're the speaker you may think I got this handled\nIf it's nuts if it's not a satisfactory to the state representative\nShe can has all kinds of avenues outside the speaker he's not king she's a state representative she's a duly elected official and she has all sorts of avenues to blow the door to ring the alarm here to get this thing fixed\n\nAnd at the same time if these are these alligators we don't know the specificity of what's going on here if they are specific and a aggressive\nAnd belligerent than the entire house of representatives has an obligation to not only call for an investigation into this guy but to also get that investigation and then act on it\nAnd I'm thinking that uh you know trying to speak for the people here I Would imagine that's what you want right\nAnd we hear his up his his his own private a law firm that he works for us now it's just you know administrative leave of some kind they don't determine whether it's paid they don't tell you whether it's paid her unpaid just stays on administrative leave 'em\nYou know it seems now that there's now a a fog over there and these allegations need to be investigated in some way shape or form I don't know what the method is seems to me the speaker has the ability to have a budget and you know I call in the state police\nCall number down state police and ask them to do an investigation of find out whether or not there's been legitimate um it's some kind of whatever here and if there has been\nIn there and they and their rises to the level according to the general assembly according to the house of representatives anyway\nThat they will vote their own member out then they should do that I mean granted there's ... there's an election next week and that can be taken care of quickly\n\nBut what happens is these things become um a week before an election not ... they they they get tainted by their timing and by the the vague way with which people uh\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they're all in pristine free own condition and blood for Denise religion they're against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices log on to flood Otto John John now\nAll this stuff and all the people want I think unless you're devious demented person um for me what I Want\nIs for somebody who's a victimize\nAnd um and if they're ... and and if anybody is aiding and abetting him being victimized as they should be called the task as well\nAnd so if people in the general assembly knows is new about this they have an ... everybody has an obligation to say it publicly\n\nAnd I mean like you know have to sit there but I came out just what I Know you know uh say we are calling for\nAn investigation\nBecause I don't know if his rise to the level of criminality I don't know if it rides the level of you know outside harassment in terms of um you know whatever I mean it it's sexual harassment legally I think has an an element of\nOf you know it has to be somebody who is above you as as the ... it's it's weird because elected officials it's not a corporate structure I mean it's kind of like one but it's you know ultimately they can't um you know political or political\nWheeling and dealing determines\nWhether a bill actually makes it to anywhere I mean there's so much of that stuff that goes on um you know ... you know the sexual stuff into it um you know can can be hidden by saying oh it's just you know there's just no support for leadership and this bill you know that kind of stuff so it makes it a little bit more of an on and on top of it you know you\nCan't just to get rid of people because those people are duly elected by individuals so it's a complicated issue but I think there's a complicated issue but when he's the happened is I think the people need to have a process a process where people come out make allegations that are credible those allegations that looked into\nAnd things aren't handle appropriately\nThat too much to ask in Rhode Island maybe about ... wants to make the above your WPRI Bob\nYeah thanks for taking my oh You're welcome I\nThis is a sad commentary on government but I guess this is highly suspect as far as I Am and go however the or other former has made allegations you know basically the whole us representative was drunk during a yes\nBills or heard and also you mentioned something about sexual harassment early but they they are worried about it they landed up and they gotta get a steady commission out of it yeah\nYou know where these people you know it's All right when they go and ask the Kavanaugh but when they were all members may fail against their own you know again it it is it's tightening steak 'cause I think it's progress is that we're trying to get rid of a support the speaking there are also speak itself in his district well\nIt's that's the case and ah I don't know that to be the case but it is the case then you know they're damaging their own ... I mean they they are literally destroying and helping to destroy the very thing that they say they stand for because if you start to create\nA political weapon with allegations like this then everybody that his ads that everybody everybody than ever makes his allegation\nWill be then a ... why should say everybody it will start to be a looked upon as just a political maneuver rather than a reality and that's the worst thing that can happen to anybody who's trying to change a culture order to trying to make it so that victims or get the justice that they deserve right I mean it's just it's brutal\n... they'd rather Britain their own house down into it and then get rid of the problem\nYeah I mean literally I mean it seems to me that the first priority there's a hierarchy of of of priorities here right first priority is get a victim justice\nTo punish perpetrator appropriately second thing is then go ahead and you can you know if there was a a decision that was made by a politician that was wrongly handled and all that jazz then you can go ahead and you know slap them with that if you want to later on\nSo it seems to me that the first priority from all these people out there call themselves progressive than pro women candidates and everything else is to go ahead to grab an allegation and determine whether or not is true that the person can be called out in the carpet and appropriate fashion\nThat's the first thing and not wait a week before an election that will be used as a bludgeon for next six days and then disappear\nWell like I said you know either way back when by getting rid of the speaker yeah in ... and do so by the other uh ...\nWell yeah I don't know I don't I don't know if that's a yeah knows that will happen but I'm sure that that's that's part of the game anyway\nUm\nBut I don't know I really don't know and if this is ...\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lighter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln him linking him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nTo leave the speaker of the house um if it comes out that he didn't teach he protected cable without an investigation that comes to to light than you should suffer for it politically\nUm\nBut there are ways if you're a victim I mean if it's if you're sitting there getting years' worth of sexual harassment that you can't have that a year's worth\nYears and the only thing you want to do is not have to go to testify in front of committee I don't know man it's it's one of these things it's baffling to me I mean years worth of sexual harassment\nUm especially by an elected official to one one other elected official that'd be a greater um everybody in that house has a greater responsibility to read these people out you don't know these people are\nYou like somebody you based them you base their election on a and your vote for them on their positions on issues how do you know unless they tell you that there are a bunch of degenerates or aid or a degenerate depending on the case\n\nOh my God I'm sitting here on Missouri oh no this is going to be done you're going to see this this is this is visual legal arguments we made this\nAre you kidding me really stop the train I may jump off the train in the last hour the show I may\nAnd then the Halloween costume controversy blackface white face God please that's another reason I'm gonna jump off the train we'll get to that little bit later on we'll continue this the polling data and what it says coming up next to the ...\n[noise] wait wait wait one solution studios seven away from the general election this is talk Ninety nine seven AM six thirty ...

B. R. O. two words\nStay to [noise]\nFor thirty six percent of the voters said there's a good chance they could change who they're voting for and the election eight days from now and there was also another twelve percent who said they weren't sure what they're going to do that is almost half of joke trolls voters that could move away from him [noise]\nThat's Joe ... who is a talk on the channel twelve about the they asked an interesting question and this whole thing about how strong\nSupport that that that voters had for the candidates they were voting for and it seemed to me that according to what Joe Fleming wrote anyway oh joke when they found any way I should say is that the people the person with a soft is um [noise] Boulder I guess commitment was was Joe ... and that to be said half of his voters could go someplace else I'm\nWelcome to the second hour the ... by the way general Mondo quarters Roger Williams channel twelve poll forty five percent Allan Fung thirty\nRhode Island's number one Ford dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont flood as every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\n\nWhat's interesting I'm always fast that we talked about this a little bit yesterday I'm fascinated by the by the eight percent who are still undecided\nAll week out just you know I don't know if that's all I got as Joe flooding at some point maybe we'll have a mind to talk about whether or not it's a that's normal um I'm trying to take a past years I can never remember the numbers but I Know that it seems to me that that's kind of been there that things are moving that much I Know that they talked about the governor of ... months ago the\nGovernor's um you know was was lower than that so she she's going up I Want to say what six points maybe in the past several months um but she can't make it over that age she cannot get the majority of Rhode Island just to back her up she can't do it\nNo matter how much she can pick a a a bite out of Alan fundraiser in with negative ads and I mean I don't know about you who who's watching TV on a regular regular way\nNow um I don't watch television like I used to\nA ... combining DVR as and and a fire stick I I Can't tell you that I I I watched um [noise] for the first time I've my son doesn't do what live TV is quite frankly I he'd ever watches live television ever\nIt's either recorded on the DVR or more often than not he knows where to go where's the recall it Roku we don't even have a real career fire stick\nBut the [laughter] it's so weird the input on my bowl system for that thing is called Roku so he goes to that but it's actually ...\nFor ten our fourth Paul ... back when we did mine in February the governor's race with upper layer of course than the airwaves had been loaded with\nAdd right and the political Kenneth Lay that whose stories out for coverage on cell what\nHappened from falling into the story I think here is the governor has been able to improve her numbers well Allen Fung just hasn't moved the needle he had thirty six percent support in February the pull you just talked about and it's at thirty four percent today that's where the margin of error for ... percent\nThen governor went from thirty eight percent to forty five percent\nSays that's the that's the change in the governor's I mean that I have to go back and look and see what the original when that time for him was that I think that's probably pulling in the beginning of the year um and so yes she is improved their numbers but nowhere near what they have to be\nOr I should say that I shouldn't say that 'cause they they don't really need to be anything more than than more than everybody else but nowhere near over fifty\nPercent and there's just she just doesn't have it she just doesn't have it she just doesn't have enough to bring everybody along with her and that's not good for the state quite frankly it's not good\nAnd so you know I'm sitting here looking at the people that are undecided there are people getting kicked move their candidate and I'm trying to get to a base line this is my my the the the reason why I'm asking this question\nIs I'm trying to get a pulse of what it is that people are dealing with when making their decision on this race\nWhen you're trying to make a decision as to who to supporting the governor's race and you're trying to make a decision as to you know what you're looking into what do you know who's represents me accurately\nAnd you're having a either you're thinking about it and you're like you're undecided but at the same time or if you pick somebody I could move away I could be I could change my mind\nWhat is it that you're going through in figuring this out and you got you know you got a couple of days left to do it\nWhat are you waiting for I got to tell you how many people are going to wait until the ... sitting there not knowing what they're going to do this is me the last presidential election by the way not knowing what the right thing to do is until you walk into the thing the walking in the booth you know\n[laughter] so you're figuring out what the hell to do and more often than not what you're doing that you're sitting there and you're thinking to yourself you know what\nHow do I not do damage whatever your version of damages right\nHow do I not do damage not how do I support somebody is how do I not do it which which is always a lovely thing to do what do you go to a voted with the

now\nIs that something that the Allen Fung campaigns go sit there and celebrate because you've got to [laughter] you're going to reach them\nYou got to have money to get to them you know you don't have the time\nUm and so ultimately whether or not you're somebody that can move there might change their mind if you're out there and you're and you're listening to this you know that's me\nI'm going to support somebody but I'm an opportunity to\nChange my mind what's he going to take the change your mind at this point\nAnd if you're under this is what's fascinates me if you're undecided these you

in handcuffs you know I have no idea I'm happy that that's going to happen to barring that\nAnd then if you're undecided one of the ... percenters will at this point you know people are salivating over ... percent they're going to sit there and try and get to those people and if you're a likely voter that means you if you're undecided now you will have to make a decision the next several days\nOr at least make a decision you know walking into that booth how many what are you going to do what are you looking for that's what I mean that's my that's to me that is the golden trying to figure that out is obviously I'm\nOne of the main strategies of getting elected is trying to figure out not only what you believe in but how to sell to people and how to get them or to figure out what they're thinking seeking kinda either tail you tailor your message or literally pander to them um and then trying to do that and then and then you know you gotta figure out who they are so I Want to know who you are\nThe governor's race you know like this three way they'll just do everything by ...\nAnd you know you're like that you're ... and there's probably about ... doesn't have a dozen people have said that to me\nAnd then I went and I I I heard I heard a I Am on what has been in our town and just you know not looking for votes being down to a guy sitting down having coffee at my local coffee shop and and stuff and like ... feet\nYou know I I'm I'm really thinking right now I think maybe I should I should turn the Allen\nWell let me ask you this question what what is it you believe in are you looking for a human touch type of thing what are you looking for\nLooking for it down to earth person going to change our governorship here\nThat have better in one way of life and what do you do you define that for me was that looked like for you\n[noise] I I just said it's a lot of different\nThings it does is it really it and be honest with me on this when we ask his question and I'm not trying to be critical ... is it all based on a on the front of feeling or is an actual factual you know a meted out actual\nFact actual I Know people that live in in Princeton and either you love 'em [noise]\nYeah there's a lot of that without informing people that there's a there's a really is and\nIt's such a weird thing if you ever met the guy he's kind of an innocuous guy he's not really a bombastic he's not somebody who's had I\nNot that it's now It's Tuesday arsenic and and so genuine and and just like how can this can be so difficult to get along\nWell he's in polarizing he he's got people so mad\nI it it's all like behind the scenes stuff it's all it's it's all like he's just ticked off half the world and uh through the I don't know if it's him if he's got people around him who are just they don't like snakes in the grass and they bite people and they don't and and it's just it's come back to haunt him\nI'm telling you you look at that aspect on the on the air and it's like you're thinking this guy is like this\nOne scene how [noise] you know it looks\nLike he's like eighty five years older than me think of it\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it

this with this race than with the whole coming out in the way they were these these questions and it could it could you know things could change very quickly\nYeah I you know I don't know I mean they haven't they haven't so far as you look at trends right they really haven't changed all that much so I Wonder you know I don't I mean that's why I'm Talking about the eight percent or ... percent is like you so what are you are you is your timeline where you can try and make this decision and make it from where you can just walk in there and wondering\nI'm probably going to walk in there and\n[laughter] going to show whoever whoever makes\nThe best\nUm emotional impression on you before the end you know I'd be by the end of the weekend here could walk away with your vote\nVery well
