Facebook page we had to have this thing going on it's still going on right now going on live right now [noise]\nAnd uh Joe ... said that this was the one of a couple of announcements not just a not just one announcements and so\nIdea that yesterday that there's going to be in a major campaign announcement today that was going to change the landscape of the gubernatorial election um we said yesterday ... big I don't\nDo you consider this to be landscape changing I guess depending on your level of tolerance for how much the landscape changes that would depend you know that will may determine whether or not you say yes or no but um\nYou know I for whatever the thing that that that I find interesting about this one guy I talked to George Will come up at one o'clock to ask him about this\nA state representative Patricia Morgan who lost the Republican a primary process to Alan ... a is now come out and endorsing Joe ... she was she had said publicly at one point that she would endorse the Republican candidate\nAnd I'm sure she's going to get around that by saying well he is a Republican because she has said that already um for me\nI sit here and I wonder and I watch this and I think you have to conservative Republicans right Joe chose a very conservative guy he helped he was the guy he was the surrogate for Donald Trump in Rhode Island to the entire election he's a Donald Trump Republican\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen

administration looks like John robot tie can block in Arlene Violet violet agreed to be an executive or appointed a in in a inspector general\nUh I Believe that the robots I Know what they would have John Robert Robert Hi do but I Know that can block it agreed to uh use some of his skills and looking out waste and fraud and whatnot and doing some of that stuff for that for for Patricia morning should you get elected so that's going to be translated over to Joe ...\nUm and the question becomes you know it's just a landscape changing announcement\nIt'll be good for you know to get the word out and to have people I you know I it it it ... does it get enough support to tell jokes reloaded grab enough votes away from Gina Raimondo you people have viable decision when it comes to ...\nUh no

will join us most of us listening here I Would imagine you know who he is will be joining us coming up at one o'clock to explain all this now is this is this going to change the landscape to the point where a of the ... election changes a little bit\nUm I I asked myself you know when I watch this and I watch how the Republicans are splitting asunder in the state the small group of them I think to myself\nWhat on God's green earth and Alan ... due to allow this to happen and or caused this to happen\n\nYou know I hear a lot of stories behind the scenes there's a lot of stories about everybody quite frankly behind the scenes or could pay all the stories of here behind the scenes or whether they're true or not and a lot of cases I don't even bother to find out because it's just the it's like it's like it's like high school girls are gossiping gossiping about each other\nBut in my mind in this case I think that uh you know if you're conservative person in the state of Rhode Island\nAnd you want to see Gina Raimondo out of office you want the best person in a position to do that and if you think Alan ... is that you got to ask yourself this ... number one is Joe ... wrong what he'd be able to beat\nHer head to head I haven't seen that from him yet so I don't know\nUm there's a lot of things going in the governor's favor lot of things the national climate her pocket book the insanity of the left wing or is in Rhode Island there's always that\nUm the machine she'll be able to pull out those are all things that Alan from what I have a hard time overcoming to begin with\nNow adding that he kicked off his own party to the point where they're ready to blow it all up and give the governor's office down here to her over having him\nYou get the heavy lifting heavy hitters

have came out\nSo the ah the sweet that comes out from ... phone says I Know that the reforms and changes I'll bring angers these two longtime Smith hill insiders too bad\nWe are going to do it anyways that's the response\nTo the fact that ah that Joe ... low has now announced that represented Morgan is going to a well David went out together that they're going to be she's endorsing him as well as the mom Patricia Morgan team that was on a with her during the primary will now be transferred over to the to the drill team\nUm that means Arlene Violet will be a an executive level in a

and its detriment ... what what happens is what what\nReally is a detriment is all these uh muddle headed more ons out there who just sit there and drool and then you have all these ... will love this stuff on the left specifically\nWell but everybody vote let's go out there and get everybody we can show them into giving voting to register and when they when they get their license learn to let's do it and just everybody show up you have to be informed you know to know anything you don't have to you don't have to give a damn you don't have a philosophy on anything\nJust you know should as many

in the state Sandy's awards Sandy on WNPR\nHi good afternoon Matt you have a wonderful show thank you I totally agree with you my husband and I were\nTo vote for fun just to get ...\nHow would you like ... twenty gene trucks with the here for only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to forge twenty a gene for that one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a flood forward and he went into ...\nAnd ... we're all for him a hundred percent\n... you know he [noise] one thing I like about Joe that a lot of people can't stand about Trump if he tells it like it is he's not going to come back I say it behind your back he loves the state of Rhode Island which is a heck of a more than I can say foot Gina Raimondo ...\nAnd I think a lot of people are going to come to his side I rarely rarely do\nWell will be enough you know a ... so yeah I Know you've got it's going to be enough\nWe'll see Sandy thanks for the call I mean listen uh he says he's a good one funds are corrupt marriage can be a corrupt governor I mean you're going to convince people that I'm gonna ask them about that about Fifteen minutes twenty minutes to write their\nALS nice prominence out here on W. bureau\nI ... a long time with\nA man I got I got a different take on it and that the opposite from your last caller a I have to tell you that\nYou know Joe thrill out doing this ... it's just that really really despicable act of revenge and retribution\nWell for one that's what I Want to know for what\nWell I personally think yeah the inanimate stores Allen idle ... does you know our word is absolutely no good she said at least three or four times on the public record she supported the body nominate Mm or where it is absolutely no good and you're bringing at three people very talented people but you know\nI it's just it's dividing the vote oh trolls already you know ... by the end the old ... that\nYou know a vote for Joe is essentially a vote but Gina oh people are smart enough to realize that this time because we certainly went through that last time and if we want to nominate governor elected around thirty or forty percent of the vote and your whole for Joe if you want some real change is somebody that you when you both our fault\nIt's as simple as that and I really really all that Joe draws a stepdaughter is not the reason and are getting a permanent judge you it's not the reason he's doing this I Hope they got it not because of that is that if that the fact the gate and I'd always denied it but if that's why in this rate man it it really\nIt really really is the wrong thing in the war and motivation\nAnd that you know the guys again at five or six percent of the old Matt\nI don't think you can do it I really like to say thanks for years ago\nA well you might be the ... it might be ... it might be the same thing is is four years ago I just you know I I'm just shocked that there's no\n[noise] well does it maybe there is a part of this new and used have invoke lies to because you're frustrated but there is it doesn't seem to be in the profiling people any sort of sense to me that he has some responsibility in this\nLike ... what did he do to these two people to make them completely turn their back on on a you know supposedly their philosophy and and make it possible for ... to become the governor again but what what what was going on that he would they would want to blow up the Republican Party like this after years of being in it\nDoes that make you wonder that I I I think it's a a ... it's a big question what I Do think you're dealing with people\nAh that may be bought it might have been that time and it's not\nIt's oh I see me sour grapes you walking fat log into say Allen is not a good candidate is ridiculous because he certainly beat her like a drama in the primary and or to make that statement is ridiculous defeat ... interesting are I\nI I just think of all but Joe is now effectively opens the interim window and it it's a real\nWell you know I get your point I get your point but you know go for Joseph vote for Joe that's what that is you know you get in to start getting into the voting this person for that person all that nonsense people don't think that way\nThey really don't people don't vote that way you know like this is why the anybody but Gina vote didn't show up because it just doesn't work that way\nUm most people don't vote that way they just don't sorry um\nYeah you might get a couple of hardcore partisans whatever but most people vote for somebody you're gonna get more reason to go for you to support you stronger that way and uh you know so and that's where I think when people criticize Allen phone and say that he's a weak candidate it's that's the issue in this this kind of thing shouldn't be possible\nYou know if you know what you're doing in your your strong I'm just kind of thing should be possible\nYeah puzzles zipped up already um but unless we listen this something's going on here I don't know what it is I've asked the question and I go I get the answer of a you know it's a bad guy do this that the other thing is

I I said yesterday I Believe I should just say if this is a Patricia Morgan endorsement I'm going to be very upset because this is not will be landscape changing tell me why this is landscape changing\nWell let's let's keep changing because you know you've got\nA significant rep Republicans here that are basically agreed to come on board with my administration Patricia Morgan fully endorsing me and pledging to work with me in the administration at some point\nAnd I think that's that game changing it really is\nUm it takes a lot for these people to basically say that they're not happy with the direction of of this campaign is going without one for is the nominee and and you know the reason why I said from day one\nI could've never supported our farm based on a lot of things I Know about him I just can't support him he's not an ethical guy is not a good guy but I I Know I couldn't support him and and I don't believe for one minute that that he can really win this race if I were to go to number one this race\nSaying I don't want young people to vote\nNo no but you do see did you see the Facebook Live\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again

governor's office ah unlike the other two they Allan Fung can't make a decision unless he runs it by a focus group\nA Gina Raimondo we know what all are bad decisions I she can't fix the problem she last year and a half hours of our taxpayers' money a year and a half dollars I mean it's unbelievable things she could even consider running for reelection what's going on in this day right now is a great\nJust to the taxpayers and they all should be beside themselves and they should also get over this anybody but Gina sure will ride on Alan for what you just got on the pony\nHe can't make it twenty without collapsing on all four leg\nRight Joe is going to be interesting to watch and we'll see what the effect this has on I Know that is I think it would be some more polling coming out soon so uh if you've ever decide you want to release your your polls to me publicly I'd love to love to read them All right [laughter] like you talk to her I ... in Germany had been a candidate for governor what did you say\nWhen you say that that\nVery interesting very very interesting um you know is it going to have a much as much of an impact you know those I don't\nEven know who I don't know that are that there are people out there even know who you you'd be very surprised they don't even know what they know Patricia Morgan is\nRight it's one of those things do they even know who I mean they might know the more people he put out there did is they carry the cache that that Joe hopes that does um how do you argue against what Joe's argument is\nYou know the anybody but Gina stuff is fine and people can think that way but you know he doesn't and I really you know I don't put much stock in the whole conspiracy thing um you\nKnow there might be some bad blood there but I mean when a guy tells you he thinks this down fungus corrupt what are you saying that\nNow Alan fungus going to be on with the terror tomorrow to answer all this stuff so I Can't wait to hear what he has to say about this uh my numbers for three eight WPRI the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI raising wore a gray aren't WPRI right\nHey I got\nI got a question Joe or just like to know where he stands with the whole recreational marijuana\nHe said during the debate he's on the line anymore but I didn't know you asking for a question for him but he said uh during the debate he would um if you could figure out a way to have police officers be able to detect it for when people are driving under the influence he would support for it to support have support for it to go on the ballot for for a vote\nThat was just taken All right thanks we get to a break we'll come back\nA lego Joe trolls being indoors by representative Morgan he thinks it's a that's a big game changer here uh I think the game it changes is that it's obviously going to be\nA battle for the people who are not going to vote for Gina Raimondo and I don't know that either one can either one of the people who are voting for the war who are going to be a competing for that vote grab enough of them to make it happen\nYou know there was only ten percent undecided ... or nine percent not a lot for three eight WPRI

Raimondo is head but you have to explain the analogy in the metaphor is probably not good [laughter]\nAll right Joe trove Patricia Morgan now a team\nHell bent on going out there and uh I mean listen there's no doubt in my mind that they're going out there to try and do as much as they can to stop but Alan from from becoming governor\nI'm from day one yeah from day one um that was a mistake by the way it was it doesn't actually\nBut you know this is I still would love to get to the bottom of what it is that happened here and how this Republican Party has been split asunder how it's been broken in pieces here and\nUh in terms of not even be able to rally around one gubernatorial candidate and I can't disagree with the concept that Allen Fung could be Gina Raimondo in a one on one game either I you know that this isn't four years ago man there's a lot of forces at work including zillions of dollars\nSo you know\nBut governor ... has got a has got a blockage she's got her supporters and they don't move and nobody nobody joins nobody leaves it's\nA weird thing so you know trying to trying to stay clean to the sixty percent that are left over um are what's your what these guys are working on and and it's that's where people get frustrated but you know at the end of the day of listening you don't own elections people have a right to vote for who they want to vote for people to run\nSo I Know you're frustrated by it but I don't I don't know what the alternative is what's the alternative is forcing the show sponsored by Jones on service center October ... car care month so so

pretty tough talk to you you want to corrupt do you want to rent the current governor than you might just\nWhat you're going to come up with an idea they're going to email here about that and until you start telling me what it is that that that's corrupt or you know I can no time for it and I don't blame people thinking that Charles in the bunker Charles Ewing WPRI Charles\n... decided to take it fell asleep while you're ... you're Charles good news well written striking distance of getting our state back ... what do you mean [noise]\nI think that a combination of joke Charlie having these people that are actually responsible adults can run the fate and know how to stretch a dollar and a blow every dollar that we got you know\nA is a plus plus plus for the working man and and the people and do you think\nThat that can happen you think he can win\nWell I think it's one more thing that needs to be done it at the moment immediately what\nBy Jane assigned to be anybody but Gina or Alan sign okay and then uh I think ah you know if you really think about it you know you want your state you can't put in our ah\nOur Allen in because they're owned by the same people at the at the state that shadow government I Want to look at it people do what they're told a joke chose not to do what he told her to go to it's going to go on to the right thing for that in Rhode Island\nWill you help will you tell Joe ... seal up the junk yard mechanic vote\nActually I have been a convince the people of all there's a lot of people that want to get ... they ... the only way it went out and I keep pointing out on everyone lined up at the same Colorado I'm not a on the people that are that actually owned a stay\nOn the on the state the people over the state and the way that the voters like just like the cold most got plenty of great white hope is that you know that\nOur people our own state and that line you know and I think that joke hello Scott\nIdiots strike one vote short of feeding 'em up the whole thing and and taking over the governorship and five week test about got it we can convince the people that Alan song is that the guy and throw trawler we'd be better off with don't fall in the long run\n[noise] yeah that's going to be interesting man Charles thinks the call I don't know how you do that I mean it seems to me you're going to go out there and you're going to spend a lot more money than you spend with your job to get that message out um you know introduce yourself to do that I mean the the debate performance he had I think it was very strong um\nI think the you know nobody lost that debate but I think ultimately when it comes to be known and and to be somebody to pay attention to draw a pillow one so that debate or you get a couple of more performance is like that you get a couple of moments like that would that that the you know almost like Scott Brown like moments 'em and you can have something happened and it just going to be a matter of time but you know you can't count on those things\nUm you can't count on those things those things he's leaving in a bottle of you to get them you don't make some Cranston Mike you're on WPRI Mike\nHow you doing Matt Good\nMan I got to tell you I I don't see this as a game changer at all in fact I I just see it as a lot of hot air being blown out of the\nEnd of the race you know but this was a tough race than and with the morgue going out back in back in ... ... and the next to Gina\nYeah I mean listen that's the that's if anything let's put it this way when you watch the primary all the patterns that came out in the primary were basically the conventional knowledge was was what happened and if that's still the case of conventional wisdom comes true again in the ... and it's still in control here uh you know adding to the fact that you might have a\nYou know a democratic a wave out there that it's going to come through that there is a a huge machine the Gina Raimondo has I mean it whether or not I I think you'll you'll see that you're going to see that they're going to split a certain amount of votes that are not Gina Raimondo votes but on top of it you may have a turnout issue\nYou're going to have a a money in a in a machine issue you're going to have 'em all those things and I don't know I I the one thing I agree with\nThat they've said I don't think that it's a shoe in ... would be walking around thinking that have joke for those are the race Allen phone would be Gina Raimondo I don't ... I don't think that we have that\nFor a million I I I think it's a very very very close but you know I sit back and I said to myself I I'm an independent voter but I sit back and say where we're all people that have their pensions cut where where all the people that have\n... well that's the thing you know that way yeah where are these people because they're they're sitting on the other hand if they ...\nAbout those we talked about those people last hour somebody called up and I flipped out about it because what happens is those people are robots and they will not vote for Republican\nMay vote and I I that's why I ... I always think that a lot of the votes that Bob hughley got ... votes that went to him because he was a guy that dead people could say I voted for him and not for Alan ... 'cause they don't want to vote for Republican\nAnd that's why people say oh you took boats from phone he he took some votes from from but he took a lot of votes from Gina Raimondo because a lot of the teacher union people in the union folks out there were kicked it her for pension reform this still take deter but they're not going to support a Republican 'cause there are a bunch of lunatics\nAnd I don't know why they would never do it he's a ... a very\nA left wing Republican he's not he's not a hardcore guy he was there at the uh AFL CIO nomination thing the other day to get his endorsement he talked to them about this\nHe's not a guy who's going to be a hardcore ideologue he's already said he doesn't work he doesn't believe in the ah in the work to to wherever they are your work their right to work state thing anymore\nI'm you know he's trying to peel off some some union support from Gina Raimondo because they still they still piss dinner and you know will they be able to vote for Joe true instead\nI don't know I don't know what they're thinking half the time 'cause I don't think that they think half the time\nYou're you're absolutely right and they make me crazy these people I\nMet I got to tell you I Love to have a glass or Kuwait the last caller with each other man oh man anybody that believes that joke so aware of it has a four year of a chance\nYou know I think he's got a rare chance I don't think he's the idol ...\nI don't think so at all I don't I don't think that ... percent\n...\nAnd unfortunately we don't have a a system that says you're gotta get fifty percent fifty point one percent or should it should be aware because that's what we should act or or going to get us another\nThrough yeah ... that's going to be changed you out and I said governor or\nI'm going to get you know we're going to get another one my you're right you're gonna get another one you're going to get another one and it's going to be and and it's it's going to be a second term minority elected governor is was undergoing what I think's going to happen Charlie's income ...
