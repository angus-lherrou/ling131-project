to be kids going to be carried out you gotta you gotta walk the talk\nUm and what we have to do as Americans is stop looking to them for our attitudes about each other\nThat's number one so I'm looking at each other as individuals rather than members of tribes that someone else stuck us in\nThat's one of the major things I think that we have to we have to return to or at least get to in this country\nNow my phone numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI all the political divide in our country is in the we've been talking about all morning um\n[noise] you know I don't know whether or not the political divide was something that's responsible for this ah for motivating this this mail bomb situation I've no idea\nBut I figured you might as well use it as an opportunity to have a conversation that's important to have we've had many times in the ... of the ... the show over and over and over again because it's gotten I think that uh with the advent of Donald Trump both the things that he's created but also\nUm has also reflected have gotten worse\nUh I think the reaction to him has made it worse I think he's made it worse I think we've all made it worse to a certain extent we all have to take responsibility not blame or responsibility for it to stop it because\nWe all have to recognize that we have it pretty damn good here not all of us but the vast majority of us do\nAnd it can get much you can be much worse\nAnd so uh you know babies and bath water don't get thrown out the window here you understand what I'm saying\nI

had wanted to address to him but I think it was it was it was a wrong address so you actually get sent back to the return address which was the office of\nA of a I'm Debbie Wasserman Schultz so she got it\nUm\nAnd so and and I think that obviously people are on the lookout for all over the country and why pd had a press conference earlier today\nI'm just get everybody up to speed if you're just joining us this portion of Adam ... sponsored by Providence auto body certified by more manufacturers in any of the ... center in Rhode Island and there's a Honda accurate pro first collision repair facility now I'm always the first one to tell you we should wait and find out what the motivation is for something like this before we start talking about policy um reforms and all this other stuff but\nIn this case you know ... ... assuming that there is a political motivation of some kind here because of the people who are targeted a or we set these things are I've been talking about the political dialogue just mostly as an awkward just because it's what people think about it and give me an opportunity to talk about something that's important no matter what somebody said pipe bombs or not\nUm\nThis is important conversation I had to think irrelevant as to whether or not a ... regardless and use that word you get Israel where by the way it's in a regular in the dictionary look it up regardless of whether or not whether or not there is a um this is a political motivated politically motivated thing here\nYou know some right wing nuts sending somebody at these people pipe bombs or some left wing nut trying to send people pipe bombs were owner of the reasons or whatever it is\nUm the ability\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the here for only one Ninety nine broth will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty so desperate for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at flood forward and essentially Narragansett\nLeave the rest of us alone and\nAh for the people for them for us to put their voice and its proper context in ... in proportion is something we need to get better at because I Do not believe that the lack of due to get the most time in our media and in our lives\nAnd and ... live rent free in our brains as a result of social media which I think is a hyper during the needle that injects this stuff into the political bloodstream um we need to stop the we need to put these people into perspective social media cable news channels they've become fun house mirrors\nThey don't accurately reflect our realities and I think that not only the difference between what happens is when people watch the warped reality of cable news media or or the ... reality of Facebook and Twitter\nThey think that there's something out there that they're not aware of what can encroaching doom or an encroaching dark shadow over the over the horizon that's about to land in their front door steps and so they go into a fight mode\nAnd I think we need to talk start telling it some of these people have made their way into the mainstream folks I warn you about the progressive than the state I think our verging on that fringe level depending on the person\nAnd\nSome of this nonsense this constant it comes to you know some people have referred to it as a um as a post modern philosophy that's invaded academia which then translates into our politics\nWhich is a philosophy that says that basically says that there's that at all most of reality is is all about perception and because you can have a perception of a million different ways\nAh about reality then that means that there is no such thing as a reality that reality is just whatever you make it is it you can't have that you can't have a society that builds itself\nOn ... unreality that's ... it's malleable\nBecause what's real today needs to be real tomorrow\nOr if you're going to shift what's real it better be damned well good reason for it and it better be because there is a hard evidence that something is different and if you don't do that and if you have something that the shifting plates of reality always in political realities social reality whatever it is you're going to have constant earthquakes\nYou understand what I'm saying you can't have it you can't have people you can't build anything on shifting ground\nAnd that's what we have perfect example of it today this ridiculous TMZ story that came out about this guy who's running for attorney general in Rhode Island I don't know what the news stories there\nThere's a couple of interesting things that happened but I don't know what the story is I mean the big thing was that ... aging candidate uses the N. word he didn't use the N word he spelled the N. word out and making a comparison between the word marijuana he says what she says is racist\nTo using the N. word it was not used in the ... the intent was not to be racist the intent was to make a racist comparison which I think is fundamentally stupid\n\nWe have to start and this this should not even at the fact that it rice is the level of people that actually take it seriously is to me an example of what we're talking about here\n\nOkay doesn't mean that he can't say it doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to say it doesn't mean you can't run for office and say what he's got to say about it but you're not going to change the meaning of widely held meanings I should say of words\nAnd then pretend to be offended or assume or create an offense where none was intended and ... and say that it doesn't matter if it was intended or not the offense is contained in the word it's the most fundamentally corrupt stupid way of looking at the world\nThe way I could do is on the left are trying to do it to Megan Kelly right now because she talked about dressing up as black people during Halloween and saying that it wasn't\nRacist to do so because she mentioned the word black face as a as a as a ... a synonym for dressing up as somebody who happens to be black and\n... that's ... automatically racist and that she offended black people by saying that just shut up already enough\nThe intent is where the fence lies the word itself is not a spell it's not a magical incantation we stop this nonsense please the shifting ground underneath us is not a way you can't build\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred free on cars always all models and incredible prices log on to flood auto John jobs now\nCalled me this now because you know otherwise you're a big it no wrong not true\nCan't happen\nSociety doesn't work that way we all get a vote on language\n\nAnd you don't get to determine what you ... you have decided to be or you can determine what you find offensive you don't get to determine what everybody finds it offensive sorry next go back to the corner from once you came good luck\nBodies and ward Bonnie WPRI Bonnie Hi how you doing today thank you how are you okay um\nI agree a hundred percent with what you're saying a few years ago I remember a professor was giving\nA lecture at one of the ivy league college is used the word nigger late right which has nothing to do with race means eight people or you know right now that it would be ... or early\nAnd the word I Believe it I just was just having this conversation with somebody and we looked at the etymology etymology entomology entomologist bugs right always get those two computers\nOf the word and it comes from I think like ancient England and that has nothing to do with anybody's race or anything else it well it was it did the word is ... and I think it has roots in Latin and healthy as if you know\nWell one of his students didn't understand it and accused him of racism and he ended up getting fired and I couldn't believe it she was still it that she didn't even bother to look it up and don't want along the line must be told or look at it didn't matter\nAnd well listen here's the thing is it that ignorance is not stupidity I'm sure the person with a person might have been smart and the person might have of haven't been able to but just to know right and so rather than say listen this doesn't have a racial overtone to it the university vows to the the Twitter mob\nOf the time about what are they only right and they don't ask those that are encouraging right is that and they all get hosted in their open tarred by the way it it just a matter of time it's just a matter of anti ... and now it's oh yeah but I mean eventually\nThey'd all comes the chickens come home to roost because to become so absurd
