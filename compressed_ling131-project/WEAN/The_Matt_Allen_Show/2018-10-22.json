I'm as you get a false sense of security if you focus on him and say well if we get rid of him now we're going to be safe um that's just not the case\nThat is true that is true which will be safer nobody's ever ...\nIt's beyond it's beyond um\nListen\nYou have to determine what level of safe we're talking about here right that's a dead Steven Brian from the ACLU talking to ... earlier today\nA talking about the situation with the the child rapist is living in Providence right now married over the weekend\nPeople actually went to the wedding that's unbelievable to me um\nBut to sit there for the ACLU to ... it's got this week they did this weird like fence riding thing where they're trying to\nEnlist the walking the line or you know that their job in in general although they've been talking about not having this kind of position anymore or in terms of when it comes to hate groups\nUm what they're trying to speak up about the way the government reacts individuals or I Would imagine in in in a way this is the this is looking at them in the most favorable light okay\nI'm In order that these types of policies that is their philosophy in general is whatever you do in the worst case scenario would then eventually become the norm and you'll do it to other people\nSo in other words if we allow for protesters to be outside people's homes when their child rapist then it's just a matter of time before we allow them when there's somebody who you know believes that one man one woman is what marriage is\nA and so you know that kind of thing so I can understand it\nBut when you're dealing with an acute issue like this you know they're treated they put out the other day about don't demonize which it's time to stop demonizing sexual predators I mean\nI don't I don't tell you if we do we stop demonizing sexual predators that's when I\nI'm done sorry there are some things that you just do those lines it will now I Will not cross that's not aligned with across that will never stop it shouldn't uh this is an issue that neighborhood is in danger\nMore so now because\nThey have a known predator living amongst them that they didn't have before and so while it was never a hundred percent safe because nobody ever is it's now less than that before that it it was before\nSo you know telling somebody to get out of getting somebody out of that neighborhood mitigate the danger can't lie about that and say it's not the case is the case Bob's more above your WPRI about\nHey man good um state should look at um\nThe Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai he a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition and what for Denise religion they're against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John John now\nBack out on the street again although ... street again it should have to agree to cash creation\nChemical Castro Asian yeah ... ... says I Know that there's a lot of voluntary how they do yeah I Know that this is a voluntary thing when I was looking up you know therapies I just I Do the one that said you know other therapies that work for these people and there are some things that you know they're just you know support groups and as you know the shock therapy literally\nUm in terms of giving people negative physical responses ... urges and things and it it it's not that great and and they do do that they actually go ahead and depending on the kind of person you're talking about this all depending on the kind of the motivation for why they did what they did\n\nI Know but the idea that you know because I get overall as a society right\nThat most people if you are impacted by some sort of predator will be somebody that you know\nAnd so therefore the odds that there'll be somebody that you know is something you have to be more concerned with the overall that is however until you get noticed that the dude moved in next door and then the priorities have changed\nThe the danger has gone to the top of the list especially somebody who'd done it three times and uh as far as I Know I think that's that's the only ones I Know about three times has been convicted spent Thirty years in prison for it\nAnd is has been labeled as a state of message by the state of Massachusetts as somebody who's likely to do it again\nSo\nThis is a different circumstance this is an overall overarching policy no granted you talking about the city they're talking about overall policies and being consistent which is always important but you know once in a while there are things that happened that that caused us to look at acute issues rather than things as a whole\nRight\nAnd I'm sure the ACLU supports all sorts of political maneuverings out there that deal with a you know they deal with policies based on a cute issues\nI think a gun control being one of them\nOh this doesn't happen over all across the country but it happens one time here so therefore we have to change the entire university so I mean it it all depends on your political proclivities seems to me that you know I'm a bipartisan way to look at it as that sexual predators are bad for society\nI'm fairly certain that that's something that both sides of any I can agree on and so wild vis a you know this this this bill might not be able to be on wrong we can stop other bills in the future for being wrong\nI'm hoping Mike's in Providence Mike you're on WPRI Mike\nOh well good but this whole situation will watch ... D a y ... um\nI was born in ... white grow up I was ... ... over the late Eighteen eighty one\nUm I was somewhat of a ... while I was on my bike white was one of the house the ... well I can remember

on your on your situation because\nIt it all sits makes sense um but I'll tell you what it's bizarre it's the whole thing is bizarre it's somebody would like evidently according to channel tend to

probably will do it again you know [noise] [noise]\n\nYou know oh there are some people like I said the people that that um\nPeople who know this about in in an individual any individual and get continue to be around them or continue to you know to to engage with other men marry the guy I don't know what\nI really don't get it I don't get it really is beyond me and it's one of those things that it's just I\nI don't [laughter] I just sitting here I'm trying there are a lot of things that if you can understand where somebody's\nComing from you may be able to put yourself in a position where you can you probably never be there but you can see how they got there you know sometimes if you're really open\nBut this is one of those I Can't get I just wanted to just you know it's beyond the pale for me and and this is the fact that people went to a wedding\nI I mean\nI don't know what the standards are any more for people I really don't unity standards in your life you know this is part of this demented um cultural shift we've had in this country where where it's almost like you if you have any standard that all the big thing when I was younger and I say younger my college years was there'll be judgmental\nWere saying oh you're very judgmental\nIt was like a thing that if you weren't judgmental and you gave nobody any crap or doing whatever it is they want to do it any time they wanted to do you are the best guy right you are the best person 'cause you're still open to everything and I and I never understood that [laughter]\nI never got it was like if you're open to anything then you have no standards you know standard definition if you're everything then you're nothing technically\nYou know you're just like this big uh you know moral blob that just has no sides to it and there's no way to define you you have no deaf you literally have no definition both physically and morally\nRight so that's ... it's really bizarre\nSo you ... the idea of you know not judging anybody know judge everybody by what they do you judge them for the right\nThings they make decisions based on things that they can help then it's fair game as far as I'm concerned\nIf it's something that they can control the decisions they've made based on something they can control then great judge accordingly and is this isn't even\nAbout a decision in terms of condemning a person for being evil or not evil or whatever there's just whatever it would be people who are predators like there's a dark there's the darkness around them some of them actually will admit that and some of them all actually say I don't like that part of me I Wish it didn't V. there and all that stuff and at that point it's like yeah sorry you're broken\nAnd what do you feel bad about it or not you can't control it so we got a ... it's like a it's a turning into werewolf\nYou know you're like in throw you in a cage because what else are we gonna do\nNot your fault no but you know what you're not going to get any of us\n[noise] so that's it\nAnd you know for me this is one of those things and this is not a black and white issue and it's not something that you can sit there and easily put in a little box outside of the fact that having sexual predators live amongst us is not good\nAnd so why these people ever get out of cages should be the next question on our mind not whether or not the mayor should or can can enforce a targeted a protest in somebody's neighborhood later how about this how about we all agree to go with what we agree with\nAnd said from now on if you're a child rape is you don't get out of jail\n\nOr a law that says you know I'm no constitutional expert but law that says if you are a labeled as likely to re offend you don't get out of jail\nYou don't get too sorry\nWas

offer up ulterior motives you know some uh you know nonsensical\n... my favorite was Rob is they always get the D. E. M. press releases about dumping gas down somewhere or something they're dumping which\nWe've talked about before or can block it's some kind of a personal vendetta\nIt's amazing never the fact that no there's actually just wrong that that we get taxed to death we get we get we pay a ton of money and things are just not supposed to happen\nAnd so you're not supposed to do that you're not supposed to do it\nAnd people are supposed to be able to have an opinion on what you spend the money on and whether or not the ... I mean this is the fact that even can block is telling me that he's got to go through and go through these these machinations to get contracting language that they study the ability for people to have a copy of the collective bargaining agreement it's unbelievable to me\nAnd I swear to you there are other places where that kind of thing is okay you go no problems the later it is what it is\n\nBut it around here it's like let's just Boston everybody's chops 'cause that's what we do I want you to think about the about the ... the culture met\nMust exist in the city a war where people will make what in the midst of this where they you know the heat is on basically for around this issue surrounding this issue and there are people out there who are literally in the midst of it like you know there's two guys rod Cody and ... and can block I'm sure other people but\nI mean they're they're the vocal faces of this whole thing because they've been on top of it and ... all of a sudden can blocks business gets gets visited by the fire inspector because of an anonymous tip about\nEmergency lighting\nNow you think about that and you think about that kind of\nA permissive environment that has to be that's going to be it's going to be offered up that exists in the cities where somebody thinks that can do that and or is going to do that I'm thinks it does it\nAnd basically believes there's going to be zero ramifications for it because it probably will be zero ramifications for it\n\nAnd that's allowed it's expected people I've had people on your Facebook page and people out there good government people supposedly can't take the heat get out of the kitchen\nLook this is just assume\nYeah if you could start to question the expenditures of a city a government you should definitely expect harassment because that's the way we do business around here because we're all want to be mobsters\n[laughter] you know\nWhy not what's next get those ones lots on their candy bar you\nBoth twenty ten and twenty fourteen when I ran for office I well I had to put one flats on my car yeah because I ended up with a flat tires more free and then never get flat tires except when I'm running for office amazing um you know and I may put the run flash back on now\nAnd the sign was left up at the immaculate conception church he has the story from Charleston we'll talk about\nWas a sign that sat in part of the what's really community\nFeels very cards and on well some\nSome members of the macular conception church last Saturday and then was held in honor of our lady found them to parishioners brought to the church and put it on the front lawn signs reading God's marriage equals one man and one woman it was supposed to be\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood Otto John jobs now\nWe believe is divinely inspired by the Bible and taught by the Catholic Church\nHas every right to put whenever he wants on its property and that Cindy sat uncomfortable but some residents [laughter]\nSunny Sunday wall somewhere in church [laughter]\nThere's Ronald comedy the Bible\nTeaches law in general so I think that overall message is more important than anything else\nThere is a Sundays rally say instead of reacting with hate in their hearts they has compassion [laughter] the algae community\nThen why at about most is I actually have come out\nRight ... thank you for high\nEnd westerly Sam Reed and ... they think it's a\nConcept to hear that that that I kinda sticks in my craw a little bit biased against peace protest people do their thing whatever and they matched beechwood speech and not going to complain about it too much but the thing that bothers me the most is that this automatic and it also takes away the word the power from the word\nIs that when you say one thing that's not in line with what most people believe what some people believe that it's automatically hate\n\nSaying that marriage is between the God says the marriages between a man or woman is not hate\nJust not hate\nYou we can't we if we're going to live together if anybody if we have any desire to live together as human beings\nOther people's opinions that unless they're expressed that you know I hate this [laughter]\nYou know I hate you or I hate this ... you know they did it just there's some things that are hate and some things that aren't and\nBy the way the law is the law the Supreme Court ruled as a matter of fact before the Supreme Court ruled the state of Rhode Island passed the law through a better option as far as I'm concerned through the legislative ah through legislation\nAnd made gay marriage legal so guess what this church can say whatever the heck he wants it does it matter according to the law and when\nIt comes to enforcing people's rights are doing what they are giving people the right to do what they want to do the law matters more than a sign on a church\nThe law is the authority which by the way one of the beautiful things about this country right\nThe church is about your oriented yourself correctly to the world to take on the world and to to to have spiritual growth and health and whatever in whatever way you determine that you think you should and the laws about\nSaying people have to be treated equally and that can change with time whatever and it changed in Rhode Island to mean that people who are gay can get married\nNow\nYou know there's a difference between changing the law in changing everybody's mind just like there's a difference between you know equality of access or equality of opportunity versus the quality of outcome you it's a it seems to me to\nBe a fool's errand and counterproductive to think that you're going to change someone's mind and heart and religious beliefs with a with a with a rally now that's you know they have a right to do it and whatever I'm just saying but calling people who have a different point of view than you\nFull of hate you\nKnow there's got to be able to be a middle ground here where we just say yeah okay me too many times I've gone by something and seeing the sign you know could be\nUp any political side I mean I just started a thousand of selection seasons if those are there are people out there why seek their political ideologies\nLiterally um the antithesis of productivity and freedom and liberty and I go by they see the signs on like a\nDirty rats what's wrong with with Iraq\nAnd so I don't know it seems to me that ... ... it's it's bizarre it's just weird thing where we refuse to recognize the progress the state of Rhode Island before the Supreme Court ruled already put gay marriage in the legal column\nSo and there were what how many people do they say in that story well I don't know\nHow would you like motor trends twenty gene trucks
