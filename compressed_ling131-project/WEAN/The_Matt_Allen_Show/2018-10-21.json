K. C. Lincoln him getting actual linking him Casey and the only twenty eight Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nThirty points thirty eight and of course forty three and when it gets Kansas City all federal aid seems like you guys are getting into rhythm is that fair to say\nI'm well we'll see you know last week last week but um hopefully we can we can put some points on the board\nTo run again line of scrimmage a the ability of the offensive line was Dante and I've and opens up the passing game for you guys sort of complementary football they're not fence\nYeah absolutely nothing better than being able to handle the ball and they get solid games and not being as long as the situations I'm like we were in uh the Jacksonville in Detroit game so hopefully we can avoid that\nI'd onto a Chicago here and talk to you this week about ... and of course his relationship with Andy Reid offensively when you watch them I Know the quarterback for a little bit different little more athletic quarterback this week with the legs but how much the Kansas City help your preparation for Chicago here today\nOr some I mean they're they're both those all fences or west coast based and I'm a so that that helps us a little bit but I think the main thing for us is going to be similar to some of these other teams that we play just they do a good job of getting the\nBall outside inside the short so we're going to have the good team defense all the way across the board they don't just do one thing\nSpeaking to the defense Dante high tear up front of your front seventies communication positioning of guys that type of game he played last week on partners that today with the amount of motion and stuff they run specially with these two backs\nYeah really big it's um that's what we see a lot of his formation and especially with this team lotta formation emotions or some new looks and thought has got a lot of experience\nAnd he's very um smart players these things quickly communicates well so it's good to have him out there and directing traffic\nAbout participate in how's he developed you know obviously what the eagles you know you're sort of second or third federal they're kind of nice contract goes to Chicago as far as this down field catching the bill needle I'll throw it some don't film all day\nYeah definitely a good speed and um he's really a a a receiver plan tied to um plays a big athletic guy that they can make plays a down the family is very good at following his hands kind of like Kelsey last week or so he can take a short run turn into a big play a as well as you get down the field and get behind the defense\nPast six games they seem to stress safety is you know getting two guys vertical the rubber outs the will routes help or just communication and back and specially with them according brothers and Dana Iran and Patrick\nYeah that they've gotten a they've made a lot of big plays this year and now they do good job of I'm scheming and the guys in positions\nThat are attacked the defense\nAnd so a wolf to a good job of making sure we have all the bases covered back there because with a Gabriel I'm certainly Robinson burden a colon uh they got a lot of Miller I got a lot of guys that can get the ball down the field they like to throw the um so it will be tested on that several times that I Am sure\nBecause the guy gets to go to especially in the kick returned game fair to say\nYeah very fast athletic he's been a big play guy forum um go to the ball is hands very hard to tackle very loose a player\nOr we've talked about Mac and I know it's a game time decision what the ankle you'd probably expect him to go as everybody else but combination of immature baby on the line backer Iran a port is that for them to seven and how you got to combat their speed\nMacs a very disruptive player a because the defensive player of the month last month so he's got a lot of plays a negative placed\nOn tackles for laws tipped balls sacks interceptions cause mumbles A L course plane next to ... those two guys are really disruptive so we've got to do the job of handling them and take care of all\nAlready played this building before it gets me to talk of Donetsk watching the weight comes can push facility\nSouth Weymouth um some of these venues you go to this new stadiums and whatnot but the old a soldier field is is a guilt fares are facing today Walter Payton but how much is a coach you get a chance to go on and I see out there with your son's prior to the game and sort of taking the type a facade like this building has\nYeah it's pretty special place um it's almost a hundred years old and it's been seen a lot of great football games so college and professional so um yeah it's got great history to it uh the new stadium really pretty much sits inside\nThe old soldier field facade so there's not a doesn't really look the same but I'm the outside structure certainly
