up at midnight starts work again but this was this is the way that he should use Twitter already because it's simply putting words\nThat words in their own words from their own mount yep yep and it's simply says I agree with President Obama\nOne hundred percent\nAnd simply this bit of audio and video but this audio for you since you're listening to radio from President Obama\nVery generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who enter the country illegally and those who have fought them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently do generally unlawfully did become immigrants in this country\nThere you go that mess it up I agree with President Obama one hundred percent\nUh you know we talked about this earlier with the caravan of slowly moving across Mexico won't be here and time for the uh for for the election if if they ever ah you know get to the border in any type of organized fashion at all if that ever happens they're stopping of bookies in Mexico city that's going to take a few minutes um\nBut as we've said this is the time\nA couple of weeks before the election to take it to the Democrats to say this is the Democrats now for the Democrats still believe this this is the time to challenge the Democrat leadership\nAnd say you keep talking comprehensive immigration reform but you never tell us what you what I Believe and so to the American people that you wide open borders if you don't want to open borders well then come to the table and tell me specifically mhm\nWhat type of enforcement you will put\nOn the border if you want to plant and we've talked about the various plans everything from citizenship to amnesty which would be citizenship to legal status without being able to vote right\nIf you got that then what level of border enforcement would you guarantee the American public please be public and tell me we are willing to keep the door open are you willing to talk or is it like we all believe\nThat your party is the party of open borders and if you are the party of open borders have the guts\nTo sell that to the American people or attempt to sell that to the American people and that's what I think the president should say if he's already halfway there with this yeah you're now and and by the way you can you can get him you can get Feinstein how many oh yeah hello see right\nNow that I was literally over the last Twenty years at San exactly like Donald Trump does on illegal immigration right exactly why he does make the comparison hit them hard you've got the bully pulpit as you know the press pays attention to everything that you say hey is depressed\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nJust what they why aren't you questioned them about why they think what they think now what they thought then why don't\nYou why why don't you ask them if they want to open border it's the same kind of positioning by the way I I Would do this during a debate of course the president's not going to be debating only went for a couple of years but I Would do this if I'm a candidate I Would do this on a debate stage\nWith my opponent if I'm a Republican candidate I Would be doing this with uh with with any of them I Would be I Would say you don't want to I go to the moderator I'll you'll my time if I could just ask you ask my opponent what they believe the level of been forced me to the borders should be\nTelling me what level of enforcement do you believe in closing the borders altogether sealing the borders\nAnd only letting a limited number of people end that's basically what we have no I mean it's not sealed we have porous borders but do you believe we should enforce the borders or not because there is no\nHalf measure in my opinion there is no half measure so either you believe in open borders or you know been forced right\nAnd it's about time after Thirteen Years\nThirteen Years we were talking about a McCain Kennedy\nWhen that went down to defeat Thirteen Years ago and the Republicans still have not been able to back the Democrats into the corner to make them feel so uncomfortable to challenge them to scare them to tell the American people and don't stop it you have the potential over the next week I Know the early voting is happening but there's still a lot of votes to still be counted\nTo make immigration illegal immigration the number one issue again\nYep [noise]

income alone despairing higher tax burden and wealthier residents so I went to the source\nI'm speaking with racial slum who is the executive director of the economic Congress Institute ritual about this uh study that you've done analysis that you've done it looks to I don't know if you call it you know quality you hold on\n[noise] yeah so this is actually a report that was done by our national partners Institute on taxation and economic policy\nAnd there's just released today and what it does is really calculates that um the total state and local taxes at a taxpayer pays and then calculate that effective tax rate that they are paying as a percentage their income on and what it scientists that unfortunately\nAnd forty five of the states and here in Rhode Island are lower income residents are paying more other percentage of their uh their income in taxes than the highest earners are\nAnd you think it's just a matter of the way he touches a structure to sing\n[noise] yes and so what what we would and what this study shows is that we essentially had regressive tax structure which means that the more ah ah ah taxes the higher percentage of your income they are paying taxes um it hired as the lower your income is\nSo for folks earning less than Twenty one thousand seven hundred dollars a year they're paying an effective tax rate of twelve percent for those earning on over forty four hundred and sixty seven thousand dollars that effective tax rate is about eight percent\nUm and so you know there has been work done over the years to improve our tax structure and that we still have some work to do and we think you know at this time especially when a higher income\nRhode Island ... and tax break from the federal tax changes that it's um a good time to make some of them even more changes\nWill some might say the two of to soak the rich but I mean you should more than just huh\n[noise] yeah I mean we would say that all of us who are paying taxes are benefiting from the goods and services at those taxes on a foreigner so our schools our roads and bridges\nOn my public parks and beaches and so it's really unfair to have that are lower income folks bearing more of a burden for those services that we all enjoy 'em and we do think that at this\nPoint in time especially that the wealthier are better able to help pay for um a larger percentage of those services\nWould seem real islands truly conservative stated I don't know just the seemed likely that the general simply Mike along with some of the lungs huh\nWell we did have legislation introduced last year and we did seats in support of it\nI'm from the Senate side and you know I think that um there's another federal tax cut cutting down the pike and and at the same time there is\nConcern around um [noise] the the continuation of federal and support for programs such as medicate and others and so the state is going to need to come up with some ways to continue to support those programs um if we end up facing some federal tax\nCuts I mean some federal cuts for benefit programs\nThat we think it's a good time to have that conversation I'm you know folks may differ on what that does change it should look like that we think we should at least be engaging in a conversation about it\nSeems a little less than likely would happen this year before the election probably afterwards\nWell

[laughter] you're probably catching up on your beauty runs\nI can say is I blame you I mean the game was ending just as I got up this one\nFriend Jim Graves filmmaker and founder of the world war two foundation is bringing a small piece of the sunken USS Arizona to the world war two foundations to global education center now in development in South kings town spoke about it with my colleague WPRI rose pausing Gary\nYeah we're really honored to have it it's it's something that the United States Navy and the folks\nAt Pearl Harbor decided on um you go through a process and they determine if your organization um should get a piece of the Arizona and we just established a new world war two foundation global education center and I met all their criteria so\nThere'll be sending out a five foot by five foot part of the Arizona and we'll have it on permanent display at the new facility and in South kings down so it's it's a huge honor for us\nAnd the funny thing is when you mentioned uh Rhode Island and the fact that the actual piece of the Arizona that's being sent here is is being packed up by members of the CDs which some awfully strong robot one connection\nThere's always a Rhode Island connection with with with anything in the world with anything in the world um when we heard that the the bees were the ones who would do the packing and actually do the cutting of the piece off of the\nUm structure of the super structure of the Arizona which is now located on Ford Island um as soon as we talk to the CBs based in Hawaii we said you know this is the birthplace\nOf what you guys do now and they all knew the history of Davis villain quants it so really to have the CBs involved in in cutting this piece of the Arizona from superstructure packing it up and and shipping it is really a I think just a tribute to to Rhode Island's own role in World War two now\nThe section of the Arizona it's actually you know to to send these who was here was something that was removed from the ship quite some time ago wasn't\nRight after the attack the super structure of the Arizona and other parts of the of the battleship or removed\nUm as the excavation and search for bodies and everything was going on and and um it was what was left on the top of the ship was moved over to Ford Island and since Nineteen Ninety four the navy and Pearl Harbor um have accepted requests from organizations like ours\nAre that if you would like a piece of the Arizona that display um that's that's where it would come from so when we got the approval um it just it'll be a first of its kind here in southern New England and I just hope people come in and look at it and realize\nYou know this is where World War two began for the United states and that eleven hundred and Seventy seven sailors Marines died on the ship on December seventh Nineteen forty one and in over the next\nFour years the United states was involved over four hundred thousand Americans are passed away or killed in action and and everything else so this this piece of the Arizona really represents America's entry into the war and and ground zero for where the United states got involved in World War two\nYou know my own personal connection to the Arizona isn't that a a Nineteen year old soon we're from Providence was getting ready to go to mass on the Arizona but wound up under attack on the Tennessee and survived it became my dad and later on but uh [laughter] it's crazy the way things work in war\nYeah I mean right right now there are only five USS Arizona survivors who are still alive\nAnd uh eleven hundred Seventy seven died that day and over nine hundred of them are still in tuned on the battleship they were never recovered so what you see now when you go to Pearl Harbor um is is the remnants of the Arizona but everything above um was was taken off\nA after the attack so it's really a it's a memorial to mix a grave site a today with with those nine hundred men still into done on the battleship and again only five left and we've had the pleasure of\nMeeting the survivors and interviewing them over the last few years and and really when you think about it um they were they were there at the beginning and uh it's it's probably the most famous\nUm ship and United States history and and not for a lot of great reasons uh but but when people talk about it or people mentioned the USS Arizona everybody knows what the Arizona isn't it takes people back to December seventh Nineteen forty one\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve for your own condition and what board and he's really Janeiro or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices log on to flood Otto John calm now\nThat's Arizona and that served as a rallying cry for Americans during World War two they they want to revenge against the Japanese and wanted to win the war because of what happened at Pearl Harbor and what happened to the crude Arizona\nDidn't tell me about the display where you're going to have used to be our zone\nWe have a new world war two foundation global education center and said things down and ... and it's um it's about a twenty two hundred square foot\nFacility that combines what we do with your documentary films I'm with the artifacts of World War two\nWe have a library we have a theater what we're trying to do is get students in and try and introduce them to the personal stories of the men women the soldiers and survivors of World War two\nAnd we we do that through the ways that students learn today which is very unusual and tactile and and being able to touch things and hold things and hear the sounds and\nSo it's really a multimedia a effort to try and make sure that future generations understand what these men and women did what they sacrifice and that what they went through during that time period is is never forgotten\nSo we're excited it's it's kind of the next step for our foundation we've just done today you know Twenty one films but this brings everything into a very um\nIs your will visual place where students can come and actually you know the the artifacts and know that age artifact represents personal story from the war\nWhen will we be able to go see and touch it we're going to um we've we've waited twelve years for this and so we're we're we're we're trying to hold off\nTill we get everything right there probably by the end of November beginning of December will will start to open up for for schools and then shortly after that

free advice if\nI always loved this doing this show because one of the best things\nAre all the listeners that listen to the show and then sometimes they call in because they have solutions themselves about things they've done or they think of something to read about something in in in the they do that you that we have someone on the line no right now who's a\nWho's into that and her name is Joey in from ... uh she wants to talk a little bit about the dream vices illusions yes good morning Julian how are you\nGood morning Tony I had a terrible problem with them ... and I did all those with the vinegar and Saran Wrap it in the online yet not where I finally went over to like to value nearby and\nNinety nine or nine dollars and change they had these little they looked like either that little tomatoes are that'll apples but their plastic right with a with a little green thing in the top ... and actually\nThe ... the liquid then it comes with when you open it you can spell the apples tighter than that but I put one by I think and they tell you to leave him thirty days right and I mean I had a really bad infestation of them and then they're still on my counters because it hasn't been thirty days but they've been cleaning go on for like at least two weeks already\nSo my suggestion is that you go through your kitchen cabinets and look for something\nA lot of times it's this time of year it's maybe the oatmeal from last year that we've got to get thrown out or or packages like that maybe even booed and things that you bought for baking back then and didn't use it all up and you know we normally talk that stuff and pick it up and put it on the top cabinet a run in the top shelf away from everything\nAnd that's all go through your cabinet strip everything down fraud anything that's been in there awhile anything you don't want to throw out save a in the refrigerator or put them in the last jobs or Tupperware a rubber making payments those heavy plastic things because\nThese little worms can actually chew through um a little bits of cardboard and plastic in cellophane okay so um once you've done that you've emptied everything got washed out in the cabinet is good with whatever you normally clean with don't buy anything special wash the cabinets down\nAnd then when they dry you can spray those cabinets the cracks and crevices where the shelves in the walls meat in with or something like you can go to Home Depot and Lowe's and buy one of the ...\nProducts that are um uh made like and also product or a bad product a rate of raid were due to reading through the cracks and crevices ... once said dries you're able to put yourself back him\nOkay fine thank you so much\nWell All right thank you so much Joan our phone numbers here for three eight WPRI

year even for the holiday baking it's the or the wall and lots of the almonds are maybe flower that was on sale and you bought two bags 'cause it was\nBy one and get one half price and you bought a ticket and you didn't use it all in normally when you have that stuff you don't use every day\nYou put it up on your top shelves you don't you don't pay attention to it and it's up there could be dried flew a fruit I mean and don't be surprised at sometimes if you bought something at a store recently but you didn't check the expiration date\nAnd he it was very close to expiring or is there are already expired sometimes and now you're by that and then you bring it home and believe it or not of those little worms and the eggs of those things in Greece\nRhode Island's number one Ford dealer is
