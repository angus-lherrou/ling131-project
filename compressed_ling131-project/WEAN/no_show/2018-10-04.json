him to make any kind of impact as we ripped through some of these\nNo I don't I think that uh you know you do have to look at a body of work and you know gone are the days now that's pass happy league where\nIf they were running batches ended up getting a a decent amount of carries you would be a viable option I that's just not the case anymore I feel like\nWhat you really need out of running backs and you know will come ... streaming running back is guys who play it in the passing game guys it to play a role in the passing game so\nYou know as much as you don't want to roll out if you predict or in Austin at color and you\nKnow in certain cases the James White to me those are the kind of guy that you need as your by week filling in for the black spots as opposed to ah you know a guy like Robert turban and there are several civil ...\nGuys out there you know out for Morris type guys that are are just going to grind out a few yards but the upside is so severely limited you just don't want them\nMark Ingram of the saints what do you do with him in fantasy if you have options\nIt's a it's a really tough one to call grass have to say I don't think you can overlook the fact that late last season\nCamaro really took over that job from Ingram ... role in more limited and limited\nAs that sees him on on I certainly think that ... somebody to own and fantasy I feel like he's more of a match up play he's certainly not a a every week starter certainly not now when it's only the buccaneers and the bears on by we cared a week five I think as the by we start to kick in and we start to get a better feel\nFor or you know what Ingram will end up being what his role ended up being you know he average Eighteen touches a game over the course of last season I kind of see that number of being maybe a little more half that or this season I I think he's going to be closer to ten eleven twelve touches per game\nIt really comes down to is he going to get the goal line touches and if he does\nI think he has a potential to maybe be a top twenty five maybe even borderline top twenty Fannie running back but I Would not expect that much more than that I think you have to ah\nSee what you have on your roster and where you need to buy weeks villains and if it's a good spot for a row and a good spot for the same thing he rolling out there but they do\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nToo many opportunities where you're going to be able to start mark Ingram with a lot of confidence as we get into the thick of the season with the by weeks and you also have New Orleans by week coming up uh after week five they've got a ... a week six by so\nIt uh I I really don't see too many spots for him but he should be on your roster certainly the handcuffs and maybe a little more as we get a sense of what the balance is going to be in the carriers\nAnd playing Edelman this week if you're an element owner and been waiting\nI think you do grass I really I don't think it's a wait and see type approach right he's coming off a suspension not an injury so there's not that worry that maybe he's not a fully a hundred percent\nUm you know I Would start Edelman who you know I'll give you some comparable guys you might be deciding between I I'd start 'em over like Devin fun just sterling Sheppard ah to marry a St Thomas and guys like that I'm not quite him over a higher upside players\nAnd by that I I'm Talking about guys like Cory Davis coming off of big game John Brown he's been a a vital part of that ravens passing off and that should be a high scoring game against the browns\nTitled Boyd is a a legitimate fantasy option now they're going against the dolphins and Calvin Ridley of course what he's done over the past couple of weeks if those are my decisions between Edelman I start\nCorey Davis or John Brown Boyd originally but the lower upside guys that I mentioned before I pull out Edelman over any of those guys\nYou know you mentioned Corey Davis and Calvin Ridley how close are they to becoming every week starters or are you still playing the match up game with those guys\nI think that every week starters I think for two distinct reasons I think ... is an every week started because\nThat is a very slow team and the slow off and and he is the speed he's the plane maker in that office and to me they're just going to continue to figure out ways to get them the ball was almost like a eureka moment you almost needed them be down as much as they were in that game\nTo decide All right well we don't have any choice here let's get a two hour really one and only play an acre with\nAn office that really was always running through the lady Walker as long as Marcus Mariel to has been there with Walker out for the season to me it's going to be Davis that going to be getting nine ten eleven targets a week and I think he's in every week started with Ridley the falcons are so banged up defensively\nAh especially in the secondary that they're just not going to be able to stop many other teams from scoring and because of that\nThey're going to be playing a lot of these thirty thirty five type games that they've played the past couple of weeks right a forty three thirty seven game in overtime against the saints and they have thirty seven thirty six games this is going to become the norm the over under fifty seven and a half in the south in Steelers game and I think because of the falcon ... always lacked\nThat solid enough to receiver Julio Jones they've found them and they invested in with the first round pick they fully intend to use and I think he also ... is an every week starting from this point forward\nRambling lastly is there anybody there was jumping into our role on a team in the NFL because of injury that you like and think either\nHas a chance to be productive or someone you're going to keep an eye on like CJ bat for it I Know nobody is keeping an eye on him but you understand the pain and which I asked this question with Jimmy gee out is there anybody across the league do you say you know would keep an eye on this guy CBP takes advantage of this injury time opportunity\nYou know it's interesting because I've got to put too tight end out there because I've got a lot of questions about ... recently and actually I Am going to put a third one out there um you mentioned that third and I would counter that with for a comment that when George Kendall because I think that George Kendall\nGoing to become more a part of that often said he would have been with ... because I don't think that things that type of guy they're going to trust to get the ball down the field of our sewn and mark he's been with him when he's healthy so to me I think there's going to be a lot of George Kendall so the arrows pointing up on him\nI think that Eric ... oil continue to be out is somebody that looks somebody's gotta catch some passes from Andrew lawyer and just like I mentioned with the falcons don't pick the Indianapolis defense is all that great\nSo I think that really put the ball up and I think ... is a somebody look at their I think with Baker Mayfield now under center\nI just feel like David and joke who has way too much talent to continue to just swallow there in Cleveland I think his day is going to come sooner than later so he is somebody that I'm looking at all that's not a cure injury playing\nWhat auto group was your car any make any model blood pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours

hundred Seventy seven zero for three three John bachelor show\n\n\n\n\nA\nMeter how ... how the president of just you can now send director of the strategic strategic deterrent studies that Michel Institute joins Gordon Chang my colleague we're addressing\nA global concern which is the possibility of nuclear conflict there is a new paper from Princeton university's global zero\nProposing what you'd have to say it was a dramatic reduction in nuclear warheads and the way we watch people with nukes Peter a very good evening to you what is global zero what is their mission statement good evening\nGood evening and thank you Gordon thank you uh John for this a global zero as an organization devoted to the elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide by twenty forty\nWhich will be primarily done by unilateral reduction by the United states because other countries as well as they say in this new report will have to follow suit because of our wonderfully a moral example\nPeter that's not going to happen it seems to me that if every you're going to get to a global zero it will be because everybody realizes they can't outspend the United states\nI don't understand the logic of our unilaterally reducing our arsenal to the point where it may not be usable and essentially having everybody else so yeah we'll we'll we'll do the same thing they're recommending three hundred warhead sky appear\nLet's go back to twenty twelve and they issued a report very like this um this was last report it called for\nA thousand more heads in the United states arsenal and now they're under three hundred so they've reduced it by Seventy five percent\nThey said at that time and twenty twelve Russia was not a threat\nAnd they did a survey of people who are members of the council Foreign Relations and said in twenty twelve is Russia threat and the number of them said no and therefore they concluded Russia was not a threat that day they issued the report was the day the foreign minister of Russia issued a ... a threat to use nuclear weapons against NATO missile defense sites\nAnd that's my friend mark Snyder has done since twenty twelve\nThe Russian military or civilian including Mr Clinton had you issued thirty\nThreats to the United states and our allies to use nuclear weapons either not been implicit these men explicit threat so what they basically done in this twenty eight team report it instead of having Fifteen hundred and fifty warheads under the new start treaty we would have\nThey take around to fix the we'd have to ... submarines that the that would be it the other three would be a an import and when you look at what the low teens are we'd probably have as low as a hundred and thirty warheads\nWhat would happen is instead of having five hundred and nine targets meaning land based missiles bombers in submarines spread all over the country will be down to five to ... feet to set up bases ... bomber base bombers would not be usable\nOr the warheads would be put elsewhere and then they have this crazy idea that warheads and missiles would be separated\nAnd where would we store these hundreds of warheads while they're empty silos and it used to be minute man silos which gentle Cartwright negotiated with the Russians that we would not put missiles in them so we put all our warheads there and then we put about bull's eye on it\nAnd it bright red so the Chinese and could no but they just took out all our warheads didn't matter whether we had submarine bombers are ICBMs left which we wouldn't uh we have any warheads\nSo in their twenties twelve report they said it is reasonable to believe that the Russians and the Chinese the Syrian at the north Koreans that Iran had targets equally in about a thousand\nWe could rationally save needed to be hit and retaliated against and taken out those numbers have all of a sudden crashed too\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to forge twenty eight teams for that one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a flood forward and he went into and there again it\nWould be it and we wouldn't have to retaliate quickly because cities banking communications don't move they're all sitting there so we would take at least no less than Seventy two hours\nTo respond if we wanted to and if we put warheads out in the minimum silos that Montana or give me an example for a minute man based to put warheads back on missiles you can do three missiles per month or wing of the three wings\nShe could do nine missiles a month you could put one more head back on minute man if you want to but they want to get rid of a good player on the global zero wants to eliminate all minute man so we would go down from well over five hundred targets to as I said five\nFeet artist with me and we do this unilaterally\nYes unilateral surrender work if a unilateral surrender includes the fall I Want to know how I can joined the international monitoring program\nI Hope they have really cool uniforms because well because their job will be exhausting to guarantee that unilateral surrender has been sustained by the fall\nBut what's interesting that the ... and this hundred and seven page report\nThey're they they don't talk about verification because you can't verify for example I did my will be alerted and that's your favorite thing it's like turning off a missile well with a keystroke on the computer I can turn it back on and I could targeted wherever I Want to target it nobody will know so there's no verification of course\nBut then they say and this is toward the end they say\nEverybody has to now not to use weapons first they have to vow not to deploy attack submarines in certain areas the oceans in order to make the submarines safe and this is what they say in which everyone and I'm quoting sincerely vows\nTo do this quote unquote so sincerely vows is like a marriage a wedding\nSincerely vow to you know on her and uh be true to your wife or your husband that now is that we we now have marriage and the nuclear policy instead of\nTrust but verify it's if they sincerely vowed to do it then it's okay and that's literally that is a quote from the end of the book or this hundred and seven page book so now we're gonna have unilaterally ten percent of the Russian force\nWill have it somewhere between twenty and forty percent of the Chinese force and we'll have about\nTwenty percent of our current force that has allowed under a treaty or getting rid of everything now one of the things that's really strange is all the submarines have all the new stories about sixteen missiles\nEvery missile Bruce Blair says put eight warheads on which is by the way the maximum you can put on it what happens if the Russians bust out of the global other new start treaty or the Chinese build up we will have no buildup capability which Bill Clinton George Bush and Barack Obama all hold the hedge\nAnd we would have no hedge we would be stuck at about two hundred and fifty survivable warheads the eat um that would be it and the other guys to build what ever they wanted a bill\nGardens you have about a minute So Peter you mentioned something before about how potent has been a threatening to your sense of use of nuclear weapons\nHe's been doing that especially with regard to the Baltics we've just got about thirty seconds if you can run through how global zero would do with pollutants threats to use nukes to start a war do they have a plan Peter a thirty second\nNo no no no I'm not at all that's the whole point of building low yield weapons on a cruise missile or a D. five submarine missile it gets there quickly within you know twenty to thirty minutes\nWhich we don't have anything that can get there that quickly today that's why it's not a question blow your weapons is the question can you get them to the battle a potent by the way announced this new strategy in April two thousand\nAnd two thousand six he said this is how we're going to do it and we're going to exercise this way and we're going to build these things and then twenty fourteen announced everything's going to be built done deployed in the field by twenty Twenty one and this I'm quoting are strapped commander General John heightened\nSo potent started doing this back in twenty two thousand in April and during the Clinton Administration and he's a couple of years away from\nMe and Peter how's the how's the geostrategic

met and I think I've carried out what I promised immediately that we want to have a fair and thorough process we had a\nFair and thorough process and I think that's best demonstrated by the fact that we the men in Iran about who the person was in the Feinstein ladder Dr Ford\nI read about her name and the paper we got on it right away to provide the forum she wanted an intern we provide the same forum for Kavanaugh\nBut what I've been dealing with since July the town the downhill slope that show has put us on Israeli dealing with a demolition derby\nAnd where they just about destroyed a good

thorough very important investigation\nNone of us have said that have judge Kavanaugh did what he's been accused of doing by some of the Democrats and outside people some outside people should be disqualified but after investigations for both the committee\nAnd the FBI we have found nothing absolutely nothing to cooperate accusations against him [noise]\nAnd we need to confirm him right away his confirmation will be a victory for the Senate as an institution a reminder that the politics of baseless personal destruction has no place here\nI think he's one of the best nominees I've seen in my forty two years in the United States Senate [noise]\nThat's how I judge to him for the way he's been treated yes this is an important position yes and Democrats have a right to feel very worried

that have been employed as part of an orchestrated smear campaign\nI agree that the FBI investigation to now they've talked to a total of a hundred and fifty different people or through the seven background investigations that judge Kavanaugh has been through since Nineteen Ninety three or know cooperation\nNo confirmation of any of these outrageous accusations that have been made against him\nUnfortunately this could have all been avoided um most of the embarrassment to Dr Ford and and the public circus like atmosphere if we adjust the ranking member had just made the allegations known\nIn the regular process and could have been investigated as as I said in a way that would have protected her and her confidentiality\nHas said before and I say it again I Believe that we should and we did tree Dr Ford the same way I Would want my daughters are my wife or my mother treated under similar circumstances but we have to remember\nThat judge Kavanaugh's entitled to a fair process to and he has not been subjected to a fair process anything butts so now's the time to quit all of these antics these high jinx the circus like atmosphere and will do that tomorrow morning when we vote\nAnd Saturday when we vote to finally confirmed this good man to this important position for say\nIt goes to some of the leadership in the Senate just want to play a little bit of that for you so

in his career he's only three and the regular season oh into in the playoffs\nHis own five all the time and a lot of those names have been lopsided wins for the patriots I Would not trust Andrew Luck in my fantasy line up despite him I guess continuing to look a little bit better week by week\nHe has I mean you know he was really good last week against Houston but your point about those being lopsided games the patriots the last five meetings with the cold they've average forty four point six points per game\nThat's good that will get it done\nIt's a good number six one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five\nIs the phone number for you I saw a good Jersey there during the break Chris it was a a royal blue late nineties teddy Bruce ... oh you got all of which you don't you don't get any points for Bruce because there's a million Bruce the jerseys at a game but you do get points for going with the late nineties\nUh soccer looking Jersey with the giant flying Elvis logos on the shoulders which I have openly advocate it for a throwback game with those jerseys at some point next thing\nThat would go and I mean I Would be down for that and you wouldn't have the issue they have with you know sort of going back to the like seventies eighties patriots jerseys which you know you can switch helmets for safety reasons so you could just keep saying how much you're going to go\nOut to go back to your calls I Know you've got plenty of thoughts on this game tonight Tony's and surely when he got an Julian Edelman Tony\nLittle you know I'm always dress let me just go it gave me a point I was talking about element of you know what I mean they say we're not going to be there say\nLet's change the top three slot machine early I think he's got to be a fly that won't walk away the both knees I Know I'm a job where I'm ... now you have a lot about this was shocked and syrup three joined us\nNo no no no no no no no no no not here this patriot page and even if you do not Red Sox\nAre here is here is my thought on his he should have stopped his first point anyway I was a good one\nUm the fact is the patriots don't really have a slot receiver on this team right now it's a good and they haven't had a slot receiver this year and even have Julian Edelman at is that eighty percent and we don't even know that's the case you might be a hundred percent him returning at less than what it used to be\nStill makes him an incredibly valuable piece on the team just because you have a true slot guy in this off at which this off ... has been very uh\n... is predicated on exactly where the ... games predicated are literally years and years and\nYears I mean this goes back to starting with Troy Brown to making the transition to wealthier and then eventually the transition to Adam and\nThis is a major part of this off and it's a major part about Tom Brady operate and even if it's not Edelman at a hundred he's good enough at eighty to fill the role and be a flock guy on the scene which they I think they need it and they've struggled with out over the first month\nYeah I mean I think you know from the outside you look at you say okay this role that Chris Hogan could potentially fill and I'd have to go back and look you know film and see how much is actually lined up in the spot but I think\nHe's sort of better as somebody who's outside then as a side guy because he can do that but he's a different type of guy right\nHe's going to use more his side in straight lines speedy doesn't have the same bilateral quickness if the patriots normally like in that position\nThey tried to ... to a couple of times everything James White line up there but it's not the same with the running back in this off ... Julian Edelman not just a slot receiver he's the number one wide receiver and I think if you take a number one wide receiver away from a lot of teams is going to hamper their often\nRichard is in Boston Richard\nGentlemen on their way to the game is set up my voice or two that I Want to get your take on that a big plus the wide receiver right now your perspective what were the rank productive look like at the end of the year\nI mean I think I don't mean that the top receivers only are recounting Gronkowski\nYeah yeah yeah I mean I mean I think just wide receivers I think I don't mean definitely at the top there I think there's a trickle down effect of getting Edelman back if he's right which I think the match ups for Hogan endorsed that become much more manageable matchups for them in in there and it's there in a situation now\nLooking for a guard credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices and cars with zero percent eight PR for Seventy two months you can be driving ... also models interest free log onto what Tom\nBowman coming back yeah I think the ... the biggest um beneficiary of that as the guy and ended ... because for the first month he is not look like a guy\nThat is you know capable of being a one or two he's a nice player good guys have on your roster you could do a lot worse for third receiver a lot worse than Chris organ but he had an opportunity to step up over that first month and\nI think for the most part he couldn't I Know there ... some pros too I'm sure I Know there were times where he did get opening the ball and goes way but overall he did not make an impact\nAnd the month that they know that ... now you mean you you you really ... and I go back to the Jacksonville game you know you got the two touched down\nAnd the first one was against the garbage time zone coverage and you know it's nice but he's a great thoroughbred ready and the second one was a garbage time TV ...

him he's got nobody to blame but themselves yeah what's the most part he's the guy who backed it up\nBut I say this though you know I Hope he's entertaining but I don't think this is a match up that

like nothing to point to to say you know the culture ready to come in here and upset it and the patriots have an emotional advantage from Julian Edelman I really think that is going to be a spark\nFor

Gillette Stadium at this hour Hi, Bob hey guys how you doing I'm doing great\nI the weather has a [noise] a cooperative no rain and uh it's gonna be a beautiful night for this match up\nA turnaround of course for both of these teams especially Indianapolis coming all the overtime laws to the Houston Texans and decimated by injuries as they are but very excited obviously to be back here to see Julian Edelman upon his return and as you note it'd be like it's fascinating that he could be other returning clients right away [noise]\nAll I sort of on Edelman on the field right now is uh I Know that he was out there earlier I don't know if he's still is\nBut when he was a was a noticeable\nYeah you know just a [noise]\nIt it it it was like old times I mean seeing him out there so early going through his routine and it's a long routine that he has with his pre game warm ups\nHas yet to come out the Colts ... specialist just emerged in right Allen is out here for the patriots so I Would expect Jillian do emerge or any time in the next few minutes and started handling some ... come out here as well or with the rest of the guys that will be back or possibly a as return specialist\nTonight [noise] Bob any surprise on your part said wrapped around county is active this week on a short we [noise]\nYou know 'cause\nI I Would say ... miles surprise I was thinking that you know ... going to be down early in the wake of men you know saying that he had limited participation that there was a possibility\nI he was going to play a yesterday you know I I thought OK perhaps but now I'm Still I'm Still not sure how much we're going to see him and and what role he'll be youth utilized in\nI heard well let me get to say this earlier today and I think the numbers Barrett out that he expects the patriots it'd be a run dominant team tonight the way they have been in recent years against the Colts the patch and one seven straight endless series and in the last five meetings\nWhile producing forty four and a half points they rush for about a hundred and Seventy eight yards per game during that stretch and I wonder if in the case Rogalski tonight we see Rob doing more blocking the nuts pass route running\nBut you know with this team you never know I mean part of the success of the patriots is predicated on their unpredictability\nYeah I mean it would be interesting I mean certainly you're right they had a lot of success in the past running against the cold and\nI don't think this is the greatest uh Indianapolis defense of of all time but it is a new coaching staff and also I find it interesting that again there's only really to real running backs on the roster yeah or if you want\nSomebody to carry the mail I guess I don't even shower in that regard and he'd better you'd better go down quite a bit of Gatorade if that's the math and I could be a thirty six carry night for Sony ...\nYeah I mean the other part of that too is that he carry the ball lots on Sunday with a short turn around the patriots or you know had some physicality to say the least from the get go I thought on both sides of the ball Sunday I especially defensively controlling the oil on a scrimmage much of the day so you wonder whether\nThey limit the workload for everybody with that in mind tonight I Try to get through this game and the best physical shape as possible with the uh when of course in the left in ...\n[noise] yeah and try and have 'em and shell also built\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood Otto John job now\nMore decisive he ran with more confidence you ran with a better vision I liked the run that he had on his touchdown and Bob I Would say he Doesn't Suck and he doesn't blow [laughter] I'm Glad you said it'd be it'll [laughter] that's what I don't have to sell so I Will leave you with that how does that yeah I I think that's a good night and I think\nTo say that but it'll doesn't mean that you're saying he needs a bust made up for a cat and right now I've read the other thing we have to keep in mind with him it's not only the the lack of reps in pre season\nAnd during training camp but it was in the operation and it was a procedure to drain blood but there's still a surgical procedure I mean this is the guy who had any operation in early August\nAnd you would expect him to take some time to get revved up in addition to the learning process the NFL\nOr so you know I Know how some people view him more critically than others but I I definitely think is good as the blocking was and it was good by every player at every position of receivers blocked well besides blocked well certainly the offensive line in the full back James dabbling blocked well but you gotta give credit to Michelle for his work as well maybe he can be the\nAlways amassing player the ... I I pay five British editor time looking for the call All right thanks guys Bob so see\nJoining us from the ... he has brought to us by the Peterson school the Peterson school that's been training the hardest working people in the trade rover Seventy years learned skills and HVAC oil gas the plumbing and electricity they do hard work\nThey know the trades Peterson school dot com Bert prayer of the ... joined us next on the safety insurance that he ate by sports patriots radio network\nAnd his mind that answer was no and I would say probably right\nBut you know what they say though in that situation you know you never want to be the guy who replaces the guy and if he replaces valid jak that's a lot to live up to a lot to live on you know you're probably doing it without\nTom Brady right but if you're doing it with the sport of the team that you're working for if you're doing it with the support of the owner and ownership yeah then that might you know\nMake you feel like you're in a spot that's good for you\nAnd then on top of your family got to live in Massachusetts yeah that's what happened to go to Indianapolis Indianapolis is not that bad exactly it's plus it it was never about that it was never about that because if you're going to return to you know put yourself back in the pool head coach and candidates if bill doesn't leave and retire or do whatever it is going to do down the road\nThen no it wasn't about your family you move your family down the road because the patriots job is in your ...\nAnd the other thing for me that makes me believe he has to be you know sort of the coach and waiting to see the unannounced successor is just that it's not just the coolest job that he turned down now the way he turned it down as notable but you know the off season before the forty niners were interested in him to get to a certain point where some of these clubs ... you start to get painted with the brush\nOf this guy doesn't really want to leave New England\nYeah I'm not sure it's going to take him out of the running hurts told me that he thinks he's going to be right back in the game yeah it's possible if it was the asked if he wants to be back in ... when you look on him\nThat the football people in the league might say oh this doesn't matter to me but what about the owners what about the non football people you think they're not going to look into that you think they're not going to be a little curious about it\nI think that football owners will do whatever they think is in the interests of winning you got a desperate team that needs a good head coach and they feel he can be that guy then\nYou really think that's how the interviewer goes with genetic owner I think a lot of it is about playing to the Reagan kissing there\nBut that's not what I was saying no no but I'm just saying that you're looking at it very objective owners would be willing to overlook it\nIf they felt like I can win right and of course that's a given you don't have to say that the head coach in Canada\nWe had to go in without pragmatic decision right here like Jerry Jones okay you're throws was winning with Jimmy Johnson but Jimmy Johnson was kissing is not so old thing imploded\nOkay but those are two very different things and I would tell you that I I agree with you for it but the kissing up to the owner is a given that's not related\nTo what we're talking about as long as he does what is required of Mossad coaches in this league which is kissing the butt of the owner as long as that ... that's a prerequisite as long as that's happening\nI think they're willing to absolve him all the same I think he has false and I think he has more assurances here than they're letting on\nI think he does too but I you know what else I don't think they have insurance on when bill will depart\nWhether you have to bill has to be near the running back building bring John ... ownership brought back hold on wait no no I agree with you I Know that is true but what happened to the narrative about oh bills going to open up the keys to the you know the castle in show Josh how it's done I don't have to ... talk to your ...\nWhat their Chevy GMC ...

know what you really dead but reports where it was a lot of walked the earth but a big metal wait for you guys can you win the weak mentally\nYeah absolutely I think that's what it's about the ... we

back ready to play so quickly get in our body ready to get our mind ready and um you know being ready to see it up here tonight\nI've talked to a lot milder about all the receivers tied into running back seems like you were in rhythm and off and it's really spreading the ball around guy like Josh ... really progressive it seems like you know gaining confidence and it seems like the work ethic and everything's progressing with him and fair to say can start feed them maybe a little bit more\nYeah full keep them involved I thought he did a good opportunity a with a chance as they head against the dolphins and in a you know made a couple of plays ran well after the cats and you know showed his size and strength these are gotta tackle so\nUm [noise] you know with him in a you know we'll see what

the end of the first quarter\nEarly in the second quarter or whatever it was a he's really played on an almost three solid games for us and um his experience and um you know just as ability of dependability good tackling fundamentals have been a big plus for us and so um you know stepping in for oh and I played well\nRide coach against Frank ... says before obviously he steps in with Andrew Luck what do you see is a is a lot of West coast concepts a specially talk about luck real quick aren't striking I chatted with you from the TV end of it seems like the orange strength is there for him\nUh yeah ... you know Frank West coast guy all the way it's very ah very much west coast oriented lotta catching run plays a lot of plays a inside the numbers multiple formations are on the same plays\nA and utilizing their their receivers that tight and it's pretty similar relate to the Philadelphia arts programs versus eve Ron Hines is is clemen um and so they have you know that a dot com they all the receivers uh play they all contribute they're all\nUh they've all been productive uh so they've had a lot of pressure on the passing game and uh you know I Know that they fought a lot about getting the run again going we're gonna have to do good job on that tonight I'm so that they are well balanced often it's a lot of good skilled players and obviously good quarterback that can get the ball the open guy\nCalled a lot of games ... last couple of years and uh but you look at them defensively now is not a lot of names to recognize from years past a guy like a very slender playing well for them young kid seems like they've really retold things so they they true for three team says for three on paper but will they mix the front up for you yeah it's all Forman\nLine they um they never dropped their rounds and they're they're pretty physical from was guys like shared and hot and woods in their uh their athletic they spend a lot of play a lot of its own coverage um [noise]\nSo you know similar um relate to what we saw um say a little bit last week the Miami Miami played more men coverage but it's along those lines so good for me in front that uh they make a lot is roughly plays ... negative plays\n'em and they also get a bunch of penalties on their defensive line because they're getting away from guys and they get held and so forth so uh they do a good job of creating those negative plays and putting in long urged we've got to avoid that and we got to take care\nLooking for work our credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood what born
