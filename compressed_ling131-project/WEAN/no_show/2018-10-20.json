Americans for tax reform and you can reach them an eight six six Ninety red eye if you have any tax questions in will read that in a but I wanted to ask you what did you think is a tax cut passed by Congress and the president\nIt was a really helpful first step\nOr one of the things that happened was during the Reagan years we reduced marginal tax rates for people individuals top rate was Seventy percent of the ballots highs Ninety percent during World War two\nA Kennedy took it from Nineteen Seventy Reagan took it from seven eight to twenty eight [noise] unfortunately Bush and Clinton and Obama\nRaised it back up towards uh uh over forty percent and uh so at the individual level we began to take the rates down a little bit but business taxes is where the United states was where the line with the rest of the world\nOr the rest of the world started experimenting with lower business taxes will lower corporate income taxes when we took our individual rights down and did very well economically a lot of Eastern European countries after they left the Soviet Union their individual rights like Fifteen Percent\nHungry it's business tax nine percent\nWe're at thirty five we had the highest business taxes in the world and then we sat around going how can we can't compete you know with China and Germany and stuff like that and\nIreland to Ireland's business taxes twelve and a half percent a week what thirty thirty five plus an average of ... percent by state and local governments so really thirty nine on average and uh the Republicans took that down to Twenty one\nAnd it made us more competitive on the tax credit than most of the country's law\nYeah average European ... about twenty five ten points better than what we used to be you know we're at thirty five they were twenty five and they would be that's when they sent me to take a million dollars I don't think there's like invested ... million dollars what do I put a chip I invested I take those jokes thirty five percent of everything I like\nIf I put it in Germany it only takes a while I go to Germany\nOr and we've shifted that down and we've seen a massive\nA diversion of foreign direct investment [noise] out of your it did I get a for starters there was a a five hundred billion dollars half a trillion dollars in the last six months which was arranged by American companies\nOver seats and we used to have a lot until the Republican tax reform\nThat punished you if you brought laid back that states they left it oversees this maybe three trillion dollars to the left overseas I'm partly because largely because our tax policy said we will hurt you it's going to bring the money back and if you don't bring it back that's okay\nAh show three trillion stock overseas because of our tax policy\nAnd we said you know we're not doing that anymore it's\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common there are all in for Steve free own tradition and bought bought any religion or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto dot com now\nThey'll ... they'll probably no penalty for bringing like back a bit about that\nAnd that we've seen a tremendous and get half a trillion dollars by it and come back the last six months and an apple they said look we have two hundred and Ninety million dollars or earnings overseas they brought ... billion right back\nAnd they said you know what because it's no longer had allies to boot buddy from London to New York or Texas\nUm we've read all back now it's all coming back but right now where they live in London back because it doesn't matter in terms of our access to capital whether it's in London or in Arkansas\nUh whereas before it\nSo that money might as well are ready to be back but we've seen a half to try and come back immediately and we'll see more as a as we move forward added that guy's overseas you know German and Dutch people and Brazilians\nMaking decisions are standing there money to the United states rather overseas is really irritating European because we're much more competitive\nThan we used to be and that's been a big help\nYeah now I can see why is it just seems so obvious all these things seem so obvious to me I have a couple of more questions and we're going to get some of the callers questions for you also but right now we're going to take her get our national forecast for um the tracks\nAn area of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit so you can look for showers throughout the day and then in the region in fact Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rain free but today a few more spots of showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news there is showers will be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas we're going to get about another inch of rain today\nI not only agree with that I wrote that in the paper in my freshman year at Harvard and they like flunked me that they said you know this does come from a conversation I had with the IRS I\nCalled the bottom fell out and said if they did if he didn't withhold taxes\nOut of never lets paycheck every two weeks that looks dead once a month to satisfy the check like the electric bill and Fonda or on April fifteenth said send the check the whole year and the ... is the IRS person I was talking to I interviewed for the the papers right he\nSaid there'd be a revolution it's\nA ... yeah I think if someone had to write you know check my little one ten twenty whatever there would be you'd have a new Tea Party\nRight or any of these days with very yeah it make it clear that he's like hey yeah let's go I promised a color to mark in Albuquerque New Mexico you're on with mark and with Grover Norquist [noise] think\nAppreciate it up to you what you just two words right out of my mouth and here's what I've always thought flat tax\nAnd it's ... percent a cross the port it don't matter whether you're right a Warren Buffett or whether you're the guy work down there McDonalds seven\nPer cent you limit they every deep dark shoot that there is as far as they are with the tax you limit they all federal tax\nWhether it's the fuel tax that we pay or whether Social Security income tax you name but if it's a federal tax it no longer exists you will limit the six teams that bad but and that\nIn order to raise taxes if you're going to do it as Congress that means you have to have a super\nMajority of both the house in the Senate to foot the bill on the president's desk for him to sign up for it be for it to be come a ballot or the election of on every two years that's one third grader\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the only twenty eight ... Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of never against it unbearable Marjorie impeccable service\nTo the ratings and I think you know and as you just mentioned are it does it come out of your pay check you write the check every month or every\nQuarter and believe me when people realized how much they're paying out taxes they would they would there would be a revolution in this country like you would not believe because I was self employed and I had to write that check every quarter\nI couldn't believe how much I was having to pay taxes\nInteresting groove or what do you think of it is I Do\nI think he's right and a number of the ideas you put out there are in state constitutions uh in California in Nevada or\nIf you if the government wants to raise taxes steak but once raise taxes it's a two thirds voted legislature because taxes are about as permanent as constitutional amendments\nWhich usually take two thirds or to impose on people\nAnd if you say it takes two thirds to raise taxes it really slows the tax and spend down doesn't stop them completely but it really slow it down it has to be a really good idea it has to have rod support\nA to an act and it I think a flat tax with a super majority to raise taxes\nOr would dramatically change our policy\nCurious\nWhat do you think about some people propose the sales tax consumption tax so what's your response to that\nWell in Europe they have a value added tax which is a sales tax at every step of production if you're going to have a twenty percent sales tax is American countries do you really have to you can't just collect it at the supermarket 'cause everybody would buy their stuff and\nDown the street from the supermarket out the back of a truck\nA so they put that twenty percent at every level of production the farmer pays that the guy who trucks goods into town pays\nA twenty percent on his value added to way to get ... percent tax\nBut he had little amounts and there's no one place where you can avoid ah the difference between the United states and Europe is Europe\nAnd has a sales tax of a national self actually value added tax which gets every level of a production [noise] ah it's why they have higher taxes than we do that stupid income taxes they have high income taxes you can only get so much money out of an income tax\nPeople will quit working dealt work around that\nHide money um when you add to that the difference between the United States Europe is that we don't have that and they do don't have a sales tax they do some people say no no no we want to\nSweat rather the income tax and have a national sales tax tax in stat well it's kind of what they promised Europeans and the Japanese and the Asians and the and the Africans when they put that in overseas\nOr it will be in addition to it will not be instead of and if we could\nAnd I'm for bringing that income tax down towards zero I'm what you want to do is we just spend it\nNot just turn it into a different tax what who cares if you got rid of the income tax and took the exact same amount of money out of ... how would that change anything it's the same amount of money out of your pocket or it it makes you feel better somebody else's writing the check\nBut everything you buy from your house to your car cheer\nCheer for dear close would cost more but at the taxes would be hidden in that so um I think going to a single right tax income tax or and reducing spending his route to go to know if you got taxes down enough\nThat you could shift from a ten percent income tax too you know a Fifteen Percent sales tax it's got it's got to be ... water a bad yeah I I wouldn't mind that\nBut you got to get the government to half its presence size before you could risk that and you really have to have protections\nHow do we know we're not going to end up with both an income tax and the sales tax true many countries have had been hit with that\nAnd there's no incentive and the politicians because they get their money campaign contributions rights is part of this hey you know give me this donation someone in a lower tax this they don't want to think solved eventually right they reduce their campaign contributions\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Marjorie impeccable surface\nOr to protect people bit by bit where everyone's paying a one percent in the same percentage less ... less opportunities to make money for politicians\nAnd lawyers and accountants maybe my final question for you well maybe I've got two more what about the mission or um how do you know what do you know if the Democrats ... take the house what do you think about what's going to happen next situation\nIf the Democrats take the house there'll be no tax cuts for the next two years ah they will do push ups for tax increases that what they used to train dollars and higher taxes Hillary ran on raising taxes by a trillion dollars over a decade\nAt least to try and I'm from where we were we cut taxes the training that they want to raise them I Try and the war we worship that's two and a half trillion dollars in taxes\nFor a decade that they want to increase taxes deli pushing for that I I think with both Trump and the Republican Senate that they will get a tax increase but they'll sit there and say hey if you want\nThe military to get paid will only do that ... only passed a budget or the soldiers and airmen and Tim and buy it if you get made action because they will they will spend two years\nTrying to get a tax increase [noise] um I Hope they will fail that is what I Will be working on\n'em by Democrats on the tax issue like teenage boys on a Sunday they keep asking for the same thing in different ways that just again and again and again they keep coming back but they want one thing they want higher taxes are and they will ask that question twenty\nDifferent ways of the green taxes it will save the planet that will be and the taxes that only paid the other\nPeople a day where we package the same tax increase and as always\nMaybe maybe a new Supreme Court tax to pack the court who knows and they can come up with anything the only work when I talk\nAbout really I didn't hear that yeah yeah yeah\nI hear a lot of us want to get out of it and they want to re of breath proposed a tax for it or even or course prison Americans for tax reform head of people get in

I read some industry seven dust\nAnd we put it in something with the ball bucket old turkey based stuff\nAnd they don't you just go up and\nShoved that right into the hole and pump the dust in there\nOkay and it may take a couple of days for it to take effect don't be surprised if you have to do with the second time but if you've got that room blocked off and all of a sudden you see a bunch of yellow jackets flying around in that room\nUm you can and and you could get it blocked off you can go to a local hardware store or whatever and buy one of the aerosols fog is that the people are concerned about bombs and\nYes and set off in the room and that will kill all the adults that have been forced than flying around\nOkay and if it continues to be a problem and you can't seem to find that um then you can always give our office to call 'em if if if there's nothing you can do it I think if you find that hole and they will go in and out there still actively feeding right now\nSo uh in in even tomorrow in the ... the temperature is only to hire someone going to be a fifty fifty one quarter jak your whether it's still going to be that still time to yellow jackets will be flying in and out looking for food so especially if it's bright and sunny and the sunny side of the house\nAll right All right thanks alone All right bill thank you so much our phone numbers\nHere for three eight WPRI road toll free one eight hundred three two one WPRI if you want to get on line with me we're going to go now to Joe ... Joe good morning how are you today\nGoing how are you going great Joe how can how am I\nGoing to call my house shut 'em and I can call and for the Lakers from scratch on the wall I thought it was like a big animals so I says well I'll let me call or someone that does you know a squirrels and wrapped up things of that nature or he come out and all he says I don't hear you got a problem there I think it's just my ... I says okay I\nHave to do is he says I'm going to have to put about twenty trucks are so all around there and she can trap not\nCome back every day in check and make sure that I took that sounds like a little over choked I may just might [laughter] I said how can I put\nSome day con town I finally said well no they gotta talk this really well what about a cold trap now that's not going to work and he says I just put these traps on their back and check it and I just it's kind of nuts I I I Would just get some like Tom Cat I thought I'm up in the attic and throw all each college around but what do you think Tony\nOkay now I've said over the news is the key question so where did that tennis is hearing the noise is it up in the attic is it like above their heads like when you're in ... in a wall in a war okay but in a wall um lower or higher or is it or is this a one family house\nWhile it's a slap slap okay good okay so there's no basement All right so the key thing would be is if you can get up in the attic and you look up there and you find\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nI find any droppings in the attic then putting bay up there won't solve the problem I see um\nThe the reason that person said you twenty ... is is it's not over ... you've got to use a lot of traps 'cause you don't know how many might say the mice reproduce very quickly every four weeks mice of reproducing so if this has been hearing the noise for a little while and a female Maus came into was pregnant she might have gotten pregnant already\nSo you know but I mean\nIt can't catch them in cages I mean I don't think that's the way I mean what are you guys to them I Would think yeah\nYeah from mice we don't use cages from ice we use the old fashioned snapshots all we do use poison too you know bait and debate when used properly does not present it has to the dog and that's the key thing when used properly with ... with a dog can't get to it\nAnd things like that it's it's not going to be a hazard there there's the chances of a dog dying from even even a small dog and I have a small dog a dog like a dachshund and I don't use any being around my house I usually use traps but if I did used bait and a dog with the dog was eight one of those ... he's\nNot going to die from one mouse like I got you know\nIf it takes three to five days to kill the mice will will with debate let alone you know trying to kill the dog is virtually impossible\nAnd I can't happen but but you got to be careful with it just puts debate with a ... gift\nI with the dog can't get to it\nWell you know there was a little small area like a quarter inch inch on a friday and I'm thinking maybe squirrels could get in there but I don't think that we're all going to go anywhere on most go at the same side I don't believe\nSo squirrels have bigger they need a larger opening they do um the thing to remember about squirrels as you will have squirrels noise during the day you will have much noise at night squirrels that die Arnold creatures creatures of the day they run around in the daytime you see them all over the place and I'm not mice nocturnal\nSo the mice you'll hear at night so I've been hearing the noise at night it's mice that Harriet during the day probably not mice\nI see okay All right All right thanks so much\nAlright Joe thank you very much and you know it it it is this is the time of year when it gets cool these animals squirrels mice rats they want to get inside not to mention insects I mean in our house you remember our homes radiate heat\nOr what have you ever have anything like that if you can do but and and the good thing about your own house just not built on the door and and stuff like I don't know about\nGore we don't do a we don't do vampires witches and stuff like that um so it's just good old fashioned schools ... good old fashioned fun stuff surprise scares and stuff like that what must Halloween is all about oh you can always get more information hunt elaborate dot com\nSounds great to get out there and taking them take advantage of that again tonight tomorrow in Sunday in the next friday Saturday and Sunday to great great event\nYou're listening to the big blue bugs illusion show here I knew struck six thirty and Ninety nine seven FM WPRI row the voice in southern New England who want to get on line with me our phone numbers here for three eight WPRI rowing toll free one eight hundred three two one WPRI oh we have a Alan on the line from North Kingston Allen good morning how are you today\nOn well Tony how are you thank you Alan very well what can I Do find that it\nHad a quick story that I wanted to share with you and I also wanted to ask the question\nShould go out\nI had an issue with what occurs backing of the side of my house to get I guess mhm um food and gave me some advice to order I play with a string\nOf attach it to a string right it just kinda dangle their banging around right um so I view of those around my house look a little goofy [laughter] but but it can tell you that in the last\nProbably five years\nI I had that problem we we went away\nThat's great I'm Glad to hear that one at a lot of the fact that well I'm as great I'm Glad to hear that\nOn the other thing\nI I had a question when you find somebody that all your company and they want as or even a white cetera\nTreated ethically they like and they you know they want they don't want to kill them right wanna trap them instead of what I'm not necessarily in that boat but I'm just curious what kind of advice you give them a oh I don't I don't want to kill any spiders when he was like\nThis is in great point out there and it really kids there is a group of people out there that are really concerned about that now the ... like the animals\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your laundry dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Missouri impeccable surface\nBut the catch and release of that animal that animal once you catch it you should take the ... you can release it but you have to release it right in that yard right onsite you can't take it\nTo like a wooded area and set us free that that's against the law against wildlife trapping laws so what we would recommend that somebody who's really you know\nReally concerned about let's say they got a squirrel in erotica score or something like that and what I Would recommend they do is if they purchased a trap like they have a hot property Tomahawk trap it in Tomahawk as it's not like it doesn't kill the animal catches the animal life too\nSo it catches your animals alive and as an individual homeowner you can catch suddenly andme alive take it outside set it down in the yard fix the whole it's getting in through and then set the animal free\nWe have lived catch mouse traps unfortunately there are in in in there are people that come down in by them they're out in the tropics called there's two products made we sell the one the most is called the ... cat and it actually it's got a little opening a door because then the mouse gets caught in it\nAnd I always tell people if you're going to set that most free on your property taken away from the house just don't open the back door and set freak his chances that's going to find its way back in you know if you've got to begin to back yeah take it to the end of your property set free over there\nAnd let and let it go to we have natural products that we use a as rappelling things like a path of an oil in Rosemary oil\nUm we have spiders and things like that instead of spraying we have spider brushes too that we can use that knocked on the Web being and again this may be something the homeowner could do themselves to just get a broom and just keep knocking down the spider Web and eventually that spider says this isn't a good place to build my own keeps getting destroyed\nAnd they move on to a lot of it is just you know understanding the insects and so we we do give advice on that we do help out with that we even have people that have contracts with us that have won a natural products used all the time don't want any pesticide use but don't want the best in the house either\n... is a troops only if you say you catch a most mhm and do decide to relocate it um and they find their way\nBack after a mile a mile no no no we're now three miles away their their their back\nYeah we have no no no way possible that's not for a modest mouse has a very small territory thing like a squirrel or raccoons something like that yeah they could find me away back by but our mouths no no way possible and again you know unfortunately we're not allowed to trap and take them away anyway and set them free anyway so we have to humanely euthanize them Oregon set them free in the yard\nAfter we repair the ah the holes in evidence that they're getting in from\n\nAll right thank you very much Allen our phone numbers here for three eight WPRI row toll free one eight hundred three two one WPRI we have wide open line so that was a good time you don't want to get in especially before the end of the show I'm a little warning I have for those of you living in Connecticut and the north west pot of Rhode Island\nTo be on the lookout for a new tech\nUm if you listen to the show earlier in the spring we told you about this chick that was discovered in New Jersey\nNever before ever discovered in the United states and all of a sudden it's discovered in New Jersey on a sheet farm and they have no idea how it got there the sheep that the gentleman ... or if he doesn't buy the racism himself\nHe doesn't go and buy 'em from overseas or anything like that they they have no idea how the ... got here but somehow it started showing up and it's called um\n[noise] the long horn check and I'm not like the Lone Star tick that's completely different that is he and I said but the long horn check came comes from Asia how it got here we don't know but it started off on a farm in New Jersey early this spring\nAnd it's now worked its way into Connecticut north western Connecticut and the north in the area of New York\nAnd in the what makes this chick so bad I'm is its ability to to reproduce I'm at the female and itself just keep reproducing her eggs in that meeting the males to to do that\nAnd also it is a disease carry so far not in the United states that is the good thing\nBut in Asia where it's from it's been known to transport a transmit things like I'm In ... or ... one of the disease things like that it's capable of picking up in transmitted yes so that's the big warning and where they're finding these ticks defining huge populations of them\nSo um if you're getting it it's it's not going from New Jersey moving its way into New York and now into Connecticut and I am pretty sure that by the end of next year we'll be talking about these probably in Rhode Island to the way it seems to be spreading so quickly and dumb and beyond people as well as a chick\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the here for only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to point for words Tony Eighteen Ford F. one fifty the best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars from us only at point forward and he went into the Narragansett\nSan ... codes and things like that as they move and they transmit it and then another one picks up they transmit it it moves gets carried\nSo um it it's something for us to fact to be concerned about a little bit here and again as of yet here in the United states it has not been shown to carry any types of diseases I'm no Lyme disease I though the potential is there that it may eventually I'd do that\nOur phone number ... if you want to get on line with wide open lines\nFor three eight WPRI road toll free one eight hundred three two one WPRI\nOr the other thing we're dealing with right now and we're getting a lot of phone calls without a big bug solutions to end up just like our previous caller talked about woodpeckers and things like that and the things like squirrels I'm I'm a school populations\nSquirrel populations in southern New England\nIn India and northern and we go to a huge\nAnd dumped a couple of reasons for it number one is not this year but last year the acorn populations wish you lots of acorns which means lots of food for the squirrels\nAnd because the schools have lots of food and food store for the winter come this spring they do at squirrels normally do in the spring they may they reproduce and then the populations develop and then they have their second brood\nAnd the squirrel populations a huge\nNow the problem this year is the acorn population is down\nSo what that means is if the squirrels and now looking for other food sources\nAnd don't be surprised if you put your pumpkins out on your steps and things like that that all of a sudden you're coming you're seeing holes northern your pumpkins it may possibly be squirrels\nOr they're taking apples off of trees pass off of trees and ... on them making it even worse they'll get the tree and I'll take a bite out like eight or ten Apple's so all of a sudden if you're a farmer and you know yeah All right if you took one apple he took it back it was necessary laid it fine but if he's biting I ate a Kennedy Apple's you know that that that's a problem\nPlus I'm this is the family and now with the vegetable gardens are virtually ending\nAnd dumb now those of you who take your gods and they just replied them back you know you let them fall\nBack into the soil and you use it for composting fertilizing the next year if there's things like tomatoes and stuff that they normally wouldn't go to strawberries tomatoes lab but whatever it might be cucumbers and stuff they are they're hungry so they're finally alternative food sources\nPlus this is now getting to be the nesting season where they're looking for a place to get into for the winter so it's really important that today tomorrow or whatever the next few days next few weeks that you start to look around the outside of your home\nDo you have any openings or their trees overhang in your house where the squirrels can crawl on or just jumped and within two feet of the house three feet of how the squirrels can jump off and get onto the roof of the house",
