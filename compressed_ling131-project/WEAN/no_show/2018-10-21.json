they still have a situation I Believe that's ongoing trying to figure out what to do about the school budget\nOr we might we talked about the school budget a couple of months ago where their school

education a and saying this is what we're going to have to do we need waivers to get this whole thing going and they would send into the you know the flag up the hole and they're going crazy trying to

is what no let me tell you something and here's where it becomes a conspiracy\nWhen they went from the fifty percent pay out two Seventy five percent pay out at the two thousand sixteen budget hearing when they had the new contract a ratification I questioned\nEarly ... who is the finance director vigorously because the line item in two thousand Fifteen they paid four hundred and forty three thousand dollars and unused sick pay\nThat benefit now is being increased by fifty percent or ... in my opinion authored a bogus fiscal note because of the fiscal note he gate to the city council which I have in my profession right now\nIndicated that during the course of the three year new contract that increased this payout by fifty percent that it would have an impact on that line item of two hundred and eleven thousand eight hundred dollars\nI questioned him and you can actually hear my testimony to go to the city archives\nI said early this can't be because if if it was four hundred and forty three thousand last year and you're increasing it by fifty percent you're going to see at least another two hundred and Twenty one five ... the odd you know that's the thing well early so when he was off the first year by six hundred and forty nine thousand dollars\nIt's my belief that that was done purposely so that the city council would not look into this issue because what's two hundred grand over three appeared it's really pennies\nBut when we go from four hundred and forty three thousand and two thousand Fifteen to one million Ninety two thousand four hundred and Twenty one and two thousand sixteen that's a problem and\nThat fact was sheltered from the city council they did not see this coming now\nTwo and a half years ago I brought this to their attention I brought them

instituted we bought the numbers I own the numbers are important because they explain the the ... the the the issue and and what not but I don't want people to like drive off the roads are also\nLet me let me just give you the typical contract language which is very easy to understand so historically this is what the contracts as\nPertaining to payments on you sick leave after you accumulate the maximum bank right what have basically says is a in any case we're an employee is accumulating his or her maximum sick leave entitlement under section one now is what's really important language listen closely he or she shall\nAt the end of each year be\nEntitled to be paid one half of his or her own used yearly sickly entitlement not to exceed ten days such payment is to be made based on their side employees they they are at a rate of pay and shall be paid to the employee by the thirtieth of march each year may\nThe only thing that changes percentages they increase it but here's the is the verbiage that's important he or she shall at the end of ... yet the title to be paid that percentage of is\nOn it you really sick leave entitlement historical contract language this is what they did it two thousand twelve they changed it to say he or she shell at the end of each year titled be paid for one half of his or her on you really sick leave entitlement\nProrated on a monthly basis and Shelby paid to be employed by the last day of the month so which is it your ... your he or she shall be paid at the end of the air or shall be paid at the end of the ... right right so what it does is it takes an annual benefits\nAnd it stops to monetize it monthly but in no scenario can you be paid more than Fifteen days right well if you take five days sick time\nYou can only be paid eleven point two five days but they're still paying everybody the maximum\nBlood out oh group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nAsk you about or if you're doing it in your what do they taken all the ... time the last month what are they doing\n[noise] oh yeah you got guys for example the fire chief he took twenty four sick days right last year he took twenty four sick days but he would still pay the owners\nBut not taken sick days\nRight so he took twenty four sick days which means you is this entire allotment so it can get paid Seventy five percent of zero was how much you right right right but he also when it the bank for four days but he still got paid\nWe had a verbal the city charter specifically prohibits any type of verbal contract\nAnd under section to dash Eighteen it specifically says that any contract negotiations any benefits that are given out in the contract must be ratified by the city council and all those contracts have to go before a public hearing so the contracts says one thing right mhm\nBut Scott avid Asian said yeah but you know what guys I'm going to turn my back on it and you guys can manipulate it to get\nWhat we call the for compensation maybe you're going to get this benefit no one's ever going to find out about it so it leads me begs the question did the finance director know about it well if he didn't then he's pretty dumb because you couldn't see\nThem what's the constant hearing my mom's looking at this stuff is sign agreements hoses legal I mean how do you know it's not it's not rounded when you get\nWhen you get people that represent the taxpayers coffers the municipal dollars that is being taken from the taxpayer and you enter and suicide agreement where\nYou have your attorney the mayor the\nFire chief the fire union president you know the city finance director the chief of staff and you say OK guys\nYou're going to do all this stuff that's okay we're going to present it in the contract does this way with this language but we're going to allow you have this ambiguous language so you can actually get more than what the contract actually isn't tending to benefit from right that's called conspiracy\nTheft I mean she needs to be that it's\nFraud it's conspiracy and they need to have an investigation and these people need to be brought in on the road and Scott ... she needs to be sworn in on the road and he needs to answer for this because this is hundreds of thousands of dollars\nFor its well here's my question what's the and get in the winter I don't know no no no you know what who the investigative body attorney general that these are on the blow to come and look at this kind of thing or I mean I Know there's an on going on right now right the the uh friends are gone and having to do with this well no this is\nNot a forensic order there's an audit going on about this particular issue\nOkay the city councils on it right\nYou have to remember that for the state police to get involved they have to be requested to get involved by the mayor of by the ... and now thankfully councilman Solomon has seen is after Ken and I made our\nZone the mayor man he's now now the acting mayor interim mayor after\nWe made our presentation may asylum and looked at this and he immediately stopped this uh this behavior of how they wouldn't ... manipulating the contract\nWhich they now well you see now complained about the union is as follows agreements filing agreement\nSo it because why not if you've been if you've been allowed to steal for six years why should anybody stop\nYou well if we might not committed knowledge of contract languages or labor law would be like well past practices you know if you start to um you start to do something in practice even though it's not in the contract the union can then say well you always done it this way so now it's part of the deal\nRight but the union cannot circumvent the city charter and the owner right\nRight but then I'm just saying they're going through their process is because they say we asked for they gave us the most would you want from me right so but\nThe the the point being and can block made made a really good point with Daniel some weeks back I said look if you go to the ATM and you take out a hundred dollars and a thousand dollars comes out you can't keep it right the point being ... this is what this speaks volumes to\nYou have handwritten ledgers by the secretary and pencil and paper any race of mosques now that's supposed to go to the finance director Ernie ... who's been there for years and years then it goes to payroll nobody caught this\nSeriously so it speaks volumes as to the level of incompetence that Scott avid Asian surrounded himself with any effort to garner political favor to keep that union vote coming to him\nHow would you like motor drink plenty of gene trusted the only one Ninety nine will say hello to what boards twenty more than one fifty this ... this is anywhere you one hundred Ninety nine dollars per month only a board and he went into\nThat but I have the CD documents like sixty pounds of them\nAnyone a first year accounting students would catch this in one minute now the union said oh it's an accounting or well it it's not an accounting era it's thousands of accounting error in that new on the line found and when ...\nYou know you can sit there and you can you can blow up everybody talks about an accounting errors blown up by the fact that the the ... the union spokesman says the the thing was the site agree\nThey had a side agreement this new was wrecked\nViolation of the city ordinances and the city charter no parent mine may arrive in Asia and tried to cite deal in two thousand five\nRight where he wanted to give certain firefighters in eighty percent pay out on the pension so he actually circumvent that the city council circumvented the city charter and and the ordinances and he started paying these fire ... fire fighters\nThey had retired started paying eighty percent indirect violations city law and the council wind up filing filing a lawsuit against him and only after they filed the lawsuit did the mayor retract that so Scott out of the nation has a track record of manipulating\nContracts manipulating finances and making these little side deals\nThey what is this what is the what is the um I mean there's all kinds of legal legal shadow hearing or it's more for she'd be great if people can make a commentary on but\nWhat is what you hear on have you heard anything from ... or the current mayor what their um you know what their their inclination is to do when they find them to get this on it in the audience shows that this is an missile wide thing is going to fix it move on or no\nCan't do that and if they do that there's going to be helped pay because they need to make restitution\nNow they've they've known about this for two and a half years two and a half years ago fight she should've been brought in and executive committee and said what the hell's going on here here's the ... it's very simple this should be a no brainer that should stop these\nThese men have\nObtained money indirect violation\nOf the contract language they should be held accountable and this money should be reimbursed of the city not\n... if I was wrong being a critic of war if I if I'm wrong with my math [laughter] I Know I'm not you would think that the city would come out the fire department come up somebody would call Peter ... hero would come out and completely discredited my analysis and shut me up once and for all what\nAre you hearing you hearing crickets\nBecause they know they've been doing this this was this was\nA scheme that was concocted to benefit the firefighters so Scott avenues you would gain political favor with them not lose them during a time when all of the other unions decided for the betterment of the taxpayer we're going to take zero increases and say well\nThe firefighters didn't get an increase in their salary but they manipulated this scheme and just thousands and thousands of dollars I mean you're looking at guys that are getting you know five six thousand dollars\nWhen are we going to get what are we going to get this the result of this of this on it what's the what's going to go on with that what's gonna happen here\nOh I'm damn sure you're not going to get it till after the election I mean this has been going on since February right this has been going on since February so the point is once you have the documentation this\nTwo to three hours worth of math to go through the numbers and I'm not an account my thing is don't move his pass on the calculators a CPA\nBut I Do the analysis of two to three hours once I had all the documents so I have questions as to why is it taking so long number one and the biggest question is the city is now shut me down from access to public records I have asked\nTo usually inspect under the law the sick pay records from two thousand twelve contract they are refusing to give that to me\nAnd why why why why would never shown any up please ... ... while you're my wife ... and that happens is why these excuse\nI I question is chief of staff last night\nI said you guys are shut me down I ... and then you do that you know it's ... when you shut me down it doesn't turn out good for anybody [laughter] I Want the documents now this whole thing could have gone away a long time ago just to stop it but you didn't stop it right\nWe know that this started in two thousand twelve right so the six years worth of this manipulation by the way that when I asked to look at these binders before what they did they knowingly and willfully pulled out of the three ring binder\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common there are all in for Steve we own condition it was more than ... religion or against the wind over two hundred three on cars all makes almost had incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John John now\nThey removed all that data so I could see it\nSo when I came back I photographed every page when I came back I made a list and I cross referenced it with the guys that got paid on his on you sick pay and I found that there was like twenty five guys whose data that they removed so I made another access to public records with all the names that I wanted to see this data\nAnd three weeks later that data magically appeared and when I went to the attendance records or they get to count ability she found\nThese are all ranking officers they knowingly and willfully remove this data so I couldn't see it and also contained within that data was men who had retired and they have the handwritten calculation of how they paid them out there on you stick to the bank and that was even done wrong\nThey ... out of everything that's good professional organization and work huh here's ... notes pencil\nAnd paper eraser marks as the former fire chief\nHave anybody in the city Council on

[noise]\n\nNicer back with you again and we're taking your calls about\nYour choice for president wouldn't be in the Democrats' side and who you'd like to have coffee or a drink with\nAnd it's been a very hard for people to\nPick someone who knew the side which is a statement of the times\nThat we live in that people are so angry on both sides that they couldn't even sit down and have a cup of coffee when they're All right so that's the those that's the order of the day\nAnd you're supposed to pick oh you have two choices there to make let me know what you think and you can call in his eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine of seven thirty three thirty nine and we go to John in Seattle John you're on with mark\nHey mark\nAre you there I'm here uh okay a life or is it John Cage sick I Believe he ran for president as a Democrat and I don't know if I had a public and yeah\nShe did oh boy [laughter] well you balance the budget and\nYou know whoever can balance a budget that's who I think should run against Trump or you know ever since two thousand eight we've had quantitative easing\nWe've had just government spending that's gone on and on and on with no end in sight and some well you know the somebody's got to pay the piper on that sooner or later and I think if somebody could make a case to show that they really know how to balance a budget\nThat would be who probably would stand a chance against Trump although I probably wouldn't vote for him on pretty much of traditional values\nCan serve you know it's to me a word that is consistent with conservative and you know if it works but it ain't broke don't fix it you know something that works it's a good thing\nOr ... ... is Nikki Haley I Believe she\nHas an intellect that as a global perspective and I have a degree in anthropology and I would really like to sit down and talk to her about\nWhere she thinks waste and and the family of nations on this smaller and smaller planet but we have to learn to get along with each other and so those are my thoughts what do you think mark\nWell first of all mentioned Nikki Haley is ... is amazing because he leaves surprised me I I thought she was okay as governor of South Carolina but she's been a phenomenal a ambassador to the United nations really letting them have it\nIn a very courageous not being afraid to save like it is she's a very impressive lady I think she's going to run for president maybe you know obviously not this time but in the future\nYeah yeah yeah\nI I don't have someone with a very large perspective on who we are a nation and where we\nWe can be a good a good companion a good name for a good partner in a global perspective I think that's very important so thanks for\nThose ideas and we'll let you hold on one second 'cause I'm going to ask you your ... your answer ... question but\nI don't like John Case if there's something about the guy\nUh and he didn't come across well he did run as a Republican last time against Trump and the others there's something about him that irritates me something I mean I I don't agree with him on everything he's a little too liberal for me and that that's fine that's neither here nor there but the something personally about him\nI I think he's arrogant I think he comes across that we have heard some things about him I had a former a producer my TV show who said something about women or something like that was years ago and that's not fair that's rumor\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free on condition I bought bought any religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices log on to flood Otto John job now\nBalance budget I mean we we can't go on with a kind of spending I mean I Love this country and we have a lot of good programs like agriculture and you know we need to defend ourselves and\n... you know we we just can't keep going on every time somebody as another lobbyist that you don't want something that you just get it because they have enough money for the next campaign\nI mean that's both sides of the aisle it all and it's just been going on and on and on\nAnd they can't go on forever I mean when you get to the point where the debt\nIs bigger the gross national product you know theoretically that's bankruptcy and\nWe're we got to find a way you know we've got to find a way to to to have a better reasonable expectation about what kind of ... we can have in this country\nOne of the things I always say is people do not understand that the government\nHas no money of its own you'd be surprised maybe how many people think oh you remember the woman or during the Obama campaign the first ones that\nAre Obama's going to pay for a mortgage and pay for gas and they said where are you going to where's he going to have his stash stash you know same out of his staff ... he was going to personally pain so people don't know that they said that the government has no money of its own\nI thank you very much recall very well said and I appreciate it very much and we'll take the rest of your calls at eight six six Ninety red eye right now\nYou're a national forecast for um the tracks\nNo was climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook yeah it'll be warmer and the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S is expected to be wetter than normal\nBut no parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter\nNow NOAA warns the forecasts should not be interpreted to mean that periods of prolonged cold or heavy snows won't happen most of the country will be dry today with the exception of a place where we don't need any more rain and that's in Texas\nOr there was no cooperation all that kind of stuff\nBut there are other senators like uh what's her name Hi Heidi Heitkamp whatever name as a she's a big trouble and in fact the way it works is the\nWhole ... a cabinet fiasco something Republicans just the Democrats were always be there are always ready to go out there and do anything they could to go against Trump but now you've got Republicans motivated and in fact of having a hadn't won I think they would have been so demoralized would have been worse but our problems are in the house\nThe house of representatives because it is quite possible that the Democrats could take back the house and as I've said for the last few nice if they take back the house\nYou're in the Capitol hearing will pale in comparison to what they'll do trying to impeach Kevin I'm trying to teach Trump\nWith hearings with subpoena powers or with calling for their impeachment he's not going to be fun\nNo it's I think it's going to get ugly I personally but that that happens I think that uh nothing good will come out of that I promise\nYou that that would be crazy I mean I I honestly didn't\nLeave anything forward said to me I didn't really do any of it didn't die down critical to me um [noise]\nI mean I did a lot of background I have it all and he just seemed like the most honest I have one of the water the what what are the best judges that are on there as of right now in my opinion I mean he got old yeah nui senator we've got you\nI was going to say the he seems like a decent guy and you as you started to say over three hundred opinions or whatever but the fact is you know in her case I just think that we're using her as long as we're talking about\nWho should run for president a Democrat side a ... book or in a column that because of his own the yeah the Kamala Harris they they were just using that woman maybe maybe she imagined it now if someone didn't do that assault on her all\nAuto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nDifficulty with the horror of what was it really was it well then we live in Oregon was he was yeah that's what Lindsey Graham was so good when he came out and said\nI'm not going to put up with this stuff you guys are doing this for power you yeah you know now how to be ashamed of yourself what you're willing to do and but that said they are they ought to be yeah well thank you so much for the [noise]\nAbsolutely I'll I'll definitely call back again\nWell thanks so much to him and uh yeah Joe Manchin would be good picky seems like a decent guy uh like I said I don't it's not fair for me to take away some of his courage uh when he seems so nice and and reasonable and I think he is going to win but someone who is less than ... and I said I Would mention this\nIs Hillary I'd love to see Hillary run again a for selfish reasons I think she is going to run again because these guys\nMeaning Hillary and bill they can't keep away from power\nThat's what the what is an aphrodisiac people say so and the Democrats even have figured that out they don't even want her to enter the fray she's viewed as the kiss of death for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm election\nForcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors by the way that makes sense because I sit on the air for many months now you know she's still looking to see a why she lost\nLike she's going to come out I suggested she'll come out with a book a hundred and one reasons why I lost in none of them will be her I have nothing to do with her\nAnd I said she could join the OJ Simpson as he looks for the killer to figure out who killed his wife but few Democrats are willing to embrace Clinton on the campaign trail despite the party's near universal support for just two years ago\nWith many concern that a high profile Clinton presence would only dampen the party's prospects of retaking control of Washington from Republicans yeah and they're worried about her throughout the mid term elections Clinton is rarely rally together with other candidates appearing mostly at low key fundraisers and loyalty 'cause you can't get many people to show up\nShe's the kiss of death won a party official said I'm telling the Washington Examiner Democrats don't want her to campaign for them because everywhere she goes she carries the stench of death when it's worse than I thought\nAnd it's the only political figure in America that has less popular than Donald Trump stretches that and that's a real testament to her\nDemocrats were relieved that the bill and Hillary Clinton announced that there international Thirteen city speaking to her wouldn't begin until after November now that\nThat was a clever move I think they're measuring how they can have the best positive impact than have time decided to wait until after the election and that's what Dick Durbin of Illinois said\nA house Democrats segment of that saying when I think the people who have been part of our pushed to retake the house I just don't think of them at all I think it's a very good things and they're not being visible it wouldn't help our candidates\nBoy one minute you're the nominee for the Democratic party and the next minute they don't want to see anymore maybe that's part of the problem these guys don't know when to get off the stage\nActually but I liked that Hillary can in twenty twenty I liked the sound of it and I like our possibility that she could run up you know like our Sam's she can run forever right but don't we have\nFor ever since forever bill and Hillary who'd run you never get rid of them actually I can take them a lot better than Brock Obama right most presidents when they leave office they they're quiet and give that credit to George W. Bush\nBut not for Iraq Obama he's in there he can't sit still he can't keep quiet\nSo maybe Hillary and bill they do have some redeeming value for those of us on our side because if they run again like if he runs again\nI think she's going to lose I think we got to get something going on our side Hillary for president in twenty twenty tell me what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine or ... the same number thirty three thirty nine mark gosh they're filling in on right on the radio\nMuch do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years but today's technology brings us other options to consider it's better quality\nUnlike mineral oils synthetic oils have a consistent molecular restructure giving it the ability to support pressures from Ira horse power engines especially at lower rpm ... it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy very cleaner\nSynthetic pick up fewer contaminants as they do there\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood foreigners over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nAnd semi synthetic oil may be a bigger investment up front but the benefits of its high quality composition will pay off in the long run this report is the surface of ...\n... with ... radio toll free at age ... he wrote a [noise]\nDish H.
