B. R. O. B. Y. leads me to be an hour and a few laughs along the way [noise]\nDinner gossip is a a labor attorney usually management side works for cities and towns all over Rhode Island is considered an expert in this field\nOr just curious about the validity in the the legality of site agreements and and then I always considered just sign agreements just to be completely just by their nature invalid but you're saying side agreements happened as long as they're ratified then they're part of the contract and you're good in this you\nKnow it's just a name that you know it's it's just a description if you will write but aside\nAgreement is a collective bargaining agreement it's\nMade between a representative of the union representative of the minister out\nIt's just usually doesn't happen in the beginning when the entire contractors decided it just happened to be nine terms or something like\nThat yet what they call in the decades oriental the middle of the contract kinds of issues arise but again it's got to be ratified it\nThat it and ratified it's a valid single subject collective bargaining green\nRight and so if it's not ratified but yet carried out as if it had been and somebody finds out about it what\nSort of relief or or recompense Kan city get from people who have been collecting money supposedly illegally\nOr a couple of our first and foremost I mean that's the power that he was on the defensive defending a grievance that allegedly arises from a violation of the side of grain that's so cool site agree that it has an affirmative defense\nThe site agreement is invalid and on and force in terms of any um any other remedy I mean is a pilot he may have on discovering that is a\nSpider Man out there that may not have been properly ratified or they may be\nClaims for restitution for unjust enrichment of certain employees under the terms of the agreement\n[noise] um and other forms of relief but that would be dependent upon the\nNature of the side agreement that particular effects\nSo if you somebody you know she was in the case of war but if somebody was found to be getting an extra payments for something that was done in a side agreement was ratified they have to pay that back individually\nIt's impossible that possibility that could be a claim made for restitution at the ... the a cash conversion if you will of leave to uh\nTo body was a maid pursuant to an unlawful agreement an unjust enrichment would serve as a basis to recoup some of that money\nIf you have people who are in political positions or appointed positions who are you know fire chiefs who are on this key any collective bargaining agency ... negotiated between the city and a collective bargaining agency who knowingly get into an agreement that they know is not\nValid because it wasn't ratified and executed anyway\nAre they criminally liable have they are they they committed a crime at that point\n[noise] well that's a pretty that's a pretty broad they and it would again be\nBy the facts whether or not somebody knowingly and willfully entered into a lawful agree then uh to\nHow would you like motor drenched twenty eight gene trucks will be your only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty more than one best friend for the best friends anywhere one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a flood board and he went into and they were\nUnder the construct of aside agree and then\nThere's always that possibility what I find in my practice is that oftentimes municipal officials may good faith mistakes and those mistakes that based on ignorance and I use that word in the sense of it's a ... not knowing\nWhat the law is a there's some belief out there that aside agreement can be made at any point in time during the life of a of a collective bargaining agreement and if the union\nAnd a manager agree upon it it's somehow a enforceable and that's why when I\nGive presentations to the league of cities and towns and I speak to elected and appointed officials I remind them that they should always consider whether or not subject matter is that they are negotiating I read the mandatory or permissive lawful or unlawful whatever agreements they strike\nBe sure that those agreements are presented to the proper corporate authorities within them in his ... otherwise the agreement is voice I'm going to give you one example\nI can I just say one real quick to thing to you I I I Know that you're being you're a lawyer and you have to be exact and your speech and you have to be exact and you and your\nUm in the possibilities whenever speaking about this when I see more blunt well just I'm just thinking as an observer as somebody seen this I find it\nWholly unbelievable that any fire chief or any cheap many department\nOr any solicitor or anybody who's the head of a union who are pretty much experts in the stuff that they use it all the time anyway could ever get into a side agreement and ... and not know that ... doesn't have that has to be ratified that's that's beyond my ... my my belief I mean how can\nI can see why you hold that believe yeah uh I can tell you that I have seen people that are completely ignorant uh to what should be done now whether or not people are acting in various ways uh again that\nThat's dependent upon the particular circumstances but most of my clients a sensitized\nTo the to the fact that they don't strike deals unless they follow the proper process and I'm certainly these questions of bound in the in the war were sick leave grievance and ultimately the grieving process will play that out but\nYou know a unions are very crafty\nAh about side stepping if you will uh the\nThe formalities of ratification and uh you know one case I had in Providence involved so called minimum staffing provision communications division I couldn't find anything in the main collective bargaining agreement about minimum staffing\nPut this factories and when the case was being ready for arbitration I show up at the operation and learned that the union had a Nineteen and a half year old ... belated arbitration award\nWould they showed up at ... and said we're going to agree to minimum staffing in the\nPolice dispatch operation\nAnd of course my reaction was Nineteen and a half years old even if it was a valid collective bargaining agreement and even if it was ballad a as having been ratified collective bargaining agreement to limited to three years and duration right\nWell yeah I have a traitor wound up enforcing that stipulated award and I went to superior court and justice ... Cheney very wisely vacated the award\nAnd the union asserted that while we make these deals all the time that's part of our living relationship with the city and those stipulated awards adjusted as valid as a main collective bargaining agreement\nTo which the judge responded\nWell that really puts any city in town at a disadvantage holiday to divine whether or not these agreements exist and wherever they kept it wherever they maintained and was stipulated arbitration or whatever blessed by the city council\nBeen I'm gonna run to the news are up against time thank you for clarifying all this as much as you would hope that helps thank you ... and then we can talk about this we come back\nHe's gay because he was one of the\nPlane tapering off not before ... times when forty to fifty miles per hour down trees in power line by fifty four ... shower late tonight the bridges Hobbs tomorrow heroes exclusive actually run Cary Sherman\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln M.

grievance and that was appealed to my office and then at that point it's up to me to uphold that the denial or reverse that denial I upheld that than I ... and I stood behind the chief finding that the document was not properly\nThey're still getting their their sick time bone is it's just not calculate ahead without based\nOn this um\nThis site agreement that appeared now based on\nLet's talk about when we talk about that side agreement for a second I mean is it or is it beyond or is there any any sort of the definition or any sort of a type of site agreement that you could ever possibly see being legal in the city of war for any ... chief executives to make with any sort of union outside of the council purview\nAs well as the eye and the uh originator of ratification by the city council of any agreements entered into of this nature I can tell you that if there's going to be any amendment to an agreement\nOr if there's going to be agreement at all and requires the ratification of the legislative branch of government which is the city council to making it\nRight in agreement and that's what happens ah and then if it's ratified it uh it uh you know it becomes implement\nThat sure I'm so there's no sense in other words there's no such thing as side deals with mayors of any kind of ...\nWell that I I don't know if there's any such thing as side deals but let's just not legal thing is\nA ... ... ... and farce civil five deals underneath the\nOrder that currently exist in the city of civil this which\nOf which I was one of the I in fact I was the original sponsor of that or\nThere's an audit going on right now in the city for this issue right there are ...\nThey're a tool and it's going on right now that there's one going on by the council auditors are that the council president role at commissioned in a way to get to the bottom and get some factual information on this also and there's also when or where uh the bargaining group the firefighters bog in a group of firefighters union\nUm all the routine and I as an order thing for him to perform in order to also so that there probably will be a the results of to put to audit pursuant to this particular issue boating calculation and I would think you know the manner\nIf for whatever reason we find out that there was improper payment made these firefighters for for sick time will you seek restitution from them\nWell not if it's tough to say at this time simply because um that would be reaching a conclusion a conclusion that I cannot make at this point we're not having all the facts before me\nIf there's a ... it's not just\nThe numerical number or that there are other factors involved relative to legality and I wait the findings of the APA trader and and now they want to paint any finding our of our ... hypothetical actions based\nOn a finding a are you going all over again would you support an advocate for these order to be made public\nOh I there's there's nothing or listen as far as I'm sure it all documents should be public accept something that uh that are related to things of that nature Mm that an individual uh is entitled to their privacy for right but the ... you know\nI I Am all for open government and you know\nKnow there was a question about there being a non disclosure thing with the audit firms where they can't disclose this stuff so I mean well well maybe the\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nUh that maybe the ... the party that commissioned the audit but\nI think the party that receives the audit enjoys the benefit of the results of those ... wants to see them otherwise what's the purpose of an audit right I mean to keep it private nah it's up\nTo make any sense right what does the search so if but if you find that there is a you know there's there's evidence that this was wrongly given out to firefighters for whatever reason will you then seek for either state police or some law enforcement agency to figure out who made the deal how we're against against city law\nWell you know the thing is this going out for a legal enforcement of such a thing in a criminal nature ah requires intent if there is criminal intent involved\nIf it's a civil nature there's a different way to approach it for restitution and I can't I Can't make a conclusion on either side of that without seeing all the facts and the results of those facts as they come back right but that's what I mean I I I Can't commit to you know we're going to hang everybody higher I Can't commit to we're going to get all that money back\nAgain um you have to look at a uh all factors to recipients participation or the intent of individuals' there's there's many many\nIf you expect to get the evidence of intent from an audit\nHot now but that would probably uh I I Would think that the any findings of a um\nArbitration would give you some factual information that if there was any indication of some sort of malicious intent\nOr or or are you know criminal intent or something of that nature ... that are at that point the responsible parties would turn that over to legal authorities for for ... ... you know as a criminal thing right but you can't\nProceed on hypothetical basis what if what you know I might buy a ... million tickets and I went you know I I don't know what number I'm going to play right but I'd like to win it yeah\nI just think that you know just knowing where your mindset is going into and what you're predisposed to do is important for people to know because I think it's a big issue if somebody's making side deals that somebody's gonna pay for ...\nAnd you know something I I'm all for equal enforcement I'm all for equal treatment I'm all for open government I'm all for disclosure but I cannot reach a conclusion on any issue until until I have all those facts before me mirror and when I Do when I Do you ... you will be you'll hear me loud and clear\nAll right man I Know you're going to run up against the clock to we have limited time thank you for

suspicious package which the Associated Press reported was addressed to Maxine Waters of California the FBI later confirmed that it had recovered two packages addressed to waters\nThat were similar to the five that referenced and its earlier statement the LA police department tweeted that its bomb squad had rendered the package at the male facility safe and that the investigation will be turned over to the FBI\nOr you don't want I I find interesting here again this has been over the last three days as we know still nothing from the FBI as to whether they were actually lied working bombs or

B. R. O. [noise]\n\nAnd try and radio he's are probably I'm very McNamara we just have the greatest audio cut of the day coming up following the bottom of your house yeah we do live it's ... it's a political ad that if you haven't heard if you want to hear\nClaire McCaskill's ad that radio ad that she started running in Missouri the Democrats and the Democrat\nCalling other Democrats crazy Democrat and not one of the crazy Democrats yeah Albert in Texas Albert welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show high Albert\nHey good morning Eric uh Gary first time caller I was calling to let you know that the FBI is doing a very thorough investigation here and so it won't become a boot political issue they'll let us know till after the November election\n[laughter] that were real or not [laughter] yes I Will say good oversight committee and get your masters and that won't happen so [laughter] yeah I Will have to declassify it uh yeah well\nThey now you know that the the things that other ... and yeah thanks that's because we we saw what you're going to say we we knew where you were a don't we were going with a ... it's a it is fascinating because it is something look at isn't that the number one question that you would want to ask is a reporter\nMhm that report them I'm sure they're gonna have a press conference today some part is going to ask because the was are where the bombs Leiber\nNot right where they you know we're we're could they have been a detonated by opening the package because the concern is not just a you know about you know the message being sent or the intent of the person or persons responsible\nBut also about the threat that is still or might still be out there in in the system because let's say that they were going or are going through stages where they're reaching out to these individuals first and then there are others on their list\nWell the concern would be by you know the the package handlers and people that might even be walking on a ... up to a porch\nAnd and they see something worth these devices ready to go off could they have been detonated a rapidly either remotely or by opening\nA package I think that's information that needs to be made a available to the public as soon as possible you know without impeding the investigation itself if possible [noise]\nAh just we got to bring this up quickly I I haven't checked the overnight markets you know I haven't I haven't checked but six hundred down down yesterday and the the doubt as he also down ... down I think was it four points four percent yesterday and\nYeah yeah uh the\nUh the Dow down over six hundred and and a lot of that had to do with earnings and and we're hearing more and more ah companies come out and say that the earnings are suffering as a result of what's going on uh the chairs from retaliatory tariffs by trade partners is having an impact on on business\nSo overnight as it is up and which I which you might expect ... all the Asian markets are down one percent three the three percent right\nThe Japanese market down three percent a Shanghai up a little bit above ... percent yeah uh Europe a mixture over in Europe so we'll see whether it's just a correction whether there's really worry\nWe know there was in the housing market and we know for example about you know for them and and St look thanks for all the banks for all the help with the tax cuts but the terrorists are killing us and and\nSomething like what happened yesterday on the news playing out makes a lot of people nervous and and of course the the markets because one possible you have to consider is that it was a foreign enemy a that was that was involved are responsible\nFor these suspicious packages and and the the concern that it might not be over or something else might happen we it was a lot of uncertainty yesterday\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free on condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices flood onto flood Otto John job now\nStory as as you saw yesterday or that does make the the market's very nervous so uh we'll see where it\nWell ... and that's something that was you know was was brought up a yesterday by you know some of the experts say look you know there's there's three things that could be it could be somebody in their right it could be somebody in the lab it could also be a foreign entity\nRight you know just to disrupt the American you know an electoral process or it could be just terrorists yeah who have decided to do it again which that's that's why we find it surprising\nThat are so late into this because it's been three days ...\nA bomb initially that nobody has stated whether these were active lie bombs that would have gone off right if ... if somebody would have touched it in a different way right apparently they were handled it didn't go off\nWell because I Would think that if there was a threat of these devices going off whether they could be set off a remotely or by the handling the package itself that we would see that warning come out by authorities would we not\nYeah because if we learned that that was the case and they didn't warn the public and there was still a possibility of such devices being in the mail system or being out there in in the public and it's still being a threat to the public\nBeyond that the intended recipient recipients over the past few days that they would want to get that message out and and we will be hearing that I Would think that and if we hear that that you know that they were armed and and they didn't say at the most someone's going to have to answer that were on a track here's your forecast\nWet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast\nAs well as a system out of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes\nAnd that system will sweep as far back as the northern plains to provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan and upstate New York the south will be drying out today the deep south as well as the southern plains Texas dry this weekend\nFiguring out Missouri 'cause I don't know what Missouri's problems are when you're inside Missouri ... when you're inside of a time limit of town you know more what their their or state you know more of what their challenges some problems are especially if you've been there a long time but it was interesting too so I understand uh\nThe the the fact of of using the pre existing conditions because all Democrats are using that Schumer said we've got to go and we've got to hit that so you knew that was going to be the messaging\nOr not you're not surprised or shocked but very interested in the fact that the biggest issue was mentioned twice was the terrorists now I don't know why you take valuable time because if if you believe as a Democrat\nThat the terrorists that are on products that are hurting farmers in the mid west\nAnd you believe in and you you you mentioned it\nYou know whites okay because you believe it's important you also know or you believe is we had we said this way back when in springtime\nOr you know we'd set this when when the uh weight before that we saw this one the Republicans passed the health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but has used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been mhm\nSo you've got that and you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned at the white in there because you believe that there is a significant number of people who might be attracted to that anti terrorist message\nThat Trump has been so louder mhm\nWhy are you throwing in and wasting any valuable time in a commercial about when he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody knows that when you're an attorney general here ... you don't work hourly you're\nNot you're and you're you're you're really you're on your ever or on the work you're not if they're all\nRight so if you're sitting there and say oh okay I'm going to go out and got to stop by and get a bottle of wine or something like that or I go to the gym during the day because\nThat's a lot of people to go to the gym today when best time to go or you know but but that's it it they didn't ... there was no real focus honestly they would have been better to leave that out completely and joke goes straight onto the crazy Democrat well [laughter]\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our high car buyers are tough\nI Can't think of his name uh didn't he ended up running for da\nA jak yeah jak ran for ... he was he became ... now did did the opposition ever use the fact that they they ring ring or are in their office [laughter] we've always talked weight loss and them on TV I mean I drink [laughter] they drink all the time after application win or lose try to run their drinking at the end of the day and they're often not wine\nLike ... it was hard liquor they're always renting we thought\nAnd so when I heard that I Would come on come on if they're if they're prosecutors they all drink\nI [laughter] but but\nYet when we had ... getting back to the ad and you said there certainly are on the show that because we focused in on using the term crazy Democrat instead of using the term ex dream is Democrat yes for leadership of the Democratic rights right\nThere's the verbiage is clearly some kind of response that they got verbatim they were hearing that repeatedly that phrase crazy Democrats by people in their cola the ... their internal were showing that this was a ... they you know this was a way a hot button\nOr that they could connect to some of those undecideds right now those independents who were leaning right at that moment and the concern they had was the crazy Democrats the ... that's that's why that was used\nIt was used and directly came from a likely from that that kind of call out research response that you get the because there's there's no other way there's no other reason\nTo put that in and that that becomes what the Hail Mary in this really neck and neck dead heat race in Missouri it is I mean it's out of all of them I think it's probably a if it's not the closest it's pretty pretty close to the closest Senate race right now uh so\nI think it's it's um clear that they want them to connect with those people that are leaning right that her independence that are winning right might otherwise vote for him a castle the problem in that is for her actions is specifically with with capital\nBecause in siding with her party in Kavanaugh you were condoning that kind of behavior right and you can come out and say no I just wasn't sure and I need to be short when we see that doesn't sorry perception is reality especially\nIn in in this kind of situation that is that is going to end could well that issue this side and many of these races the uh the outcome of the the Kavanaugh situation\nAnd and when you look at the polling there in in Missouri to begin with a a if you look at the September of polling a you know as the CNN a McCaskill was up by by by three with ah with likely voters and you get to the Fox news poll which was\nUp until I was nine twenty nine to tend to and it was a tie and then you know it through that whole time the cabin all thing in ... Missouri scout a huge sample of of over twelve hundred likely voters\nAnd holy up one still margin of error is to point seven right uh and still nobody has hit the fifty percent mark so there's still a ton of undecided there the\nUsing that term crazy Democrats a Democrat using that in an ad by the way apparently ticked off other Democrats in Missouri ... I was reading an article on that earlier a but using that term means that the undecideds are talking about it\nThe undecided that's part of their mind set you know the Democrats are crazy these are crazy Democrats now that had to come directly from cabinet yeah because for that to be to do it for that to go to the level of\nUh from fringe to extremists too I just read my leadership too crazy Democrats mean that exact term they're not stir crazy that is the mindset that they view when a significant portion\nOf undecided independents in Missouri that she's trying to get aboard I'm not part of the Democrats I'm not part of the crazy Democrats I I I I think for myself I'll go to the middle I Will compromise which means mutt you'll compromise with Republicans and\nYeah\nYou know it's it's a ... this is why you have this race that you have here it's not because her opponent\nIs is is this big great strong opponent it's because there's weakness across the board and [laughter]\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free on condition I bought bought any religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices flood onto flood Otto John job now\n... vote for or the cast that's you know that that that's a given but those people in the middle and this is what we've been talking about for a long long time those are the ones that may vote one way or the other insurance for one party or the other and they're the ones you have to convince\nThey're the ones that get you over the top and right now she has too many weaknesses that that are that really don't serve her well with either side and I think that comes directly or certainly her vote on Kavanaugh was an indication of weakness\nIf if it didn't help create well you know there's it's it's one thing you know you you can uh the the uh\nInsults the uh the accusations against Donald Trump being crazy being not you know everything that you might remember the whole mental health thing that has sort of disappeared hasn't it\nYeah but he's mentally ill and all that but you know you can look at that and you say okay that's that's an attack it's always thrown at at one person the president always gets that yet but we're talking about a political party as a whole\nWe've been talking about the the the Democrats from twenty sixteen where they said look we've got to go and figure out what the people the heartland is\nAre going and we said back then we said yeah but they're they're talking crazy stuff\nThey're talking you know the whole transgender saying\nLook we have compassion for everybody\nBut if you think your if you think you're a man and you're a woman doesn't make you a man and it doesn't make a man and shouldn't make you want and legally when you shouldn't as a man be able to compete against a woman in the past majority of Americans believe that the trans racial thing\nThat they started adopting President Obama before he left office talking about the fact that he's come to know that race is a social construct no it's not\nRight and and so we talked about that craziness well it's gotten to the point if it's no longer the Democrats in order for Claire McCaskill the put that in the concern is no longer the Democrats aren't relating to the average person it's at the average person has now joined the Democrats as crazy ... and the capital thing I Believe is what put them over the top\nYeah and and and that behavior by the way as we pointed out not from protesters from from the high ranking officials and and and members of the party on those committees\nClaire McCaskill's now as a Democrat believe she's fighting against the crazy Democrats ... eight six six

I Am your host\nI'm also president of the Rhode Island association of realtors for the two thousand an Eighteen year and we have as usual a special guest this week they've called well from the Rhode Island builders association and we're going to be talking about amongst other things green construction\nAnd they tell us a little bit about what you do as a builder and then also\nIn Port Rhode Island builders association sure thank you Joe until about two weeks ago I was the president of the builders association on the immediate past president will you'll be a rye are here and a couple of months that they write wonderful mhm\nPresident number at us if you will yeah my family's from was started in Nineteen sixty eight by my father and he was building solar houses in the seventies oh wow and I am now the vice president kind of the operations manager he's still president ... charge of the owns that company George ... but we have a pretty long history in the\nFamily of being very attuned to energy efficient construction methods soon we consider that a real hallmark of our of our company okay now for the listeners did aren't aware what our\nEnergy efficient um methods of construction how would you you know quantify that\nIn the simplest possible terms we say build at titan and ventilated right okay that that's the baseline of what you want to do All right\nSo now when you when you're building a tight and that means you know all the the air energy will stay inside the air will stay inside and have to ventilated so that you get fresh air and to get rid of anything like access rate on gases and things like that is that accurate\nAnd that is accurate do you want to make sure you have nice healthy fresh air in the house when we were getting into energy efficiency in the seventies during the oil shocks and\nPeople started to build houses very tight right sometimes they used um materials back then you might have heard that from El Biden solution or even going back in time people's used building materials this best us and led way way back when I deal with that over the history of many\nHouses and as you and the real estate profession no one has more exposure no pun intended and to the issues of all around the ... and lead ride and real soon it's good to your association makes a large part of that in your disclosures in educating your agents to understand these things it's very helpful to the buyers right\nBut we didn't understand the building that houses that tight uh impact that some of the indoor air quality nowadays they require mechanical ventilation of kinds to make sure the indoor air quality is good when done correctly the number one piece of feedback we're about our houses is how\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty four fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for only a flood forward in eastern enjoy it\nA lot of discussions about how that was incentivize and how they're using some of that land right now is I'm from a builders perspective that they're taking some of the land that could be best suited to develop housing right is somewhat problematical rather we can put a lot of photovoltaics and ... and a lot of places where we build anything right\nSo that's an issue right now that are open for discussion and oh the realtors are involved in that we are are medical community the building communities sort of think through some of this large scale photovoltaic\nDevelopment which we all like the idea of renewables have done in some manner of economic sanity [noise]\nBut you are capturing capturing a good deal of high dry land right now that could be in my opinion better suited for other things\nYeah I totally agree with that I'm On the actual I'm involved with the Cumberland conservation commission and that's an issue that we talked about this past year\nBecause there's a plot of land in town that you know could be used for a residential development could be used for solar panels and uh you know something that we are paying attention to because again of everything with real estate there's only so much land available so you want to try and find its highest and best use\nAnd perhaps converting a big tractor farmland to a solar panel field is not the best way to you know utilize that land\nI Would tend to agree with that exactly a lot of things we need to think about but in general we we do have a bit of a housing problem mhm turning into a major housing Brad one man we're short housing production by several thousand units a year and have been for a number of years so right [noise] uh we we may need to have a discussion about that\nAnd that ... and that's a

neighborhood you want to move to just go to\nOur eyes living dot com and you can find all the information you need and you just click on their resources tab and everything will pop up you can even get heat map set already living dot com [noise]\nWe are here with our special guest David Caldwell and we're talking about\nGreen homes new home construction before the break we had mentioned how we need new homes to be built where a couple of thousand homes a year short of where we need to be Dave is that true\n[noise] I Would say a good twenty five hundred right now Ford in Rhode Island housing and Brian university has some good studies to show how our lack of supply is now causing prices to go up right and I'm beyond the wage increases that make it affordable for a lot of our first time a new down by her specifically\nRight so and folks those are two sources that are not the Rhode Island association a realtor so it's not coming from folks that want to sell you homes but I Want to point out that you know if you are looking for a home and you you want to buy a home of course the first thing you want to do is go to our living dot com and click on to find a real tore tab\nAnd if you want to build a home you should really consider building a green home home is going to be energy efficient\nIt's going to conserve energy that used to heat or cool it and then also\nDo at any cost effective way\nUm and you should look for a builder that is experienced and has I guess the appropriate certifications in building green homes [noise]\nUm so if someone were to speak with a builder tell us a little bit about what would be be involved in other words what are the things you want to cover with a a neophyte homebuyer or home builder sure\nNumber one would be identifying your budget you know be would be key but when it comes to the idea of building and energy efficient home it confuses a lot of people because they're talking about price right or large scale as you know with your clients that it's this is an intimidating purchase a lot of people that I just never going to build they're going to buy a\nThirty year commitment and yeah it's a substantial\nAmount of their network and income [noise]\nSo I use the analogy that if you're going to buy a new car and you go out to the car lot and and see two cars that are identical in every respect and one of them costs thirty thousand dollars in one of them cause thirty thousand six hundred dollars and\nYou know that's the only thing you know and they look identical in every respect which one are you going to buy you buy the one for thirty grand ... why would I spend the extra six hundred bucks\nNow if I told you the one for six hundred dollars extra guts triple the gas mileage out running the numbers and first inclination is going to be well that sounds like a better deal right I understand the value of the six hundred bucks and\nSo we try to explain that to people to when you're building a new home it you're in the two or three percent range to make an EnergyStar right yeah that's it and think about it from the get go and when you explain that to people\nAnd makes total sense this and why wouldn't you do that right by the way you know it's probably less than that because you get the Energy Star incentives and really has two percent all and yet doesn't cost anything extra\nHow would you like motor trench twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for only a flood forward and he went into all\nSorts of things on my house is a hundred years old and remodeled it but we got it\nAnd you know my my third for masters we doesn't need heat in a while and I literally have you know no heat up there a while in insulated so well and then he just comes up to the house yeah\nAnd we we have a radiator one radiator but it's been turned off I never turned it on us when we've been there one year yeah that's essentially from the spray foam a package that we put in the back of the roof ... which will be unbearable up there if you didn't have that it'd be freezing cold in the winter and it would be boiling out in the summer like and you know he's been in the\nBoiler yep and you know folks I Want to point out 'cause uh David may have mentioned something about insulation that pink fluffy stuff you see in the attic and as a realtor I I I've been in literally thousands of homes\nAnd I have seen 'em workman ship done by the homeowner and I always tell my buyers as we're walking through these homes to quote you want to\nRemember is just because you can doesn't mean you should and I have seen insulation that was installed backwards and homes um I've seen insulation that was installed you know compressed too much so that it doesn't function [noise]\nUm and and that's just talking about insulation never mind if you're looking at how light fixtures are ... you know are installed or other you know a contractor issues that people try to save money on just because they can buy stuff at a big box store [laughter]\nSometimes you need to really think about whether you should hire a professional and I always talk about about a year or so ago there was I don't know if you remember this day in the I was an eye on TV [noise] there was a home in Somerset, Massachusetts that blew up\nAnd just ceased to exist it was it so efficiently blew up that there was nothing left of the house and it was\nA boiler that was installed by the home on it was they replaced the gas boiler and thank God no one was in the house\nBut it blew up in the house with shifted they showed it there was nothing left of the house other than the chimney\nAnd things like that he probably saved a couple of thousand bucks or so putting the boiling himself\n[noise] but then what happened than he has insurance company probably didn't cover that because it wasn't installed by license plumber\nAnd I was so folks it that's why it's very important to always work with a professional license and insured individual when you're getting involved with the largest real estate transaction of your life or maintaining\nThe largest thing that you're going to purchase and their life use a fulltime experienced realtor or even a part time experience realtor and then of course a licensed\nInsured contractor if it's a plumber electrician a builder general contractor you want someone who is license and don't forget books you can't interview your contract as ask them\nFor copies of their insurance you can ask them questions about how they work and make sure you're comfortable working with them and you should also probably reach out to Rhode Island builders association to make sure it someone that's in good standing um and even preferably a member of right\nThey've sure the number one thing that would look at it as the state of Rhode Island's contractors registration and licensing board website ... so you can get your contractors registration number and see that their current all their insurance isn't workman's comp and that they've [noise]\nYou know been in business for a while and don't have any complaints against them or investigations would specifically judgments mhm what you're looking for and that's all available on line for the state or the island\nAnd then the word on builders association is an excellent source there for three eight Seventy four hundred okay so I guess that's another source you can look at but we would encourage you to say over Donald builders association members generally speaking held to a higher standard than someone who just has a relations\nRight now folks I Want to point something out because I'm just going to veer off from the construction and green construction of homes for a moment I Want to talk about sales real estate sales [noise] there's been a little bit of banter and the national media and the business channels up out of\nThe real estate market is heading for a downturn it's there's a bubble and they use and all those terms that people can remember [noise]\nThe data I just want to make it clear that data does not support\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition I bought bought any religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices flood onto flood Otto John job now\nIs a lot of demand there they're going to continue to buying houses the numbers of millennials who were entering that age where people buy homes and increasing every year for the next couple of years [noise]\nAnd also bank of America I just heard this today bank of America uh did some research and found that millennials actually value home ownership more then marriage\nSo based on that metric alone that bodes well for demand going forward interest rates are still at historic lows okay the average rate the historical average rate for thirty year fixed rate mortgage is eight and we're still barely into the fives\nAnd even if they raise it for more times we're still going to be significant in the next year or so they're going to we're still going to be significantly below that historic average of eight percent\nSo it that's something to bear in mind as if you're contemplating getting into the real estate market upgrading downgrading I'm doing anything with a home it's still a great time because rates are still really low\nUm especially if you want to build a home okay um it's dynamite time to do so and I'd have to do with a\nContract contact a member of the Rhode Island builders association\nAnd you are listening to our I living radio here with deep Caldwell from the Rhode Island ... and we're talking about the need for new construction we touched on this a little bit earlier\nAnd conventional wisdom is that when you're talking about green construction you think of a home and I really rural area by itself on a large piece of land and maybe has a wind turbine and all this other stuff\nBut that is not actually the most efficient or most green quote unquote home isn't\nThat is not a what the real encouragement would be from true green building advocates it'd be high density living keeping the all the\nThe living areas the business the other development and more concentrated blocks larger open spaces right and the market seems to want that the consumers seem to like that and the builders like that because building the infrastructure is very expensive writer paving roads and\nMaking these two and four and five acre lots now there's places for that out there or being rural would be appropriate mhm where some people want to live deep in the woods that's fine if you're twenty acres but\nLarry's around there against the ... pretty well developed already and um I'll just use a you know north ... down where the village of work for right as an idyllic\nLying eyes is one of the great main streets in America\nAnd but the village and zoning district now it's been over latest half acre lots right uh so we we need to get some water sewer and\nStorm water infrastructure and some of these places and building higher density is a multi families if you see what we used to build around the you know Providence to tuck it back in the day it's actually very efficient housing stock right and um we're gonna have to get back to some of that to make\nMake this all work so we can make sure that the next generation millennials says that opportunity for home ownership because it might be a one bedroom condo or studio it might be a multi family to get them in\nThe home ownership cycle and many of our seniors are looking to downsize mhm out of the house they own into something that's more appropriate\nRight exactly and right after the break we're going to come back and talk about another benefit to having dense housing stock like that after these messages\nNews talk six
