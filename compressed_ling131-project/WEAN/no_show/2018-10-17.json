Providence former ambassador former former former and current\n[noise] developer [noise] owns half of town for crying out of [noise] um [noise]\nJoe is is playing a little bit of a hedge game politically you starting to speak out on this mayor's race in some of the mayoral issues\nI I don't I don't know who\nWho he's kidding in what in what punchy pulling it seems to me that he's he's been advocating for Didi Whitman who is the opponent in this race who was a complete I Will not a complete not quite yet a complete but she's kind of like an anomaly\nTo me I I Can't figure out\nI really can't she's she's an energetic and she's got a spirit and she's\nA well spoken and she's a seemingly pretty smart but\nShe hasn't shown me a lot in terms of preparation and getting into the weeds on the issues that's for sure I had her on on on the television show last week and uh she made a she made an interesting inverted point she didn't have the facts correctly but she made a point about the bus strike that I thought was salient\nIn terms of language that the contract allowed for which may have which may have allow for for students the bus company to um you know ride pain free all pun intended through this bus drag on\nThe idea that they were paid six hundred thousand dollars to close this deal is a mind blower to me ah I talked to me or laws about that on the television show two nights ago\nAnd we might play that conversation for you but since we began talking about some of the silly politics and the city Providence let's talk about this well yeah I I I like inspect your family and always have but he's the he's you sometimes you play the too cute on the question of endorsement or we have the audio eh let's see if you can grab that for me I just do that\nMonkey wrench at you and let me look it up it's right here I've got your terrific listed you gotta you know the cut nine ... nine thanks\nI think she uh I'm not endorsing anybody right now I'm In this race but I don't ... for a number of years um she and she is an angry resident who um sees things\nAnd she realizes that fixable issue doesn't see them fixed as she got into this race I was shocked when she got into it quite frankly\nHa ha\nWell anyway she told me the story of how she got into the race and I'll save that for the time that she visits you she was actually scheduled today\nUm and and we got this very weird cancellation late yesterday she's been schedule for a week\nAnd we got a cancellation from one of her staffers saying that uh her uh her I don't know that her schedule events had changed or had things have been added and I wrote a terse email back to her campaign manager saying where there are\nThousands of people that could hear duty and and at those events or\nYou know not too smart\nBut I'll keep an open mind for the average level of stupidity that occurs in most campaigns anyway\nAnd hopefully she'll ah Shereen gauge on not losing any sleep I'm having having cancelled I just thought it was very strange um also something that I did not expect but mayor Louis told me the other night on on the set that he would\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota in Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood Otto John John [noise] now\nI operate on both on television and radio to invite them to come in and for you know an informal discussion some much debate\nI'm sure we'll see how that goes but mayor ... comments to me ah on on the show two nights ago or is it last night was last night I'm Sorry he was last night the day's run together for me sorry uh his comments on the show we're we're pretty interesting on on the\nSanctuary city thing a clearly it's grabs a lot of attention 'cause others have been writing about what he said on the program if you want to hear the full context a here's a few minutes worth of the conversation\nFor you know I've had my differences with the Trump administration's policy on immigration but what really did it for me it was a child separation policy at the border it as a heartless it is cruel it's anti productive not anti American and it's counter productive and so you know we can't have a federal agency that role\nIs separating children lying about it and keeping keeping those kids away from their parents it just it it it it it's not who we are we are so much better than that and that's what did it for me on top of that and I've said very proudly wear sanctuary city here in Providence ... department will never be a federal\nImmigration force just like they're not federal income tax or I Believe you know they're not federal gaming agents there not federal park park agents we are not the federal immigration force and our for our police department never will be so so that's where that\nComes with the interesting thing is I don't know whether you know I don't know that have ... ISIS disillusioned there's no doubt that the Trump Administration has put it's touched on ice and you know there are procedures respond to the boss [noise] uh I think ISIS behave in a way that's different than it did with the previous administration ice abolishing the organization the answer or is it just keeping battling Donald Trump on execution\nIt seems like there's some top to bottom or for that to reform\nThat's required in the organization you know one other policy that you know it's really mean spirited is Obama Obama um in fact did deport a number of folks but he prioritize the papal for violent criminals\nNot what the Trump Administration and what ISIS done as you know they go in several warrant on those violent criminals but they also arrest whoever happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time at that very moment and that's done to send a shepherd down everyone's back says it doesn't matter where you are or how careful you are you're subject to the importation of being caught\nAny single time that's just not right things that people living their lives and law understand that but\nYou're a woman for spent in your police chief or in in in in a province public safety director\nOf both of whom are I think pretty good professionals I think you'd agree I think they probably [noise]\nCringe over over the politics of this I mean if there's somebody who needs to go and they and they've been charged or they've been arrested they go that's right uh so I mean it's not like you're just this this give me twenty seconds on how proud your the term sanctuary I'm not sure that that it may help you\nIn certain neighborhoods but in terms of the marketing of the sitting in the state of this as a whole not so sure that's a smart\nThing well yeah let's that a couple of facts so sit ins with high on their side of the immigrants so that finished with higher numbers of immigrants have less crime immigrants are less likely the natives to commit a crime than ah than than NATO's and so you know this link between climate immigrants\nThat's something that the president has just completely if put out there listening is such a maybe you're committing crimes should be deported but if you're living in a law abiding way welcome you here in the city it was\nOkay so that that was the the the just the conversation with Providence mayor ... on the New York state of mind and Fox Providence had midnight and seven thirty and Myra TV last night um rent those things don't ... we're we're both those things down for Doug Matt\n... like they know where the shows they had trouble with earlier today I'll let him know ... if you know it's hard time with TV you know it's okay um [noise] the ah\nThe commentaries is caused a lot of people to shiver\nBy the way the there is no definition for sanctuary city you know that show you can determine what you think he's a sanctuary city simply by dialing in here for three dirty bureau and seeing what it is and that's your version of sanctuary city\nIn ... which which which is interesting about it is that it reflects\nUm the current\nTime we're people can shape things change\nMeans something to themselves\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free own condition at what for Denise religion there were against it that's right over two hundred free on cars always all models and incredible prices are going to flood Otto John jobs now\nThat we don't stipulate very much any more about what something means that we ... that we argue a about things would slippery slopes of definitions\nA\nThere is no place where you can find a cure definition of sanctuary city there's no federal um statutory or regulatory definition to it there's no state statutory regulatory definition to nothing\nIn general what was the thing means is is that look if we pick somebody up who's not a hard criminal will process them and we'll dispersed with them and we won't call ice I mean that's basically what it is\nBut\nWhat's funny interesting that funny ha ha but funny interesting is that you can have two police departments who are operating in exactly the same way and one mayor this is a concrete example right here in Rhode Island between Providence and Cranston\nYou can have the mayor in Providence beating his chest over the idea that he's a sanctuary city in following the politics of that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "17"}
