scientific poll I learned about it when I was an undergrad or grad student postgraduate and you know what he's talking about you can't quote an internal poll and the other thing that's interesting for me is what are you saying that that when\nThey cheered when what let me read but each at where the only way and John prove this last night on this show\nThe only way I can really make sure the victory

trying to destroy everything about the other side\nI I don't know I don't know\nMaybe you think it's true I don't you think it's true do you think they do use [laughter] I mean you could I couldn't hear you can take Hillary Clinton out of that ... thing and put a Republican in there and have them say that and and they both believe it\nSo assuming that they're both right\nAnd both sides has their line in the sand where the other side drew first blood\nWhere do you and I come in\nBecause it seems to me that like a you know the Lord's and ladies of games and throw a game of Thrones that the

good\nSo let me start by the administration before this one\nIn that people were killed by a but there are bad and that and everything but when you find that ending up criminal and then on the other way of getting ill and then letting everybody yell at Guantanamo Bay\nThat jumped on it you know it it got people why don't we watched our country [noise]\nWell I don't know I don't know about your specific examples but I think that there's a level of there's an absolute truth to the idea that\nThe reason why Brock Obama lost the vote for the last minute Hillary couldn't keep on to Brock Obama's votes or when it came to the the the rust belt\nAnd places like Michigan in Wisconsin places like that that voted for Barack Obama for ... for two terms and they didn't go over to Hillary is because of what you're talking about I think there's that there's this concentration on identity\nOf common or ... thought about what decency isn't a code to unite you then you can have civility anyway payments calling from Massachusetts Pam your WPRI have have\nI dare I\nSay you want to hear from a centrist Democrat and I'm sure that you like to ask me All right I mean\nYou know I don't know you

know simply that that is unbelievably important to me so that's why I called him mhm\nUm and you want it so you want to know first of all where I'm where I thought the incivility it'd be gun sure right I think\n'cause it sounded like it was it sounds like Hillary was saying that you know she ... everybody has their moment in time it's like their first blood that was drawn right like so they started they started here well no they use started here and it goes back and forth right so in your mind ... where's the where's the instability and where does it need to be rectified\nOkay so I definitely from paying attention for very long time um I had it for many years at a very strong point of view on that and\nI absolutely and I'm I'm I'm a let me just say I'm always open to hearing them for making sure that I I Want to say that out loud because I think it gets presented in the media that um\nWhatever media does Facebook that I'm Democrat\nYou know each side is not open to the other side should night and I purposely he got Republican chocolate oh good so I just want to have that out there 'cause that's really important to me mhm I'm just be one sided not useful to anybody in my opinion but I think it absolutely I Do think looking back that it started with Newt Gingrich and Lee Atwater\nThat's when I think he's there things started to get that if\nThey were willing to be a little ... in a way that politicians hadn't hadn't been in at that time in if we you look back in history you can see nastiness and incivility has been part of our is so\n... will will haunt us was the last part you say that again that students and into the ...\nThat now when you look back at the you know are are there with you know founders of this country they are they called a gun at a lot of land for a day\nYeah [laughter] ... they weren't nice to each other\nHave you ever heard have you ever heard that if you ever get a chance to go on line to the you do to you too and you look up reason magazines I'm a political cartoon political campaign something or other it's like reason magazine John Adams' campaign commercials and they actually have\nThis is from ... years old now this time but they actually have the quotes from the Jefferson Adams fight\nBack now and so it's hysterical you'll die laughing like you know he's a he's a half breed son of a ... who was raised on her cage you know there's some [laughter] and they said about each other back then felt very icy\nThank you thank you for sharing that with\nMe no it's very ... and I but I you know it's interesting so All right so what we were stuck in that if let's say you're right\nAnd the I the thing we're stuck in now is that there's everybody has a justification because of getting vengeance on the other side and then so where does it end I mean it seems to me that something like this only ends when when something gets so bad happens that everybody's just like whoa and I'm afraid that it's going to be something catastrophic\nI I I think you might be right I mean I feel like it's incumbent on each individual to make an effort to reach out to the other side of that has a boy and everybody in this country code\n... you know what I'm not going to the other side as evil I'm going to reach out to them and I can tell like I said that's what I Do and if everybody in the country chose to do that\nAnd and I do I honestly do it through Facebook sometimes\nYeah when you're ... ... ... ... ...
