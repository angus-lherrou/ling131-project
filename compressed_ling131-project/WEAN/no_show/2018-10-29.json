...\nOkay alright listen it's not for everybody or I just wonder if so many of the campaigns especially locally here or there they're very\nUm very vocal and they're very you know gung ho on social media they're pumping it out on Twitter there's a lot of um discourse\nAnd going after the you know the opposition campaign\nSo I I feel like it's almost a side show it's almost not a sideshow in the central you know not like a circus sideshow but it's a sidebar it's another program to be able to be watching and you can learn a lot about the inner workings of the campaigns and sometimes I Wonder if it's a working against a particular individual thanks Murray\nA building run for not WPRI bill\nHi Hi there I'm a big fan of social media good I tried to follow it as much as I can to keep up with what's going on not just the politics the other day I thought it was funny to see the journalist story books for every minute folks\nAre you ready to say that again but journalists were talking about robbing the pope's oh ...\nOh okay ... wait hold on I Know exactly what you're talking about I thought you said the journal was grabbing its time and I didn't understand that there's no journalists alright so okay so here's the thing so does it bother you if you're looking at someone on the news and they're supposed to be this journalist professional reporter or whatever\nAnd somebody wrote um something about cleaning out of time I know what you were talking about and the other the other the other reporters that I have two words for you scrubbing bubbles and I said I have two more for you [laughter] robbing bubbles and the magical racer\nAnd I said these the entertainers have so much money the royal ... probably are you\nKnow obviously we're all grabbing our own tubs showers and toilet fell so I understand\nThat oh you're funny that I think that um like followed Riley very closely\nMike Riley yeah he was and he's he's certainly in a while and by the beach turtle courage I Know he's a very bright man\nHe has a personality if you know and I told him this morning that he should stop why Wal Mart or going up\nAnd he wrote back on what is it if you want do you get it from Amazon but I think he knows his shortcomings and that's one of them but he really does not have a personality that is a good foot politics\nIt may not be conducive to that to to to to holding a I'm One of the higher offices in the state and all the people that I told\nHim today it's it's just it's a really is not good\nGet lost that said he told me today\nOr last night I saw that I saw that [laughter]\nCertainly is a qualified individual\nAnd you know what I think he he feels as if he's he's attempting to give a\nLot of a legitimate information and ... to the sort of Rhode Island and they don't want to hate ... well he could be can block look at all can block to it on and he gets the left upside the head or you know politically\nYes but he can't run a campaign sitting at his office Narragansett doesn't work or you\nKnow who knows maybe maybe this isn't the right time bill thank you for that for three eight nine seven seven six Mary's in Providence on WPRI Mary\nHow're you doing good I'm not on line okay I get my political news mostly from television and radio um occasionally a newspaper but only when I'm some place where there was a newspaper [noise] um and discussion with friends\nMhm and I enjoy your show very much well thank you get a lot of\nMy information that way and\nI'm I'm a drink I'm enjoying this political\nTime very much [laughter] it makes\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nRight we'll be talking about who won who lost they how do we go forward and alterations all kinds of work on\nThings Mary thank you [noise] uh but it it it it is a a this has been a very interesting and I wonder if it's because of social media and I I I Wonder if it's because things you know are pulled out of the past if if in fact so many people are um engaging I guess you could say\nBut I'll tell you it um\n[noise] well we have one more week ... let's see if we can get there\nSo tell me who you are and I would love to say hello maybe we can take some photos with the best

Newport he has something to add about one of the political races now jumped on the line if you want to win our last two pairs for this program our last two pairs of Billy Gilman home for the holidays concert\nTickets at the dunk December eighth friday we what people went nuts we had a lot of breaking news\nAbout the bombing suspect or the bummer male or suspect in Florida we had to cover that and Billy said I'll I'll hang around he was great to hang around and but we had to take the breaking news so we gave away three pairs and now we have two final pairs left\nBut you're going to have to earn them and win them and we're going to come up with a fun way I mean here's the thing we have one full week left\nIn this election season and it has been a doozy for many reasons and the day is young the day is young\nAh but it's been a doozy and um I think it can predict how the how the outcome unless something else comes up I don't know uh but there's some shenanigans going on behind the scenes you never know what's going to come to to uh fruition here\nThat being said how do you ever had an odd run in this is how you're gonna win the building them and take it home for the holidays have you had an odd run in\nWith a politician maybe you didn't know who they were maybe they came to your door you know he's standing there with a T shirt and underwear on may be uh you didn't recognize someone at the grocery store I always seem to run into one particular politician and because I've interviewed this person\nOver the years and it's fairly fairly friendly I mean I don't think I I don't have a fangs or talent but they they never want to say hello to me in the grocery store you know it's I looked down run and it cracks me up because I think if it were in a setting\nYou know a work setting or you saw them at an event they would say hello to you but in the grocery store no\nBut that could just be by problem people don't wanna look me in the eye if you've met a politician and you had an odd running now my man here our producer Nick Flanagan had a weird thing happened to him\nMay have to have you have to suffer a story\nUm where somebody was running for office and kind of followed him home and it was just it's all an awkward exchange if you will um ... or maybe maybe your story could be you've never met a politician and I don't know how that could possibly\nBe in it where we live because everybody's neighbors with somebody but if you had an odd run and I'd like to hear it and you can win the tickets are going to make the stories good folks usability Gilman tickets there they're flying out of the dunk like you can't even imagine they've they've they're it's it's a a\nSecond time around here for the show so successful last year they want to do in another home for the holidays like it's been an art William has something to add William in Newport morning William\nForty you're like oh yeah you know I think there's a lot of it is right now that are rated because they feel like for whatever reason they did on their opportunity to get their message out\nBut I think Mr Reilly\nInfo graphic loaded for months which cited showed that his own um that's been performed much better than the earth and even then treasurer Raimondo or you know it drove up there that's important is that that argument\nBut you know at the end of the day you look at the Republican Party other than that\nHow would you like motor trench twenty or gene trucks will be here for only one I've you know will free hello to forge twenty four to one of the struggle to fish fries anywhere just one hundred Ninety nine dollars for a full year what board and he's winning Georgian\nDream um you know almost not even a bird already but something that is going on I was ... when you look at their communication infrastructure when you go to that walk oh\nThe oh about bad look at the Michael Riley walk so that it just I think the Republican Party really have to evaluate in Rhode Island oh wait better way to communicate their message this delay and get it out there people um that's the way you know\nI Know I agree totally I totally agree with you William are definitely there's a lot you just said a lot for an organization and then communications and they're you know there were just talking about social media and and the ... and the and the um the trail on on public\nI I'm Suzie on social media and and kind of airing your dirty laundry and and and they've they've learned from that this time around as well didn't do any good for any of the Republican

[noise]\nAnd so what I Wonder is we talked about this last year last week and I had a couple of people call in is actually a couple of people that actually worked for the former or current\nUm employees of the health and Human Services department working for you here for the department of ministry work if you were working on that you have situation and um and they said that\nThis you know this they're going to be voting for somebody other than Gina Raimondo and pension reform but ... in their mind it was actually you have a situation that was\nUm [noise] that was the motivating factor for them not necessarily the fact the pension reform a made a lot of people crazy\nBut I was always fascinated by this because I was fascinated by the reason why I even brought up and spoke about it was because\nThe NEA in Rhode Island here the teacher is one of the teachers' unions are too big teachers' unions NEA in this day of T. R. I. F. T. right around federation of teachers and the national Education Association of Rhode Island right those two groups I don't know what I don't know if the uh R. I. S. T. is\nUm has endorsed anybody yet but I think the the NEA all rise come out and endorsed Gina Raimondo as the Providence Journal by the way\nI'm\nInteresting about that to me is that if you have this group and they put up clay Pell last year and they were probably a driving force in primary ... a month or with Matt Brown this year I mean they they have done a lot to go ahead and to tell a governor among do that she screwed up\n\nI'm now you can ... Johnny come lately it's political it's all political it's it's it's basically without actually buying somebody out which is a political promised that they are making in order to get votes\nThis is what happens in politics right you can tickets cynical you can tickets hypocritical whatever it's fine but when faced with somebody who's going to tell you\nThat it is what it is we screwed you that's it versus somebody like you got screwed and maybe we can work to fix it\nI'm\nUnless you're just a democratic ideologue who wants to you know all the other crap that he mentioned there were there were early childhood this that and the other whatever that nonsense that is\nUm why would you care about that stuff and not have I mean it's it's fascinating to me what do you think about somebody you know or by the union whose mindset is about it seems to me that that Bob Walsh there\nAre speaking on behalf of NEA our eyes kind of said that you can screw with our pensions\nAnd\nThat's it not fine but it's something you can do because we won't ever leaves you anyway we'll primary you will make will make you pay ... will make you pay a little bit with the with a a a with a primary but we'll never leave the yard\nYou know we may pull on the chain a little bit we may dig holes we may be on your favorite bushes but we're a good dog will never leave the yard will never run away to somebody else's yard so don't worry\nAs long as you uh play nice and some of the other things will have to because ultimately an ideological group not a group that represents workers\nWere kind of both but ultimately we lean towards the ideology that's the last what Bob Wolff says to me where we are more Democrats than we are protected ... worker protectors\nI that's what that says to me\nAnd I would love to know what it says to you my phone numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI we can email me mad at six three zero WPRI dot com it said it seems to me that you would have a hierarchy of\nOf importance of issues if your pays been taking care of if people are fairly paid you know according to a tax payers can afford if your pension system is shored up and uh it was being treated fairly according to the contract and all that other good stuff then\n\nKnow we can go on to the other stuff that surrounds education an advocate for the other stuff but when

they did it last time they stayed out of the governor's race last time but um you say that those are the guys don't have a chance um unions pride themselves on being the\nThey couldn't care less about the people they represent\nOriented philosophy is there any allergy means more to them than the actual pay\nA lot of things besides cables player I I was a public employee union member falls twice if he is\nSo you know I'm not talking on my head but I I I was federal or state or out and it's just that this is a shameful because what they care about is\nThat they care about gun control they care about our ...\nThey were caught whatever it takes you out a way that this is how we live in lake house payments\nOr cake may wish I would say I mean I I don't\nKnow but you know I hear you you know what's interesting Joseph ... see things like you know this this caused a lot of pain for a lot of people and you just and you just indoors the person that supposedly caused that show or at least in part championed it right I\nWasn't for definitely champion in part caused it\nSo then what does that say to people I mean it's such a weird thing to say\nWell she'll shop at Walmart job a lot I can tell you I got this\nUm I was teaching at ... or ... years but she also a a Jewish state\nSo that is a way to land those is it's a shame because I I guess public employees having been or will be but the critical here where we go after public employees but they shut it gets cold I think we're supposed to be represented\nWell that's my whole point right I mean we can sit here and have debates is whether or not we should have public sector unions you know that just like anything else there's pros and cons to it or in but but what's fascinating to me is this idea that you have\nIs that you have the union which is supposed to first and foremost for protect the interests of their workers right\nIn interest moved their workers I think if you're on a hierarchy of needs the top would be their pay their benefits retirement is number one right it would be up on top of their it's kind of like the first amendment of of of uh you were what unions is supposed to do this in the number one of the most important thing for you but I still\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason they do prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nBob Kerrey came came [laughter] [laughter]\nYeah yeah that's the you know yeah that's the the the the the rich and they're such a small group of people folks it's I'm Jo thanks for the call the recent study that they\nDid where they found they were a there's a study that was done recently was fascinated to read about\nI'll get the I put the link up on my Facebook page and that was the week before last and how I can try and stick it back up there she can see what's fascinating to me is they have this you have this uh this they did a whole studying political correctness\nAnd who hates and political correctness is is pretty much the the majority of the vet overwhelming majority of Americans hated everybody and you knock it down or you break it down by by um\nBy subgroups I'm Talking like you even racial groups everybody hates\n'em except for these ultra progressive ultra progressive make up by the way eight percent they ... they estimate eight percent of the population eight\nEight percent I Would love for them to expand their their study to find out how much their ideas are represented in media\nBecause I guarantee you their ideas are represented a majority of the time and media for eight percent of the population controls the majority of the conversation about this guy\nEven the extremists conservatives they have like ... and they didn't call them that but they were like extreme conservatism is kind of the way they they the I'm miss recording what they call them but like very conservative people make up twenty five percent of the country\nTwenty five the vast majority of individuals however like Seventy five is whatever the what is left over there I'm like Seventy percent of whatever it is is sixty percent right sixty seven sixty percent somebody that\nYou look at the math is the ... is this exhausted a majority that called the exhausted majority there so sick and tired of the stream is getting all the oxygen in the room that they just they were like either checked out are like oh please shut up\nAnd so it's interesting just to know that that the progressive although they make up such a tiny amount of are in their most by the way they are the most homogeneous um\nGroup out that they are mostly white and rich\nSo what Joe was talking about the money to live with the ... the money progressive is abs will be real\nAnd they um they manipulate people through identity politics like you know through their little sub groups you are this is the hyphenated America is one of their main tools um that's the only way a vast minority of individuals\nCan control the control the the the rhetoric and control the narrative is by you know shopping everybody up into little sections\nAnd denying the you know and and and talking to them based on that having your whole identity wrapped up in that and the only reason why you do that is because you know you can help control people through fear in through and through painting people you know us versus them stuff\nSo the individuals that that are running like the hardcore platform of the Democratic party now and unions and all these other places these are idiot logs who are represent a small tiny proportion of America\nAnd in their ideas and yet but they have a huge\nVoice because there were in there they they run the media they run or I should say that\nThey they are occupied the media\nThat's more accurate or accurate saying that the people who are in the national news stations most of the most of them than nationally and in widely consumed media both entertainment and um news\n\nIs is is occupied and is a program and\nGet in and put out by people who are part of this the money progressive there's this left wing eight percent or ...\nThem\nAnd so you know you want to talk about a fun house mirror by the way they also run um they also run the ... the entire silicone valley which then controls your Facebook Twitter all these dissemination sources and they also work there on math and so these are all people who have Sherry political philosophy\nAnd in outlook on the world\nThat um\nThe pleasures of political outlook on the world that then controls the narrative and suppress the speech in some cases\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the here for only one Ninety nine brought will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at flood forward and eastern edge or Narragansett\nFlick a conspiracy it just happened to be a bunch of like minded people all getting together and taking advantage of their power\nUm\nYou know and there's a way we can it can you can fight against that is just\nTo stop consuming and stop using it I mean ultimately I think that we have really one of the big things that is being underplayed right now this\nIs kind of off the beaten path here but it's kind of it it kind of connects\nIs the idea that um and I was I was actually emailing back and forth with a social media attorney Brian Lamb or who have talked about a lot on this with a lot in the show and also on our podcast yeah mad Allen show uncovered podcast as a whole hour with Brian Lamb or a little over an hour where we talk about\nSocial media and social media and technology in general screen time for kids all that jazz and I think that the algorithms that are built into social media platforms he's our mathematical equations that look at what you look at figure out what you like and feed it to you\nPay these are mathematical computer programs that are that are so ingenious and so I mean they're incredibly\nBrilliant and they watch you they take advantage of of the information that you feed them voluntarily\nThey spit back not only confirmation bias type stuff where you get stuff that you like that maybe distorted and whatever but they also get just stuff that you tend to click on the most which is a lot in a lot of ways I'm outraged porn\nRight so like you see something you find orderly ridiculous on the news you get fifty more stories just like it\nAnd then you get the stuff that you clicked on that you agree with that comes out she was all so you you have this paradigm set up that there are these extremists out\nThere right\nLike this this extreme and then you see it a ton on social media she constantly bombarded with these messages that you are that you either way I could do is out there are people who agree with you and so you had this distorted view of the world that there's just extremes that exist and it leads to this fun house mirror type of perception of what reality\nIs and uh I don't think that does well for any of us now that's just an aside you know the idea that you know a lot of the the people out there who are these eight percenters are running a lot of these democratic institutions now us in this case like the you know like like our ... our college oh just said that you have\nA guy who's executive director of the

patriots lots of what's going on\nHey be it'll it is a cold and windy night here in Buffalo as I'm sure Chris has already told you about some of the players out they're beginning to warm up the place kicker is and the hunters in particular and looking forward to this Monday Night match up\nWhat's the crowd going to be like their tonight I can only imagine that they are going to be amped up for the first night game they've had there and it's right or first time on Monday Night football in a decade\nAnd they've also kind of retirements than I did a number of retirement to sermons honest so\nI'm sure there are all kinds of jacked up for this one\nWe do not interestingly enough to be the one we rolled into the stadium today now granted I don't think the numbers were as large as we typically find when the patriots come in for one o'clock game for example a lot of people might have\nStill been in transit maybe traffic delayed them perhaps you know people who are working and then decided to come to the stadium tailgate a bit later on knowing they're going to be\nA tailgating and watching football and doing other things to him by being a fit into the early morning hours after this one is done but the crowd was outside is really subdued so had his camera out he was ready to\nDocument at all for you guys back home and lo and behold\nA lot of friendly waves way because nobody was there to give you guys the finger rolling in there that might have been an occasional ah you know number one raised here and they're not nearly like we've witnessed in the past I Know one thing that I've heard from a couple of different people around the organization here in Buffalo\n... in the last week is the the bills have really tried to crack down at least in the stadium loss\nOr if not I'm a satellite lots of private parking areas around the stadium they've really tried to crack down the organization has been embarrassed by\nThe reputation of the fans and the breaking tables they had all the attention that that has gone on social media and even a year on television and uh in the mainstream media\nThey don't want that to be the focal point unfortunately their team is struggling so model you have to fly with an ... ... that that has been about as much much talked about topic this week\nAs anything else there'll be amped up a lot of former bills are going to be here the nucleus of the four straight AFC Championship teams had a big party last night for Thurman Thomas or there's a big pre game bashes well for them and I think it'd be a great scene here for the fans of buffalo and have done so wait let me get this right by Louis ...\n[laughter] let me get this right so the organization is embarrassed by the performance of the fans should I have a feeling\nThat the the usual and Bowling Alone\nSuck like here here's an idea I Want to pay attention off the parking lot to do something on the field\nOh no question about it but Bob you and I were talking about before your segment I mean you almost forget this this is a team that made the playoffs last year and that ended that drought they had made the playoffs in Nineteen Ninety nine they made it last year ... tailor made the decision it really hit the reset button and hear and\nKnow Josh down the rookie quarterback is out but they invested a couple of draft\nPicks and moving up to Sacramento picks it cost them to move up including I picked it ended up going to the patriots the patriots use it on two dots and\nSo it's really interesting because it seems like John McDermott rented being said okay we got this playoff thing out of the way but we want to build a team that can really compete and that's a longer term process here in Buffalo yeah you know in some ways they might have been better off not reaching the playoffs last year in knowing\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\n... performance against Indianapolis and that Sean McDermott expertise and I think he wants at all times that resembles the defense and that he doesn't want to have it at all since the turns the ball over and\nHe's got some wide receivers right now that have been non productive with quarterbacks as we know that have been in this a revolving door for the bills and they had assigned or a cat or set off the street some wander around here why didn't they just keep ... Taylor to be the bridge because Cleveland acquired ... Taylor for that very same purpose to be the bridge\nTo Baker may feel but what a drastic difference from the end of last season in January when the bills beat the dolphins him and watched from the

office right now is you guys have I'm sure well chronicled\nThirty one points to the last four games without scored in the in the first half I think one tend to forty and if you exclude the went over Minnesota gets one ten ten Thirteen and the first out this year I'm\nAll right Bob Hope we cannot you're calling a lotta touchdowns in the same for the patriots\nWhat's going to be interesting to be
