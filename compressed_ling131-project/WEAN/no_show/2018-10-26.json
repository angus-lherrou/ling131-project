white\n[noise]\n\nOur friend Jeff good amount of stadium now joins us here for the PC preview let's just get to this right away or how good can Providence College this year\nReally good I mean it's going to take some time 'cause they're young but I'll tell you like there's no doubt in my mind that going to make the tournament again you know a ... he told me before this thing started that he felt like he was surprised at how high they were they were picked this year because they are young but I think it's a testament to what it cool he's done with this program\nYou know they're young yeah but they're they're more talented\nThey're way more talented than than a year ago and and I think last year a steam was kind of an enigma and this year's theme he's got coach your bowl talented young kids that are mature um that I I think again I think they're going to a chance to be really good by the time Congress was starts\nI've asked everyone this and I'm curious for your thoughts what's the ceiling for David do\nUm I think again because of his maturity I mean there's a kid comes in with a ton of hype\nI mean think about this a coup he brought a freshman to media that that does not happen I mean it just never happened so I I think they do some guy that again I'm not sure anybody in his team's going to put up a huge huge numbers\nJust because you're more than than what people realize I think it's going to be more balance the ... the guy that comes back it's already done it but you're going to have three freshman that are all going to\nI'm really figuring heavily to every game how big is getting MBAs hold back this year I thought they missed him big last year huge huge experience you know he's older\nShe got yellow and and and ... and now he's healthy\nObvious there was talk what he went through last year but he gives you something that are on the front line that you're going to need I mean you've got two guys that again are good veterans mix with with a bunch of young guys that that's the really the ultimate recipe for success and I think so many people forgot about him and hold\nWhy is it truly so successful\nIs authentic authentic he's passionate he's got so much energy like he he's the perfect coach 'cause\nHe's a player's coach pretty hoses guys accountable and he can relate to him\nLike he's just got the whole package not a lot of coaches are like that right I mean he can coach he gets his kids to play harder than almost everybody else I'm but I think again that off the authenticity allows him to connect with recruits get good players in and then when he has them they play hard for him\nI talked with Bob just call about this you know when I got into the sports radio game Twenty years ago Providence College it was like Chicken Little who's going to steal our coach now there isn't any of that that is a huge sea change\nYeah I think the only way anybody still believes if he goes to the NBA right I don't think he leaves for another college job I really don't and you know obviously he's he's one of Providence his own he understands that better than anybody they love him\nYou know another component to what makes makes it so great\nHe's out there in the community you know there's a lot of coaches that don't want to do that and he'll do anything and everything to go out in the community because of his community you know he he grew up there there's ownership absolutely I mean there's a connection there and\nUh you can't take that away a lot of guys like you said coming to Providence with the thought of what's next right it's that stepping stone job frankly I mean again listen if if Carolina called it would be hard but they're not going to I mean that that that's just not what's going to happen\nAt the end of the day I see a ... probably a Providence wife or a\nBest team in this league is who and by how much\nNot by much but you got to give it a Villanova you got to I mean just what they've done and you know the culture I think is important and they've got to veterans who've been there done that in an aircraft skill and Phil boots and a lot of really good young players so you got to go to Jay right and and then the wildcat\nSide I've been one of those who when this league grief four and six years ago I thought oh boy that could be in trouble they've been able to thrive why how they got it done\nI'm speechless like I Can't even give you the answer to that it's shocking to me\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne as over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right and one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\n[noise] you know I just didn't think it would be able to to be relevant like this like it has been but Villanova has obviously been that that staple right I mean they've been able to carry the league\nBut you've got some of the schools that they brought up that have done really well have you obviously you know ... who thought Creighton after Doug McDermott right would be able to sustain it like they have so\nUm I think they've just they've hit it right and and being able to win enough games in the ... good coaching good players you know this year at the market's going to make a big jump St Charles it's more open this year than it's ever been since the league or you know how to\nThe pressure is really on Reggie McKenzie is still there um which I mean it still remains to be seen in ... and most of all John good hit on the spot that those five percent and pays for the next two years\nWhat is Jerry Jones thinking given up on one for Calvin Ridley you know what I mean excuse me I'm Ari Cooper [noise] ah I Know that the eagles offered to too but yeah that seemed like a little much but as you and I talked about a million times nobody tells Jerry Jones no\nYeah I think as much as anything else it's a first of all the dollars spent that\nAh that they mess up a man I mean look I think that they felt like they could build an officer on the ... that would um sort of minimize the problem is everywhere else in the issue is the opposite minded as dumb as it has been and they\nWeren't as good as receivers they thought they'd be they thought they'd be a little bit better than they happen and so\nWhat do you usually be eight that you can bring in a guy who's got central to be a number one at Google has that you know will say that like Cooper\nIs the first two years and we looked like he had the capability of of all we can do like Reggie White typed on board receiver you know and I'm really what happened was you know three years under Nick Saban two years under Bill Bill mosque crave\n'em yeah I think that there was a little bit of a substitute teacher effect last year um I Know the worst turned about his work habits in two thousand and seventeenth certainly a factor is production and then this year you know they they they they wound up they were hoping that that that crude coming in with these things\nAnd they were able to light a fire under him and spots but it wasn't consistent enough and so I mean Jerry Jones that here is that the change of scenery is really going to help them the being traded it's going to be a wakeup call and that this guy who was you know by all accounts are really good kid is going to\nTurn back into the guy he was a couple of years ago if that's the guy that getting I don't think it's a bad values in fact I was at that guy shows up\nTowards the end of this year maybe their playoff seen that one day last isn't as high as it might have been otherwise they're probably not going to find a receiver as good as America Cooper late in the first round\nA but certainly a gamble you're gambling that you're you're going to get a player who ... at twenty four years old who is going to sort of a ball back into what he was when he was funny to\nAverage ... Monday morning quarterback dot com here on the ground show on WNPR oh I'm not the brown like Todd Haley had to come out and say sure Jackson and I are on the same page is going on behind the scenes in Cleveland\nIt's not going to have you with that I I just tell you I mean this thing I think has a chance to get worse and\nAh I I work called you before the year that I think John doors who's going to give you Jackson the whole year because the valuation um after they go through a full season together I'm not there so he was I mean I think that this very well could be\nA one of those where you know ... with multiple ... and\nThings we've gone to side with you know we have too many good young players on the roster um we may have to pull the plug in mid season and just sort of patched together and get to the end of the year uh you know I mean for the first time in a long time I think you'd agree with this crashed\nThere are a lot of good young players of that team\nI mean there are the other ... Baker ... pro Baker made appeal to vent awarded to grow peppers a mild scared to Larry Hogan job will be a\nGot a lot of promising young players in that roster and right now I think what's paramount for the ... the owner is what can we do to Boston to the best environment for those guys to grow when you do to make sure that they could feel isn't position to hit the ground\nHow would you like motor drenched twenty gene trucks will be here for only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to forge twenty a gene for that one fifty a best friend for the best rice anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a flood forward and he went into a new again it\nIs you know what is the coaching staff look like and I certainly know that you know some of the stuff that you've said publicly on Sunday when I was like it was that one can be offered some other cultures there\nAre brutal Monday morning quarterback dot com here on the ground show on WNPR oh [noise] um yeah I I'm with you there is some doesn't seem right ten I don't buy the wave thought he may think taught Haley's the long term answer I don't know or if he's really the right guy to go with ... what did you make of the\nUm I guess\nA dissenters on dissenters crime in terms of read getting after Malcolm Jenkins of the eagles\nYeah you know that one to me that that was difficult too because\nYou know I I both guys are probably trying to do the right thing um I've gotten to know about the only um there's some degree and I know of course because of where he went to school I Know a lot of people who've been around you know and I think it would have a hard time finding anyone who would ever say anything negative about Malcolm second uh\nPersonally you know I I I\nI have a hard time seeing where the right answer for Eric we was trying to publicly embarrass you know by trial and trying to make an astronaut guy and I think it's it's hard because you know you're judging what's the motivation there and you know part of me thinks\nThere is some level of jealousy here that\nYou know Jenkins and some other guys you know has taken a player's coalition sort of ... over to move past or the game and I think part of this goes back and you can look in at the meeting where um they had that much bally hoos eating in October right like where the owners of the players that down\nUm and you could see sort of thing kind of coming to Ruth where\nYou know Eric reading within their and a\n... for about four hours it good productive meetings and they went through and made a lot of progress in ten minutes class you know Eric where he basically jumped in there and yet very ... hearing you say well what about college\nAnd you know that's what the ... there's been out for him is like you know who's the later this broker or calling cat well no right now ... ... ... ... you know the whole ... or ... or so\nThere's the question of leadership there are there's a question of motivation on there and you know I just tell you I mean I I think that going about the way he went about it and you know what looked like a very and I'd be curious to hear what you think of that what looks completely stage [laughter] um\nYou know I I just I have a hard time right up my ... my my head around why it was\nYeah I didn't get it from the the air agreed standpoint look if you're all in this together why start bickering over who's leader who's been issues that\nIf you're really committed to the cause then that stuff shouldn't matter a but it seems like it does and that's the part that I\nThink what bothers people but you know it's amazing even though they had that done some burn the whole and some things has not been a story this yeah at all\nYeah and I think the days of credit to you know they screwed up a lot like the league younger players a union they screwed up a lot in the handling of this thing over the last two years I finally got it right and you know they did was they had a set of meetings in the summer\nAnd then in August I'm the one final meeting it was the giants filled it at the end of August you know right I think before the uh the forth police see the game\nAnd they basically came to the determination what's just leave it alone but it's not making now spent ... doing let's just leave this thing alone it wasn't a bad spot at the end of last year it wasn't a national talking point in the playoffs so\nWe're sitting here right now is not a talking point now let's not talk point let's just say let's just kind of it's almost like continuous without a fight you know just last month this than sit the work goes I think it was a brilliant way to handle it there there are a couple of guys and those rooms not\nNot at liberty to share the names of the people who ... who ah what part of who are sort of leading the charge of this but\nA couple of smart people in those in the in that room a came up with a really smart way to handle it and you know I think so far so good I think we're ... we're seeing a lot of a lot of unity involved with and the players and the teams are healthy players\nUm you know attacked the causes that are important to them and so this progress being made on that and\nAnd but the flip side you know they're not forcing the players to do anything they don't want to do\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in East Village and there were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log on to what auto dot com\nIt's not an issue anymore and they've accomplished what I think that we wanted to accomplish which was you know putting the focus back on the clock\nAnd finally will Patrick Peterson be traded before next week trade deadline\nI'm going to say no I I don't\nKnow I I think that there are there or you know Arizona lost a good amount of the roster hell\nI'm if if you want to pick up the phone and make a call or two guys are sort of figured out there that are similar it's terrible and so I'm not going to be traded without having a talk with ownership about it\nUh and I don't think she wants to trade them you know both those guys are sort of seen as being a different class the rest of the person that roster sort of the the the the drive\nAnd Arizona is not one of those markets as a sellout regardless you know you have ... people at the stadium keeping interest in the same um if you are going to rebuild that you know they're beginning stages of that so um yeah I think that the\nLearn how SDF can help we encourage you to educate yourself in tears on the St Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never

week or ... on national news\nAlmost every night there was a story about you know be be between black and white a white people are wrong to grab the black people and I think they're doing it too right off the base and I think the Democrats are behind the migrant thing I mean ... is\nHow do how how how joke to explain to me how this works and why you think this\nWell [noise] I I think it because when you look at the migrants none of them look under said they all got brand new backpacks on their back I mean I don't know what the judge shows buying them or what but I think they're doing things

happening into your political advantage versus actually creating that thing\nOr two different things right [noise] oh I think in some cases you know they're they're trying to take advantage of certain

they do yeah you know and you don't know I don't know I mean could you make bombs I couldn't make ten bombs\nNo but I'm I'm saying out at ten times you would think one of ... what what\n... that's when I was trying to do maybe we're just trying to scare people I don't know\nDid did you see the the the story last week about the woman who wouldn't let the black guy in his own apartment yeah yeah ... and then there was another one where we are a a black kid walk by a white girl and she called the cops trying to say that you were trying to [noise] a sexually harassed her\nI Can't forget it with ... other ones too what about um ...\nWell I think I think like they they find the store you\nI think what you're doing is you're conflate eating a bunch of different things together to form a\nDeterrent no no no I think what you're seeing is that there's this one mind there's this one mine that's controlling all this stuff I think you do see something where the the media the media out there the national news media specifically in website specifically law does re stories because they get clicks and they get people to click on it and\nThere's a lot of the they find extremist stuff to to rile people\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices log on to flood auto John jobs now\nBelieved to think that somebody would then create this I think that what happens is you have people that are doing crackpot things out there all the time\nAnd in this case is is most likely will say ... ... rays are in the in the office before most likely this the simplest reason\nIs the most is the most viable one rides usually the right one it just hope that this guy is probably a day and we we don't know yet right I'm just I'm conjecture Joey have no idea this guy is a crock pot who for whatever reason wanted to either scare people or try to hurt people uh and he's got a political point of view that that that may be drove him here\nAnd I'm probably I Would imagine that at the end of the day during the investigation when it's all done that's probably what you're gonna find out\nAnd hurt my back on the ground again I could always go or not you're All right Joe thanks very appreciative I just\nYou know the I don't know I just think that you know the the the Internet and the people want a time people spend on not only in social media but the social media that is\nIs

out to be a hundred percent but it probably will but that said there's a special day for that reason but you know we all get attacked and were smart [noise]\nSorry about that we had a weird situation that was one of the sun by something when we wanted my apologies that didn't make any sense because it didn't [laughter] the president's ah speaking in front of us some young black Republican state the White House talked about the fact that um that this that a suspect has been arrested in the case of the the bombs that\nThrough or are they the apparent bombs or whatever they are a mail bomb type of things that were sent to a lot of Democrats in high profile of liberals in the in the country what are we up to now is at twelve or Thirteen\nI think it's twelve or the man's name by that is is I've been identified as Caesar say oc um the van that a van that was evidently confiscate it as a result of his arrest um has been a photograph widely one individual I guess had a photograph of the band itself from\nFrom literally weeks ago or days ago before he was arrested because like a person just so do you see something when you're driving around your your your your phone and you look at this thing and you take a picture of it in\nA van a vet Lee is covered in um in pro Trump anti CNN anti Democrat a propaganda\nUp pictures and cartoons and whatnot one individual bench appeared just tweeted out a funny way the guy said the guy said that the van looks like what Steve Bannon would transform into if he was a transformer [laughter]\n\nMade me laugh but anyway\nSo there is a a you know this is a they call it the demographer mystery machine\nLike I'll I'll uh Scooby Doo but the you know the issue is here you know you find out that this guy looks like looks like it just looks like he's driving around and extremely pro Trump a van\nNow what's been interesting to me is not only to try to figure out what motivated this guy because evidently as a criminal history and everything else um\nAnd I guess the sources are telling CNN the DNA and at least one of the packages was tied to the suspect so we don't know what he was trying to do well maybe we'll find out about it um in spite of what his motivation was here when it was it was you might say motivation was he trying to hurt people was just trying to scare them that kind of thing\nBut what's also interesting is whether or not what people were when this ah with this whole thing was announced that there was an arrest and what they what they thought\nAnd what they still might think might be going on here I've been here for people on on social media talking about a false flag and all this other stuff this guy's a Patsy he didn't do anything it's amazing how people's minds go right there and we've been talking people through this\nAnd try to get to the bottom of why they think the way they think was it calling today so Jay's Narragansett Jay you're on WPRI J\nLooking for a car credit not played well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in East Village and there were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent NPR for Seventy two months you could be driving on affords also models interest free log onto what auto John ...\nA ... but you seem to be totally against that because there is the theory and I'm I was with the most my life I'm almost sixty your pay yep but all the crap that's going on that's been brought to a tension over the last couple of years\nI I Try to believe that that is very serious or the or write or war you're listening to the um with the Trump advisor guilty or got what they say oh\nYou're talking about ... as a Papadopoulos is that his name is that what you're talking about you're talking we were talking I yes\nThat's the that's the way it was about ...\nI did not know\nOkay if you listen for what he said what they did this or that the FBI ... okay you wouldn't believe this theory okay cause\nYou read about it you're the that he was just at a ...\nAnd now he's going to try to go and do it you know they had even though he served time in at least there one day in jail but it's going to go get the information that is the yesterday during his hearing is that where they where they discuss things with him in the area that was saying\nThat he was a Patsy and he's got a new lawyer\nSet up by whom boozy set up by a by the FBI or get the size of war and um they they said\nIt was a guy from Russia that whole that rush goes I I think that Russia had rushing\nOr they had they had to opposition research that was funded by the Democratic they've come to Hillary Clinton campaign although\nIt's just a for that is just before that this is the one where they are the guy came to him he didn't even know that guy out of the blue ... him and said listen the Russians have emails Hillary Clinton I think it was like yeah OK whatever they had nothing to do with this guy and a whole week or two later they\nWere going to we're going down and we're going down a road that we were going down this this this long ... again you say you believe the conspiracy theories but the conspiracy when you see that there's a thousand of them and some of them may lean more towards possible versus the others and so to say you believe you you believe all of them I mean it says a lot\nThe man's been taken into custody there was this ban that has um that has been taken as well uh the van itself has windows that were covered with details\nOr the decals we're all pro Trump um type of messages and anti Democrat type of ... messages and ah you know so I don't know ... to what extent that what this guy was I should say that I don't know what this guy was trying to achieve if he was actually trying to hurt people\nOr if he was um you know trying to scare people trying to send a message trying to get attention we don't know what the guy's motivations are but evidently he was in a business this morning and they took\nThey took him into custody didn't seem like it there was any struggle or any kind or anything like that his social media or should say Facebook page in any way has been taken down um\nIt's interesting to watch people react to this I mean it already there the\nExtremists are out there talking about how they don't they doubt this is real they don't think it's terrific disguises set up they think this is a bunch of garbage um you know I don't know what they do they listen there's a lot of things that people do that don't make sense and if you take things that people do that don't make sense\nAnd you automatically ascribe some form of conspiracy to it or that there's some shading is going on\n... and we were trying to take some level of sanity irrationality to somebody who just sent politicians either real or semi real or pretend real overtime pretend or you know fake real bombs you know speak really been a thing as made it up Josh is talk of Joshua WPRI Josh\nSaid oh man I just kinda wanted to comment on your comments with the conspiracy and I think what we need to look at it and these conspiracy yes I agree now everything's conspiracy well let's look at ... ... what was one of the timing of all the events\nAll summer nothing happened and I I I go to school I I said before the Christine Blasey Ford they\nWatch is the only be a very eventful October November and in the last five weeks we've had a rapist\nJews dedicated wife the service right and we have a cat and the people coming into the United states and it's like it's all\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator floods Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nI I mean it's kind of\nWell listen I timing is white listen to you saying that something trees he's going to happen during an election season is like saying what jobs it's going to be lots of decorated trees around Christmas Time watch you know what I'm saying\nBut I mean there you'll watch coming up in December\nThere's going to be lights all over people's Bush's watch a guarantee it you know what I'm saying\nThat that that's a that's a production of of a of a cultural thing I'm predicting\nRight just south of all I Want to say that again the protection of what\nIt took ... production of a cultural thing we do in America\nRight now say that about September and October during an election year\nSo that cultural ... attacks on Democrats that's not a cultural thing that's ...\nWell not physical tax them I'm Talking about you said I'm Talking about your overall statement that something crazy is going to happen crazy things happen ... ... and when it comes to an election season so my point is like the cabin off thing that was all political all political that's ... that's different that's that the military\nYou know like I'll give you an example\nI'll give you an example rag human example\nUm there is a mailer that went out\nTo people or the last day or two\nThat says that is a ... you can literally I mean whoever did this is almost like it's a diabolical genius because whoever created and I should say I know funded or the Democratic party in Rhode Island funded the state committee funded this mailer the mailer can be taken either depending on your point of view\nIt took a Rorschach test you see it as what you want to see and if you don't like Trump and you didn't you get it ties true load of Trump in a negative way if you like Trump than it ties true low to Trump in a positive way\nAnd it was sent to a bunch of people including Republicans now the Democratic state committee did that that is a conspiracy can technically they conspired to do this because a vote for for trouble oh\nShit hurts Allan Fung and helps Gina Raimondo ... or a tiny little to Trump helps her to show it's a you know it's it's a whole thing where it's a double whammy it's a double edged sword either helps them or hurts him\nA and helps in hurts wherever that they can tie to Trump and and so it's a really put a couple of times it's it's a conspiracy with the Democrats in state of Rhode Island a legitimate real life hey we're going to get together and do this\nOn the guy that was arrested in New York with the whole world to the explosives Rosenfeld whatever his name was ... no media coverage because it was it wasn't against the ... the last was against all politicians\nWould guy I don't know what you're talking about what who\nTurned out to you because there was a guy arrested in New York about two weeks ago with a bunch of explosives with a plan to go bomb you see during the elections and it was a report on because it wasn't it wasn't on the left it was it didn't help the well\nI I don't I missed the Josh if that happened I don't know what you're talking\nAbout I don't I don't know man to it and I know there's a different\nI mean does it yeah okay there's that that I Know that is called the biased right that may be why as a media\nBy writers let's try to like you know what this whole Gina Raimondo and call it that it's like you know who look at her commercials it's all\nType at the Trump the guarding and tried to\nCut that is what should we will see what happens is we should mixing a thousand different things here that all look alike\nYou have media bias which is real it's there I mean it's it's not even trying to be hidden in hidden any more people just because I Know that's the one you have political um strategy which is what you're talking about with Gina Raimondo in her ads they're trying to manipulate your thoughts through advertising that's what they do and then you have a a the the\nUm the criminal activities of a person\nThat you automatically ... not you but people are automatically assuming are part of some kind of major league or you know conspiracy about and I'm\nNot saying it is I'm just saying we have to work at timing with events like the Caribbean thing like suddenly in the beginning\nOf the camera is ending and suddenly equal wanna it's possible or over the\n... let's say the timing is very convenient that's more\nThan ... ask don't convenient if somebody\nWants to pick up and sensationalize\nWhat will happen people get package every day that are on now many times around ... eat well you know suspicious talking packaging parking lot you know\nSure we know what I'm saying is you're noticing of the media's trend to focus on certain things other than others is not necessarily\nThe evidence that shows that there was some sort of democratic conspiracy to make the bomb happen it's just that the Democrat the that the um the basically what happened was the that the the media focuses on the the the sensationalistic story\nAnd let's face it before this guy was ... I was talking to a close friend of mine I said why aren't you the Soviet style and create the Trump supporter now all over his house I didn't say car but I so I guarantee you hear the case for Trump and talks about how great he is\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nIt didn't wasn't what what actually made the guy do it\nOne hundred percent either area it's All right I always look at timing with everything I have a guitar I look at me but I don't know why\nAre we look at the time and the timing is interesting I don't know if it puts us over the edge if there's a conspiracy\nOr no answer your question you said I Need more proof and I'm like yeah it's not proof but I I I think you can actually\nOh believe me there's enough there's enough holes especially in something that we don't know what this guides deal was right we don't know enough yet to Josh thanks man you you know there's enough holes in any\nYou know breaking developing criminal case\nThat we watch a lot I mean one of the detriment of where the downfall of\nSpot news you know on the spot breaking news as it happens type of thing\nIs that yeah you people can can growing audience by being first and given in and it makes you stay tuned the whole time because you want updates you know what was this thing was what's the new what's his name she's standing you watch it the downside of that is that you don't get to know the whole story all at once so you get the story in dribs and drabs you analyze it as it goes\nAnd you fill in the holes that you don't have your 'cause you're not investigator right you don't have the information or have you don't have the guy in custody you can ask questions about it doesn't it doesn't sound right to you because you're filling in holes and yourself and asking questions\nAnd just because you don't know the answers doesn't mean that they're not high interest out there and that they don't make sense in some way and at the end of the day even if you do know the whole story and have all the answers\nOther people's actions based on their perception of the world it's not always going to make sense do you\nBelieve Bob's napping on Billy Bob you're on WPRI bills off it Matt how're you doing good thanks good ah so I have two theories on this guy in the ... the non bomber I call them because they don't go off right anyway uh\nWe all know that there's a whole bunch of crazy in Florida though is just crazy and that um\nWhat is it was Florida Man did what what what is it that everybody said I didn't know this until recently but every time I see something crazy going on in Florida people are always like a typical Florida what was the Florida depository of urban seen people or something I didn't know about what goes on in\nThe melting pot alright get let me just say this to you all\nThe left wing or is up from the north east retire down there so maybe that's why it's a crackpot place\n[laughter] and you're fed up\nWith it and he figures the main people behind this identity politics it targeted right and it's just crazy and set up or have you seen as Dan\nYes yeah it looks kinda pristine do you think\nWell I mean based on the pictures I saw I guess\nI mean if you're driving that around people are gonna throw stuff at it you know\nWhat's the un scribble are supposed to do\nIt they don't let her that are being better in the name that being right right and it goes what other work it'd be great with those letters\nYeah so if you take the name that's being floated\nOut there the U.S or are those are those letters but it misses the scramble or is he on an online friend for ya and it's

fascinated by the by the propensity for people to want to take it to a a level where there's some nefarious mind control\nType of thing going on here it's possible\nBut I mean here's the thing is is an interesting point do people just\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best finance raising prices in cars with zero percent if you are for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log on to what Tom\nLike do you find it interesting to see what people are saying about the possibility that this kind of a thing was set up all your Democrats set this up in order in order to uh to gain sympathy before the midterm elections and blah blah blah\nYou know one of those things right is that is that something that\nUm\nThat just is interesting to you or do you actually look at it go this is real this is real I think Ninety nine percent of the people\nWho will post about or send me stories about conspiracies ... do not live or act as if they're real\nBecause if you did you'd be in a you know under the bunker someplace under the under the bridge somewhere or on a underneath a a you know under the docks having a meeting about the building and army against the conspiracy\nThere's no way you really believe that 'cause if you really believe that you would\nAct differently that's what I said I said about atheist all the time they really don't believe that God doesn't exist they say they do they think they do but they really do because if they did they would act in a completely different fashion they don't believe that there's nothing afterlife this and that they don't believe they don't really believe that 'cause they act as if\nThey live their lives every day as if this is they got nothing to worry about\nAnd in that way\n\nYou know what I'm saying there is no way you act as though you act a certain way there's no way that people out there that they think that there's all these conspiracies actually believe that because they don't act like they are they don't act like they like their real they don't\nThey go to work every day they pay their taxes they watched their television shows and they do whatever they go on online and they read about in you know they they dabble in the nonsense on Twitter because they're fascinated by they find it interesting\nThey find it you know but they they don't they don't actually live it because if they lived it we'd have whack a do is doing crazy things they have people you know people are forming armies and everything else they just they you know there are some people out there who live it but not many most of the people just find it mildly amusing but the people who watch\nOr listen to Alex Jones\nAnd that kinda stuff they watch it to be entertained or they look at it me entertainer to be said to find out or or maybe get get a little bit of an interesting perspective on something or something different they don't live at and so I don't think they really believe that\n\nYou don't\nAnd so you know when it comes to you know what that can you want to know what the what a conspiracy is wondering what a real mystery is I'll give you a real mystery how about this one I have a\nPipe in my basement and my my garage under the I have a garage have my basement as my garage and like I put my car and underneath a garage underneath my house is a\nPipe that just sitting there in the ... that comes out of the ceiling I have no idea what it does [laughter] I've been staring at that thing and I had an assumption is that what it was\nBut I don't think I'm right I actually called the plumber some of that that did my house left him a mess is asking if you could help solve the mystery for me you never call me back so I'm thinking maybe this the the the ... he got him and his is taken away and they won't tell me\n\nSo for me it's a matter of ah [laughter] that's the real mystery so if there's anybody out there that knows how to solve that mystery you can actually give me a conspiracy theory on that one I'd love to hear it\nMan that's what it is well hold on a second nobody likes fruit anymore everybody likes to just regurgitate what they've been packaged and people will hate you if you don't buy into the the illusion that they're trying to create\nWell you have to have to prove to me that's an illusion\nIf if you don't if people don't want to have an honest debate snake hang up on the radio when anybody can play Sherlock Holmes go on on the Internet and and

why we've noticed credit for that phone wire it I got back by anything except the\nGood they are talking\nAbout for the full faith and credit Charles thanks for the call I appreciate it I got all these people who are um who are given me advice of toward that mystery pipe is my\nMy ... getting emails from people this one actually sounds\nThis is what I thought it was this is actually what I thought it was\nUm which is interesting\nIt's as if it's a small PVC pipe it's likely a secondary overflow pipe from the paint onto your washer or air conditioning unit in the attic often they place them somewhere noticeable so you know that there's an issue with the primary however shouldn't pierced the ceiling of your garage if there's a living space above that's a hazard\nWell you're more room certain for your house you have that there's a pen\nThe ... there's a piano these my washing machine that has a drain on it and I thought that's what it was I was thinking about points of water down the drain and putting a bucket underneath that pipe sticking on my feeling it is a small PVC pipe is it but it's it's not kept no\nIt's open\nSo if it if that's what it is the I don't know what I don't understand however shouldn't pierced the ceiling of your garage if there's a living space above that has it it doesn't appear said it's all\nAround it it's it's sealed up on it like it's it's it's a plastered up to it it just sticks out of it lets her living room right above yeah\nSo I Know I always wonder what the hell it is I have no idea what that pipe is four and I thought it was that because I figured that they would make it but why would they\nWell I guess you want to know about it so like if if my drained clogged up my dream goes down into the wall and so if I have an overflow some kind of the washer the washing machine slew of flows over the concept is that this drain it they'll go into the pan that's underneath the washing machine\nAnd then go down this pipe and then I guess what flood the floor my garage to want to go into my garage into the hell's this but I don't think there's plumbing on that side of your house is\nNot on that side no\nMoney this plumbing right next door this late in the kitchen and whatnot but this was like yeah there there's not that that that little that area there's nothing right above it right so it must go through those wall they're above it ... it must go up either into the addict or something else I don't know what that is\nI don't know what the pipe is\nIt's probably about an inch wide PVC pipe it's not piercing the ceiling I think what this guy's talking about this guy Mike wrote in to be thinking that when I start the car up then the gas and the from the car the ... would go up into the into the are the places but but you know what I Do as soon as I don't I have the doors open\nBefore I left the car up and as soon as I start the car up I pulled the car out fast because I Want that they don't want that happens you know I I worry about that myself I don't know I don't like the I don't want the car run in the garage and pull it out\nSo I think ... I guess they leaving in a public spot I didn't know that and I called the plumbing the guy didn't call me back which is not is par for the course of the contractors have built my house they're all mad because the builder went bankrupt and stuff a lot of them\nBefore the ... with other houses that they built ice ice skate that nightmare by six months\nWe closed on the house into the house six months later I find out from everybody are the only thing I loss was a war in ... a year or two on stuff so if anything goes wrong I'm screwed I got to take care of myself get called the building I lucked out big time\nIs when I heard about that man I was like ...\n\nI was not I was not happy about that but now you know I listen I've been in there for almost three years now it's going to be all mind me anyway at this point it is what it is but I I've been looking at that pipe for literally years I I'm going to cold I\nI ... I figured that's what it was I thought actually thought it was that pipe I guess you could just put a bucket underneath and pour the water down the drain and find out real quick but it seems to me why would you just pour that down into the into the septic\nToday five zero eight eight for one three six seven one my stomach study dot com\nStaples ... printing in color as veteran when promoting or business but don't take our word for it research shows that color makes her company look more professional and improves brand recognition it's also snows ear\nStaples and research that last part that just seems obvious so coming to staples and get twenty percent back and rewards on color printing from banners their brochures and copies of reason patients\nPrint more color save more money\nAt staples installed and eleven penny teen restrictions applying these or associated staples ... back pretty tough\nRaces for the hell are rare\nSuck up and said this fall at your neighborhood is when you're taking care of the everyday projects around your house races you're one stop shop to find exactly what you're looking for get great deals now through October twenty nine\nLike buy one get one free on select Eli the light bulbs buy one get one free on east basic how these and by to get one free unease furnace filters pony up here locally helplessly offers out are participating stores exclusions and limits ...\nRan opening of the sporting shopping arrange to preserve massive sales October twenty seven twenty eight [noise] alright five o'clock\nNews time stay with us we've got more immigration malarkey to come\nAway from the New England solution studios living away from the general election this news talk Ninety nine seven AM six thirty W.

I ...\nI did have a deal yours is vandalized about fat jokes learning Mandarin to order ethnic how you got nothing on me that brine\nWell it it got there's got to be a few short jokes in there as well I'm sure\nYou know what I wanted to put those in personally [laughter]\nI'm going to I'm going to backtrack a year and go back to the Nineteen eighty four New York state classic baseball's championship in ... in New York state when I was in high school or the classes were not won a five to eight three eight et cetera they were bc be\nAn a and so we were a large school with a nationally ranked bought that's worth I don't know how they determine in collegiate baseball magazine and USA Today with the top twenty five high school baseball team twice the country but we're actually actually nationally ranked in my junior and senior years\nAnd as a junior we played orchard park high school or to park of course the home of the bills\nAnd Ralph Wilson stadium and the ... player for orchard park was a guy by the name of Dave Holland and you may remember Dave Holland's as the third baseman and part of macho row with the un actually championed the Philadelphia Phillies and later played for a couple of other teams and and a lot of going into ... but it's got for many years\nIn baseball you may have won quite a work for the red Sox even I I Know I've seen him\nOn a lot in my minor league baseball travels but that was as a junior and then as a senior or after losing in the state championship an extra ... the year before and we end up winning and the ah another extreme game I think over\nFalls New York I catch them high school way up north and the uh in nearly a maniac in the Canadian reaches of of New York state or we were just a\nA you know we're able to pull that one out as opposed to the year before and play with a really a great team we had a catcher who want to go into AAA got as far as ... lay with grows my best friend time in\nA short stop for the team Marcel piano or became a a very good baseball scouts man is the former director player development for the Florida Marlins vice president ... Florida Marlins\nWon the world series run with them and then in two thousand and seven got World Series rank as a special Simon Scots the red Sox and now works for the evil empire in New York so I was a great time I I wasn't exactly the best baseball player I was one of those all glove had guys even as a high school kid but\nIt was a great experience and ah you know lo and behold many years later I got a chance to tell about it with your listeners\nWhile this is pretty amazing yeah Bob ... the best pitcher at all or in high school in Nineteen eighty five to be a better choice for quarterback this week for the Buffalo Bills by Eric Anderson and they're huge or it off into the wild\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new borders games were just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... how\nAre you kidding Bob where are you talking about the patriots hanging on the on the bill or Bob so see this is your life for crying out loud I mean how\nLong I've got the number one left you wind up playing a Quinnipiac briefly and then eventually with the University of Arkansas out ... he could run he wasn't he was he was a pretty good pitcher but he was a better outfielder off but he could probably run the triple option or at least run some of the army oh right\nAnd and and do very well with those uh but uh you know I look at the let's say look look at the bills they got a good defense despite what happened last week and then of course they gave up all over two hundred yards rushing to the Colts but this was a team that had to defend short fields as regularity all season long the goals of\nAh you had more turnovers touchdowns offensively they've scored offensively Andy Ott early you have to eat or does she as a team of eighty one take away that you take away their ran over Minnesota and in the first half of games and they've been a shutout now four times in the first has a ... for the last two weeks\nThey've been off scored a hundred and ten to Thirteen and\nAll that being said they've used three different quarterbacks of course Peter ... uh once again to getting a chance to start a little bit this year and and really struggling\nA Josh Alan ... a big rocket guy with a big charming and certainly he ran well against the Viking their best game by far to date and as you meant Derek amason signed off the street a couple of weeks ago and pressed into starting duty for the first times two thousand sixteen [noise]\nIn the last game and I I think the only hope for the bills and all in all fake missed on Monday Night is is some help from the patriots and when you look at the back over the last few weeks even though they won for in a row and they've been on a nice roll to win column\nThey've committed some careless turnovers and they've made some uncharacteristic mistakes be it by giving the ball away or having breakdowns\nIn different facets of the game or or with penalties so you know it's going to be an active crowd of the bills are you know playing a ... at two and five I Try to answer a lot of critics don't ... understand me already up in western New York's by making the playoffs last year uh they've been heavily criticized this week with their lack of\nEffort perceived\nAnd the media in by fans of life from what I've seen and uh you know I think that it it it's a game where the bills are in a lot of ways they're going to play the Superbowl or at least for the first half of the season I'm not against the ... the first time they poster Monday Night football game two thousand ...\nBob so see with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh Bob from the patriots and\nAh what are you expecting do they try to pounded you they spread 'em out and throw it I mean it's almost like whatever they choose against the bills they go out and they executed and they and they\nHad an unprecedented run on success against this team you know I almost really wonder if it matters because the bills have just had an amazing inability to stop the patriots over the years regardless of what they do\nYeah it's it's it's really true you know ... without Tom Brady they've they've done it a few times most notably in that game of years ago and you know uber set hours quarterback a couple of seasons now I'll buy your your mind to build the the the the record for the patriots against that built\nA during the course of the ... ready to run a is kind of parallel to what Notre Dame used to do the navy and Oklahoma Kansas\nAnd the college drink 'cause it's like a dominant\nCollege theories where you know state you beats up on you know the smaller branch campus year after year and that's met with no disrespect\nTo the building this it's just unprecedented really in modern times in the NFL and you have a series so lopsided a and the patriots you know have been able to do it and a lot of different ways one of the things to your your first question that concerned me about this game is no Sony Michel\nIn all likelihood of course you have James White Kenyan barter him in Kansas for those who have been a practice player of the week up on the practice squad\nUp but the questions as well with Rob ... situation and going into buffalo you know are they gonna be able to run the ball on that event\nBecause I I think the bills obviously going to look to shore things up they got paid a lot on the edges last week running with multiple tied ends in in in Indianapolis of the really nice job\nAh with their their one game a outside against the bills\nI eat you know I think the patriots in this contest or are more apt to try to spread it out in the Brady do his thing uh in particular with the way Chris Hogan and Josh Gordon uh have have really come along the compliment what Julian Edelman has done and again a lot of it depends on on on the the situation or with their death or lack there of it I think in a couple of positions [noise]\nTen AM to four AM every day in the storm they've blizzards or any hall live your openness especially like

tell gators who are going to go out and football games\nLike they need professionals like you people who are running a place like ... pizza to sort of give them a tip you happen to have potentially

Syracuse ... Albert [noise]\nHard [laughter]\nWatch yeah apparently they cut to mark and Chris Webber and Chris Weber fell over on the table and uh that's somehow still made it into the highlight package for the game there I I didn't have to search for that that was click here for Celtics highlights and I got\nMartin Albert describing Chris Weber falling down to Ernie Johnson so I just\nI guess that's what they are but the Celtics are very impressive comeback win that war is something I found earlier again if you follow me on Twitter outreach nation I retreated it with a with the uh my own little caption their comment that said Brad\nBe who's where it ... because it was I Do believe dime on up rocks weeded out how the Celtics were mainly able to come back\nFrom a Fifteen sixteen point deficit against the Oklahoma City thunder using a lot of corn or threes now not just three that oh you throw it to the guy in a corner and he shoots the breed and that just happens to be where it's coming from\nBut if you click on the link from up rocks or that's on Twitter they have a video there that's broken down much like a you know mad and would break it down with the teleprompter they're back in the day with the little lined ... boom and and such\nA ... a lot of screens to get guys into the corner because they knew that if they forced the big on Oklahoma City to extend to the parameter that they wouldn't be able to do and they'd be able to beat them with the mid range and the three pointers and that strategy right there at its finest in and hats off to to Bradley ... than the Celtics last night and I\nCan't believe I'm about to say this but what you described Kenny Smith did a great job at half time talking about except he called one of the players surge of bunker and not being able to get out\nThere that's why you try to stay away from the names and yeah yeah although Steven Adams as probably still on that a yes or you name it burns zone\nAnd he stands out that the that Steven Adam good they are good when by the Celtics or they will be in action tomorrow night uh where they will\nWhat auto group once your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nTomorrow night at seven in Detroit\nBoy oh boy if it weren't early in the year that would be a danger game not because the pistons are any good but because who wants to put out great effort on a Saturday Night in Detroit against a bad team a and I leave it at that\nThe Boston Bruins also have a big one on Saturday\nFor you punk kids you know what I'm Talking about because this is one of the games that you probably had circled on your calendar\nIf the patriots perspective you're going in without Sony Michel ... I think we can guarantee that was put Bronx route fifty fifty\nOn drunk I is probably rented more towards playing I I think what you'd be more likely to see is him play the first half or something to that effect and then\nSome sort of phantom injury sidelines and for the rest of the game because I'm with you there in terms of\nYou should be able to be buffalo without him so he's not a hundred and ten percent there's really no need to play on but again you also mentioned the other side of that sort or coin yeah depending on which metaphor you'd like to choose their is that ground needs to play needs to get those catches these get those touchdowns and yards in order to get that money so\nYou know if he's close to being able to play he's going to be wanting to play so I think maybe a happy medium would be get them out there for a couple of series if indeed that is the case and then get them off the field because I'm with you in terms of\nI don't think the bills you mentioned TJ award I don't think there are going to be any players on the bills necessarily that are out there intentionally taken cheap shots but just as dangerous or crappy players\n... yeah yeah that's certainly know what they're doing so just dive at the lake ... ad out I got her by my TJ war because it was all while they don't want to tackle anymore right and it's the perfect excuse for somebody to just dive in\nBronx me uh and that's what scares me I don't look I I don't even though I Love the running game for the patriots and I'm not saying they're not going to try to run the ball um you know normally in Buffalo they've gone more the spread 'em out route\nThen they have the let's run right Adam route and now you got James laid back there being the main ball carrier along with Kenyan Drake and some guy they pulled off the practice squad garner who to what I say ... I always say Kenyans right now I got a real brain lock on that Kenya honor Kenyan\nA Kenyan born or other Hugo Oregon scientists um and then some guy who was up on the practice squad was telling people are grim this we talked to was just to get a hand off from Tom Brady in practice a Jonas Gray ... oh my God\nWe're going to wear ... remember he was going to be the next big thing was going to cover sports does yes he was after is for touchdowns in Indianapolis and tell me about great he was washing cars I\nMean that is Jonah strays the perfect example of\nBell check his capable of anything that's right that is exactly right I'm Sean McDermott as Bob so she mentioned when we did the\nThis is your life ... socio patriots bills that good he mentioned that you grew up next to Sean McDermott says he may be at the end of the cul de sac we had Sean McDermott here in the Russian bills\n[laughter] and uh McDermott is apparently coming under heat because their quarterback situation is a mess\nFolks here's what's going on in Buffalo so they draft the kid Josh out when he gets hurt they can't turn to Nathan Pete Herman because last\nYear when the team was rolling with toured rod Taylor\nThey took all turn rot out and they tried to put in J Peter man and it blew up in his face so now when they needed to make another quarterback decision he couldn't go back to Jay Peter men so they had to turn to the guy who had ten days in the building and then started and just got to beat out of them\nI like the ... last night he's like I don't think my buddy Derek Anderson was planning on actually playing when he signed for that in my life up he was going to be Billy Joel ... is just should it be a catty and be alone for the ride and making money in there you go and provide some veteran leadership in that room and said it's well\nHe hears again I don't know if I use this on the air here or not I can't remember I said it on I think it said this on\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit letter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator was Lincoln if they're against it unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nAnd then it's uh who wants to go get the bags and everybody but one person takes a step backwards and the person left as the one that got the I think that's what happened with Derek Sanders\nHave forgot to put his finger on his nose when they were and then all of a sudden he had to try to or I guess because it's me\nAnd there is that now he's a thirty five year old guy who was you know playing with the kids or what not he's got the old grey beard working and he's now starting quarterback\nOf what is according to the stat nerds and while we wait on this big this might be even worse off and in the history of the NFL\nCertainly could be I Do notice that from a gambling standpoint\nI Want to say if not still the patriots opened as the largest roads favorite I think in the history of the NFL or something close to that the largest road favored in like a decade or something like that and it's not very often grass patriots or not that teams are favored on the road by to touch down so that tells you a\nWhat the gambling community what the community at large thinks of the Buffalo Bills and a mostly probably yes ah their lack of often\nI'll tell you what next hour or we're going to go through some NFL superlatives so we'll probably move around the NFL quick much planning on eight twenty five folks\nI'm going to tell you about all of the\nUh numbers they can be reached this week including one with Tom Brady\nWhere if he throws four touchdown passes he will move to second in the all time touchdown passing list in the NFL tying
