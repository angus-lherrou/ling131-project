by the ... than the leader of the Soviet Union a country that still exist\nAnd Ronald Reagan president of the United states it was the abolish myth of a complete class of missile never done before these were missiles that were\nIntermediate range from a few hundred kilometers to several thousand kilometers and the concern was based in New York based in Russia\nLooking for a car credit not played well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in East Village and there were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent NPR for Seventy two months you can be driving on affords also models interest free log on to what Tom\nBallistic missiles of the U.S and Russia in silos that have a big ballistic ark and you have some warning time\nThere is none with the INS so what that means is when the missiles were fired miscalculation or not you must respond instantly don't check should launch on warning\nThat is what started the end of the Soviet us Cold War in Nineteen eighty seven when the two scientists in these last hours the president of the United states the knowledge that the U.S will leave the INS treaty between us and Russia\nIn six months time unless there is satisfaction that the Russians formerly the Soviets are not violating the INS treaty by building a new class of missiles intermediate range missiles\nTo replace the Soviet era ss twenties these are immobile missiles on a great big truck that you can fall into the forest the tiger shoot from anywhere\nAnd again there's no warning that just come there like cruise missiles they fly\nRight through and destroy either operations or leadership or other missiles before they can shoot back we welcome Rick Fisher of the international assessment of strategy center riding most recently the epoch times about the INS trading and China\nRick I'm very good eating you does China at the pie LA\nDoes it have intermediate missiles that are comparable to the ss twenty of the twentieth century good evening direct\nGood evening John indeed China does have intermediate range ballistic missiles two thousand fourteen it revealed its dong facing the F twenty six a four thousand kilometer range\nOr intermediate range ballistic missile comparable to the old Soviet ss twenty\nR B um that was the subject and was destroyed because of the INS treaty China does have this missile in both are armed with nuclear warheads and with the new verbal anti ship ballistic missile warheads Gordon\nRick there a couple of problems with the IMF treaty right now I'm principal among them is that the Russians have been violating it since at least two thousand eight\nAnd the United states despite what has been doing has not been able to bring the Russians into compliance that would seem to me to be a good reason to get out of the treaty because we just have a one sided agreement right now but the other reason is what you've just been talking about and that the Chinese are not a part of the treaty the question is\nDo you think it's possible that Beijing could be persuaded to join a new uh I N F treaty which should include Russia and the United states\nGordon uh it's my opinion that are both the Russians and the Americans at various times have tried have implored the Chinese to consider some kind of relationship with the IMF treaty the problem with China\nAh since we started a outreach since really since the Nineteen eighties when we began to try to have these conversations with the Chinese is is that they have refused entirely\nTo be constrained in any way by an international arms control treaty or they\n... their goal is dominance and if your goal is to dominate well then you conceal you hide you refuse any kind of transparency so that your enemy or can prepare to defend themselves against the Chinese understand this and so they reject arms control as we have practice it even with\nOur dire enemy the former Soviet Union\nJob does Russia\nHave a dialogue with China about intermediate range missiles they in the same concern could be ... imagine Russia had with Europe Russia could have with China there is no warning here\nOr John it's my opinion are based on conversations that\nThere is a wide swath of the Russian national security elite that has long been concerned with China's military buildup especially their buildup of ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles unfortunately for them however ... has decided that he\nNeeds China's economic support in order for his regime has dictatorship to survive so he is going to downplay and ignore the strategic challenge from China for now\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nPeriod of ... talked with try to that the Chinese are going to come after them and so they ... they were buying time to prepare for an eventual Chinese tilt against the Russians garden\nFor Rick with these short and intermediate range missiles or the Chinese have them all of them are appear to be mobile even the ones that are supposedly hidden underground\nThe U.S doesn't have road mobile a ballistic missiles we've got ones that are in silos they're really vulnerable um because they can be taken out on a first strike\nUm do you think that the United states will actually go to what the Russians and the Chinese have which are these but a ballistic missiles sitting on big trucks that can just go wherever they want or are we going to stay with a silos or in the future\nOf Gordon the army has a program to build a modern short range ballistic missiles and there have been suggestions from army officials that they would like medium range ballistic missiles as well\nUh the Chinese have been building medium range ballistic missile solid fuel mobile medium range ballistic missiles ah since the early Nineteen nineties\nUh twenty seconds right the American military wants them as well and as we do build\nThem and we should we should also consider offering the technology to our allies in Asia\nWreck Fisher the international

particular we've I mean we've had now several months\nOf steel tariffs much less time with China specific tariffs but several months with steel and aluminum tariffs\nAnd it's clear Isabel from every major data series at the American government been puts out that not only are those industries that use steel and that and that use aluminum not being harmed by these towers yet they're actually out

part of the big point that you make that I think that's very important is that there's there's a if there's a reality out there and there's also a bigger perception that the people in charge never get

that you do you think it is that's that that's your health on to their identity thanks for the call 'em you know there is this and I don't even know if it's ever going to be a a um I don't know if there's ever going to be\nAnd\nThey started off I guess it was on TMZ right don't use the originally TMZ had soul story and it said that you know this guy used the N. word in a forum with children in high school\nYeah no funnily enough or you know picking up around politics from TMZ is the first thing that happened on Tuesday for me anyway\nEarly so you have this thing where where you ... when you when I hear what do you think when the easiest somebody used the N. word\n\nWhat do you think of that you hear that they used the N. word so you would think some someone pulled some kind of Michael Richards thing and cold somebody that right they leverage did against somebody you're riding a wave against someone yeah you you've assaulted somebody with that word you've you've thrown in that somebody who would be offended by it who\nYou were trying to make the rage of racist infected vets are infected with somebody\nAnd you were hurling it at\nThem in a way to verbally assault them\n\nThere's more than one way to use any word right you can describe\nIt usually ... words are just symbols for ideas right and so when it comes to using a word and a racist fashion your intent is highly highly important\n\nSo I mean over and over and over again oh ... attorney general candidate uses the N. word using I mean he didn't really use the N word against anybody he didn't call anybody that he was\n... and this is where the store even goes even further off\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit ladder of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln and Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator floods Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nOut 'cause they didn't want to say it\nSo the story becomes this guy is attorney general candidate in Rhode Island used the N. word he didn't use the N word he spelled it out as a ... and making a comparison to it in a fashion by the way so patently stupid I Can't even imagine it um\nAnd I'm sitting there and there are people that are going around saying that this is that he used this word and I'm I'm banging my head against the wall saying no can we please be accurate about what happened here\nAnd it's like\nWe just deciding that this this ... ...\n... characterization of what happened to paint the picture is something that's completely the alternative all the antithesis of what actually happened\n\nNot to mention the crock pot nature of you know marijuana having racist routes I mean it's so please stop it you've turned the war what's happened in our culture today as we've taken the word racist and racism\nAnd made it completely innocuous we've made it and basically innocuous because when everything is racist I mean nothing is it's Chicken Little\nYour call somebody a racist or say everything is racist than no words can be used you don't have your thing you don't get to arbitrarily decide\nThat eight term is now racist\nEither it has been as ... as a place in there that everybody recognizes and you don't just to get to decide that now here's a new word that's not a racist\nYou don't get to do that we all have to have a shared experience here that that you know what I'm saying and intent manners intent matters\nIt's not like words by themselves or just have have inherent magic to them right it's not like words have have powers like spells it's not like if you just said if the if you say the word out loud\nHe just happened to saying\nThat all of a sudden now like racism radiates from it now people who are normal and\nGood loving people five minutes ago are now infected by the word and have now turned racist that that's the kind of the connotation\nThe stupid stories about this case about what happened there because as if oh it was set in front of children so you mean not all of a sudden these good harder children were open and loving of the people who are different colors from them have now heard the word and now the the secrets seat of racism has now spread throughout their bodies like\nThe uh like like a like like venom like the uh [laughter] I like the the ... taking over in the venom ... comic book taking over the body and covering it in the black\nWhose user Amish kids who've never ruined and listening to a gangster rap for us ten years the high school kids right well just to be very rough part of this guy because he was a crazy guy pot making making outrageous statements I Would have cheered like a\nHigh school kids are cheering because the guy said some crazy stuff is talking about we'd\nWhich is why when you hear about his clapping and everything else there are some fools out there that want to give these kids the right to vote even earlier than they have now they're dummy brains because they're supposed to be their biological stupid as nothing you can do by the brains develop\nI'm the one that level of maturity in the ... in the voting booth I mean think about that have demanded that is\nRight\nSo it's like I live it's it's this is the fun house near the attorney general candidate uses the N. word [noise] oh my God somebody in Rhode Island who's a politician called somebody the N. word that's unbelievable that's not even close to what happened not even close\nBut why why would you make an accurate headlined or making accurate new story to reflect what actually happened because like like like like like like like like like like like like like\nLike the way toward TMZ picked it up right [laughter] right\nRight\nThe real crackpot if you want to the crock pot story the crock pot story and that is that marijuana is a racist term\nThat's crackpot store nobody uses marijuana as a racist term because one person a hundred years ago\nA used it that way

helping law enforcement this is something that everyone can do if you have any information at all that you think could help law enforcement to address the situation share it with law enforcement immediately\nOr let them be the judges of the value of the information don't hold back\nA so many times and I agree with the commissioner law enforcement that ultimately has proven they will find the perpetrators but so many times it's because\nI'm an individual citizens step forward with information that really led to the key breakthrough you have information\nSharing if you're concerned about uh packages that could arrive at your home or your workplace you see something that worries you reach out to the police get ah their involvement to address the situation\nPeople can be part of solving this immediate challenge but finally we all can be a part of solving the bigger situation that we're facing as a society as a nation a tone of civility a tone of mutual respect as something we all can create\nWe shouldn't just ask what are the most prominent voice is doing we also have to ask question are all of us\nTreating each other with respect treating men and women the law enforced will

nationwide investigation involving multiple jurisdictions coast to coast to give you a sense of scope just here on the New York to ATF agencies ranging from ATF\nUS postal inspection service the secret service the NYPD the New York state police and dozens of other federal state and local agencies are working shoulder to shoulder\nI Want to thank those partners for their efforts there collaboration and hard work much of their leadership is in the room with us today I also want to personally think the hundreds of men and women that are up the street working on this together\nThe FBI will continue to focus all of the resources at our disposal to identify and apprehend individual or individuals responsible for these acts\nThe investigation is still in its early stages I have said this each time that we face similar situations but\nIt bears repeating today it is vitally important that we do not inadvertently disclose information that could adversely impacted our investigation or a future prosecution\nThe public understands the need for this level of operational security and for that reason I Will not be able to answer specific questions on what we know\nWhat I can say is that at various times over the last few days ten suspicious packages were located at multiple locations in New York Maryland Florida Delaware and Los Angeles\nLaw enforcement responded and each package was collected by experts and examinations are now underway at the FBI lab in Quantico\nAsked the devices located in New York which contained a powder\nThe initial analysis indicates that the powder in those particular ... did not present a biological threat other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nWe continue to advise the American public to remain vigilant\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTC and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nReport any suspicious package to law enforcement and it

information you may have we've set up a hotline nationwide that hotline is one eight hundred call FBI and we also have a link set up where you can provide information via the Internet at tips dot FBI dot Gov\nWe are actively investigating chips you have already provided please continue to assist us with our efforts a moment of your time can make a great difference towards resolving this

[noise]\nIt's probably true that a lot of Rhode islanders don't really appreciate the global reach and the high profile to graduate school of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island has all across the world\nAnd the forty five million dollars is to specifically enhanced that program how\nWhat it'll do is three things will allow us to build a brand new ocean technology center that'll support everything from New research on offshore wind to title energy generation or two technologies to monitor\nFisheries and the climate or to a variety of other uh technologies get deployed in the

of the best left these against lefty so\nIf you got to be with Dave Roberts that's probably where you should know that would be one you up take that out on a ride and then you've got Ballenger and Jack Peterson and I think Rand Paul is the third left handed bad who was maybe fourth on that team and home rounds of course a money Austin Barnes has been getting the stuff that seems\nLike hey by the way that guy Barnes behind the play death has he done a hell of a job for the Dodgers are one he's not a good job\nI just feel like he's someone who should have hit a home run for the Yankees and I can\nFind on here [laughter] maybe John sterling\nFootball or open the horses are coming home damage you know when I was thinking of my wife there because she loves sources that video but you know I guess\nIs that we're thinking if though he gives here's here's the way I look at it the red Sox are in total control ... start who you want to start do you do what you've done and if they Roberts doesn't put those big bats him all lined up then that's on him and and I got to think\nThat when you're down to nothing in a World Series\nLike if they have to have Clinton curse shark close out game three to get a when they're going to do that to get the victory the Dodgers are now to the point\nTo where you don't completely throw all of the match up some of the numbers out the window but you you start to play a little more hunch or I don't know if you've got a guy on the bench she's got thirty five bombs\nAnd he hasn't done anything and you're in a two one game with a runner on second in the eighth inning the numbers the damn to put somebody in there who could hit the ball the ballpark\nYeah absolutely it's the old uh you know gosh I like to quote a legendary\nMaster of war sons sued when it comes to strategic situations like this\nClose friend a pair yeah very close friend of area and general sour as well and they all Jerry other on the weekend and they do what they do a chicken wing it up yeah but ... says a couple of things ... it's like when your opponent is making mistakes you don't interrupt them and so if they Roberts wants to keep doing this then allow him to keep doing this and the other thing is\nYou don't change your strategy when it's working right so\nYou know maybe the red Sox and now it's Cora will view this as well we got 'em down so if we change our strategy we can really pin them\nAnd you know what there's something to be said for that and of course out score can do no wrong right now so if he decides to do that I'm sure it would work and he and break David Price back on one day rest and somehow we're more exactly Andrew Palmer aunts would come in for him and throw a bunch of no right I Know that he Rodriguez come in and the left the trainer be rolling right exactly and we say that sort of jokingly because\nYou know ... hours on a nice roll right now and he's he's making a lot of decisions that are wise decisions but are also\nFar from certain and they they seem to be working out\nBut yeah if your strategy the one that got you hear is still working I Would find it a little hasty to change your strategy simply because you say this tiny window and again there is something to be said for having your opponent down and trying to put them out but there's also something to be said for the old adage of\nThe series hasn't even started yet you know all of a sudden LA wins one game at home\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition it was more than ... religion they're against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood all those on jobs now\nLos Angeles to maybe game five maybe maybe maybe but I'm telling you were going to see a completely different line up and while I can understand a lot of people and the people I talked to on the phone they see that coming and they're like well maybe we can stop this\nBut I don't want the red Sox the up and everything they've done and end their plans just because maybe just maybe they could do something in Los Angeles hey all they have to do was homes hold serve right and they're going to be world champion so\nYou know if you think that'll be good enough you think you can win at home don't take your foot off the gas in Los Angeles but just continue playing how you played all year and I think you'll be fine\nAnd I think that's going to end in five I think the Dodgers who gonna win game three I think it's going to be a very pressure patch game for\nAnd then gained five the red Sox are going to get a lead they're going to rake they're going to get to lead and then it's going to be all hands on deck and literally if you got to go through six different pictures to get you through six different endings then I think our scores going to do that and these guys are going to empty the tank\nI read that last night I thought that was the last game at Fenway Park this year you did oh and lord knows some people accused you of a jinx in this situation has the right genes or for kids so tricks tricks\nIn jinks or for kids but\nI just there on a roll and it it would be tough to think that the Dodgers don't clap back a little bit and what I Hope it doesn't happen is to the point where we started a righty and that changed everything no no Nathan of all the poor rich poor so uh we're starting this game\nThere's to me there's no eh thing way they were going to say sure a draw Palmer into games free of the world series is a good idea I just don't ...\nHow would that be though if the red Sox rotted out there and they Roberts sends out the same line of what does your and freeze and all these writings that he yeah another thing for encouraging to uh was that this is like the only time in the history of the world series grass that a team has tried it out in All right handed line up I mean they Robert dissenting all sorts of unenviable\nRecords here in the world series and the red Sox lead the league with five gold glove finalists Mitch moral in that first in Cannes where it's second and the whole outfield yep\nA which of course is going to feed into talk of the decision of what are they going to do with Jackie Bradley junior and as much as I was sprouting would over Mickey plain second\nUh up to nothing they're going to put ... center and they are going to put J. D. and write and\nHow do you do about JDs ankle by the way yeah I'm not looking great no it isn't looking great now how to play the outfield yeah all those left handed sluggers\nYeah I mean look I think that you've got to keep him in the line up as a whole don't fiddle with it but you've got to be mindful of him not ruin that thing or making it worse I mean they you know they're in lies the rub okay can he put something on it if you know what I mean or I don't know take a shot\nI mean toward do that thing up for crying out loud don't numbers whole foot but make him comfortable to where he can go out and play in the outfield um\nI don't I'm not worried about the old little league thing you know and they got the weakest player in right here yeah yeah I'm not so much worried about that that the the Dodgers players will be able to pick in place the ball that easily but again all those left handed\nSlugger yeah ... yeah yeah it definitely makes you think if I thought was important grass I Would be extremely work\nUm yeah I mean I think having let's put it this way you're not going to it's not like you're putting a one legged guy out there 'cause I Know what I mean or there's the old line and Family Guy the arm was second baseman voids funky and he's made\nIt to this point but I don't know what our managers thinking I mean we weren't [laughter] they Rob it's going to put that guy and [laughter] not so that nobody is not a right that a lot I hit her out on his split scratch a pretty good\nOh boy so I think for the red Sox just keep doing what you're doing and Alex court did say something video and the red Sox past would have gone right up people sideways well I've seen in the post game he said hey worst case scenario were coming back here and he is right\nSo if it goes the other way and all of a sudden our score good on a cold streak and it starts going against them you know let's not think that he's screwing the pooch on this\nRhode Island's number one Ford

the zenith fault\nWatching the eagles have gone through this year and even looking at them their game against the jags in London on Sunday the patriots sustained success\nIs nothing short of amazing 'cause you watch the eagles it's like they just can't win the close game that they can't close it out they have an issue here an issue there and next thing you know they go losing record meanwhile the patriots were twelve games every year I laughed\nAt their their season when total before the year when it was like ten and a half or it might have been nine and a half I was like yeah I'll take you over until Tom Brady doesn't play football anymore thank you\nRoss soccer with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh you've once one one you can follow him on Twitter\nAt Ross Tucker NFL the raw soccer football pod cast in the uh the Ross Tucker network ... gas including our friend Andrew brand is under a the Ross Tucker umbrella a you know and I'm Glad you brought that up Ross because I think\nPart of the reason why after Eighteen years Tom Brady Brussels\nAdvil bell a check and it was the whole grammar and stuff\nBut it's the fact that she has to push the team so hard for them to maintain that level of success like when I hear Doug Peterson saying everything is fine there's no problems here\nBut you never hear that from Bella ... yup we've got a problem damage we're going to fix it and I think that great some players who've been here for a while but that's why as you mentioned a winner living twelve games every season\n[noise] yeah I ... and just I don't think I think what Peterson\nWas saying really was we're not going to get the number one seed like we're not going to get home field advantage not even worth\nTalking about this point we're just kind of we just got a we just the pressure's off in that regard which are winner division now yeah I think that for the men ... but it has been remarkable to watch that up close and just the team it's got a lot of talent that you know has not been able to find ways to win\nAnd somehow the patriots and you know what it is more than anything else\nIt is a tension to detail is focused you know the eagles are giving examples ... they've had a lot of missed assignments\nAnd blitz pick up whether it's the old line or running back\nThey've have dropped coverages and there's just not the same level of focus or attention to detail meanwhile you almost never see that with the pages every once in a while you almost never see I'll give you an example I was in London as we discussed last Sunday twice\nTwice chargers receivers just blew by tighten the bees who look like they were confused it wasn't even like they got the it was like they got confused\nAnd the guy who ran right by um you just don't see that from New England very much at all they just don't make those kinds of mistakes especially in the old line and the secondary where\nThose mistakes are typically the most noticeable\nRoss how about the transformation of Trent Brown to being as solid left tackles need soldier was here last year\nAnd think about the fact that the forty niners didn't even think you could be there right tackle and instead they took a guy in the top ten are you\nKidding [laughter] like that you\nA top ten picket officer tackle when you already had Trent Brown you know that's another example there of the patriots being value where others didn't and\nScott actually is the best man met soldier nine old line coaches in the NFL and you know his individual period made me feel like it I was going to ...
