I have no choice but talk about things like he killed somebody in an accident he shot the body Ninety six feet and the fire is sealed hoping the final exit let's find that if you were on drugs let's find out what was going on he was\nNineteen years old and a grand jury why it was a grand jury said there was nothing that it in a dynamic those drugs that he was ...\nHe was initially charged with killing homicide his family at a restaurant across the street from the police department so he was in with all the cops in France than he went out and hire ... the mafia lawyers to defend them\nLet's let the facts come out okay open the file let's find out where your drug test and were you were you under the influence of al ... of alcohol you hit you knock the body Ninety six feet in the

just wants to sweep under the rug and say or took responsibility for it the same way he took responsibility for the police departments running as police department like a crime syndicate and and that was not me saying that was colonel Donald animals they were putting\nSomebody in in the report that he had that they put the yeah yeah what is the so you know I I'm sitting here and I'm thinking to myself\nI hear you drop that bomb today this has been discussed and kind of disposed with for a long time and in in a response to this you know perceived attack from the fund campaign and I'm thinking to myself gee are among those laughing her ear and off right now this is probably is what are you saying that the people out there sitting there going Joe you're making it so we get for more

going to get pushed around by anybody\nThey're going to run into a stone wall when they start to deal with me I'm not the one that's taking millions of dollars from\nThe lobbyists I Will stand up to

what do you uh you know it it does this poll comes out today gives you five percent of the vote five percent they got a you know a a fungus behind double digits from Gina Raimondo you see that poll what do you send me the all these polls have you in single digits space it\nKnow initially I I I I've said that I didn't believe the polls I still don't believe the polls in the last few days we've said I've said people are volunteers out on the street all over the state from Newport so west Warwick standing outside of wall greens\n... group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nSaid they want you to give them your history before you answer the question [noise] in in what I'm seeing from the people on the street that we're going to use the Joe Joe is in this race very seriously pulling way above what what the polls are reflecting\nSo you know all I can tell you is that what I'm doing is not scientific but I'm going out there and taking it to the people and the people are saying that they're going to vote for me and believe it or not I'm I'm I'm leading in that poll\nWell I mean if you've got to take that for what it's worth I Can't imagine what it's worth but what I'm getting at is I Do it for myself if I thought I didn't stand a chance I wouldn't have been this far but I'm In it and I said it from the beginning I'm In it to the end\nPeople think that you're going to just get out get out I've infested on just a thousand dollars in spending your of your own money in this campaign right now\nI don't even know 'cause I didn't I ended up you know I went out and bought motor homes and I didn't run them through the campaign I bought vehicles I I've done a lot of stuff above and beyond the campaign\nEstimate how much if you think he spent [noise]\nOh I think when I'm done probably right now I've spent about four hundred thousand ... maybe with another two hundred thousand to spend so I don't know I'm just guessing\nDo you have a limit [noise] um\nI I never put a limit on this at the beginning and I'm Still not putting a limit\nOn it no you don't have any idea what you say you know what I'm not going\nTo smile but I don't have the money to buy two TV spots in every\nHalf hour of TV I mean that's a ridiculous amount of money Gina Raimondo an Allan Fung habit um you know I Can't do those kind of buys but I I Am out there were TV ads um I'm going to be up on this station in it and another week I'm going to be up on other radio stations\nUm so I I mean social media I'm doing as much as I can with with limited resources with hundreds of thousands of dollars\nWhat is going to be your answer should election night Tom and Gina Raimondo wins and the exact ... monitor that she wins by the exact amount of money amount of votes you take and the Republicans who you of worked with and worked for and worked around for years look at you and say I can't believe you did this\nAs far as I'm concerned I don't know the ... Republican Party any explanation and I don't know anybody in explanation I got in this race because I hate the Republican Party and I think they're totally dysfunctional and they resent the fact that I that I dislike them\nAnd if you look at what's going on in Washington between the Republicans and the Democrats the both of them should be ashamed of themselves\nSo the other reason to get it again it is because I could never support Allen fun I Know too much about is dirty Bertie activity the fact that he threatens people that don't support him that he goes after their jobs\nI mean there's just too many stories I've heard about island song that ... of turns me off on them let alone the police reform bought and the fact that he killed a guy and he's got the file sealed\nIs this I've asked this question out loud it's just something personal that happened between you analogy\nNo not at all I don't dislike Allen personally at all I mean I dislike where ... what he represents but I've never had even a personal argument with him\nIs there is this issue that people calling all the time of the deal between you and a reminder yeah what's the deal that's gonna make be spend this kind of money give me a break\nLike I'm going to try to help Gina Raimondo she's got a better shot again landed on the moon next week [laughter]\n\n[laughter] and be paying for it [laughter] well the issue is there I mean whether or not there's a deal to be done I mean that said they look at that is that just as you know\nWhat is there a boat you ... I Can't support him I Would I support Raymond patriotic I Know\nI Know that's an exaggeration but you're asking me to support a guy didn't morally I think is very bad for this thing I think he's corrupt\nAll right well you told the story you told us about unit Larry Earhart citizen seemed to be anything there there's nothing else to do it by the way that day was there any\nDrinking involved when you were together no no we never drank ...

support what we allege he did\nWrite your which goes against it and think about it\nI I think the perfect example the perfect imagery is the ACLU what they used to be a seal use as to what they had become today but the presumption of innocence means nothing nothing to the American civil liberties union anymore it shows used something accord with Americans understand\nAnd the ACLU probably did decades have a a damage\nOr to themselves by saying that doesn't matter that the allegation matters by taking a side instead of defending the constitution\nAnd that's when it gets down to and so like

design I've seen also includes you walk up to the kiosk or the kiosk is even embedded into the counter like\nThey do the are they actually have like a a if you go up to a bar and a gambling city ah for those who don't gamble or never been when you sit at a bar you can get your drinks actually for free if you're gambling and they'll put the right there\nAt the seat there is a video poker thing

... but but for the bar is they'll move away from ...\nHome man on a no no no right now bartenders robot brothels yeah I guess by the way we never really talked about it we didn't talk about Houston didn't we didn't talk about and we did last week well I mean you know if you think about remember the old but I guess they still have them the coffee vending\nMachine where would make you a cup yes yeah I always go back to the Terminator two the security guard making the or it\nWas a ... that went to make a a cup of coffee didn't work out too well known as tea to walk up behind them and then became him which was weird but you think about robotics in serving food that's been around for a while\nBut it will be different in a bar like this where you go up and you basically uh order it you

Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nFor a guy who has a pretty good uh business uh or has over the years in Las Vegas and also from uh the bar rescue\nYou're never going to see a well first of all there's no way to steal from the till I'm not blaming bartenders from for that I'm not condemning all bartenders but that does happen in the business and you know ... caught it\nWhere they were you know skimming or whatever from from the register but even to a greater extent pouring way too heavy right ... robots not going to do that\nWell either one but I here's the other point because I was thinking the same thing I'd asked John tap for how far can you go with the robot bartender ...\nPena regular Barbie all robots right and just a person walking around or do you have to is is there a because he talks about the science of a bar mhm and the science of the bar is about people and interaction and wrote a a a robot can't be pleasant\nTrust me I Know a few of them well a robot also can't be angry either right MBA an angry bartender right\nOr can't can't be a drunk bartender [laughter] well that's that but how how far do you do with the science of it you mean I I can see this working totally in a place like Vegas where the focus is gambling not not communicating with the bartender or not walking into your corner bar\nSo my wife and I uh recently went to a place that had\nA robot roulette wheel\nNow we walked by several times we didn't we didn't look at it\nBecause it was often like they have a a a a what would you say it it's there's there's there's poker and blackjack were you walk up and the screen has\nYou know a dealer but it's it's animated right and so that you know the the whole tables animated the cards or animated\nWell on this roulette that's what I thought I was ... that I thought it was all animated it's actually it's it's an actual wheel in the center\nAnd you don't you're not close to every one it's not crowded like a real roulette table\nAnd so we thought okay let's see how this works and it was interesting we played it for a few minutes and it was interesting because I said you know that's that's not the animation thing is still gives you the view of a real roulette wheel right and that's important for a lot of people they don't trust right animation records that well\nIn in the case of a a a Vegas in in a in a bar setting there's a couple of settings you're going to be a nightclub kind of setting in night clubs are huge in in Vegas um where they don't care they just want to drink\nIt's not your pub riding where is that where the bartender right they used to be pleasant needs to be a companion for and carried maybe a little bit of a conversation on with you in Vegas it's not that\nIt's not that for the most part it's either the gamblers or ah like I said the nightclubs and no one cares anything except about the alcohol when it comes to the bar is all about the alcohol or it'll be interesting to see how far this goes\nI Want to be alive when they come out with the home version of the robot bartender\nAh yeah go ahead you're walking your house and they basically you've got bottles that you insert vodka whatever I mean right ten different types of alcohol that you put in their right and the mixture and everything else and then you just walk into your house and you say Alexa\nGive me a screwdriver there you go oh\nAnd then she hands you affiliates\n[laughter] I Know like so [laughter] I doubt at all I Do now [laughter] and then its eyes I profile

the service\nOr they'll share their information uh\nUm so that other service other brokers and agents who have a buyer's mhm uh can find the properties and so that they have in common but the\nBut the difference we talked about some of the differences earlier in terms of specialization in data fields and that but er the commercial exchange also is not an MLS and that they there was no uh uh immediate offer of a compensation made to their brokerage is which is really fundamental to an end my lesson than the MLS\nA properties entered and a broker says I'll pay ... percent if you bring me a buyer or with commercial exchange uh there's there's not that at least initial offer a you know certainly whatever brokerage is work out they they work out\nA and so uh so that content has created a Fort brokers to use but it's also it has as you said a a consumer aspect as well that comes with the site with the east coast site\nConsumers are can actually find properties there as well they can go and search a and find limited information but enough to to really see a see some properties and then reach out to the brokers that have those uh those properties and hopefully make a deal\nSo if I pathetically speaking if I had a small uh you know retail plaza ... three or four tenants in it and I wanted that I wanted to list that for sale could I Do that I'm east coast commercial property network\nNot directly so if you're if in this case we're using the example that you're not Joe ... right that you're you know Joe ... Joe ... and Joe ... Joe schmo is not licensed could not uh directly a list there a property in the commercial property network that we need to contact one of our brokerage customers\nAnd have the brokerage do that um themselves\nRap because ... and ... that is something that's very important because again as I said earlier in the show\nIf you were getting involved in and they're going to be trends acting real estate purchases or sales you need to have representation by someone who's experienced in that field [noise] and as an aide it real estate agent or realtor a you know we do this day in and day out multiple times a month or and several times per year at the very least\nMost folks don't buy and sell that much real estate whether it's commercial or residential so and the thing is to as a real estate agent you're our license so you have to comply with certain laws\nAnd you're going to be presumably more aware of any changes in laws that could put a positively or adversely affect the value of a property or impact the transaction [noise]\nSo you really need to work with someone and that is um that could save you a lot of liability and also um help you get more value from your transaction\nYou I agree I mean and you know I mean I've been in this industry for thirty two years or I Would never attempt to lift my own property I mean I I see the value that brokerage is whether it's residential or commercial with that but the value they bring to the table\nAnd you know they do a lot and it and frankly you know I Want to go about my business and not have to to to do what you do in selling those property so you know finding a good brokerage you know it it can't be under a overstated\nRight exactly and I would say under state in the field is there now and and you know it's just another thing too and I mentioned this before is just financing you know a lot of times if you're going to finance the residential acquisition or ride residential purchased you go to the bank you get a mortgage and then you have your money\nBut on the commercial side there are different types of lenders for different types of properties and they were all\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine Vermont flood as every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com [noise]\nCompanies depending on the size of the property and where it's located in a type of property it is that will really determine what type of lender you should be looking for but of course if you're a consumer you may not have this rolling database of ah lenders in your head or in your database\nAnd you'll be able to see everything you don't have to pay a membership fee or pay one time search for you or anything like that it's free okay um and every thing on there you're going to have all this information that you would not otherwise habit for just a conventional MLS so that's something that makes it a two things that make it very different than other opportune options out there\nAnd a great point a to follow up on that as well as a if you don't see or what you're looking for a there is a great a feature on the east coast site where uh there's needs or wants function so you can go and you can actually as a consumer enter or what it is you're looking for and uh someone will reach out to you\nYeah that that is significant because you know let's say I'm looking for a place and I want to have um\nSome kind of sports complex and so I Need something that's really big has high ceilings clear span those are all factors that you can put into your you know needs and wants and if an agent or realtor who participates in the east coast commercial property network\nHas a property like that or maybe getting a property like that they will find out that that's what you were looking for so it may be a quick way to a ... a sale but again the best thing is to lift the property with someone who participates in the east coast commercial property network because\nIt's pushed out to all of these municipalities to their databases to the state commerce alright database\nAnd consumers from literally all over the world because when you are the um when you participate in east coast commercial property network it's also a a ... a source of a resource for the um the MIT them which is the largest real estate conference in the world\nThey were twenty five thousand vendors and visitors who have access would have access to all of the listings on the east coast commercial property network whether it's one in Central Falls westerly when socket Massachusetts Connecticut anywhere along the east coast who our we have participation\nThose properties would be visible to the twenty five thousand foreign investors developers builders who are looking to invest in the United states so there is a tremendous opportunity there by getting your property on the east coast commercial property network and this is something that\nNo one else offers all of these benefits and all of these features to the consumer to the average consumer\nRight we're pretty proud of that I mean a where the platform that the east coast is built on is a national platform\nAnd so you know actually in addition to being fit feeding out to these sites we've mentioned uh the date is actually also felt the fed up to the sixty other uh sites that use the same platform but we're proud of is really the relationships that we've built with the Congress sites and the fact that\nWe've we feed our I living in Congress are I et cetera I mean that's really something that we've we've we've done we've done in our market\nThat we haven't seen done in a lot of other markets\nRight and you know why this is also significant other reason why this is ... is because we're a small market we are not New York city were not Boston Chicago so a lot of times our marketplace is overlooked by folks but we have a lot of really nice properties and a lot of nice\nI'm highly valued properties because you get a lot by locating your business in Rhode
