social media the or I mean that kind of dictates kids my age lives right now I'm so people really want to get their followers up\nBut when you drove content matters you don't need the followers I Know that a lot of people especially in ah\nRhode Island's number one for dealer is setting the standard again and again for joining us over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right and one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nAlex help them learn how to be professional what to study how to study and now you're looking at the what I think them in the rams five for the two most explosive often says and football\nMike I Know what happened to homes looks like coming out of college you know what he looks like now tell me how he's gotten better as a football player over this last year plus\nTwo thing number one consistency of mechanics\nNow the kids can make any row from any platform side arm over the top or he can he can floated he can drill it he might have the biggest arm in football but his mechanics especially\nFootwork has gotten a lot better and I think more importantly Andy what has happened is that when he was in college every single play something big was going to have\nEither really really good or really really bad and I think what Andy Reid has been able to do if you drill situational football into him and he basically eliminated the bad play once he got fourteen or Fifteen touchdown pass couple of interceptions\nAnd he's not put the ball up for grabs which he did a lot in college might may I\nWill have the call of the patriots and chiefs on Westwood One with Kevin Coogler he's with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh\nTom Brady recently said Mike split the NFL is kind of morphing into what the college game is where it spread 'em out everybody playing in space easier for a guy like him to get the ball out\nHey are you noticing that across the league and beer so is that good for the NFL game to take on the characteristics of college football\n... years ago it was always the opposite it's really intriguing because years and years ago it was the college coaches the will come to NFL camp to learn what the latest and greatest walls as far as schemes and ... and now what we're seeing and mainly\nBecause that's what we're getting from college is these days the proliferation of the spread\nOften has affected every position on both sides of the football it's not just the quarter back I mean for instance there are left tackle that will graduate this year after play four years of college football that have never put their hand in the dirt\nOkay that's a different concept that it's a different thing they're going to have to do in college you look at defense\nThey're getting smaller quicker more defensive backs on the field it's become such a space game and I think what's happening is that\nYou know built bell jak kind of been ahead of everybody forever and the NFL and I think bill was the guy that years and years ago personified taking advantage of match up in the NFL and if he needs three tight end on the field fine they need no tight and going to feel fine\nBut bills game plan changes weak the weak based on how he hopes to take advantage of match ups\nAnd Mike I I think that like he went down the road of drafting those too tight ends in the early to thousands then it was widespread them out and use the slot then back to the tight end with Hernandez and Bronx\nI think he's trying to stay ahead again where he's gotten a good run blocking off into wind a draft Sony Michel\nWho was a great finisher of runs in turn run over some of those smaller guys and I know it's almost counterintuitive these days to think that the head coach is planning to run the football but especially in this match up Mike I think the wrong game has a chance to be here for a New England and could be huge all year long\nTaken advantage of those smaller defenders like you said\nIt's really intriguing because those build bell jacket and he read or or two of the guys that I respect the most in the entire league and you're the the term you use counter intuitive is correct\nAnd I think as they see defense is getting smaller and quicker and even though we talk about Tom Brady and Patrick ... homes and the explosive\nTasoff and each team has the hold back the plays more snaps than most of the old back in the late do and you know you've got James dabbling in New England who plays a pretty good number of snaps you've got Sherman\nIn Kansas City and both teams are deceiving leap tough in their own game so when you start talking about Sony Michel I watch the tape this morning of the game last week and I think he's still thinking a little bit just making sure he's doing all the right things but he is finishing every run physically\nAnd I think what you'll see it's all more birth to make you met as the season goes along\nI think health is a part of that to Mike I don't know if you think that or not but you know the missing early sort of getting his feet underneath of him but boy when he knows where he's going here I'm a bookkeeper\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers I ...\nDon't eat the will of the defense you're also gaining extra yards when people really aren't even paying attention to how they're getting there\nYeah I I think the two guys that are deceiving as far as how explosives in physically tough they are coming out of college were album come Ira and Sony Michel and at two hundred and twelve two hundred and Fifteen pounds their thicker\nAnd tougher than you expect because they're so darn fast everybody thinks they're just an outlier neither of a lark they can make a mistake and catch the football\nBut they're talking to some physicality outstanding and I'd be remiss if I did also say that every time I bought a New England take on and you're talking about their options of line they rarely turn a defensive player loose\nThey've played so well together and I think Don tastes car next year is that good enough in a life coach is I've ever been around\nI'm with you that guy is Yoda Mike from a aka Westwood One he's calling the game on Sunday night up here in New England with Kevin Coogler\nHe's with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh Mike I'm not going to get into the whole ground ... versus Kelsey but no one may have trained and I am watching film as you you would see grown over the years and there's a lot of people really nit picking at him he's almost thirty he's had a major knee injury\nDescribes still flash on film or are those skills starting to decline just a little bit\nOf good cronk still outstanding and when you watch 'em on tape and you want to talk about the most complete tight end in football\nThere may be guys faster run faster forty\nBut at the end of the day when you put the film on the block in Iran game he passed protect for Tom Brady\nHe's outstanding again though and when he he's in line and they run play action him in the middle of the field is outstanding and he can still win banned the mayor and there are still teams and trust me because you know when they didn't have element and and before they signed Gordon\nEverybody was double teaming who robbed bunk out that so much respect teams out for him\nNo question uh Mike ... is Josh Gordon as a football player just sometimes forget the in the context of the New England often these planes so liberal I nobody can be for what is he we need help and figuring out\nHow good this guy really is\nWell everybody knows including yourself that from a physical traits perspective he's as talented a weight speed athlete has been drafted in the last eight nine ten years\nAt the wide receiver position now he's been out of the league both with injuries and off the field issues and when you start talking about quarterbacks that needs to be able to trust Tom Brady is at the top of that list and if you look at the film from last week the first two in completion\nFor both the next between Brady and Gordon\nSo the first one Gordon probably should have stopped\nOn a crossing route Tom throw all behind them anticipate the net and then he was wide open on the backs shoulder and again the timing and the trust wasn't there so you've got a kid with tremendous physical traits but I think the timing and the trust is still lacking and that's just something that comes with time\nAnd might that Baylor off instead he played in that really isn't translate of all to what New England running here in the NFL is it\nYou know most of the big twelve from of a wide receiver\nEvaluation perspective is ... is is it difficult evaluation a because of the type of routes they run and be because of the types of the fence and they play against so you're a hundred percent correct\nOr when they get to the NFL both of them have never really seen much quality crust man coverage and most of them have done very little reading post snap\nAs adjusting routes and getting to where they're supposed to be\nMy class thing for you Tom Brady has a chance for his two hundred when as a quarterback in the NFL\nLook you played in the league for a little while you've been around at your whole life can you put into perspective can you put into words just how enormous two hundred wins for quarterback is\n... [laughter] I think it's even more impressive when he's only had Ninety four losses you know when when you when you look at a ... I'm highly impressed with the quarterback to take hits every week and keep on playing weak in and week out he's rarely hurt\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common there are all in for free on condition and was born in east really Janeiro or against the wind over two hundred three on cars homemade all models and incredible love onto flood Otto John John now\nNearing back of Josh Mitch Daniels and the way Bill Belichick check one about it for those who may be missed it bird can you sort of tell the stories you know it as to how ballot check was able to pull him back in\nYeah I mean I don't think it was really politics so much to craft a you know and and as luck I I think a lot of things happen behind the scenes the NFL and\nUh yeah Josh out the door I mean I you know I don't think that there's like really a whole lot of gray area there um yeah he like a sample of the staff you filter relationship or Chris Ballard\nA you know I I think a big part of this was that the patriots really did anything I'm In the three weeks between you know that his interview with the cold than in the super bowl\nAnd I think a huge part of this was a you know Robert like you know the field at the end of the super bowl seeing yeah the coach is going to be sixty six a quarterback is gonna be forty one\nAnd basically looking as you know organization saying you know this is the year to year operation Jimmy's gone um you know and and and and so he felt like you do something about it\nUm you know part of that was you know what can I Do it and maybe create another layer stability or eat my head coach who\nUm who is getting up there in years and who has been here for a long time now his decision to go and and keep Josh with Daniel ... you know that was definitely a part of it I think part of it but\nI'm having somebody who is capable of coaching Brady nothing bill at nothing to do with it I just tell you that my understanding is that the Robert Craft you know his his impact on\nOn on John McCain's decision on this day here I I think wait a lot heavier on Josh [noise]\nInteresting stuff there from Albert ... of the Monday morning quarterback dot com here on the ground show on WNPR oh Burt it's it's maybe the game of the week in the NFL was here in New England is on Sunday night it's Kansas City coming in to take on the patriots\nIn your opinion how good part of the Kansas City chiefs are they wind championship worthy\nThe chiefs are I think the defense of improvement away\nFrom being in getting serious contention for a championship now I look I I don't think they need to be great offensively because they are often it's not just my home the home it's been fantastic it's also they have around it\nA better off its appliance rock solid you know more than er Fisher sports tackled spot\nOr they've got speed all over the place and speed that really but you know how that really fit their quarterback and Kyrie kill Sandy walk is Travis Kelsey\nAnd Chris Connelly they've got to work horse back and claim it really is laid off that I don't think there's a whole lot that they can't do um\nI don't I don't think they have to be great on defense I just don't who they can be tried for for the first few weeks they were ... ... it got better last week and a lot of that has to do with a group of young players they're seven or the force has been fantastic the last few weeks um and he's going to need to be again this week with the\nLike we have the Justin Houston's not going to play 'em and then they've got a couple of really young real young guys in there now and the and a ... I Believe they're both twenty two years old who really stepped up in a play well the last couple of weeks or so\nUm you know they they made a decision that the off the grass or that they needed to get tougher and they need to get faster I'm On the fence and it was a result\nOf basically getting bullied by the Steelers again that's why I came a few weeks ago with such a big one for them is that going in and getting punched in space by the Steelers is really what made them um decide you know we got to change who we are defensively because we made the effort to do that I think they're on their way\nI'm with some of the young players they brought in it's just a matter of how quick because players can develop now because they've certainly see some growing in the first month or\nBurn I'm curious as to what you're hearing about the league in reaction to the way ... Holmes has played this year do people buy you do they think it's real do they think you smoke and mirrors what are you hearing from people across the league about the way my home just started this season\nWell I think most people expect that there's going to be a leveling off which you know I mean if we're being fair to the kid um\nI I don't think it's fair to expect him to keep this up [laughter] you know a ... because he's been spectacular or ... you know his first five\nGames a full time\nLooking for a car credit not break well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in each bring a generic ended up the best financed raising the prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a Ford salsa models interest free log on to what I Do not how\nHis first for the first few weeks you know the last couple of weeks is I think you know he's been challenged a different way\nSort of had a good knack for wanting to go off schedule and went to turn things into scramble plays and so\nThe challenge is going to get tougher for you know there's tape on them now there's tape of what the the chiefs are doing on the use it now and as you know body of work builds up defenses are going to get a better better chance to diagnose what are you guys and be able to plant better against you know\nUh but you know I I think what we've seen the first time we get those who've been around them or would tell you that he's he's got what it takes to work through a you know the challenges that are at that every young quarterback faces ... that that that helped me staying in the next few weeks\nOr a gang grass I mean I\nI think it's fair to expect a little bit of a leveling off but most people I Know that know him feel like he's very very equipped to fight through that the\nHistory I think tells this bird than in a situation like this one extra time to prepare the often says gotten it least healthy in terms of the bodies out on the field this looks like it set up for a typical\nHigh bill bell check figured out a way to slow down a gene that was on his team got right they go when the game is that what you're expecting on Sunday\nSo yeah um yeah I I I think the bill will have a have a good point um if that's what you're asking\n[noise] there are a couple of things that go into my you know I I think they're one this is right around when the eagles level off last year and they they came out of the gate ... last year to an incorporated a lot of the news spread stuff and\nUm they have to leave on appeal for for about a month but this is right around when they leveled off they went to the red sea swap says one piece of it the second piece of it is that builds got ten days preferred to prepare here and so he's coming off of that Thursday night game and so I think you had those two things together and\nUm I think bill is going to have a good plan it'd be questioned that'd be calm can Andy Reid find a way to turn this into it I mean the same way that the Peterson turn the super bowl on to attract\nI can just tell you know just from me and demand standpoint this is a difficult match up for the patriots\nGot bigger longer people in the secondary and Kansas City is small and quick everywhere\nAnd so I think the challenge for any reason is the situation isn't going to be so much countering what Bill does I think it's gonna be finding a way to create situations where there's just turns to attract me Doug Peterson was able to do that in the super bowl we'll see if I could do it on\nOur prayer the Monday morning quarterback dot com here on the ground show on WNPR oh let's get to some other stuff around the league\nI Know you wrote about this in your a giant Monday breakdown where are we in terms of the pressure on Jerry Jones from maybe even the fans an app people on the outside of the organization\nTo make a move on Jason Garrett because clearly I mean I don't know how many times you gotta blame his head against the wall bird to realize that the structure east put in place any working\nWell I think this is a little different than than than other situations we've seen in the past Dallas because I I just had a deeply cherry even in that family is Jason Garrett um remember you know that his chasing dad worked there for a lotta years\nJason played there as a player Jason with why did the coaching meeting in two thousand seven\nJason was hired before white hot where he felt was hired as a coach you know and so they've taken so many chances on it and they've invested so deeply\nThat I think in a certain way and I'm sure I've said this before it caissons feels it's we're Jerry's failure to which is why I don't think that they're going to have passively pull the plug on him\nAnd I you know I I that that is why I think they did it that he's got time now that said\nThey've already made the playoffs twice what type of the head coach uh they've only won one playoff game with him as the head coach\nA and this is this is a ... year a full time then you if you want to count the end of two thousand and took over for like ... to a there are a bunch of eight days there there's no evidence there um and clearly the cowboys in a bit about that they've had a couple of great years\nUh I think a lot of people are fighting for their jobs they're now too and I would just give you this

investigation of the buses being set on fire or they just happened to erupt in fire which I think most of us think that that's a stretch whatever happened at the bus yard last night where six or seven buses were torched or caught on fire\nIt's it doesn't bode well for the union were in the middle of a contentious strike people's nerves are getting frayed I'm not saying anybody did it that's connected to the you know the drivers because you can't say that right now however the mayor himself said the elephants in the room\nOr the ... in safety officials have said timing is suspicious and then the mature thing to say and the and the correct thing to say if you're trying to get you know not jumped the gun is we've got to go through the investigation there is some kind of video or a

district to come to to where it is now and be\nA bus is getting set on fire there was a garbage strike would buddy was in the last time around in a people remember that boom fired everybody and got a different company and I I Believe that's how that work I remember it and I know if you lived in Providence it was thinking it was disgusting it might have gone just as long as it might have gone\nOh a week and a half to two weeks if I recall I'm sure I can Google it and people are remembering that you you have to step in and do something you can't say well we might have three more she kind of options most she doesn't work right now it doesn't work right now so the buses get set on fire\nWhere's the mayor\nI give a lot of credit to the police chief in Providence and the safety commissioner

I mean granted listen every going to do what they want to do in the in the voting booth but there's resources volunteers and whatnot there's there's things that come along with a with a a with an endorsement\nAnd uh and that's something that I think is it it's just it's fascinating to me and then this whole idea of the Trump agenda whatever the hell that is what's the gender going to do to the NBA alright what\nNothing that nothing in here and the problem that\nA lot of that I Want to go to set up locally or part of it goes to the last ... and then they ask us for a political action works right which are supposed to be in the bathroom festival but nobody called back the body and soul hey what about I thought you know about the vote no by the uh\nExecutive boards that boat and their answers are if you don't like it don't vote on it that yeah you know you know it's kind of a catch twenty two I'm for the most part a local or great job or you're a little guy in that a great job on\nThough I have no role\nI Do I have a complaint with the national union or the national federation supporting\nA woman that's taken away tended\nTo a lot of what the Ninety five yeah don't get a pen seem out\nAnd I worked for Ninety five years old\nYou buy that it's a combination of yet it like for example I found that forty forty years old the ... I'm going to have a combined number of years and he came up sixty\nEverywhere I mean we were if you START I mean what do you expect you started at forty ... do you know how many other people and started late in life\nYeah I mean listen this is the thing here listen I don't know what um [noise] what the actual what the actuarial thing looks like now in terms of the combination but I I Will tell you\nIt to me it's one of those things that listen I thought to the pension reform is going to be necessary doesn't to be something that was that had to be done but then to watch what what what was a you know quote unquote necessary\nUh the get changed at the last minute during the lawsuit thing during the election season is amazing right so you start to wonder how much of that thing was all necessary to begin with and we still don't have\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nThere's a lot of that so she's got a similar thing going on right now with the truck tolls right oh it's legal where on good safe legal ground we we've done everything we're supposed to do it yeah blah blah blah until the lawsuit happens and then it'll be some kind of settlement or something you know that kind of nonsense ... um ... yeah smoke in\nMany ways right out of what they don't have a dying out without willing to pay up to get people back to what what about you end up in the cold\nAnd if you want it to anyway let me tell them you know what will fight what's he gonna do that I Will tell them fight it was going to win\n[laughter] All right thanks to the [laughter]\nPrograms for the lawyers and it's one of those things\nThat it's like I I I sit there and I wonder if the members of the union is our our or the ex members you know I\nCan't remember if they change if they if they represent retirees at the end he a\nI don't think so um but you know you're sitting there you'll pay into this stuff and they get somebody is who's\nAdvocating for some I mean is there any what if anything what sake you want to send a message to somebody back a Republican\nI mean think about that for a second\nYeah here's a here's what's interesting to me you want to see your point you want to see a republic become Republican become pro union endorse him once\n\nAll of a sudden the Republican in the state of Rhode Island or be the most pro union person you've ever seen in your life\nAny politician would Ellen phone was trying to get the endorsement of the other unions he was a union endorsement a meeting couple of weeks ago mention that to endorse Alan ... what\nA message that would send a Gina Raimondo the place will be they'll be on fire now like the buses and prominence imagine that and you think what he's gonna come back in ... bites you in the rear end\nI mean I mean and and to me that's something\nThat you would have to send a message to your members and everybody else who else it keeps people on line once in a while you yank the chain of the dog\nThe dog oh gee I mean that's it's just baffling to me it really is it's baffling because what\nHappens is um these places become much like the media in this country the\nNational news media in this country or even to a certain extent sometimes local media you've come you become laced with it was ideologues [noise] those those positions tend to be occupied by the most extreme people and so what happens is they\nGo in there and they have they not only are they do believe in collective bargaining and getting the best for the union members\nBut they take a whole panoply of of political beliefs ideological beliefs with them and so they used their power to not only push the bottom line than the working conditions of their members but also hey\nOh look there's a guy who ah happens to be\nA an illegal immigrant we're going for immigration issues now why 'cause I'm presenting him sure your\nRights\nMarriage equality why well because I remember is again I Want to get married what\nElse you know I mean it's just what they can justify anything that they want to justify to become you know tools of the ... of of the ideology that they're presenting\nNinety nine point nine Ninety nine percent Democrat by the way and so you know I Can't imagine that say oh you never know I Can't imagine that the ideological\nI'm a orientation of Ninety nine point nine percent of of their members\nIs to the left the hard left\nBut people hold their nose when it comes to their pay raises their their working conditions and their pensions\nIf the pensions can be impacted and sacrifice on the altar of whatever\nWhat else can do what can they do to you [laughter] this point\nIf I'm sitting there and I remember this union like you know I Hope my news you know as a person tend to lean to the right if I was a member of a teacher's union because it had to be I'd be like All right they can represent me if I get jammed up for this that and the other thing that if some politician wants my job for his friend\nThey're going to represent means that keep me where I Am I going to you know somebody's going to end up ... my pay for me okay great this is one of ... pay the nine hundred dollars a year or whatever it is all about what about whatever's they pay for union dues\nAh you know it is what it is I'll hold my nose and do it yeah I Know they back a bunch of these companies and everything else but what are you going to do\nBut then when they start going after the benefits and they have they changed some support and this is from a point of view of a teacher a point of view of a union member I start to change them unilaterally ... it it comes to find out they're testing the ground as to whether or not we actually have a contractual obligation for my pension and retirement that I thought\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nBut we got all this money for this program all this money for that program maybe we ... it it will call this year [noise]\nYeah I don't know I I don't know what that does you have to look at the actuarial tables as to whether a cold or for one you cola over you know that to cola for one year\nDoes to the entire thing if you still believe that the the place was a was a was a house of cards to begin with and whether or not actually did anything [noise] and then there's the turkey gun [noise]\nAnd then there's\nThe emotional support squirrels

disconnected from their fellow humans than ever before have less likelihood of desire to even have a social relationships with other human beings and instead have a one way conversation with themselves through their animals\nAnd therefore put all sorts of things into those animals that do not exist\nOkay that's the truth what's all be honest about it I see these people everywhere there in

for college football number Fifteen you are I host number twenty two main in\nWhat is expected to be a sold out Mead stadium which is pretty amazing own coming to write a I did yes yes because someone asked me a one of the homecoming game I'm like yeah New Hampshire's I'm doing it on TV and they're like oh\n... lead hasn't caught on yet that I Do college football games on Saturdays I Can't go to these uh get social gatherings and whatnot based around these sporting events but\nI can remember my time if you are I and I think the most amount of fans we may have played in front of\nI think was in Nineteen Ninety five we add more people at home coming in the rain for the Yukon game than\nWe did for the game for the conference championship against Delaware\nI think that Delaware game we had about maybe eighty five hundred nine thousand and then you can't was more but that you can't game was played in the pouring rain and I remember a sets homecoming Ninety five\nSo one of the wide receivers runs like a twenty yard in cuts\nTo safety bang into each other quarterback puts it on their side butler guy side butler I think it was goes off the sidelines for the touchdown we beat you come with skip holds two things I remember from that my brother who then would have been a senior in high school\nWas that that game and everybody Russia field and he spared me like Goldberg from WCW nice like lift me up some\nAnd of course my friend Nelson laughing is I'm rolling over getting ready to punch someone and it was my own brother who hit me and then after the game skip holds liberal skip skip holds and his coaching staff\nRipped apart the visiting locker room like we used to do\nThis corner yes things where when you beat a team you took something like a programmer scouting report or whatever or some of the left behind them a locker room and you buried\nIt outside stupid for Keith crap\nAnd you can't left a whole bunch of stuff so we took some of the broken pieces of some of the things in the locker room to put them in the tomb for Yukon when skippy and crew went nuts 'cause there was a game between nationally ranked teams just like this one down at me stadium on Saturday and you're more\nHuge weekend in New England for huge huge huge some are the Boston Bruins kick it off of the freebie 'em game it TD Garden\nWhat their Chevy GMC ... Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all make all models and incredible prices log on to flood auto John job now\nDerrick Johnson back there in their line backing group no longer ... Ali there as well and it used to this guy that had a couple of facts against the patriots back in twenty four scene at ... patriots last year\nOr the ... the guy who really did a great job of frustrating ... last season and we won defensively arid Barry tours left Achilles in that game and he's been bothered by white ill injury that's kept him out of line up ball all season long date now that from the defensive side often simply I think this cat that each team is better because of\nMy home and the people ability consistently Alex with last year through the long ball far better than at any point in his career\nBut I think with more homes there's a different dimension they'll certainly you look at Albert Wilson versus Sammy Watkins the way that she had used Watkins that's far this season at least with one really\nBreakout game you know there is maybe you're not great there it's an extra year experience for a guy like Kareem Hunt Cal she's also a terrific START I think it's a comparable team all fence to flee at every position and better\nAt quarterback the what the patriots face last year\nBob so the the voice of the patriots with me here each and every week on the ground show on WNPR oh previewing the Sunday night battle with the Kansas City chiefs again you can hear within eight twenty kick with Bob and so\nSo uh Bob I don't know if you were around for you know there's been these narratives with the patriots you almost a year to year why all the when the coin toss then they're going to different or because they want to double up the score and I know there was a year or two where it was God's for first got to put the first points on the board and\nI'm starting to wonder if this is one of those years for the patriots Bob too where\nThat's going to become the mantra once again get the lead give the defense a little cushion maybe you'll get a stop in the offing puts another one on the board and then maybe you're offering running how important is scaring first for this year's New England patriots\nPlus scoring first is huge in this game in particular because Kansas City as a team that's dominated the opening quarter at it and you know when you talk about a young quarterback especially although my home's really his inexperience and his age or in a lot of\nDifferent ways me watching the voice that he showed late in the Denver game even improvising a ... and doing all in a substantive way wasn't lashing hotdog out there through all of his left at\nA news doing something he had done in college uh yeah I I think the Kansas City as soon as you definitely don't want to try to\nPlay catch up against authentic cars that are just so tough to to stop there are similar to what the ages of ... for so long in that sense you know we sort of Jacksonville game take the ball sorts or we have seen that periodically where they have one of the coin toss and put the all sides are out there\nInitially whether it was because of wind conditions or it was because they wanted a fast start off as I'm not sure where they are from the ... in this game I I tend to think that you know the feeling is that you're you're better off and I think it's consistent now across the board and football's inject more and more people\nAre doing this for the different at take a kick in the second half you're better off having the opportunity I think to prevent\nThe Brits scores and to have that that chance herself or to do to put together the scores going into half coming out of half of that city to make the adjustment to between offensive series if you take the ball first while then you don't control the possession of the first possession of the third quarter\nBond so see with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh Bob Josh ... been now in this off in two weeks and there was a little mini by here where everybody got some rest\nDo you feel as to how Josh warden will ultimately fit in like we know he has the potential Bob we just haven't seen it yet but I'm starting to wonder why ... we know they want to run it elements back\nHow does he fit other than just some deep deep point\nI think he's fits in a lot of different ways and I think one of the things for them in brief flashes thus far is is the ability to catch the slapping and muscle is way out of tackles and and make some place\nAfter the catch and I think back to back components of the patriots in particular the twenty fourteen season will bread on the fell gave them I think in Gordon skates he can give them that\nAnd the guy who can burn your deep so you know it is similar to a Kansas City does a with a guy like ... kill him ... in a different way because Gordon is a much bigger player by far or even you get the ball\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition I wasn't born in east religion or against the wind over two hundred three on cars all makes all models had incredible prices are going to flood Otto John calm now\nBeat the defense deep or the ... defense away from the underneath stuff he's been on the field for Eighteen snaps in each of his first two games\nHe or than acquitted himself as a blocker and that's going to earn more reps in this office or in the first game against ah the Miami Dolphins in fact I think there were more running plays record them and then the second game and now I think we're going to see his snap\nCount continually increase and I think they're going to ask more of him on the week in week out basis\nHow big is running the ball this week for me Bob it's one of my he's out on the Kansas City is very good at stopping to run\nAnd I think we I'm hoping anyway what's the drafting of Sony Michel maybe at least if not the you know the coaches and some of the fans will get over the whole well Tom Brady he's going to throw fifty times to win this to me kind of sets up from one of those games were balance might be the key\nI think for sure and he and I think you know can city has been vulnerable or against the wrong one of the things that really her Jacksonville last week was the absence of for that and then grant got hurt\nReally in that game and uh they became and they fell behind to they had to chase and they became very one dimensional and it really had a lot of self inflicted wounds whether there were turnovers or just bad passes by like ... and if they still had over four hundred yards of often but I think you have to be able to run the ball\nA I and I still believe that that is a tenet of any team at any level or in in the NFL especially\nA it's not to say that they're gonna dominant a turn into the you know the old three yards and a cloud of dust approach\nBut I Do think it's imperative for them to have that balance and be able to run the ball in and pick up some talks yards they didn't do last year and I go back to that first game between the patriots and the chiefs in two thousand and Seventeen and as badly as it got away\nFrom the past and the fourth quarter of a lot of respect that game was settled early because the patriots had a Seventeen Seventy and\nThey had a couple of short guarded runs to prolong drives early in that game and they got stopped and they've got to be able to convert those particular plays in this game and it's not just to keep out more homes and this and the cheese off that's off the field\nBut I think it's as well to it at a certain dominance will be lost the line of scrimmage and control uh in in that sense and and I think that's very important thing moving forward\nBond so see with me here for a few more minutes on the grass shoveling WPRI oh what is your theory Bob as to why Bill Belichick check ins had such success over a long period of time against in the ...\nWell it has but any rate is really had a lot of success against bill on little recently when I think it's only four to route in Kansas City\nUh that was the the first encounter over read coach team with Bill and that was the Monday Night debacle when everybody out the window at not only closed on the past would it shattered a man that was the game of course in the playoffs than in thousands if given the patriots had a comfortable lead in Kansas City\nValiantly tries to come back and they pick up on ... minutes the score a touchdown older within one score and the fourth quarter of that game but that was pretty competitive game overall is not for a stretch deflection off alcohol leads Julian Edelman\nThe shield at getting it but it might have been a different story too and then of course last year we saw Kansas City you know run away from the patriots or the fourth quarter of the season opener so\nI I look at it you know ... separating but and he reads teams in Philadelphia did against the Baltics because really the only difference is different eras in a different ah generations of those teams the patriots against for example the eagles Super Bowl thirty nine\nYou know a much different kind of team\nThen today in in when I began to read is done with his office it's all into phone you're more than just the west coast concept he's\nTaken so many different pages out of college play books that approach is that it's made him a more effective play color and made his own fence is much more difficult to stop and look for cheese have some of the most part of players and the league and some of the most pivotal positions in the lake Travis Kelsey\nTier ... kill Kareem haunt you know and and I don't want to risk to what my homes is done and then I probably\nShould walk back some of what I said at the top you know Alex Smith who's a very experienced and successful quarterbacking this league but it also has a a big arm and he seemed to have the moxie and everything that a ... a while and a quarter back\nAnd I think young to be that's far he spend the most impressive to me\nSo what does Bob so see do with the weekend\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru

to fall down into the net he was trying to back up so quick [noise]\nBruins get it done again the TD Garden last night\nWe often simply they can be pretty damn good defensively tightened it up much more last night and uh I Know that that there are a lot of people who don't like hockey they don't get into hockey I'm a ... cat I like it I Try to consume as much Bruins as I can it's tough during this time of year\nNot only with everything else that song but ... unless you're a real die hard NHL than it is hard to keep track\nOf a lot of the player movement in the league because you're not exposed to the players the way you are in college football college basketball\nBut to a different level of connection but that first line for the Bruins that a pastor knock burns your own and it's apparently Marcia on this year that's what he told jak Edwards\nA that line has been highly productive of course the Bruins get it done last night here's a little bit of Bruce Cassidy Bruins coach after that game\nYeah I mean special teams were good obviously makes a difference we got a couple in our power play discipline was good team defense was good\nOur whole bench you know our backup goalie so everyone you know contributing um\nI thought the area that we had to focus on was one was rushed defense with with this team the ... the David found a puck or what I mean I think Verghese you weren't good spots just found and we kind of a so that worked out well for him but after I thought we did a real good job and that was a bit of just tough ... so\nAnd then we do we want to be just want to stay out of the box that got a I think their power play can be effective and were able to do those two things they managed pox or weren't given up on man Russia so that formula worked well for us and it always looks good for your team defense when you do that because you're forced him to go to a hundred feet and we were pretty good defense of to move to them [noise]\nAnd the ... in a boat Eighteen thousand people I mean who doesn't appreciate it moves like that you don't like it against you but\nI'm was a hell of a play it's a high end skilled play we keep a puck alive and we attacked interior where we wanted\nWe wanted to do against their peak case get inside attacked or D.C if they can handle that so we got lucky when after that but still that was a great goal to get us to get us going you know you don't like to give up the first one at home we want to go to get it equal as quickly as you can he did a great job their\nNose runs on line lentils on much\nMore jump you know more involves um you know part of that's on me to keep ... kills et cetera in his power play groups not getting out there so we try to keep more involved in the game we had more jump\nUm and then when he was gone it makes people around them better and you know it was only a matter of time and then before you know we we started to get a little more balance and in already wants to play like he ... a lot of pride so scored but not only that I thought he won a lot of parks and play the game as advertised tea\nIs up and down his way he manages a ... with purpose how's it good sticking ... only had about three or four help plays in swat that we're trying to teach the details to the younger kids like not to leave too early and that's just what he brings so nice to see them get rewarded with a goal as well [noise]\nBruins are getting it done man tough talk last ah clocks\nI was going to be a matter of time before some of those uh hockey phrases with Janeane that turned into drops\nTough ... ... ...

here on the grass show on WNPR oh of course WPRI oh is the new home I should say the new old home for Providence College basketball and\nI Want to go back to your last season we know you're transferred in we know your history in terms of college basketball but man not being able to be out on the court how tough was that mentally for you to deal with last year\nOh it was ridiculously I'm hurt hurtful uh but the guys they always takes me that I was in contact the coaches always names shah was All right and when I was finally able to return it was just a list and spirit for everybody not just for me\nI'm just the guy being able to see me back um and an action and it was great it was great for them um you could just tell the difference um when I come back for everyone that it to\nYou know and it's interesting the way your position that where you said they always checked in on you you know when you're not around there and and you're in the injured athlete\nAnd you have to follow a rehab schedule that is aside from whatever the team is doing you could kind of get lost in the shuffle right might get that keeping in touch with those guys is very important\nI Would think through your psyche going through that rehab process\nAbsolutely absolutely I'm going through the rehab going through the rehab and just making sure that everybody knew I was still there um I was still in their corner um there was still in my corner\nI'm I was just a great thing for everyone um yeah but it was it was tough man just to watch from the sideline I'm a younger guys not doing certain things I Would just be like you know I Want to show you how to do but I Can't right now where it's just that I mean I'm just happy to be back on the court in the\nSenate did you see the game almost as a coach in terms of communicating with your teammates last year\nAbsolutely and I kind of took it as a learning experience or just to be on the sideline and see things from a different perspective I can see a lot of things that I could improve on\n'em and but my teammates can improve on so we can all the all around better seat um it was a great well not a great experience because industry but\nThe seat of perspective from that angle is it that was a great experience for me just a learning experience\nI was going to say that it's one of those deals where are you got something good out of a bad situation because I think as a player\nYou know you see things through the purview as a player and you don't think big picture when you have to sit out on the sideline and watch the coaches and then your almost coaching these guys as you go along at least it's pulling something out of a bad situation\nHey exactly exactly and the managers were making a joke and starting to call me a cultural because how much I was standing up our moms like coast cool and whatnot so uh they saw me because I'm good so so it was it was just great\nYou didn't have your parents or anything and have to go to our around me about hind down there at one point did you\nKnow nah mean Sherlock Holmes ... hey\nThat get that gets me into coach cruelly Emmett I Love to ask guys who play for coaches what makes their guy so special so for those who don't know what makes coach cruelly such a great coach and why are you drawn to him\nI'm well number one he's a genuine guy I'm not even talking about the coaching aspect you just a genuine person he's a person that you love to be around\nUm he's a family for these kind of respect for he's passionate about everything everything he does um when it comes to the coaching aspect [noise] um he just looks at things differently he's great at finding the weak link on on other team and he's good at like\nHelping our team become better in ways you wouldn't even imagine uh I Know that's hard to understand but that's just the way does thing and he just does things differently and I think that's why I was sort of try a drawn to him in the first place\nProvidence couch senior forward Emmett home with me for a few more minutes here on the ground show on WPRI\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one I mean

there were against it\nGuides have gotten on this kind of street I'm sure there is the inherent pressure that is hey we're done in five years in a row we don't want to be the group to not get they're just kind of walk me through that a little bit do you feel a palpable pressure to get back to the NC double a tournament\nUm well our myself we always think I'm bigger picture so NC double a is an automatic for me but kosco they actually sat down and he told his there is no pressure I'm In this every year um as long as we give it all\nAnd give it a hundred and ten percent of the time we on for everything else to take care of itself\nSo with that being said I'm ... I don't think there's any pressure but with our expectation with us the guys in the locker room we expect nothing left to get that as he retired\nSell me a little bit of operating fryer development center how doping this new facility you all have\nOh my gosh it's a great facility um we think is one of the best ... is not the dirty in the Big East I'm right now um there's a whole bunch of component\nThat throughout the facility I'm ...
