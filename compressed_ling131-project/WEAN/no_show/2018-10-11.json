Boston Globe excuse me for the Herald doesn't exist anymore and the host of the Bob Ryan podcast that'd be won by Brian Bob how are you\nWhere you put a lot of pressure on me any\nNo please come on now you know the drill a Bob I I just got done talking to a buddy of mine and Robert you does the midday show down in New York and\nI talked to him about you know Yankee fans\nIn their thoughts on on the rivalry\nAnd admit Bob when it became Red Sox Yankees I thought okay maybe connected to some batteries in little jumpstart here I don't know about you but I didn't come away with any of that rivalry feeling in watching this series and I did you feel the same way\nNo I I think it was still there and and and and if it if there was any evidence or any inclination that it wasn't their\nAaron Judge provided\nA U.S enough to go on with the uh New York New York thing that became a you know quite a coast celebrities there and the red Sox responded in kind last night uh I don't think there's any\nDiminishing of the of the fervor among the fans on both sides I think the Yankee fans to sing to anybody other than Boston or it could accept it a little bit better\nUh and and certainly the red Sox are relishing fans are relishing beating the Yankees so I don't know I don't know I I I think it's there\n[noise] yeah maybe I'm just ... you know you're earning for the past\nWhen it was really an antagonistic getting people overreacted massively like Yankee fans screaming about John Carlos Stanton I could see fans in Boston doing that because of all those strike outs and all the expectations I guess I'm just looking for a little bit more that nastiness that just seems to have gone out of this ...\nYear 'cause we had that joke Kelly Kelly fight club but Jill Kelley play no significant one good you know you had a good ending but he was not a negative you know a spark factor in any way in the series he did not documented the dialogue at all in terms of the rivalry as the series unfolded so no but I I\nBelieve me I I don't I think if you were to go take a random survey of Red Sox fans are they're really relishing including over repeating the Yankees\nAre you had to get it took away at the game too because I think there was a lot of trepidation do you yes\nGoing in the stadium for for to me that's why I Know I was scared and a very simple reason is that the Yankees have been so good at home\nWith their ability to hit home runs and if you probably know it'd probably have every state it and of course you're a broadcast today this was only the second time all season that the Yankees swept\nGames without hitting home right at home\nAnd the only other time was an April ... strangely enough against the Orioles but April seventh and eighth but other than that I I wondered about that you know I was thinking about that and and I finally got the the numbers about how you got the information but\nThink about that they went off season\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition at what for Denise religion or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices log on to flood Otto John job now\nThat the reason I don't know if that's the reason but you just start to wonder if that's the reason why people speak so if I were to

I'm very pleased to welcome my friend and colleague Gordon Chang to my studio because he brings with him to guess\nThat will permit us to range across the vast landscape that is that China quandary where we're plunged now into the remainder of the twenty first century what has to be done with the aggression\nThe predation the ambition and the confusion of the People's Republic of China we inherited it from the twentieth century it is part of the business model of the earth right now but it is demonstrating either instability or irregularity you get to take your choice\nOr hostility we can't tell garden a very good even too good evening Joan in these last week's garden we have looked at the Decatur incident a on a Sunday Morning eight thirty am local time spradley islands the Decatur on all the ... class destroy which means it's one of the biggest warships in the solar system\nWas challenged by a PR P L A navy version of the same thing a missile destroyer within forty five yards\nThe Decatur was on a freedom of navigation act the P L A navy uh was warning the Decatur to back off these are Chinese territory that is a false statement\nAnd that incident attracted us Gordon because it seemed out of step\nWith the conversations about North Korea with the conversations about tariffs but at the time you looked upon it as a sign that the standing committee and the president for life Xi Jinping had made a decision what kind of decision\nWill certainly the Chinese have decided to try to push the U.S out of the south China Sea and its other peripheral waters\nAnd over a course of years we've seen some very dangerous encounters not only with warships but also with the navy and air force planes in international airspace\nOr the Decatur incident was unusually aggressive because of the Chinese warship across the bow of the Decatur and came within forty five yards when it did so that's just seconds away from a collusion and that could have been catastrophe way welcome\nVoices who helped us who will help us understand these unusual occurrences that are happening in China and in Hong Kong and on the high seas South China sea first of all returning to us after some weeks mock Clifford is here in Studio he's the former editor in chief\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one night I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty so desperate for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at flood forward and Easter and enjoy it\nYour in good will and just passed that vintage denim jacket you spot miniature do not airing you leaning [noise]\nThat's the center of shopping because at goodwill every I mean by funds local job training and long suffering home those do not hearing some good\nGood will bring good home brought to you by good will and the actor John bachelor show [noise]\n\n\nI'm John ... Gordon Chang my colleague and co host and we are very plays in the studio to have with us mark Clifford the former editor of the south China Morning post he's a resident of Hong Kong and he's traveled here to New York to sit with us as well as the hunt Kym who's a master's candidate\nIn the program for higher education at the University of Rochester but also as an observer of\nInfluenced by the Chinese authorities and their Kendrick of Cain Gordon\nSay you're a graduate student University of Rochester in March you we're organizing an event on campus who was the event for\nSo the event was pretty much for everybody in the university was an open event where everyone can come without paying a fee and it was meant to sort of um spread this idea of dialogue on campus\nAnd dialogue with whom I mean who who are the people are going to be at the event\nSo I'm as I said before it it it although was open for everybody I wanted to use I wanted to purposely use the Tibetan issue as an example because of the fact that the Tibetan issue mainly focuses on having dialogue with those that do you tend to disagree with\nAnd so I'm by by setting that by sending that issue and talking about it on campus we want to give everybody a chance to participate to get to know about the issue and of course being on a college campus we do have a lot of an international Chinese students\nSo once you give them a choice I'd give them an opportunity also too\nYou know I could get to know the Tibetan issue I'm\n... and that's why that's an issue to bet I'm Beijing believes is a part of the People's Republic of China it sits in the south western portion very strategic because many of the world's a river start their high ground 'em\nAnd Tibetans they don't necessarily agree that they're part of the People's Republic some of them do but some of them want independence\nActs at least since two thousand eight the Chinese authorities have used brutality against the people of Tibet we have reports of internal migration forced internal migration ethnic cleansing that can be called\nNot only in Tibet but in large cities at the edges of the Tibetan Plateau that's what you were introducing people to the facts that we have about uh the persecution\nAnd his holiness the ... the spiritual leader of the Tibetans um has taken the position that he doesn't want independence that Tibet should be autonomous\nAndy's complained of what he's called and what many people agree his cultural genocide the purposeful attempt by Beijing to eliminate Tibetan Buddhism to eliminate Tibetan the density 'em to take over the lands of Tibet so this is controversial with regard to both\nIran and American campus what happened\nWell ... you know it's it's not I I think it's more it's bigger than being an American campus at this point because you know my primary goal was to live out this whole principle that you know we can talk about any issues as a student and we can\nCome come to come to the mutual ground and and just simply and simply sit down and agree to disagree or or to agree to agree\nAnd et cetera et cetera um I purposely usage of an issue in order to give a an opportunity for every student to observe it and make an opinion of their own and then have a dialogue amongst themselves\nThere by living out the principles of what it needs to be at a at a at a college campus especially in the United states of America\nAnd in March you would actually organized this event it was advertised it was actually the university authorities knew about it because of course it was taking place on the campus of the University of Rochester and you had a very good\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lighter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln I'm Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln if there were against it unparalleled Marjorie impeccable surface\nUm I was told that the hosting student organization\nI'm even had a meeting about the event and they've even decided not only to host event for me but to help me register for the event I I I went through every every guideline that their advice or had told me to follow and\nSuddenly um my ... so my event was set on the thirty first of march and on the night or the twenty ninth\nMy a friend of mine actually sends me a screen shot of an email that they receive from the Chinese student association saying that um you know apparently the Chinese student association has had received ... concerns\nFrom uh some of the members of the Chinese a international student community and that are about my event going on on campus and they will and it said on the email that they will lead they ... at both the university and the student administration or know about this\nNow a few friends of mine actually called me that night and asked me you know a we're\nActually fearful that your event might be canceled or something worse might happen and I told them you know what you know this is the United states what could happen you know it's I I'm entitled to my free speech as a scholar\nUm ... it just says they're they're free to they're free to go and complain and I don't see anything wrong with it so what happened to come that morning I get an email from the advice or the advice the same advice or who helped me all throughout that month to register and to reserve or that event\nOn campus um sent me an email saying that the hosting sheer organization all of a sudden with drew their support for this event which are the sponsorship for this event and henceforth\nUm this event was cancelled and on at the end of the emails she even noted that um she suggested that I I I moved to the event from to an off campus location\nSo basically the University of Rochester decides to um cancel your event and Turks you off campus well\nI I don't know exactly what happened I don't know why I don't know why she decided to um you know take that step but to to the eyes of many people might look that way they found a has a lot of smoke around here right [laughter]\nRight but all I can say is that you know um I it was a big disappointment and also at the same time I was not only disgusted by what had happened but you know I I just I it it it's I was so upset\nNot because of the fact that my event was cancelled but because of the fact that we\nI personally felt that we were somehow compromising our values as Americans as as as people were living on this land um to ... to practice this idea this this this right of free speech who said that was just so hard voted\nAccording to who made the phone call ... ... who made the phone the phone call I mean who do you think who made the phone call somebody made a phone call who watch it I I can\nOnly I can only guess at this point I'm or maybe maybe it was maybe it was some very upset student on campus maybe it was a ... the Chinese government maybe it was a some donor who who might have not been happy that this kind of\n... and let's go let's go to mark Clifford for the answer what's in a condo well we were talking before about um the the scholar Perry links 'em\nA suggestion that the Chinese government is a bit like an anaconda in a chandelier at a party everybody's enjoying his party in the ballroom drinking champagne eating canopies whatever\nThe snake doesn't have to do very very much everybody knows it's there it reaches out every once in awhile often quite randomly you can't figure out why the snake does what it does but it keeps everybody in\nMine John there's another part to this story um we don't have time in this segment but we've got to get back to it because this is an issue of what the campus administration is doing and what have tried to do to cover its tracks\nGordon Chang the database mark Clifford is a former editor of the south China Morning post and we thank you very careful very careful scholar say when Kim to tell the story of the University of Rochester yes there are other explanations but I think everybody just started not only in the United states but around the world\nThe anaconda I'm John ...

Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nEssentially an organization although it's supposedly Chinese students and scholars is really run out of Beijing and its intended to monitor um students also to organize them for political activities on American soil this is a violation of American sovereignty clear and simple\nAnd the thing here John it there's a lot of people to get angry at one of those people or set of people are are basically us politicians in us leaders for allowing Beijing to operate on American soil violate our sovereignty year and year out and we don't do anything about\nIt I say I've seen too many Alfred Hitchcock movies so I have to follow this course have you heard talk is there an noise about Chinese spies among the student population reporting back to Beijing\nWell I'm over the years uh in in in the University of Rochester I'm I have heard bits and pieces yeah my Chinese student colleagues that um\nThey have to they always have to watch what they have to say on even on campus um even in our private conversations film them use had well there are certain things I I I personally cannot mentioned so I I don't feel comfortable talking about that specific topic like Tibet or or even or even the Christian or even the first Christians in China\nAnd market that would be an example of how the anaconda doesn't have to do anything\nThat's right but the anaconda in this case is doing something I Know for a factor in Hong Kong at one of the universities professor friend of mine is teaching would get no questions from mainland students until she install the software that allows them to ask questions anonymously to her and she gets a ton of questions\nShe knows for a fact that they're spying on each other and then one of them said oh but we have to report back on you as well this is a a person who is not a PR see national so you know the the anaconda does does make some moves down\nGarden what they're not allowed to discuss we we should mention this list is just this is surprisingly simple they're not allowed to say anything that sounds like tenements right\nA democracy is not welcome a Tibet certainly rolls out entirely\nBut they also can't mentioned the south China Sea well Taiwan Taiwan for ... or anything like that I mean it's a it's a list that goes on for some time in and they're always adding to it but these are simple things they're not complicated a dissenting positions of recommending radical conduct\nNo ... and this really just shows the insecurity of the Communist Party because we're talking about a whole range of ... the three cheese tournament Tibet Taiwan and but also all these things you mentioned about and and as you point out John this list gets longer and longer all the time they are more and more things you can't discuss\nAnd this is just a symptom of a decaying political system\nAnd I want to come back because he organized his have have you been through it and now you've told the story\nOr Tibet did it did it did it in the conversation did anybody that night the Seventy who showed up did they have an understanding about why Tibet is\nIs forbidden why this happened did they did they see the connection between Tibet a freedom loving people are persecuted and the conduct of the Chinese what's that set out loud [noise]\nWell um I\nI personally I yes I personally had a lot of conversations after after the event with the ... I mean during the during the event of seven to yes I'm so basically my speaker who is representing the office of Tibet at that time I'm actually gave a gave this comment that all Tibetans wants to do\nIs to have a dialogue with all sides especially with the Chinese are authorities and the Chinese people\nThat's so sweet did he mentioned the self immolations yes he mentioned is all that's enough garden that us it will certainly because that shows that the Tibetans are not happy in that Beijing's rule is essentially occupation way ...\nSay on it's a terrific story thank you say ... and all the college is and all the universities and all the professors and all the students get it exactly\nGordon Chang of the Daily Beast mark Clifford former editor of the south China Morning post and also our guide to anaconda villa when we come back we'll return to it I'm John ...

now look back go back fifty years before your time Mm forty five or fifty years you complain about entertainment I think are a little too focused because it's always been a little bit of a division here you have\nTo rub them as more than ever in my lifetime anyway come on\nYou know go back and look you had mostly folk rock bands who had the rock bands at the time they all lean to the left but you also had people like Bob Hope Lucille Ball Frank Sinatra Johnny Carson you ... it's always been sort of some are some art and I I\nWe're OK okay you know what a good point because then I could find the ones that\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\n... structure that normal people looked like conservatives they're not\nThe opposite side of extra but things are done more with in the context of the work you know whether it's broadcasters or ... or whatever you can make your with your work without actually going up at a state opt out you can make your political statement I think the quality of\nArt and media in general it in some way the creek as people you know kind of taking their time to restate talking point rather than work are doing their work and I see that effect because great you know\nYeah no I don't because I don't understand artists I Know you're an artist you have an artist mindset I don't I don't understand it I get anything everything you just said just I kinda got but not really\nI Do you understand and I can tell you understand it I don't understand it I don't have that mindset I it's it's a deficit that\nI I I mourn sometimes because I see people get moved by great works of art and things like and I just don't see it um you know I see a painting would this one's a bunch of ... watches on it and I can go over there do the same thing like a five year old and and [laughter] that's what I see\nBut I Know there's there's things that there's a ... you know creating a great narrative or creating something that is um it it takes a skill set I don't have the skill set and I don't understand the mindset of it so when you say the word they can do it through the work that is where I'm complaining about\nIf I can see it I guess maybe that's it maybe it's too obvious and so I think it's cheap I don't know\nYeah but there's people now that are doing it\nI really disagree with what they're doing it very well for example in our country if you look at a radio station musically they'd get the most listen nationally ... country what people listening to and get a lot of it any way it kind of a right way you know the\nOnly way we're a character on so forth there not up there something wrong\nIt ... late ... and their music and and then they're working out out there and equal digested and art subtly game that stuff um they may be tuning in nightmare ... political and but it it\nWell see maybe it's not political maybe it's just social comment content maybe they're getting something that's the political is when you talk about individuals who are in charge that support them blah blah blah versus talking about ideas right and and try and promote values\nUm [noise] you know to me like a lot of stuff you see now is a lot of this this uh you know the the patriarchy nonsense where you you know it's it's you know I see that everywhere which promote girls girls are great Boyce suck and I as a father and son he's watching this stuff\nAnd I see him sitting there and he doesn't see any doesn't he he looks at it it's not just like girls are good too it's no it's girls are better than boys so that's where we have we don't see you know both girls and boys doing great things we see girls doing great things in boys acting like idiots\nAnd that's the problem it and it's so it's not necessarily what elevating everybody it's about elevating one person over the other which is what we're not supposed to do I thought but I guess the rules change and nobody told me that means in ...

process of getting an apple on you know an apple a two and I can't tell you that I'm incredibly familiar with all the details of it maybe some of you are\nA but what's fascinating is that you've got you know one man shows one gal shows one person shows you know trying to put this together an app because everyone thinks oh man if you could just do this bank\nUm and then there are no major conglomerates that end up developing or or set up for\nIntroduction of an app because of the projection that it's going to be such a home run with everybody ah it it's a fascinating um you know new frontier\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nThere is a study on the number of apps that are out there now and you know the numbers that are that are profitable or not but a mayor Korea uh you know was not yet profitable when I interviewed him in January twenty sixteen a as a new mayor in the fall river ah\nThey did in my mom can look at me and she says to me mommy why is it must not coming to get me\nThey can't go on with this any longer the sides seem to have discussions said is there seems to be open and there's no hope well we need to move on and we need to find a vendor that can render the services that the kids need\nThat last voice is that came in from the school committee in Providence obviously moms and kids are having a real hard time with this bus strike understandably\nSo I I wanted to you in on this because the superintendents going to join us at the top of the hour four o'clock and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of logistics conversation that you're not going to have on this but I had an interesting exercise to de de de Whitman candidate for mayor who scheduled I think next week to come in here is you know yes what's coming in Alex Gino\nTold once they were still have to confirm but aren't so next week some time she's reportedly\nPutting a half million dollars in campaign and has gotten the endorsement of the problem is police union and tells me she seeking the doors to the middle of the public employee unions which is intriguing and of itself\nA she's hyper critical of the mayor with uh the current stalemate on the teacher contract but she said something about the bus strike I open up the TV show we record that at one o'clock in the afternoon so you only see tonight seven thirty am I on TV and Fox problems have been\nI opened up by saying 'cause I've been pretty tough on the mayor from time to time as it doesn't seem like this is his fault but he certainly got on his plate to resolve this matter because this has to parties for student and\nUh the Teamsters Union employees that are at each other's throats basically on you know where their retirement benefits are going to be invested in four one K. were for student [noise] currently has it and wants to keep it\nAnd then uh the teams just one one one that won a pension the Teamsters pension investment so they're at loggerheads over this even though reportedly they've been meeting a more regularly in the last couple of days anyway Whitman says to me\nShe says well I I take umbrage with you in terms of the uh the mayor of not being a fall to think it is it you know in in party's fault because you know he took a contract language that would have put for students in in a much or more responsible way some language force mature that was eliminated\nAnd I had to admit I hadn't read that hadn't seen that with some familiar with it\nAnd so I kind of table that you know there's only one guy that I go to when it comes to the city Providence for things are happening there so let's go to the news maker line because I think this is important in fascinating only holds a story that I missed and should have known\nThem a gallon WPRI dot com or just caught at the gym but who's always at the ready are put the wait staff will you start and then we'll figure this thing out so I called them during the break is do you think about this because yes\nTrue but let's let's let's talk about what what what is you know acutely true and what's not what what what had happened dance with and what is your story tell us about the ah thirty five million dollar contract and language that may or may not have been limited\nYeah so the question guy with a couple of weeks back now to go back or third day of the strike um and and it was interesting I I had read and read the entire contract that student and\nI'm like I said for a different story and so I was aware of language in the contract basically explain in the bank of a strike\nUm the the company would not be required to provide an Easter or to the city you're proud of that\nBut I worry taking a little bit deeper on was that the city where they put out an Iraqi basically when it could it contractor services out to be back in ... team they included a provision\nIn the in the dead that said if you go if there is a labor dispute you'll still have to provide us with a with a turban you want to come up with a different way on in the event of a labor dispute\nDuring the course of\nGo she ... the company came back and it's all it's all public documents the company get back to the city that basically we take exception to that by the end\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than ... around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nCity of new ... in these cases so a new American is right that the city wanted some ... uh and then allow a contract to go forward that did not include language that the company to\nUm to a shorter dressed or to to provide services during the strike\nHuh\nAnd what has been mayor ... superintendent Mars\nDiscussion of that\nBasically the answer they've given us a repeatedly had back during the course of negotiations were taken out they didn't give us a reason like Afghan and this is the gas is not our there's nothing you know I don't know for sure but my guess would be\nIt was not something that they they ... they probably didn't realize that there was a real chance of a strike um at any point in back in twenty Fifteen\nNo mention of all the problems the city of property you know bus drivers was probably not near the top of the list and I think they probably said All right bye no problem let's fight off now coming back and really bites\nThem uh I'm ... I'm I'm split focused here I'm reading a legal language here in in listening to the same time I want to make sure that I'm paying attention did did did the city or for a student at the at the execution of this contract to have any inkling as to whether or not they'd have a gym action problem\n[noise] uh no I'm the only including they could impact because this was back in twenty fifty remember\nOnly including or the only reason maybe to include that language in the history of\nOf labor issues with the bus drivers way back in the early two thousand when there's the ... he was still in office there was a strike that was pretty heated um I Believe early on in the berries administration\nOr there was a threat of a strike that the city kind of was able to uh I Believe kick in a little bit of money that they could go away or and so there was at least\nA knowledge if you work let's say in the city solicitors officer if you're a long time to leave school department you're away or potentially that these issues do pop up but again\nWhen you're a new administration taking office keep in mind that that contract goes out to bid January twenty if the mayor or Mr noises a fresh new mayor\nOr at the time the superintendent leaving the court to for an end to it at least when it goes out to bid the current superintendent did sign the contract but it was you know especially on day one\nSo if I get this correct and I want to get this correct yeah we're talking a damn a gallon WPRI we're talking about the bus strike in some of his contract with language an assertion my duty would've been a candidate for mayor about uh about language changes in this contract she says you know he you know he should've saw this\nUm so it's like if I've got it right I Want to make sure I got this definition I'm correct in inverted\nOr the force mature or language was eliminated ...\nIt was no it was in fact\nI'm Sorry it was inserted because at first mature I'll relieves a party from having to to act with unforeseen circumstances ... you know working on um their ability to perform\nYeah exactly I think in in ... lawyer terms or one lawyer described it to me I it's like an act of God provision right by a a labor dispute does not strike me as an act of God [laughter] yeah [noise] so how does that\nHow does that rule out that what you what do you think about that 'cause I'm I'm I'm thinking out loud as we go for the majority is something that first student would have wanted\nObviously they have it um the definitions of beyond your control are arguably not in play here\nRight although in the contract that was written so it's not just that the\nCity wanted one thing and then got another it's that in the in the contract and the actual contract that was executed a horse majority provision\nSpecifically outline a bunch of beyond beyond your control measures but also says the specifically labor to you or struck\nAlways listen to specifically exactly so that that covers for students liability completely\nBingo exactly so a big question\nIn Hawaii by his name would you do that\nI Believe you're going to have the superintendent of schools adding a little while you could ask [laughter]\nYeah I did that that is I mean that that's ... material\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine Vermont flood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nSo ... yeah I mean and I'll tell you\nWhat the the uh [noise] I have to give them the benefit of the doubt but here's what we typically I've covered now I Believe two separate bus contract type thing early in my career and then in twice you know I was you know part of meeting where this was debated publicly and the truth is\nFlood Lincoln is southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nAnti advertising\nCredit products are made by ... rating terms very based on credit history Amazon is not a sponsor of this promotion other restrictions apply the website for details\nThere is a million ways to get into a credit card debt but one of your way to start getting out of fond of von ... has access to online and secure loans from two thousand dollars to thirty five thousand dollars a competitive race and now get a fifty\nDollar Amazon dot com gift card happier first claim they made on time go to a bond ... fifty eight fifty eight when applying a B.

well taught to do the women candidate for mayor coming up after the four thirty headlines for her perspective on this I'm not necessarily inclined to turn this bus strike\nInto a big political mayoral\nCrises at the same time there is a race this is an assertion that was made I learn something about this I don't know how this got by me but them sometimes that does these things happen you know happens to all of us we've had chronic assertions and are certainly bought into it for a while that this is a spotless\nIssue for the city uh that\nThere is you know dispute between two entities not employed by the city for student a contractor but certainly not unemployed and the employees are for students who are the bus drivers\nAnd that there's not much that the city could have done about it but now that they have this problem they're looking at these alternative plans\nYou know it falls under the category of semi spilled milk at the same time it's also about what you do going forward\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island for a mere luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit letter of Lincoln MTC Lincoln Lincoln and Jay Z and the all new twenty or gene Lincoln Navigator was Lincoln if there were against it on ...\nSo you understand the difference correct for getting me yeah okay so you're saying you know having said that it's interesting the superintendent came in after the contract was signed so ah you know he's not\nUm I don't think personally and professionally responsible for that\nOr he does have the school department is well aware of that language and that's got to be addressed going forward so repeat what you think about the about the mayor's a responsibility in this because it has been more or less characterized by by many that you know golly shuts it's really not his issue\nIn his shoe he is he's the mayor problem and then he signed the contract I I don't understand\nI don't understand why\nHe wouldn't get it passed some that anyone would get a pat on the ... sign the contract and hence the teacher the forgive me the drivers are on strike\nWell I'm not sure it's that simple right now I'm not sure it's that simple the the new ones that the superintendent offered there you may have heard the sound bite\nRight and well here's the thing 'cause it's kind of confusing for everybody I so they've got this three or if the thing is a solution right so if the if if first student and and the Teamsters don't get together there's at least an effort being taken now to replace for student either in whole or in part\nAnd I was asking how does that work if in fact the the the language and the contract a\nWaves\nTheir responsibility or do the job action in in the superintendent pointed out that it may not waive their a responsibility to perform it just may protect them from being sued\nShow I I'm not sure that that your criticism is is crystal clear ah okay let me do you find your shirt absolutely yeah\nAll right kind of thing the superintendent and said he is not an attorney and certainly I'm not an attorney or you probably should be talking to an attorney all I can say to you as mayor is he not head of the school at the end of the day\nHe is responsible for contracts especially the school apartment which takes up half the city's budget\nDon't you think it would be managed jets that\nHad better again I'm going to say to you have teachers who don't have a contract you have but who a bus drivers who are out on strike he absolutely guaranteed that I eat these students would have transportation they do not\nAnd hear the

reason I called your back is to a credit for bringing this to my attention but be kind of want to clearly understand what your criticism of the mayor is that\nThat this this force majority language\nIs is the key to the problem because although it certainly seems to alleviate a long term legal ... liabilities for student I'm not sure\nThat it is the language in or out would have

getting ready for the big one that gets Kansas City\nShort weeks now is is a little bit different is this just for tickets said seeing here with a an extra practice is actually kind of hope you get in the swing of things\nI mean anytime you get to ... the team that's where you\nDevelop your confidence so uh it's definitely good to have a full week the practice so\nWas it was it difficult for the last we could all your account only had to walk through before a plane\nThat's the situation I was in so we dealt with it and be able to get a win but that was last week in\nWe've got practice now looking forward to\nHaving another one tomorrow [noise] uh I think he's good uh you know he\nEven playing tough a lot of people want to say things about their defense but there are leading the league in third down and uh they're doing well on third down and that's a huge crucial part of\nGetting off into the field though so you know he's instinctive er he's he's getting out of breaks [noise] um so he's pretty good\nGuys like ... like you added like can I ask you on\nHold if I told you didn't know they wanted the tricks\nTo in a in a way that probably only they'll do a tickets that he said you can run around the track as much as he wants to do is any difference if there's something altogether different\nSort of talking about your transition it's going to take some time how do you feel like the transition skull\nOh I mean it's it's getting better each day\nUm you know\nHonestly I'm just worried about just trying to get my son's down and going on in an executing turn practice so it it it is better to have competition the defense playing as a D and playing against a park corners and getting into the flow and feeling bodies and ah\nAll that stuff does is it allows you to build your confidence so I like it\nWhen your condition have you with your condition has been since you got that\nFeel like my conditions been pretty good um you're always working to get a better uh you know\nWin against Newt Gingrich helped me a lot so\nThat was that was good and you know I I really felt like we took\nAdvantage of the time that I had um so\nYou know I'm looking forward to going out and get another practice then and building that confidence a little more options for thirty points less we put into the city has probably could have put a fifty ... near first came back what would you notice about this group and where do you think you guys can improve\nI mean I'm honestly not even thinking about last week or what happened last week you know we're playing undefeated team that's you know looks unbelievable so uh my focus is a Kansas City chiefs I care less about last week\nUm you know\nWe've got a battle if you love football this while you play it for games like this so far too too tough teams are and that's what I'm looking forward to\nYou said you're concentrating on where you guys need to do to feed the ... what would have some of those things you guys have to do to feed them\nNow we've got to ask you um [noise]\nOr so you know we got another day so you know work on that and and go from there I think if it's still haven't\nNicholas always got it [laughter] Brian ...

standard again and again fought board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nSkilled position players\nHe's put together and you start with Tom Murray kill and Travis Kelsey why I think are two of the most special offers some players in the entire National Football league and present different sets of challenges\nFor each of them you know I'm not even including Sammy Watkins who's a former top ten Beck and a heck of a football player so they're skilled position players are outstanding and I think the drafting of homes at number attend a year ago\nWas the best place he could have gone because a Andy Reid\nIs quarterback friendly puts his quarterback and good positions and to they've got\nThat group of skilled position players make anybody look good and Leslie he got the ... behind Alex Smith for a year and I think that's really important Alex help them learn how to be professional what to study how to study and now you're looking at the what I think them in the rams\nFight for the two most explosive officers and football\nMike I Know what happened to homes looked like coming out of college you know what he looks like now tell me how he's gotten better as a football player over this last year plus\nTwo things number one consistency of mechanics\nNow the kids can make any role for many platform side on them over the top or you know he can he can floated he can drill it he might have the biggest arming football but his mechanics especially footwork has gotten a lot better\nAnd I think more importantly Andy what has happened is that when he was in college every single play something big was going to happen either really really good or really really bad and I think what Andy Reid has been able to do is throw situational football into him and he's basically eliminated\nThe bad play once he got fourteen or Fifteen touchdown pass a couple of interceptions and he's not put the ball up for grabs which he did a lot in college\nMight may I Will have the call of the patriots and chiefs on Westwood One with Kevin Coogler he's with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh\nTom Brady recently said Mike split the NFL is kind of morphing into what the college game is where it spread 'em out\nEverybody playing in space easier for a guy like him to get the ball out hey are you noticing that across the league and beer so is that good for the NFL game to take the characteristics of college football\n... years ago it was always the opposite it's really intriguing because years and years ago it was the college coaches the will come to NFL camps to learn what the latest and greatest walls as far as schemes and ...\nAnd now what we're seeing and mainly\nBecause it's what we're getting from college is these days the proliferation of the spread often has affected every position on both sides of the football it's not just the quarterback I mean for instance there are left back all that will graduate this year after play four years of college football\nThat have never put their hand in the dirt ah\nOkay that's a different concept that it's a different thing they're going to have to do in college you look at defense they're getting smaller\nQuicker more defensive backs on the field it's become such a space game and I think what's happening is that you know built ballot jak kind of been ahead of everybody forever and the NFL and I think bill is the guy ... years and years ago personified taking advantage of match up\nIn the NFL and if he needs three tight end on the field fine the need no tight end on the field fine\nBut bills game plan changes weak the weak based on how he hopes to take advantage of match ups\nAnd Mike I think that like he went down the road of drafting those too tight ends in the early to thousands then it was what spread 'em out and use the slot then back to the tight end with Hernandez and wrong\nI think he's trying to stay ahead again where he's gotten a good run blocking off in some wind a draft Sony Michel\nWho was a great finisher of runs in turn run over some of those smaller guys and I know it's almost counterintuitive these days to think that a head coach is planning to run the football but especially in this match up Mike I think the run game has a chance to be here for a New England and could be huge all year long\nTaken advantage of those smaller defenders like you said\nIt's really intriguing because they do fill bellies jacking any read or or two of the guys that I respect the most in the entire league and you're right that the term you use counterintuitive is correct\nAnd I think as they see defense is getting smaller and quicker and even though we talk about Tom Brady and Patrick ... homes and explosives\nRhode Island's number one for dealer is setting the standard again and again for foreigners over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right and one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nAre deceiving leap tough in the run game so when you start talking about Sony Michel I watch the tape this morning of the game last week and I think he's still thinking a little bit just making sure he's doing all the right things but he is finishing every run physically\nAnd I think what you'll see it's all more birth and make you met as the season goes along\nYeah I think health is a part of that through my ... I don't know if you think that or not but you know the missing early sort of getting his feet underneath of him but boy when he knows where he's going he I mean look he probably should have got called for the last week for way put the head down I Know they're not ... the league but to your point\nThe end of those runs are really what is impressive because what you think is a forty hour game is turning into sex you do that are on a whole drive not only are you eating the will of the defense\nYou're also gaining extra yards when people really aren't even paying attention to how they're getting there\nYeah I I think the two guys that are deceiving as far as how explosives in physically tough they are coming out of college were album tomorrow and Sony Michel and at two hundred and twelve two hundred and Fifteen pounds their thicker\nAnd tougher than you expect because they're so darn fast everybody thinks they're just an outlier neither of a lark\nThey can make a mistake and catch the football but they were talking to some physicality outstanding and I'd be remiss if I did also say that every time I bought a New England take on and you talk about their options of line they rarely turn a defensive player loose\nThey've played so well together and I think Don tastes car next year is that good enough and it's a life coach is I've ever been around\nI'm with you guys Yoda micro array of Westwood One he's calling the game on Sunday night up here in New England with Kevin Coogler he's with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh Mike I'm not going to get into the whole ground ... versus Kelsey\nBut no one may have trained and I am watching film as you you would seem grown over the years and there's a lot of people who are really nit picking at him he's almost thirty he's had a major knee injury\nDescribes still flash on film or are those skills starting to decline just a little bit\nOf good cronk still outstanding and\nWhen you watch 'em on tape and you want to talk about the most complete tight end and football there may be guys faster\nRun faster forty at\nBut at the end of the day when you put the film on the block in Iran game he passed protect for Tom Brady he's outstanding again though and when he he's in line and they run play action him in the middle of the field is outstanding and he can still win banned the mayor\nAnd there are still teams and trust because you know when they didn't have that all men and and before they signed Gordon everybody was double teaming who robbed bunk out that so much respect teams out for him\nNo question uh my name is Josh Gordon as a football player just sometimes forget the in the context of the New England the off chance he's played so liberal I nobody can be but what is he we need help and figuring out how good this guy really is\nWell everybody knows including yourself that from a physical traits perspective\nHe's as talented a weight speed athlete has been drafted in the last eight nine ten years at the wide receiver position now he's been out of the league both with injuries that off the field issues and when you start talking about quarterbacks that needs to be able to trust\nTom Brady is at the top of that list and if you look at the film from last week the first two in completion for both the next between Brady and Gordon\nSo the first one Gordon probably should have stopped\nOn a crossing route Tom throat all behind them in to pay the net and then he was wide open on the backs shoulder and again the timing in the truck wasn't there so you've got a kid with tremendous physical traits but I think the timing and the trust is still lacking and that's just something that comes with time\nAnd might that Baylor off instead he played in that really isn't translate a ball to what New England running here in the NFL is it\nYou know most of the big twelve from of a wide receiver evaluation perspective as it is is it difficult evaluation a because of the type of routes they run and be because of the types of defensive they play against so you're a hundred percent correct\nOr when they get to the NFL both of them have never really seen much\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again for foreigners over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right and one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nMove to a thousand dollar dodge challenger el mode Chrysler does ... ... or online or download C.

them smiling ... joy was going on they are really enjoying this you know it's not like a relief is like yeah this is cool and hopefully we can\nIncidentally placing their bets at the same time so there's been a massive steam play on the giants\nBut that's simply already occurred now why that's important is you look at the giants plus one and you see that the line has moved in and like wow so the smart better as must really like the giants because they're pouring all their money and on the giants but what you're missing in that equation\nIs that they liked the giants they liked the giants at that number that's why they poured all their money and then again you could look at it and say well the number has barely changed there's still probably some good value there and that could be true\nBut it's important to know a steam play versus just the market correcting itself because of money coming in steam plays can be very important to take note of because again that means known better is known to casinos for winning known for making what are known as sharp ... plays\nA lot of them got in on the giants at plus two and a half and plus three and move the line across the industry which\nYou know it's something it's common and that had happened multiple times a week but it's rare and that it it doesn't happen in the majority of games that happens in a small percentage of games which is again to say that it happens every week but it's happening tonight and giants in Philly\nWas the steam play created in Cleveland\nYes that's a very funny or observation you're glad I don't know if it's eight o'clock yet I don't know if we can make that maybe that other hour we'll revisit the uh the birthplace of the steam\nOr the match a predictor\nWell in the four letter network has the giants at fifty point one percent and silly at forty nine point five\nSo rude mortgage your house right now for your money on the giant what\nBut I also think too that you know it's really hard to figure out how the weather is are going to affect these teams just last week you know it was raining like crazy in the first half in Kansas City and Jacksonville didn't put points on the board and it was twenty nothing but in reality it worse\nIt should have been probably twenty to ten and twenty to fourteen to have\nThe rain did not affect them in case see I think it's a little different this time because number one you've got you know again Carson went to was coming back from a knee injury she got to be worried about him slipping on the turf in and not you know in a bad way resume stumbled but the terms gonna get wet it's\nGonna be a factor and rainy night versus rain at one o'clock in the area of ... rain or four o'clock while they would never be playing it for a with these two teams matching up against each other but\nYeah rain at night and again we're not on the ground there at the Meadowlands are in Philadelphia So we don't know what the weather is like necessarily again being in in the Meadowlands but uh yeah they are expecting some whether there and yet whether at eight o'clock at night much different than what weather on uh at one o'clock in the\nWrong grows ... will be interesting and Dave Yorkers nervous about as young\nAs I should be but or I'll give the jinx too old Dave there and I I like the giants and so they go Dave ... on your own ... men and but you know it's funny ... I\nWouldn't be surprised if there was a lot done through the air tonight I Know that's typically a snow saying no you know and yeah the known to generosity always know the public freaks out the public thinks that when there's snow on the ground that everyone's going to run it because you can't pass the ball\nAnd then what the patriots be the titans like Seventy five to nothing in the snow or whatever the fifty nine seven right exactly I think a good rule of thumb to follow and the weather is whatever that team does well they're going to try to do more often than normal because of the weather so if they are running team they're going to run the ball and if there are passing team\nThey're going to keep passing the ball so neither of these teams are good either one so that's why I'll take the giants in a in a nail biter\nAnd the one thing that I Wonder from Philadelphia perspective is if they lose this game do they go out and make the splash and go get shady McCoy and bring him back\nFrom buffalo we know that it was a chip Kelly who traded shady McCord of buffalo when he was there in Philly I Wonder if a loss ends up pushing them to make not to panic move\nBut creates a new sense of urgency for them to want to go make a move and find themselves are running back well the roots gave us some betting lingo for them to generality\nAnd the truest definition of the generosity is Perry Perry's picks are like running a has basically\nThe headline jumped fellow that Kavanaugh to campaign digging seriously for welcome Gina to point out\nTo our ground weekdays nine so\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood what born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason unbeatable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nHousing and cash gift certificates and prize is the more you play the more chances to win and the ... river bed center will be busy this fall November ninth\nThe temptations and the four tops don't miss grand funk railroad on Saturday November Seventeen get your tickets the twin towers box office or online to ticket master twin river casinos so much more so close\nYour doctor sends you for lab tests but does your health plan half of the ... can you choose which lab to get your blood work done\nThe next time you made testing avoid the higher cost of hospitals visit each side's political laboratory east side clinical lab offers\nThe highest quality of the lowest cost they accept all insurance has had with over fifty locations there's a location near you why pay more visited lab choice ... for more info and the list of convenient location that ...\nDo you need safe reliable transportation I'm ... and if you have family or a client coming to town you're celebrating a party wedding sporting event call professional security services they can help you with all your transportation meat whether it's a right to Logan New York airport there appears professional\nSecurity services will take you anywhere anytime twenty four seven and they offer transportation services for seven fourteen up to twenty four passengers as well as town car called professional security services nine for two forty four thirty in ...\nI'm here with Tom Marshall Marshall building and remodeling Tom Marshall gets my recommendation for roofing citing and windows hands down but why should homeowners call you this time of year\nWell ... this was a perfect time of year to get a free estimate you can walk in a low price in time for one to reschedule your word for next spring and you won't be anything until the war just complete and you're satisfied that's just the way marshals does business\nAnd if you need new roofing signing your windows there's just no harm in getting a free estimated especially from a company you know and trust\nThat's right and that will show your samples discussion project and give you a price we can also discussed affordable financing in fact right now you can get a new roof for new windows for less than a hundred dollars a month and remember marshals you get a fair price beautiful work and the promise that will be there when you need us\nThere it is doing my family didn't trust your home to marshal building and remodeling call today for your free estimate eight hundred eight six six fourteen Ninety nine that's one eight hundred eight six six fourteen Ninety nine or ...
