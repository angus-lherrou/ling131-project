political correctness in general not there to the tough part like I said is defining it and I don't know that they did that in this study I think they did it they defined what that means but I mean

than the eighty percent average except for black Americans who that Seventy five percent and white Americans it's like Seventy nine and ...\nThey think the ... then who's running the place that's my question who's running this conversation you always want on the conversation rich white liberals highly educated rich white liberals why are they running the conversation while they own the media number one they run the media\nAnd a and at the end and this is according to study that's what they say they basically they they are among those the quote this this study by the way called hidden tribes [noise]\nUm where was it here they just said that they called the ... there were the most the head demonic the word they used those hedge demonic group ever think there is no diversity\nIn uh in any sort of\nOf progressive activists it's amazing and this is what we've gotten by the way this is these are the people running the the surrounding themselves around Gina Raimondo you look at all the progressive left this and this and the state today that are trying to get this whole thing going on\nAnd they're all that's the exactly who they are it's amazing\nSo if ... if if you're part of what they're calling this they're calling it the exhaustive majority\nWhere the majority of the country is sitting there saying\nAnd you know they bore racism but they think the political correctness goes too far they're not so they have a new wants point of view they see things as malleable like you know you might have to be left on some things you might have to be right a ring on on some things they just they they're not out there to hurt anybody but at the same time not ready to sit there and blow up institutions that have helped us\nSurvive and prosper as people for literally hundreds of years at this point and so these are just the normal people this is just like you know you have you probably have these people in your family\nSo the issue is\nFor me is if there is this exhausted majority\nWhat are they doing and where are they and how do we get them to be not exhausted [laughter]\nThe exhaustive majority I Would imagine they mean psychologically exhausted where they're sick and tired of the nonsense\nAnd if there was and I think what happens is when you're sick and tired of the nonsense me ask you you check out right like you're done how many of you right now I Know people have said this to me they're not voting for governor then they're they're done with the governor's race like I'm just not going to vote for I'll do something else will vote you said you're not going to vote right\nOh saying this this sort of a sprinting the sort of describes me I'm exhausted exhausted psychologically by this stuff right cabinet thing to me and just the the the back and forth on that on the well nonsense ramping up of it I'm done\n[laughter] other if he does want a job they just check out I'd be checked out completely but I this is that this is how I make my living so I Need to be checked in but it's like you said at the governor's race I'm are you going to stay out of it I think I might\nSee just going to be interesting to see how many people out there get discouraged because when those people those the silent majority when I say silent I'm Sorry the with the term that they use is not so majority of the uh the exhausted majority\nChecks out then the extremists are the ones that battle it out whoever's got the most most motivated and dedicated extremists\nIs is the winner right and so in this case obviously in the blues the blue states in Rhode

technology is the phone at the apparatus\nUm but it's software that's that's dedicated and increasing so that you have to you that you become a custom in or addicted to use it and over and over again plenty of did a podcaster Brian liberal last week which is up on our website six thirty WPRI come we talked about this and he kind of he he took the cell phone\nI'm a part of a I paused thing I've had thing and in in ... made a comparison to cigarettes listen to this from the from the pocket\nOf the the the concepts in New Delhi honor the parallels between big ... big tobacco so yeah I don't want to get into it here because it's sort of ... off topic but\nIn Nineteen Seventy nine when the tobacco companies wrote a memo that said we're looking for an addictive product that is socially acceptable in hand held and delivers a boost the or versus nicotine love you replace that with the word doping mean that's the iPhone right that's the galaxy\nIs that we had these socially acceptable in my view addicted addictive products a that\nIs more insidious in a way to tobacco 'cause we all know tobacco was bad for it but at least I can argue on the phone I Need 'cause it's it's important for work what is my wife text nature so we had this weird mishmash of something I Know is really bad for me and myself wellbeing\nWhen I Need it and I got to have it in the fact that I haven't checked it and forty five minutes is giving me the creeps\nSo it isn't that weird you think about that and then the software on it the programs like Facebook and Twitter and all this stuff and and and the reaction I mean you can studies have done to the children young people in I'm In adults in general after they use social media they feel worse than when they did it and it but yet they go back again and again and again\nJoe's in Providence Joe you're on WPRI Joe\n... is actually are quite aware like seven days if people my age group for political correctness of course that could be a warrior and a white guy well educated well is currently a country just like ...\n... it to ya ya\nAnd or a circuit shows that the ... and there's a ... ... people that want the score won't\nSpeak to any more [laughter] than what you would cause a great voice as far as what yeah okay I'm from place to endorse so ... ... if you got somebody let's say ... or ...\nI think she will lose everything she says\nBut she she actually what we were him out yeah whereas mom she's first for the\nLeader of the mercenary Gina Raimondo will work the will use the progressive hired them she'll have them around her she'll let them have been she'll let them be hacked dogs\nRight it was a professor there for me who poor white teacher or a more so it doesn't matter well look at facing because it was a bomb on what we can begin with for all the reasons why they say you know wind job\nIf he could get fixed thirty in the history of stuff is going to harvest introductory those kids and make them think like I\nSaid before\nCertainly for just the opposite she wants people to pay for themselves material and decide you know what's in it for how they were ... were you know what this kid\nHe got his voice will pressure people smuggling go or knows it\nWell what's happened is this has been referred to as a guy in the American Weinstein you can check them up on on the Internet he talks about\nThese these old or these old institutions being like a shows were hermit crab no hermit crab dies the leaves and another one comes in ...\nRhode Island's number one born dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like flood autos that's how\nThey basically just ideology being promoted they if they get a degree from brown I mean how ... what are we going to do going to go into a job interview you were impressed you go into brown used you pay your way through you get in there you get the the network that goes wrong with brown or without any I Believe ... whatever it is\nAnd they assume that you have the higher quality education when in fact the matter is depending on what you're studying and may not even be education at all\nThe way by raising\nActivists they're they're creating activists they hold disciplines in academia created specifically just to create activism\nAnd I just want to invite while you're\nLike oh no [laughter] our [laughter] oh\nYeah I I Want to argue with [laughter] [laughter]\nWell there's the other thing to joke I appreciate the call thank you the other thing too is you know the educated versus the uneducated and all that stuff you know there's a certain level when you have somebody who doesn't have a college degree they live life and they their education as their experience\nAnd so you have this you know that you when you see when you're living a life of people who are surviving and working and working with their hands are working at a job that's not a maybe not so technical in terms of you know I'm a science or or or biology or something like that\nAnd and they don't have this indoctrination they they have a different level of its usefulness determines your value you know how useful or you can you do this can you do that\nAnd so they're worried about being useful they're not worried about these you know post modern philosophical nonsense crap that goes on there they worried about being useful\nHis political correctness useful not really it's useful if you're an ideologue to wants to control people's brains and and bludgeon your political opponents over their head because they not because of their ideas are aren't effective but because they said things the wrong way\n\nAnd then when you see the Twitter moms that go on social media mobs where people get get killed or lose their jobs for doing something that is perceived as being wrong or being said the wrong way and all kinds of ... are thrown at you or\nIs racist sexist biggest\nWhatever you know those are thrown at you and when that happens you know you see people's lives can be completely destroyed as a matter of fact if you go and do some of the research\nAnd some of these these Twitter mob stories later on you find out that there will be um you know the real story what was really meant by the press wants to one does one woman who was a fascinating story where she was actually an activist\nOn on promoting aids prevention in Africa I Believe and she tweeted out a it was supposed to be a um a tongue in cheek like being sarcastic thing about uh you know I'm going to Africa but I guess I don't have to worry about getting aids because I'm white\nAnd she was doing it you know saying that because people are in in Africa and are black that don't get the treatment and don't get the prevention the education that they're supposed to sing it being ironic and the Twitter modern went crazy\nAnd she got literally got like flown to go underground I think she had like disappear for a while she\nCouldn't get any jobs at six six successful young woman\nWent and then like the people who who went after her it was one journalist I think he actually did a story later on and apologize and everything else because he didn't know she was\nIn that political correctness thing that there's no new wants there's no looking into this not trying to figure anything out it's just everything is racism\nAutomatically the media promotes that you have this other story a couple of stories in the news lately about\nYou know they always give everybody a nickname like these white women calling the police on people for barbecuing or not letting somebody take a nap in a dormitory or there's another one a with a woman guy trying to get into his building in a woman's blocking them and it's automatically race based not just the people are just busy body\nJerks but it's automatically a racial thing the latest story the woman was married to somebody who was half black half white so [laughter] they were married together the divorce now or maybe that was a reason why maybe she became racist and so I Can't be married to a half black man I guess I don't know\nBut ... it's automatically a racial thing because the media says it is they said in the headlines white woman does this the black man\nIt can be no racial commentary nothing we have no idea what the real motivation is but because those two things are set up there then it's automatically racial incident that's just that's the the paradigm they want to set that up you know why\nSome kind of like like like like like like like like like like\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury
