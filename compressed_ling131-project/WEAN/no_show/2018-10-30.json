W. B. R. O. [noise]\n\nEleven twenty five on this Tuesday there is a false statement [noise] and I want to make sure we covered this because the amount of time that channel twelve put into this\nStory or you know can't be done in in a couple of minutes on TV a teddy posted the full statement from speaker Matty yellow\nThat he gave to channel twelve about representative cable the sexual harassment allegations he didn't go on the record but he gave the statement I'm going to read it too because I think it's very important ah because there are there are holes and gaps in this story and the timing is odd let's just put it at odd\nFour years ago the speaker writes I became aware that a close personal and professional relationship between representatives key building cars area and had ended during a non state health event in which I was not present\nBased on what I learned after the fact I asked both of them to separate and not interact with one another in twenty Seventeen representatives air and requested a meeting which I accommodated she want it to discuss her bill assignments in hearings on those bills before the house Judiciary Committee I had my policy director and he named the woman Lynn\nRabbani accompanying representative ... to the hearings on those bills representatives airing was satisfied with this arrangement in twenty eight team\nRepresenting ... hearing requested a meeting which I again accommodated as in the previous year she wanted to discuss her bill assignments in hearings on those bills before the house Judiciary Committee\nI suggested that representative Keith will not be present for these hearings\nRepresentatives ... expressed repeatedly her enthusiastic satisfaction with this arrangement I've not heard anything from representatives area to indicate that she was unhappy with these a combination in every session does is ...\nThere arises conflicts of many kinds between representative when I made aware of issues I pride myself and trying to resolve them expeditiously I find it suspicious that one week before an election reports are surfacing about events which date back many years involving these representatives\nAnd this is ... last line here this is clearly another attempt by ultra progressive to impact this election cycle\nWill All right so he is saying speaker ... hello\nHe's his words a close personal and professional relationship between the two had ended during some event non state house event so they had something happen according to him he said he wasn't there but based on what I learned after the fact I asked them both to separate and not interact with one another\n[noise] this is crazy if this were a normal workplace are something happen between these two people are you all over here you go over there don't look at each other on TALK to each other\nAnd we'll go about our business I now that was the allergy she's saying for years she endured sexual harassment\nAnd now he's saying well they had something going on at the time I don't know\nI wasn't there I heard about it I said stay away from each other\nOh boy now week before the election twenty teen Hey Tom on a car phone\nIf you're living in a soap opera\n[laughter] open up the bubble doesn't hurt\nThey look I can understand somebody comes to Austin did quite well this is not just the way it goes way beyond and all the facts and maybe we'll find out what the report what groups offered me a climbing course period\n... but also the fact is is extra and be ready you were where indirect\nOr every resource river he said she said or some grumbling believe group or whatever\nWhy would an extra ... ...\nWhat is good reason for that\n[noise] you mean on a yesterday yesterday when he removed him\nFrom Gregory in other words said it's the trigger to the ongoing for some reason the statements were coverage for all of a sudden now literally within minutes are going to be recorded in the near a ... ... ... ... ... actually were worthy of being taken\nAfter the news we're broke why wasn't worthy before that\nWell here's the thing I think because his private employer meaning representative cables employer in real life where I say not up at the state house they let him but they yeah they put him on administrative leave so they\nOur uh\n[noise] being focused on as we speak because representative ... the Democrat in Brownsville in Gloster\nHas a big problem on his hands\nHe's been accused of sexual harassment going back years speaker about a yellow is involved in the sense that uh he's one of his he he was on the powerful Judiciary Committee meeting representative keep all us ... stepped in yesterday after the channel twelve story eared aired\nAbout an hour and a half he said look taking you out of that position\nThere's an email floating around from the\nUm the woman that is accusing and they are colleagues up at the state house both state representative and she's in ... in his statement said well they had some kind of a relationship it ended it sounds like an into poorly and he said stay away from each other and so the question now is that enough\nBecause she is now saying nobody helped me out and I I was harassed for years oh boy so isn't it funny that uh two of the ten races to watch involves ... race and also this representative ...\nWho he has a a I Would imagine his Republican opponent David place [laughter]\nUh is doing a ... today and I you know sex allegations of sexual harassment or nothing to laugh at but my goodness and such a mess up there right now one week to the election Mary's in war with a W peril Hi Mary\n[noise] mourning mourning so that's a very confusing okay when you read that a yellow made he said he kept them\nThey had to stay away from one another um so if you wind up they had a relationship with one another like out of out of the state you know and then\nWell less than ... let me let me let me just handle that part right there I I can tell you what the statement said and that is what it sounds like okay that right that is what is inferred in speak about a yellow sign\nA statement because it starts right off\nThat they had a close personal relationship that ended at a non state house event years ago right\nNow not yell at me and he's saying you know this is what I'm getting out of it and I think you are to marry me listen I don't know what happened with\nYou too and it it staying out of the state house if you think is over and knock it off and don't bring it in here right [noise] right\nBut now now she's saying that it's sexual\nMisconduct or whatever word she's using um that he's she's bothering her evidently and evidently she's doing his first out of work too so don't you think the authorities should have been born in I mean that sexual harassment that's you know\nThe police department of late should have been involved\nRight I mean it it does make an area was there did she feel so safe that she said well maybe I Need a restraining order or exactly I don't know what you know neither one of them are coming out publicly the speaker is not going\n[noise] uh [noise] you know in person on the record he put out a statement to channel twelve is their story\nThere are a lot of missing pieces and I only say that because it's no joke I mean this guy is accused of something that could ruin his political career could ruin his is his personal life it could ruin his professional job so you know I I I'm I'm I'm not making light of anything but\nLater when you read the statement from the speaker this seems like there's an awful lot of detail do we do know\nSo the question is this representative Sandy\nComplained about this a couple of years ago the same person I mean she needs to come full which came when she first made statements all these people both married and they don't want it out there that they were having a relationship I mean come on they they you know election next week you know\nWhat are you trying to ... you know really when someone's life and correct\nMe if you're a deep thank you Mary you're you're spot on the this is there's politics at play here obviously somebody's been going on at the state house a kidney she's reports that he talked to a dozen past and present lawmakers up there that also they knew this was going on so what this is right\n... group wants your car any make any model what more than ... around because we're a survive bowling center and we'll buy yours even if you do by our ... our car buyers are tough\nFrom each other don't bring your personal nonsense in here or was their sexual harassment and if she felt threatened did you get a restraining order did she go to the police you know there's a lot of there's a ton of questions a ton of questions\nAnd I don't think there's enough time before election day to sort this out I don't think some of the key players want this\nObviously being made public and is it a hit is it a political hit on the speaker that's what you gotta ask yourself ... there'll be apparel Hi Vinnie\nI ... I've never called your show before you piqued my interest when you as the the timing of the speaker's race I'm\nSure that I did my job right today [laughter] yeah you know you're not going to\nThe light bulb went up but I had a ... I read in the primaries journal that she had the worst voting record and now she has a ... on my question of views does she have an opponent this election cycle and is it true that she had the worst voting record that I read in the Bronx journal um and does her mother work up with the state I was that was the other question\nI I don't know anything about her family member I don't know anything about her family member and I am going to\n... all over the voting rights and our race but she got her raises your goals I was just curious how she's\nHere's the thing that he if if she what do you mean by a poor voting record that she wasn't showing up\nRight and ... and is it because they were on re she's worried about she's trying to get on the line when I don't know what I'm not accusing her that it was just curious as Yemen up on it and does she have the the job that was born to regulate the brunt of journals that are that they make up\nWell I'll look that up I didn't see that um you know listen I had to be honest with you kill people I Know because he's got an interesting name right and I've\nI've heard the name I don't know too much about 'em and I and you know it's ... they've got the power plant up there so they've got a they've ... he's one of the tend to watch if you listen to the journal I'll look up her\nUh her voting record but what I don't know what that would have to do necessarily with with this I think it is the channel twelve stories and she's married\nUh as far as I Know ... married us I rented to someone last names and they just had a baby so you think anybody really wants all of this to to be happening never mind your his a private employer\nHas stepped into the picture I said it's a nightmare it's a mess and it's a week to go and I don't find I find that suspicious I think this is more of a political hit on Nick ... yes I Do June to North Providence WPRI Hi June\n... Hi how are you doing you know I'm doing fine okay good [laughter]\nHow about a couple of thoughts this is ridiculous [laughter] this is just the woman's clue trying to um these people like to see and this one they can handle their own personal problems so they have to bring it to the state house\nNot only to knock 'em on that a yellow but now ... is from Puerto Rico\nAnd the government wants that revolt and number two this weekend it was announced on one of the cable channels\nThat come out and when it first that aid is as the costs now too and I talk to accept them savvy my breathing that good today huh masculinity\nSo this is all now she wrote that letter last march that's when all of this woman for white crap now these people is supposed to be making decisions for us and they can't handle their own problems\nYou have a June ... listen she's young she's I think fourteen years younger than him if in fact something was going on and they you know and and he's harassing heart that has to be addressed that cannot be swept under the rug\nWell he might not be there rats and her well that that's who would against it's like with them held in White House what judge Kavanaugh oh God I Hope we don't put any yearbooks and they were lucky and it lives\nOut there and um\nI don't want to know anybody's lying though I mean this this could be an interpretation of a bad situation\nWhy why didn't you go to the authorities are white and well that she's going to have you\n... the both representatives have I have a lot of questions to answer June thank you gossip is in the car I guess\nI Do are you're good you want to know the answers to why all these problems when paranoid don't really\nKnow how do you think you'd want their you know one ... candidates or anyone that resemble the idea of full or candidate to win so they come up with situations that you're bringing up have you noticed everything or grants well whether you know there's a woman's grew\n... group wants your car any make any model what pays more than ... around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nThey have emails they have documentation they're reporting\nIs is legit it's sorrow it's\nIn our politics amount oh you bet you busy I completely agree with that to say it's all made up no something was going on there twelve other people out there that said we don't totally know about that now I did get a message from one person who was up at the state house during that time and said how did I not hear about this I don't know\nWell what do you need that for you it's called life [laughter] and by the way who knows better about being an old lady than you [laughter] right\n[laughter] I didn't know but my mother didn't let me go to high school so I always considered myself being done was stupid or whatever you're anything about that all my friends say you're not stupid now you just didn't have that education everybody else\nRight believe me I've read met a lot of highly educated people they're not that bright either\n[laughter] All right Mary I going to run for the news now thank God but God Bless shall thank you very much\nAll right the idea that we're going to use an executive order to change the fourteenth amendment so we'll throw that out there we come back in the next hour the ... state of\nIllinois one solution studios seventies away from the general election news talk Ninety nine seven AM six thirty W.

those benefits to kill us it's ridiculous\n\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free own condition and blood for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices log on to flood Otto John job now\nCome in and they have a child and they you know parents have to stay at the citizens and it's really one of these things I get it um it's something that you know I think that just you know figuring out a way to I don't know be rational and enforce the border and border laws and absolutely by the way\nI'm an absolutely in force and maintain order at the border as a fantastic thing I supported heartedly or stopping places from becoming sanctuary states in cities all about it\nUm president's using executive orders to completely changed the um the city that the interpretation is an actual text of the constitution now now I don't know what he's going to do to do this I don't know what this executive order would look like sweat the suits languages but it's the wrong way to do it you want to change this concept\nOf birthright citizenship then you have the argument you place the argument on the ballot or on the in terms of the ratification of of the constitution the way supposed to be done and uh with one of the two couple of ways it's supposed to

factory makes up basically attempted to do because\nThis is not for that\nNot he's not the first person to bring his argument up I've heard it before uh\nDoesn't matter who brought it up is that what it's about it's about being Donald Trump pregnant for muddy everywhere because they know what's gonna happen in the rest of the week\nWell maybe I mean I might be the case it just seems to me that uh it it should be a a common value for everybody\nTo just say that the executive branch doesn't have the power to supersede the constitution even if the constitution has been interpreted by the Supreme Court there's a at the very least if there's a if there's a specific constitutional interpretation it's gone that that is in play here than at the very least you should have um a congressional clarification of it\nAnd the ... borders I mean come on [laughter] [noise]\nBut you know one of the talents of of Donald Trump is to bring up in an exaggerated fashioned those things that other presidents have done a and and let people lose their minds over it because as a way to show the hypocrisy of the people because they have been done many times\nI'm executive orders to to deal with things because president wants to political win over the actual legislative when it happens all the time\nUm and it's disgusting it's disgusting\nAnd you know for people out there I I just think about the about the second amendment implications out here we were you know what else are you going to change what other what other constitutional issues are going to try and I've I've changed with it with a executive ... you know a guy right ahead let's try it out we don't do this\nShould be a statement of values from everybody we do not mess with the founding document without the consent of the

into it\nThis portion of the show sponsored by Providence auto body certified by more manufactured than any of the ... center in Rhode Island is a Honda accurate ... repair facility now the reason why I played that is because there's a story upon this was on drudge today I'm it's either it's it's from media I\nAnd what they did was they went and they found that the story was published yesterday so it's a little bit late but I wanted to bring the subjects and get just I didn't do it yesterday\nUm they found\nThat there have been celebrities like Lester Holt right for their Halloween show they did on the today show evidently he was made up\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason prices in cars with zero percent if you are for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log on to what Tom\nMousy little woman actually mousy but she looks like a librarian right and she came out in like belted out this insane voice so they dress Lester ... hold up like her complete with like prosthetics in white skinned woman was white okay\nSo Lester Holt does the story about backing Kelly and they're you know all the people over at NBC our ... are all these people are just they're all living about her like\nThat she's got to choose an apology to the broader core group to abort a person of color community whatever that is okay then they have a copy she was dressed up and full prosthetics and what people are just referred to as white face as ah what's his face or the the country singer who's on the voice\nHis name like shelter she's dressed up like great like Sheldon then they have\nNow that's white face technically white face first of all these companies these terms it just made up the black faces a very specific thing that happened in American history where people who are white were dressed up to mock black people for entertainment purposes they you know they put on exaggerated makeup that looks nothing like them\nAnd they went off and they they they spoke and in horrible English and all that stuff was mocking it was racist it was terrible\nThese are examples of people dressing up like individuals now\nJimmy Fallon evidently did this on an NBC show I think what what was he he was the Late Show before he was on the Tonight Show right with me and I guess he was like Karl Malone was dressed up like Karl Malone and black face and they will what they're calling blackface miss\n'em Jimmy Kimmel did it when he was a part of the man show what a what a scum bags hypocrite Jimmy Kimmel has become I got to tell you for a guy who was really funny he is such a hypocrite because now all of a sudden he's Mr woke\nNow he's got this this uh this this popular late night show Donald Trump's president and so all of a sudden he's well this is the host of the blanket man show folks\nYou remember the man show on Comedy Central Nick did you watch them then show on Comedy Central\nYeah I've seen a little bit of it here and there yeah it was famous it was funny as it was him and Adam Corolla and they sat there there was a it was kind of basically got tongue in cheek over the top masculine guy thing it was like you've ever stuffed magazine maxim magazine it was like if that was a TV show\nSo that would end the show with girls are jumping on trampolines big busted women bouncing up and down and trampolines in slow motion okay that was the man show\nThey did a bunch of stuff like that it was an addict call them the ... the junkies were like the girls who were part of the show yeah Jimmy Kimmel I'm sure it's amazing the spin machine that exists hiding this past from him\nYou know from from the from you know nobody talks about his past amazing all of a sudden everybody woke\nThey're all woke now there are all that they they they total line so everybody gives them a pass\nBut Jimmy Kimmel evidently was dressed up their videos out there I'm doing this kind of thing and so\nThe standard is one thing for one person they've always NBC was always made it very difficult over there for Megan Kelly to to get any success that people never embrace their they hate or whatever who cares right\nSo I see this and I'm thinking to myself\nHere's a solution like there's all this new debate about about Halloween costumes and every and others you know you have\nThis is my culture is not your costume and you can't wear a you know some ... show and pretend to be a Mexican person you can't wear a I'm a ... and pretend to be a gay show or or dress up in like a samurai or something like that's all cultural appropriation\nThis is the insane asylum that exist in Halloween I have a solution for it how about this we give Halloween back to children\nHow 'bout that\nWe give Halloween back to the children and adults start to act like adults people asked me a tomorrow night go trick or treating when my son were you going to be for Halloween\nI'm going to be an angry taxpayer like I Am every day\nHow about that\nHow we do that how about adults let children have they have the ah have the the floor they can go around the trick or treat and the adults I don't know stay home and give out candy\n\nThat do go off the costume parties dopey do stupid things that the children to\nDo things that adults do which is be an angry taxpayer more people with the Halloween parties as angry taxpayer maybe they would stop having them which is fine by me\n\nA less optimal solution but still acceptable everybody can go ahead and let everybody\nHow would you like motor drenched twenty gene trucks with the here for only one Ninety nine process will say hello to forge twenty eight gene Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a flood forward in eastern enjoy Narragansett\nThing you do there's the sub optimal from [laughter] just because I have a bias against people who who are putting on a constant were grown adults who put on a constant following it's a pet peeve of mine but I saw\nThe optimal solution is that everybody grows up the second you know optimal solution is or you could just go ahead and be whatever you want to be and uh and and stopped\nThrowing racism around like it's a like it's a a a a a necklace\nThat you can put on people can always do that too\nIf you're dressing up as an individual you're not a racist if you're dressing up as a race and mocking them you might be a racist\nDepending on the situation because you could just be stupid and think it's funny because you like to shock people there's always those people out there and more often than not there's more of those people than racist individuals who just do things to shock people 'cause it's fun\nI've had that in my in my ... my DNA before saying things outrageous things that people just make them like oh my God 'cause it's fun to watch their faces drop things you don't mean that was my humor my entire twenties heads intimidating to ensure WPRI dead\nRat snake before you're really friendly I like\nThe house yeah today my ... I Am the host I mean they are our producer Nick yes the Knicks filling in for big Doug nix the man\nOkay well I like them all but anyway the knife okay so um I just wanted to say that with a clip of Hillary Clinton um you know that you've written that I'd like to be are going to you know the new\nI you know what I've seen stories about it I haven't heard the clip you and I haven't seen my\nGosh man if you're going to have this discussion today you have a yeah it is ... ... ... ... or like ... ... you know let us let me where\nI'm liberal eat that I ended up with this thing called because they're doing it mhm I didn't want to say it's like ... ... ... ... right you got to watch the\nWell from what I understand if she was talking about Eric Holder and about and one of the ... right right who sheets she was talking about the she got the mixed up and somebody said do you mean Eric Holder and she said some tell you about it\nI Know they all look alike [laughter] right that's right so I got to know if you've got to see that as soon as possible right that's what he said in the ... that it\n... your word clip with and we're working with them or anything that Donald Trump ... regarding rights are and you can walk right on ...\nWhat if what you're saying is correct and accurate I Will tell you she will get a pass 'cause she's woke and\nGetting the ... [laughter] that letting her go yes you're right you're right that correctly ... you would have\nTo get even ... really has not act on it it it it will not let me at work or\nI Will see it I Will review it and we'll talk about it tomorrow or perhaps you\nThis is a criminal criminal level of hypocrisy now you got ... or the ... ... ... ... you know the photo array of political correct now we walk on I got you well if a critical manner by the main your own visibility\nBy the way you want to bring racism back into vogue or and make it acceptable in this country may weaponized weaponize accusations of racism\nOr do you want to actually create you want to actually create racism in this country and create ... racial demands that has come more weaponized claims of racism or whether an ice creams of sexual harassment yeah I think you will create more of it it does it is the the the exact in hit the ...\nWhat you should be doing in order to create a solution to the\nProblem it is the worst possible thing that can happen which is why when we talk about identity politics and then and then nightmare that it is it creates tribalism and if you want to go ahead and say what\nAnd said that uh that we're all going to be together under one on bravo here tribes don't live together tribes live you know in proximity to each other and war with each other\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "30"}
