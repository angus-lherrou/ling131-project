a news director I said these men\nAre saying that this ... years ago raped them\nAnd how do I go interview them and put you know what I mean put us on the air now that there were some some um reports of this but no one and actually heard from the victims and they turned out to be the four original not uh the poor people that came forward first I watched one of them\nIt was three or four we sat at a picnic table in a backyard something or an adult borrow myself and my photographer and I watched one of those are men completely break down there's no way it was anything but almost a seizure he was

very scary time for young men in America when you can be a guilty of something that you may not be guilty are just very very very difficult time\nWhat's happening here has much more to do that even the appointment of it's the largest [noise] it really does [noise] you could be somebody that's perfect your dire allies and somebody said it gives you up stuff that\nDoesn't necessarily have to be a woman as everybody say what somebody could accuse you of something you're automatically\nGuilty but it's just well you are truly guilty until proven innocent\nWhat's interesting about that she was I think there's other things that not necessarily just false accusations but also ah in my mind [noise]\nThe ideas that um\nThere's no room for perception anywhere else there's no room for anybody else's point of view there's no room for anybody else's\nAll for even taking time to find out whether or not allegations are legitimate\nThere's ... um\nYou know there's an automatic if you're either believe this or do you use something wrong with your type of thing and there's there's a whole bunch of handles this whole thing right I'll tell you I think I'd be curious as to how many men out there feel the same with ... is the president there I I you know\nI think that there is I'm more worried about the division that that attitude that he just mentioned cause rather than um\nRather than specifically being accused of something that may or may not have happened and being assumed to be guilty but that's a concern to 'em because they think in general most of them are still decent human beings who make false accusations\nUm ... you know when you get into the grounds of high stakes stuff like this it absolutely becomes more and more possible risks in Freetown regular WPRI wreck\nI make a long way saying why\nYou're saying that I stay off it off if we stay things now as the [noise] yeah and that's with everything you've been talking about asking\nSo you say that again 'cause you've looked out of seconds we see things not as how they are but how we are\n... things not as bad but uh\nYeah you know something that can tell you I see a lot of that I see a lot of that in the world I've seen a lot of people who put their stuff on others right yeah\nUm you know some people who who all call of the people that make certain things because they share those actual live just because that's the ... thing within themselves maybe\nYou were talking Ali what was going to wait it out with the world and\nI mean listen I when you when you hear about I mean Harvey Weinstein was was basically ... recall him God\nRight he's got so when you when you when you have a high ... rooms or anybody in Hollywood you could think that would have the most freedom to tell anybody they want you to go screw it'd be Meryl Streep bright people are knocking down her door that she's her name was attached to something it's an instant instant artistic credibility and celebrity to it\nAnd so if she's calling somebody God I mean the guy can do pretty much where every once and so as long as that's allowed to happen the guy could do whatever you want and evidently not a very nice guy according to reports and so you know the fact that they dealt with those people out there had to deal with that and careers either made or destroyed by this kind of\nA filth then automatically I can imagine why people who would be you know but who would have to deal with that I Would think the entire world like that but it's not\nExactly exactly it was not that is\nInteresting very interesting wreck I Want to know how that is that's one of those things is Coleman attorneys verity where there's just a little detour no truths\nOr I don't know if we're all stuck like that where we all just see things the way we are rather than being able to see things from other people's point of view I don't know but I think there's a lot of us that are like that I think that's a that's probably a human condition we have we have to struggle with\nUh is damaging it makes it seem that the ... there's no individual belief in anything and so you have this\nThis this ... this assuming\nThat because the power structure that goes on in Washington DC and then you know and it's been self admitted when you hear from you\nLooking for a car credit not played well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east

all have a wife or a husband\nAnd maybe that's the I don't know maybe that that kind of philosophy is trickling down into human beings lives maybe that's why everybody's buying pets and adopting pets and not having children [laughter]\nIt was everybody's calling and saying what they look they'd rather hang out with dogs and humans because they just sit there and look around and they see people who are are constantly trying to take power from them or something I don't know\nAnd Richmond mark you're on WPRI marked\nMan this is a ... a couple of things\nUh I haven't heard any interviews but many are sitting on\nA Supreme Court no wonder what it takes is on this and the other thing how about those people remaining on the shortlist Mm it thinking oh good God I Hope he doesn't pick me well\nYeah I don't know I I don't know you know I don't know I mean because you know in this case was bizarre is that\n[noise] you know trying to go back over your entire life and think about what could be you know either rightly or wrongly are brought up\nAnd you know and and pointed to as something that is disqualifying\nI mean there's probably a style we're talking about who's there talking to the other day yesterday or today about about things that they did\nThat would be completely and these were all laughing about it because the stupid things you do as a kid that stuff came up forget it you know you would never be able to it just everything would be disqualified because you can make all sorts of assumptions and and I called yesterday the meaning creep where because one thing happened then that means Fifteen other things happened as well you know\nAnd um and that becomes I mean the people walking around right now saying that Brett Kavanaugh was a serial rapist\nAnd ... there's no evidence that fact in any way she was a matter of fact has not been that's not even been a direct allegation last\nNight I guess that goes along with the saying that the rumors are spread fast that the truth\nWell yeah which is there more fun for the long run\nBut while they destroy somebody's life and ... and how to repair the damage you don't this whole says that this whole methods there's been abused and and I don't know if there's another way if somebody's planning something different to a to change this\nWell there's been there's been a construction of values in our country\nTo the point where um\nYou know again this is the result of political marketing where the person who you're running against not just somebody who disagree with but there's somebody who's just fundamentally broken and evil\nAnd so how could you ever have a process where the two sides who think each other are evil and broken can come together and figure out some wanting to become a judge who's not evil in broken you know what I mean so I you know like a ...\nThat's what the panel is supposed to do yeah we we and we trust him about that I don't know what their thoughts on it I I haven't heard that one's been interviewed\nWell there's people in that short list I don't know if there's anybody that would that would actually make it through I don't I don't know I don't know whether or not there's enough time to get the work done it would need to get done to make it to make that you have to make it through um I don't know\nThis portion Marshall sponsored by prominence auto body the first and only facility in Rhode Island and Massachusetts district certified to repair the all new all aluminum Cadillac CPS tons of his car time you're WPRI\n... yes many are you doing I'm good thank you\nLook I I just want to call a little small lower case B us here I I I Know you've got and I don't actually\nAgree with you a lot of times I'm sure I understand that\nBut then he politics and that is a problem with this country is real no but it doesn't apply to everything you know to say that something you did X Y and Z is a problem and it depends on how far up the food chain of ... and you have to do it so here we had a case with a with the judge\nWho's being as you well know to the highest office in the land for life ... and no other country has a structure like this when it comes to the court systems in our modern democracies no other nation so here we have the unique situation of an old rule Trump or\nFrankly from the from the eight the nineteenth century being applied to twenty first century situation\nAnd you know the FBI if not dealing with a dent in politics that's not their job they don't come to conclusions is you know they look and they do research the front the facts as they find him to this case the Senate committee to educate\nAnd as you rightly said this is not a court either ... you know this is an opinion mhm this whole thing is about does this person to have whatever deficit must say that the\nTemperament and the scale and the expertise to ... just not it's not trial right and so you have to take in the context what this is really about mhm and so far ... year he's made the ...\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they're all in for Steve we own condition and bought bought any religion or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models had incredible prices log on to flood auto John John now\nIs these rumors out there today it a little something when I was with the national guard maybe I did maybe I didn't but you know he is listening as quote when I was young and stupid or that young and stupid things right and you know what people said yeah I guess that's about right mhm it didn't hold him back\nNo one was raging against the machine for that he said yeah when I was youngest spray\nYou your your point of view makes a lot of sense assuming that were that he's guilty\nWell here's the thing ... it has to do with\nThe unique circumstances redeeming and they are unique to ferry small group of people obviously and when you have a ... this situation it is not identity politics this is about really just what it is the fact is about and if he had come out and did what George W did I don't think this this thing would be going on at all but he\nDidn't like that but that makes sense as long as he did what they say he did\nHear something he could have come out and said yeah it was kind of a frat boy were from my lessons as kind of an adolescent jerk you know but I went to school I worked hard I drink beer or whatever it was indeed matured but he's not acting like a mature person if not acting like that he's not saying yeah\nWell he's acting like a person who's been falsely accused\nHe's ... he's made it a binary choice he said look either she's lying or I'm blind there's nothing in between right after the issue right and the truth is both of them cannot be\nIt can't happen it's a binary choice and I think if he had approached a different way\nAnd not gotten up and and acted like Lady Macbeth channeling Donald Trump's campaign speech [laughter] I don't think we'd be doing this\nI really don't I don't know I yeah I I think that if he didn't do that we would be believing her\nWell here's the thing she did she come forward if you look at this look at the facts why didn't\nShe came back in the ... I suppose it depends on how you define coming forward she came forward to her congresswoman and\nAs you get in and they're saying they don't have to Feinstein and we we know what the story is\nBut the I ... I think if he said to them what George W said to him I just don't think we'd be there\nWell you know as long as she but you you have to see your point of view is coming from the point of view that he's not been falsely accused\n[noise] yes that's right right that's right\nOkay so he says he's been falsely accused\nThats fights a binary decision that's his problem will\nNotice that it's not a problem at this point [laughter] I I don't think you're driving me crazy I'm gonna put an end up in my I\n... you only look here's the thing and ah he could be as pathological liar I have no idea I I'm just telling you\nHe says he didn't do it so telling somebody that didn't do it to admit that he did it [laughter] it's kind of a weird thing to do\nSo if he did it and he's you know and and he's using the denial of the allegations of the way to survive this thing then you're right he did that he picked the wrong thing he picked the wrong path the best task is to tell the truth and you get past it but\nYou know he says this isn't the truth now what do you do when you have somebody who comes across credibly\nIn one case you know and then somebody else that comes across credibly I when I say come across and they don't look like liars feeling would ever gap that means do you figure and figure out the ... the definition of that for yourself right what a liar looks like a an ax like and you know everybody\nHas their own prejudices and just so determines what that is what is ... you know whatever that was a lie or does it acts like him you know\nBody language experts and everything else\nUm you know so you put the so then you get a look at the evidence right 'cause if you if two people seem believable and you're trying to figure out who the chicken from one over the other you look at the evidence and you haven't so far as we know the FBI has we don't have a right now is from what you've seen publicly I don't think is their\nPast the you know this person says this and that person says that that isn't Cranston dentistry W bureau\nHey how you doing today who thank you good yeah I didn't believe me out of it I watched pretty good out of her testimony I didn't believe or which I really feel that it was", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "02"}
