of\nThe news was Rhode Island Sacramento gene boundless energy\nSeven forty three here uh WPRI joining us on the line this morning is Dr John Drake from Brown University in Rhode Island hospital to talk about\nA dimension and what happens when someone is diagnosed with dementia can be a difficult time for family and friends but certainly are for the individual diagnosed and we learned yesterday that the retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor\nHas been diagnosed with dementia so I thought it'd be a good time to have a brief conversation about that with someone who's an expert on the subject when we say good morning to Dr John Drake from Brown University in Rhode Island hospital\nThat morning and I appreciate the opportunity to you on your show\nWell thank you for your time and so our first you know\nUnfortunately you know do a dimension diagnosis I'm sure feels like a blow to the patient but also it can be difficult for the family so what's something that you would tell someone a shortly after facing a dimension diagnosis in terms of uh you know how do they adjust how do they adapt to life going forward\nAbsolutely uh this is a tremendously important and um and actually Sandra Day O'Connor is a good example of\nAll the issues that you raised because she was a caregiver herself and and now a patient and it is a really difficult time you know how often people will have a big\nAnd subtle symptoms for a year or two before they come in and um then they seek medical help and you know it's it it's hard to hear the word dementia um but it's important to\nIt for what it is and um\n[noise] especially how it impacts uh your your life and and that of your family um this is a progressive disorder that typically I'm starts with\nA short term memory difficulties often what we call word finding difficulty difficulty coming up with words um when you're trying to speak and and visual spatial types of uh um abilities often people will notice that they're\nLost unfamiliar places while driving\nUm and it it is progressive and uh it eventually does\nUm lead to this condition that we called dementia which is a general term meaning that people lose their ability to be able to function independently and day to day life because of the issues that I mentioned um and it uh\nOff and pretty early on a patience lose their insight into the fact that they have this disorder they they sort of can't remember that they can't remember and it often leads to a very difficult dynamic between as you can imagine if you can't remember you have\nUm a dimension disorder um it can be really difficult for family caregivers so I can fully appreciate with that what the uh former\nHas gone through on on both ends of the spectrum\nCan you distinguish for us the difference I think sometimes we often associate dimension and also ... can you distinguish for us the difference between the two\nAbsolutely that are typically the first question that um people want answered when they come into the clinic\nUm dementia a is a is a kind of an umbrella term a general term that describes someone's ability to be able to function in day to day life so somebody with dementia has memory or thinking problems that make it so that they can no longer attend to basic things in everyday life\nBeing able to manage their finances are their medications um they may find it difficult to get around it difficult to get around in the community because a little more difficult to remember how to get too familiar places\nUm and so that's a so dimension of being a general term that describes that situation um many many things can cause dementia Alzheimer's disease that particular\nA condition a it's a part of a group of what we call neuro degenerative disorders\nUm uh the for Alzheimer's in particular typically\nWe see around the age sixty five people start to notice symptoms um it it's a it's a little bit of a tricky question because there's the diagnosis of dementia itself which is the loss of everyday function then there's the disease itself\nParticular uh also ... we actually know from lots of research studies that the ... that leads to all the time has these uh begins even decades before people start to notice subtle memory symptoms\nVery interesting well Dr John drink from Brown University in Rhode Island hospital we appreciate your time this morning and certainly shutting some light on the subject a thank you for joining us either\nI anybody else talking about it or you just um what do you mean offering your own little clear on this whole thing a little bit of both you know I mean I just want to it's it's just interactive guessing\nWhile I'm On my whole point of view to listen to it was talking about I'm using it as an opportunity to talk
