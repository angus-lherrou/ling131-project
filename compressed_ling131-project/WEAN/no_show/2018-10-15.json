I mean that guy never\nBenefit of the doubt is pretty much by yeah um my thinking and you know in this scenario reading this article and\nAnd having the you know the the Johnston Johnston mayor who you know again just being a lifelong resident of the state um have heard that he's made disparaging disparaging comments about people you haven't you know like over the years with just saying you know this one should get a disease I have cancer or whatever if they do something wrong you know but um\nYeah I mean I ... yeah that's\nThat but I don't know the Joe ... I have never I ... I've never heard that I don't know I'm most I missed it I don't know but my\nPoint is that uh people glass houses shouldn't throw stones but I as far as I Know nobody who commented on that had been convicted of a felony [laughter] so you know it's either going to mean something or doesn't I guess ... Kirk your current your WPRI hurt\nI met a a I'm an attorney and I uh\nI I wanted to focus on one of the things I just heard you say which is a horrible mess and you know something I don't know what a horrible messages you're trying to focus on because in my my audience someone a second chance another another opportunity to demonstrate goodwill\nThat is not a horrible message\nWell that that's that's a heck of a way to interpret that that that's a heck of a way to interpret this as well but that's what\nThat's what I mean what good will what are you talking about ... so let me say this\nYou've got to I think very\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than ... around because we're a sort of by buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nMouth is they're saying no we're going to put a name out there we're going to demonstrate we're going to allow lot actions speak louder than all of these good words about oh we want to do the right thing we want to get people second chances but then it becomes not my back yard\nAnd that's the state police and all of these other law enforcement individual but here you have two people that have recognized this opportunity with a good man\nThat that to demonstrate the ability to overcome these obstacles and by the way he had\nThe Supreme Court has found him qualified to reinstate and that's no small achievement you can do that\nWell no if you are listening for a politician it is Oh absolutely\nWhat are you kidding me I don't I I Know you're kidding me right now I Am I going to tell you man you are who must grind must be why what do you charge in our cars you must be worth every penny you're real good try a lot of money should because you're really good [laughter] and no matter honestly\nThis thing that that to me that's a cop out that's not true that that\nWas not true it's not true\nTo say that you can get reinstated because you're a politician is such a denigrating but you're still\nCurrent that show her on that court 'cause that's not John ... yes yeah I don't know about him\nLook up this look at how he got his his law license back\nHe submitted know numerous\nLetters yeah from who is from her current individual if not politician oh no ... not ... not exclusively of course not oh come ... come mad you but you did a great job listen you\nYou can't denigrate the judiciary and then at the same time we\nShow on a second chance to hold on a second nobody's denigrating I didn't denigrate the judiciary you why you say no\nI'm saying that this is a there was this whole case on their individual\n... that are not all it\nWas first of all nobody most of all a number one ... year all over the place you're on the plane she was correct you're going to hurt and you're going to let me talk are you going to go we gonna go okay I was going to a show it's a two way street here I'd like to have a conversation with Iraq

what ... what does the word you used showing a showing is or something to the community or something like that what does it have to do with anything\nIs a good will is I mean what does that work for what getting paid to do a job no\nI think it's being able to finally have people recognize I I actually see this is an enormous opportunity missed so yeah you know he because this is affording him an opportunity to be heard on many of the issues he's talked about which a prison reform and the need to reintegrate\nA formerly incarcerated individuals back into society and that has not happened that it's because of this an Arab prejudice was white collar crime and violent criminals absolutely I couldn't agree with you more but when you're talking about white collar crime\nAnd for the first time offended if this was a state court cases of federal ... this was a state court case he probably would have received probation they wouldn't know individuals that lost any money as a result of that is why there was no risk their restitution\n'cause there's no way to get any money right running fortunately Louisiana\nBut they talk about this high number one point six ...\nThat was a gross amount of alone the taken up they were in fact\nThere what is your connection to this case where uses his attorney\nI noticed it was felt okay yeah I'm not that is what I use my real name and absolutely\nI actually I'm just I'm just curious 'cause you see I mean a lot about oh I'm not gonna hide don't\nListen to me this is this isn't about him to me this isn't really anything about him this is about the job of the judiciary this is about the\nAbout ... you know you have it it's a it's an amazing thing to me and also the perception that we have a ... you you I Know a guy state\nAnd that's exactly what this is\nYou can't you can't do connect he's asked I sent it to his Senate I'm a service which by the way confirms all kinds of justices right confirms the judges in this state right right yeah and so all of a sudden now the justice goes reach I get a former state senator and all of a sudden the audition\nBut he's still out he has so far out of the game now forget that he's never going to be in

I've just never I Know it's not apples to apples\nBut it still bothers me anyway so I Am with\nYou on that that I think there's got to you have to put it in context if you're the twentieth team in the country and you lose to the number five team you slide down a couple of spots alright that's fine they move yeah that's ridiculous\nIs and especially when it gets to me when like let's say that example you just use they lose in overtime or on the library they have like oh I didn't watch the game so we're like oh pencil and in my life now and yeah the team's terrible because they want to just come out I mean obviously the polls don't mean much anyway but I just a pet peeve and uh now I got it out so I should be a relatively good to go from Iran\nAnd I also think ... the a playoff committee when looking at this last for Rhode Island are going to put it in context in that uh they didn't have their starting quarterback drawing Lawson veto priority play\nAnd ah he was a thrill under fifty percent completion two fifty six two touchdowns interceptions and I bring that up not the bag on the back up\nBut to put into perspective\nThat I think when you're putting together the playoff field you know you are I can say hey we had our back up in there and it is something tangible that the committee will actually look at I think the other thing that's going for them to\nIs that\nDirector your eye is representing the CIA on that playoff committee now for years New Hampshire had always had their guy Marty serrano on there and Marty was always able to make me ma'am she got in one year at seven and five all wrong foreign foreign the week\nFive ... five games at four and a third innings and one hit for walks in ... at this point right now our score is literally just going out the outlook is open there's now a ... that's probably\nIn the minds of some being little short sighted disrespectful to map barns but I mean come on you use when Rick poor soldiers set up died so it's the whole what are we doing here\nHe's just trying to find a way to peace this thing together we talked to a friend it prior last hour about poor so coming in in the eighth inning and for some it was done a hell of a job\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen trucks with the here for only one Ninety nine process will say hello to foot boards twenty eighty four to one fifty that's for the best

of the red Sox has always got to make it interesting right\nNot only did he give up to hit sort of run but I mean that that ball the bet intending caught up against the wall I mean there are practically pulling a number out of there so you can stick his rear end in to get away up against their to make sure the bald and go off the wall I'm partially only kidding there but you understand my\nPoint and look like Garrett coal went out there and spawned a gym\nBut you know what he did his team was in the game and he gave them six innings to where they can use their bullpen\nIn a much more normal fashion then what's the red Sox are trying to do right\nNow let me get ahead of something here crashed to you talked about poor cello and he did a great job and I don't have a problem with how he was deployed but I'm already preparing myself whether the red Sox win the world series or not most likely if they do\nHow diamond day the silver Fox is going to be out there peddling every media outlet that got a microphone about how\nYou know actually this is why we didn't go out and get any middle relief pitching because we knew we were going to use our starters in relief rolls come playoff time and I'm already not buying it I'm just a preparing myself for the whatnot that will be trusted out there\nAs some sort of reasoning as do behind why they didn't solidified the bullpen\nOffer the playoff to your point if the red Sox ended up winning the world series and Rick poor so out of the bullpen and Chris sail out of the bullpen is a part of it that is just the part that I mean that is really a ... it's like taking that foot seal tape\nPutting it on your boat and praying to God doesn't sing\n... really that would that's a new data that is correct and he'll have\nHoles in his team and roots you're a billion per cent right yeah you're now dealing with or Alex corps is now dealing with the fact that they've done browse ski put his faith\nIn Tyler foreign bird and then it was well you know when they'll go bowl or can help save us and he was injured all year long and they didn't want to go out and get anybody else your million percent right\nAnd it's like I'm not going to be happy because I get a lot of this from Red Sox fans that are friends of mine I'm going to be ecstatic if the red Sox when I'm just not a results oriented guy so I'm not going to buy this uh hogwash as our good friend arcade K would say when I ... and I know it's going to be tried it out there\nAnd the whole again if this all comes to fruition the whole talk of the off season will be\nWho needs starting pitcher not anymore everyone let's just go out and get to winning guys and build your team around guys who can pitch to a names it's the wave of the president yeah and I'm just ready for it I Know it's coming a specially with the way the red Sox have been using they're both and another thing is\nYou know if this were the plan all along\nAnd they were going to use these guys the way they're using them which again I have no problem with you could have said that it's not like a football where you're giving away some sort of strategy where there'll be has to come out there actually were going to have Julian Edelman\nJoined other one's gonna throw a pass a so it'll be on the lookout for that no you could just be like well you know what we have some interesting roster construction that we're thinking about using\nThat'll help our cover up some of our weaknesses in the bullpen now maybe we wouldn't have thought that maybe we would have been like oh what's this hocus pocus the diamond Dave's gonna whip out but you know it's a lot better than I talked to Alex and he said this was great so that's what we're doing [laughter]\nOkay I Know you're covering all the bases here diamond day but\nYeah it's just an odd strategy and it seems like you know to look at the bigger picture\nThat baseball has just sort of lost its way in terms of the starting pitcher and now all of the managers or at least a good chunk of them are like hey you know what I'm willing to try anything when it comes to pitching hey you want to throw six guys a game on a regular basis hot down that sounds like a great idea something Joe ... would do so let's run it out\nWell Regina with these new fan dangled numbers and all the different ways than we ever all these different in my church now\nThey're measuring the game and when are finding that even though that you're a theory is very popular among through bs employee aims then we who analyzed these things I think that the two any pictures on the future of the game and therefore\nMy general managers will robotically tell their managers to manage that\nWay yeah you know that's going to war I certainly do
