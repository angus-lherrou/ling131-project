B. R. O. [noise]\nReminiscing back to our conversation on\nNew index new numbers that came out from the freedom the center for freedom and prosperity run by my extent house says that to Rhode Island is in forty six forty six place on their jobs and opportunity index and not just just to regroup a my extent how\nHow do you put your index together\nOkay we look at we looked at on employment related factor that's one group we looked at the ratio of number ... working versus a number or relying on government or or receiving some form of government assistance that's our second group of factors in a group of factors\nWhat is your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common there are all in for Steve free owns edition and bought bought any religion or against the wind over two hundred three on cars all make all models and incredible prices love onto flood Otto John John now\nAll those to us are indicative of whether or not or good jobs\nIn a low tax you know environment that that can provide for prosperity and upward mobility and we're not seeing that in Rhode Island as compared with other states again Rhode Island has improved but also must all all but for other states have improved faster\nAnd uh we don't like being in the bottom of the pile\nNo and it just it just doesn't jibe with what a what a governor among does then saying right in in order to get reelected but also with\nThe growth of the nation and then the national economy and just now I Believe that a new poll came out that said President Trump's approval ratings hit it he he's high up since he spend less\nYeah that's a great point you bring up here so let let's just contrast that to\nNationally the economy is moving because free market policies conservative policies were put in place taxes we talk regulations\nThat a bunch of things and national economy is booming the reason we're being held back slower in Rhode Island because we've adopted largely a liberal progressive agenda which is holding us back so you talk about voting for two weeks out from Portland voters\nYou know what kind of Rhode Island do you what do you want to old growth economy with more people independently earning more money and\nBetter paying jobs with you on the economy where people are relying on governor rent assistance more and more and you should look at your candidates and do you find out or they are they are or you know are they professing a pro growth free market or gender or they\nAre they professing in advocating for progressive you know more government control over our lives agenda and and we we we believe that contrast of so stark in Rhode Island with conservative policies clearly\nAllowing for a great national boom and liberal policies holding us down here in Rhode Island this year the contrast but not any more clear and all of my\n... well ... it's always fascinating and you know I spend a lot of them working so people do have to ask themselves some tough questions if we're you know are we on the right path in other words not to keep up with\nYou know if the nation is is going full steam ahead why are we calling out right so I think that's the question people have to ask but also do you um like I don't know if she just before do you indoors for support any particular candidates saying the governor's race\nNo we don't get involved in individual candidates will it will comment on any policies any candidate might put for 'em and tell you whether we think that would be good or not good for our state but we're not we ... we we are not allowed as a five oh one C. three non profit to\nTo get involved in the ... elections and individuals campaigns in any way even by endorsing\nSo if it by looking at your your numbers in the index if there was one thing I and I think I think I Know the answer to this but if they were one thing and I tend to go down this path that\nWhatever whatever administration gets in in a couple of weeks in going into the new year and what have you would it be one thing that could push us up would it be the sales tax lowering the sales tax\nThat could be part of a prescription a buddy you you mentioned that a number of times at nine billion dollar budget is strangling us yeah that's right [laughter]\nJust are spending way more so we have to pay more taxes whether it's sales taxes or you know ... ... so we just spend too much and and and there's not one candidate really out there talking about for me that spending a it it's the albatross around her neck is why our taxes are high\nAre we at least think we can do some regulatory reforms like even freeing up hair brighter something as simple as that you can't even get done in this state\nUm because of special interest so but I Would say that nine billion dollar number that why do why are we the whole here's my rhetorical question why or we'd be holding well budget is strangle him to us\nWhy I don't know and and it and it's going up and up and up it certainly isn't going around it it doesn't even it didn't never even thought of them to say but listen you've got to kind of ... billion out of this thing it's you know have\nA we have a budget that just driving people out of the state\nWe have a budget that are making us unattractive for other people relatively that come here every politician you hear is beholden to what we have to we have to replace the revenue no we don't\nReally don't know if you want to have a better state and we've got we've got a literally ... but not stopped to grow it literally has to cut and then taxes and everything else would be reduced accordingly at that point but somebody's got to start reversing that curls we're going to be\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln and Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nYou know for all the time so it's a long term pattern is a long term politics of our state you you get that we're very liberal I'm up all the the high taxes on a cell that changes are going to stay there wired and bottom like\nAll right my extent house from the center for freedom and prosperity thank you for your time that I could tell you're luckier voters\n[laughter] but it sounds like we're going to need that we look at the index thank you for three eight nine seven seven takes away and and that's what Mike is saying what his uh his index shows and if you feel that if you feel the same way that\nOf the candidates including a democratic Gina Raimondo Republican Allen Fung Mahdi part or it can a party candidate William Gilbert they'll Gilbert and independent Joe ... plus they asked independent Luis Daniel Muniz the doctor Dr ammonia is\nOr how they would respond to three questions written by the journal and the public's radios and honest if given the opportunity\nSo they all rode back their answers there were three questions that they didn't quite get into this debate\nI think that's a pretty smart right your time runs out but there are other topics they want to cover so they said would you write back your answers and will publish them\nSo they all did except for Joe ... he didn't write back now I don't understand that you're up there in the debate you say you know ... you know my I'm very serious my campaign but he didn't answer them back I so I don't know\nWhat that entails but I'll just say that that's what they're printing the Providence Journal that everyone wrote back but him but the question that I wanted to tie into what the what we were just talking about with my extent house and you can weigh in on I Know there were a couple of people before the break that wanted to talk about what Mike was saying\nFor three eight nine seven seven six four three eight WPRI all the question that was posted the candidates for governor\nThe state budget is more reliant on gambling revenues and it was four years ago\nAnd there are proposals from lawmakers and the gambling industry to expand the gambling in the state is the state's reliance on gambling a cause for concern that if elected would you support allowing either on line betting or bending it more locations other than the current twin river casinos\nSo that's the question that was put out there\nAnd then the has the other one um this is the one I wanted to to time with my extent of economists expect a recession at some point in the next decade with the state budget up by eight hundred million dollars\nAnd that's at nine percent it's been pushed up over four years and still showing a structural deficit how would you deal with the loss of revenue and spike and expenses that a recession would bring\nSo spokesperson for Alan ...\nMayor ... took over the city of cramps at the height of the recession so he knows this all too well he got the city out of its horrific financial condition despite all that he tightened the budgetary belt across every department including his own ... or so he's talking budget cuts so Alan ... is on the record through spokesperson saying he will cut the budget\nA he said at the state level he'll do the same an ad that office of inspector general to help eliminate much of the excessive baggage and waste that has grown exponentially under Ramin does for years All right so this is what we're talking about who's going on the record\nTo say they'll cut the budget they'll work up there to cut the budget Alan ... people said that he will\nUm Mike ... is the spokesperson for Gina Raimondo he answered the question\nThis is exactly why we can't afford to see Alan ... office they'll ... economic development and job training which will send Rhode Island backwards and make us less resilient if and when another national and global recession hit their policies will make it more difficult to navigate a downturn and more Rhode islanders will get hurt\nOr that says nothing about cutting the budget right nothing\nThat's the ... campaign\nAnd you could read the others um ... children respond Joe ... didn't respond for some reason I have no idea Dr Munoz said my platform focuses on the need to expand vocational training at all high schools\nUh at all to all high school students by investing in a state wide after school program expanding retraining programs for various industries and reducing the duration of existing certification programs\nAt our public colleges and universities the key is to improve the accessibility of training in employment opportunities Rhode Island and to build a stronger and larger talent pool to conserve is those industries that are likely to survive the next recession or he's going education job training still\nSimply put I looked at this uh article today and I said super important question which is why I Want to\n... group wants your car any make any model what pays more than ... around because we're a survive vying center and we'll buy yours even if you do ... hours logged onto our car buyers are tough\nSwollen eight hundred million dollars\nOver the last four years that's nine percent went up what do we have to show folks

done I Will say just in time for election time right for three eight nine seven seven six five four three eight WPRI jumping the line right now real quickly while I have time\nTo get to a kind of taken over by some breaking news when I Do want I wanted to I saw this question and I thought to myself wow how we just glance at these numbers and don't absorb it\nThe budget went up nine percent in

they're trying to put their bills and they're trying to get their legislative grant they're trying to figure out fees and taxes and everything else how we how do we pay for everything let's put more in the budget put more in the budget put more in the budget what could we get\nFor eight hundred million dollars nine percent jumping the budget in the last four years tell me 'cause I I don't know I got\nWhere I honestly don't know what what I got out of it what did you get\nAny Spanish WPRI there hey guys doing good how are you\nA good listen I didn't hear all the conversation but I I've been

seven of them and I am six thirty WPRI\n[noise]\nOne twenty three here on the mat Allen Jovan or gossip is a a labor attorney who's usually a management side\nWorks for cities and towns all over Rhode Island is considered an expert in this field or just\nCurious about the validity in the the legality of site agreements and and then I I was considered just cite agreements just to be completely just by their nature invalid but you're saying side agreements happened as long as they're ratified then they're part of the contracting your good in ... you\nKnow just a name that yes it's it's just a description if you will write\nBut aside agreement is a collective bargaining agreement it's made between a representative of the union representative of the minister out\nIt's just usually doesn't happen in the beginning when the entire contractors decided just happened to be nine terms or something like\nThat yeah that's what they call and the executive oriental middle income times issues arise but again it's got to be\nRatified that isn't ratified at the ballot\nAnd go subject collective bargaining greener right\nAnd so if it's not ratified but yet carried out as if it had been and somebody finds out about it what sort of relief or or recompense Kan city get from people who have been collecting money supposedly illegally\nOr a couple of options first and foremost is the minister palate is on the defensive defending a grievance that allegedly arises from a violation of the side of grain that's so cool site agree that it has an affirmative defense the site of green is invalid and unenforceable\nIn terms of any um\nOther rented either I mean is the power that he may have upon discovering that is a excited written it out there that may not have been properly ratified or they may be claimed to arrest training for unjust enrichment of certain employees under the terms of the agreement [noise]\nUm and other forms of relief but that would be dependent upon the nature of the site agreement took ill effects\nSo if you're somebody you know this is which is in the case of war but if somebody was found to have been getting an extra payments for something that was done in aside agreement was ratified they have to pay that back individually\nIt's possible that possibility that could be a claim made her restitution at the ... the a cash conversion if you will uh leave to uh\nTo body was a mate pursuant to an unlawful agreement and unjust enrichment would serve as a basis to recoup some of that money\nYou have people who are in political positions or appointed positions who are\nWhat all do group wants your car any make any model blood more than any dealer around because we're all sort of by buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy our ... our car buyers\nWho knowingly get into an agreement that they know is not valid because it was ratified and executed anyway are they criminally liable have they are they committed a crime at that point\n[noise] while that's a pretty that's a pretty broad state and it would again be driven by the facts whether or not somebody who knowingly and willfully entered into an unlawful agreement a to derive money uh obtained money under false pretenses or to\nA steal money in some way under the construct of aside agreement\nThere's always that possibility what I find in my practice is that oftentimes municipal officials may\nGood faith mistakes and those mistakes that based on ignorance and I use that word in a sense of it's a ... not knowing what the law is a there's some belief out there that aside agreement can be made\nAt any point in time during the life of a of a collective bargaining agreement and if the union\nAnd a manager agree upon it it's somehow a enforceable and that's why when I\nGive presentations to the league of cities and towns and I speak to elected and appointed officials I remind them that they should always consider whether or not the subject matter is that they are negotiating I read the mandatory or premise a lawful or unlawful whatever agreements they strike\nBe sure that those agreements are presented to the proper corporate authorities within them in his ... otherwise the agreement is void [noise] I'm gonna give you one example\nCan I just say one real quick to sing to you I I I Know that you're being you're a lawyer and you have to be exact in your speech and you have to be exact in your in your\nUm in the possibilities whenever speaking about this when I see more blunt well just I'm just sitting as an observer and she'll be seen as I find it wholly unbelievable that any fire chief or any cheap many department\nOr any solicitor or\nAnybody who's the head of a union who are pretty much experts in the stuff that they use it all the time anyway could ever get into a side agreement and ... and not know that ... doesn't have that has to be ratified that's that's beyond my my my belief I mean how can\nWhen one inquired as you with allies that those documents were never presented to a city or town council or other ratify body within minutes of how\nAnybody could ever possibly I mean it's got there's no way\nI mean this is if you're an elected official or you're an appointed official you're an attorney it's been ... who's a a labor attorney here in Rhode Island who I talked to all the time about these issues guys as a guy's an expert I'm I first knew about in regards to win Steve laughing back in the day said you want to save a city first thing you do is you're hired been regarded as your labor attorney\n... knows what he's doing and was in regards to um he's going to actually represent Warwick on the issue of this this grievance that was filed with the war fire department the firefighters you an excuse me\nI'm for them stopping paying the sick time thing but the fact of the matter is if this deal which came on the Providence Journal\nIt's written down on a piece of paper was never ratified by the council and nobody knew anything about it yes what it's not real\nWell here's the crazy part about it for the reason why I'm focusing on this issue lazy Jones because\nCan't imagine has been just talked about how many other communities exist where they have collective bargaining agreements forget about firefighters what could be you know sci you or somebody else were they have all these things were going to do it this way we can uh not it's all basically almost off the books\nRight nobody in a councils ratified it nobody's every we ever get caught we're gonna have to give it back we're going to stop doing it but you know we're gonna have to go ahead and do this\nIt's a way and if it it's it's one of those things do it and get forgiven as opposed to getting permission that's what it sounds like to me\nAnd if you'd there's no way I Believe that any person in a in a a in a in a chief union position like a president of union or a chief of police or fire whoever or whoever sitting there or a lawyer like the city to listen to the city to city award doesn't know\nThat\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne as over one hundred

council if there's never got passed by counsel it's done over\nThe firefighter union if they stipulate to that unless they can show of voting if some kind or they should just drop this and move along and hope to God that nobody doesn't investigation into this if they go through this arbitration they find that this is garbage there needs to be an investigation as to\nWhether or not somebody
