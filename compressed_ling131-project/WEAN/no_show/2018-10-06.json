the a sexual assault allegations against a a Brett Kavanaugh the Senate now has the they will be able to look at it all day are just so you know how this all works a there is a room that they have to go into\nTo look at a hard copy of you know on a on a piece of paper they have to look at the hard copy\nOr they can take notes but they cannot take those notes outside of the room this is an FBI thrilled to\nAs as as they call it and uh back in two thousand nine Eric did the research on this earlier or a ... this morning and uh in two thousand nine that was the Democratic controlled Senate that came up with the protocol and this new rule that what you learn in a background check stays private\nYes it is going to be known only to the senators and and the idea is that uh I'm I'm certain that was back then but you can easily apply that to what's going on today that if a claim 'cause the FBI is not doing a criminal investigation\nI hate the fact that we have to keep saying it but I feel it's necessary so if you talk about how a background check has done for those that were in the military that had certain clearance\nA you know all too well or going into the military uh and and maybe you have a I so I Know someone who's who who had both parents were immigrants\nAnd so there was a that there was a a a special kind of background check okay we're going to look into basically a who you are as an individual and your family and everything else the point being is that they're there to vet you okay in this case they're there to vet Brett Kavanaugh\nBut it could be that uh a neighbor says something or that Brett Kavanaugh used to play hopscotch or in his underwear\nWhich we all know to be true I think we can all agree on that [laughter]\nBut [laughter]\n\nHe didn't use real chalk but the the whole idea is that someone's going to make a claim\nThe reason the FBI is part of it is because they have the resources in order and the training in order to substantiate claims when they do so on a criminal investigation they for the most part get it right\nBut they had the point being they have the resources\nThan they are going to move on to the the the majority leader

questions about the methodology and what's going on with the way the but the FiveThirtyEight dot com is putting together they're basically a composition type poll based on all the polls\nAh in all the districts\nAre for the house seats it's interesting to look at it but I'm not so sure that I buy that well as of right now it's roughly Seventy five percent chance that the Democrats take the

so but I Do wonder about again the polls they're using I'm a registered voters versus likely voters a demographics and everything else so you know all that is important when you're trying to put

Want a total nonsense judge okay we're breaking for ice cream [laughter]\nYou know in other news of this from the hill dot com this was breaking news yesterday afternoon and uh yesterday evening congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official this is from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign and\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee private law firms\nThat suffer amused by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dos da\n... cooperated man whenever we talked about the left it's always on cooperating cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow where colluding to hijack the\nPresidential election the revelation was confirmed or by testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between Perkins who we law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground about the FBI's use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive\nWe've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said\nAnother said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about FBI media contacts citing ongoing investigation\nBy the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nOn new how much the FBI and Justice Department had withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump\nAnd so that is you know breaking news because what you have there you have you had the first person from\nThe last administration the Obama administration\nThat worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon test to find the tie in we were ... there's no reason\nIf you were investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the ... lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured worn right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said they talked to they talk to ... the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why why would that be I Would that be\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure the upcoming days of the news want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to a near record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices this from Bloomberg now\nOh pets largest producer

to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nUh the key insights from blue bird their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be ... again to pressure from Trump\nNow we talked about his 'cause we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil in the war yep we beat Saudi we'd be ... every other country and somebody called up and they said well the outcome prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors involved and there's been a surveillance a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you producer on oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here\nWell and and you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you have the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact\nAlmost unbelievably good\nAt some levels well that comes from an expansion as you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations\nOnly the regulations were holding us back\nThat we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nThan I'd give I'd give credit here to President Trump yet where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me we're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we find what you were military where we're there for you all the time mhm uh and whoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil\nAnd could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia the OPEC member I deal pact member [laughter] very good deal back then the OPEC member right Saudi Arabia or to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways but we talked about when he does extremely good things we talked about the fact that no other\nThere was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrats there is no other Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um but every weld starts to be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we had said look we said this a long time ago we saw one of the reasons that we are concerned [laughter] and we're ... babies\nAre one of the original terribly terribly [laughter] you know one one of the reasons that we were concerned and said look\nEventually when disagreement comes out it's not really going to be different than the agreement that that we have now ... or ... who is leading the economist for the wall Street Journal exact same thing yet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like\nA lot like the old NAFTA mhm Mexico's only significant concession was on automobiles in parts rules requiring more production in North America highway or higher wages for workers\nAnd potential terrorists if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicles that even though there's a cap because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance they talked to judge Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower priced models now assembled by Volkswagen Mazda in a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry but\nThey're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariff will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we have said and they said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from sending an expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments are they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with\nSouth Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed right\nAnd as we subtle along are we there's been a lot of us you know industry that has

of nursing\nA well actually it's our school of education so Horace Mann Ajmi no was built a now forty nine years ago and there's not been any major renovations happenstance and so the bonds can help us modernize really the entire teaching learning experience for our students and this is particularly important for ... down in college\nRight now because over the last Eighteen months we've

Rhode Island a ... since I've been president we've never had a bond issue failed to pass usually with very good margins are were very very appreciative of the confidence that Rhode islanders having us and in higher education in general Ricks has been successful over that period of time as well and I think it represents\nThe fact that Rhode islanders no this is a good investment for them\nIs this the best way of on higher interest you know it was the infrastructure improvements that you need for higher education\nAbsolutely I think when you look at at the future of higher education if we want to be competitive with our graduates can be competitive not only in the state but in on the national stage for jobs they have to have the very best team in ... he can I can not only a professor but

get to go out and share our stories we get to talk again to Rhode islanders up and down the state across the state and every contact in every community why it matters to them that these institutions have\nThe facilities they knew what it is someone who's just finished my second year here actually I've been very impressed with Rhode Island's 'cause he ... over time I seen the value of their investment in Iran and this is why so many of these bonds past I think in this day\nIn a way you could probably say Rhode islanders feel invested in the universities because they voted for it and they they have a better understanding of what your needs\nAre I think that's exactly right they they I think Rhode islanders enjoyed being consulted they enjoy having a say and what this does is it gives them a say in the future of their public universities\nWell and had they also appreciate the return on investment so they're going to make the investment and they see these two initiatives in
