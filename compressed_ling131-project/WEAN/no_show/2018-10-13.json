right on here this wasn't just about the nomination it was the belief\nThat the Democrats\nTruly are and it really hit when he realized it was the main stream it was those in the Senate Judiciary

could even come close to it I guess in ... during the the uh the Trump presidency ah to to paralleling this was when Roy Moore last\nThey realized they need to get tax has done yeah you know they ... they weren't getting it done they weren't getting it done and it was well known within the last one and then all of a sudden right after Roy Moore's last they got it done\nWhat happened over the last

even the\n... south where it comes from that's where the motivating comes from because if you if you look at what drives the legislative process well if we were all still shouting away with Obamacare it would've been gone\nThe first several months that Trump was in office right so you know that's I I think you you point out the base of it but that's really where I was going with all of this is that the party itself which of course is driven by the rank and file so the the things that are important to get done\nThere has to be greater pressure to keep all of those on Capitol Hill and the

good point there because I when when I was giving my explanation there I wasn't even talking about the protesters you brought up the protesters and I think the unique thing that we've gotten to the

me for three eight WPRI road toll free one eight hundred three two one WPRI going to go to Don and we hope it sounded good morning you're on the big blue bug solution show\nGood morning how can I help I I\nHave a\nQuite a few very small dark colored flying dogs that looked like flying fleas income you know what they are and why we have from\nYeah they could be one of two things down and they could either be fungus that I'm coming from soil outside and um\nEarlier we talked about the leaf litter and stuff and it's been so mold and ... there's so much mold and mildew outside now because of all this rain that we've had it could be from there or from indoor house plants even they will breed in the other thing you could be as an insect called the dream fly\nAnd dream flies breed just rice said in the drains or the they think dreams in the kitchen or the or the tub bathroom drain shower dreams in in the bathroom in one way to know if if it's the truth ... if you're getting from dream flies and thinks is at night before you go to bed I'm\nMaking like a little bubble tent of masking tape or duct tape over your dreams just you you need enough so that a little bit of light can come come through but but if you put up there and you put it over all the grains and when you wake up in the morning if you pull the take back and you see flies on underneath the undecided I take you know they're coming from that drain\nYou could do the same thing yeah you do the same thing with the house plants too if if you have I don't know if you do have a lot of house plants\nAre not many I think I only have about three\nOkay if you want to know if they're coming from the house plant get a little garbage bag of trash bag and just put the ... in there for like a day if you open the bag up in this flies in there you know that's where they're coming from so so the key thing is to get to fly a Dennis ... know what type of fly it is\nWell I can still quite a few of them in the in the kitchen\nOr I thought that was the last thing that they would be the ones that\nThe dream fly right so the simple solution for that is to get a brush like the old fashioned baby bottle brushes but smaller ones that will fit down the drain and you put some detergent on whenever you normally clean\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest

dry out just a little bit\nAnd if the played have of the plants are wrapped in aluminum foil or anything take that for love dry it out and if they're on sources or anything or or dishes lift the plane up and drive that out to to make sure there's no fungus or anything underneath there that builds up\nAnd it's just microscopic as the insect is so small\nYeah All right thanks I tell her that that

issue like every year we got wise but they're the kind that have that they have like almost like a green sense to them on the back yup\nAll right so it seems like they come every summer and then they go away and then just recently when I when he picked up again they came back and I'm I'm Wondering you know since you mentioned the dream thing I'm Wondering what that are trained wise or knowing where they could become\nA great pleasure a very very tiny fly like the size of a fruit fly now your life a little bit bigger more like the size of a house why would that green tens that's usually club called a blow fly or a bottle fly and that usually means that something is either died very close by the house\nOr possibly in a chimney area or if you've had 'em any fecal material in the yard or things sometimes that's another thing that'll um\nWill do that um they do but you got to kind of find the source and if it if they come in and all of a sudden you've got a bunch of them and then the numbers slowly drop off that's usually what happens if something has died close by and once it decays and it's all through they have nothing else to feed on they go away\nRight so it sounds like something yet again\nAnd again somewhere in the house maybe like a chimney and it seems like every year the\nRight to have a chimney cap on\nNational you know that\nThat may be something you may want to consider investing in because they may not even be living in the chimney it may be a thing that what they're doing is instead of living in the ship they they just you know they they use it for a little while breed in there and then leave but some of the fecal material left behind or stuff like that creates a problem\nOkay All right All right all\nRight Jason thank you very much our phone

back a it's a wider at the shoulders of a kind of papers down to a a smaller triangular a point a town at the back but um there was crawling on the wall and I've never seen them before and I'm just wondering what the uh\nIt sounds like it's the the the traditional stink bug that starting in and maybe even the brown mama rated one that is starting to make its way here in the southern New England and it's it's a relatively new past compared to some of the other insects that have been around here\nUh started more in the northern section of around but it is slowly working its way across the state I'm a real test of trees are the good news is they don't do any damage to our home\nOr they're just a nuisance past the the one every now and then it's no big deal if you've seen them in greater numbers like I have some people called our office you know and they get forty fifty of them in their home I'm In that case\nWe need them do as contact the tree spraying service somebody with an hour is on the staff to kick them out and take a look at the trees and maybe come up with a program to treat the trees maybe not this year but starting next year for you\nOkay now you say stink bug possible I mean do they smell\nI Know if you crush it off if I\nWas on the wall and I just thought the paper towel and got crushed it yeah the favorite\nTown in one of them usually you don't give you you may not get a real bad bad odor by by the does have a slight odor to it if it looks kind of does it look kind of like a shield\nYeah so that yeah that that's what it sounds like that's sounds like the brown ... stink bug\nAnd dump it in just a nuisance past they don't cause any damage to the house they don't or anything and it was ... as long as you're not getting great numbers of them\nOkay remove them carefully and crush on that my ... okay Toni thank you very\nAh right thank you so much Joe\n... you know the the fall is the time of the year when when these we ... we refer to them and
