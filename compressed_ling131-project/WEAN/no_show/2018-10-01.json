Peters with ... financial office at one thousand chapel view in Cranston\n[laughter] Matt\nTalent show news talk Ninety nine seven of them and I am six thirty WPRI\n[laughter] I don't know if it ... or ... how do you pronounce that she got her first a flash of what we were six\nOkay [noise]\nAnd so when your friend mark judge said the same but the same thing as you're ever fade factor you he has the same way there was actually\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulence such a sixteen year about ...\nAh [noise]\nIs forcing the show sponsored by Nairobi ad Kurdish furniture mattresses create new memories today\nAt a new dynamic for dining room from ... to take advantage of up to six years interest refinancing at parties yeah the ah\nThat's a that's a heck of a thing\nBut if you don't talk about your ... your ... blurbs I'll tell you what happened mine says getting caught with one of the things that might says getting caught with Jeff and Craig\nPlay what happened buddy of mine close friend we decided it was right before Christmas Vacation I Wanna say junior year\nUm this is like we're the only people know about this I think maybe we told us\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the here for only one Ninety nine broth will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at point forward and he joined there or has it\nNot supposed to leave school early but we did we ran off into the weeds we took off from the school ran across into the woods trucks through the snow ended up at his house and we ordered some pizzas and we sat there and we're watching honest to God is not even a joke you remember the TBS a cooking show the frugal gourmet\nI don't know why we had that on but we did and the guy who is guys Jeff whatever his name was the ... was a chef later I got all kinds of trouble for other things maybe an assistant named Craig\nSo we're sitting there and we're watching the TV all of a sudden we hear noise coming from the kitchen\nAnd I don't know my buddy was like he reacted to it his mom came home he shut the TV off real quick now we're both standing in the living room\nOf his house it was like I was like a um a colonial so you walk in the side door I don't even know she knows this story\nSo she walks in and we're in this room like stare nature like ... you know black where screwed with Boston so she can't see us war in the room we got pizza boxes into good we've so he starts scooping everything up in the room and like hides it in the room and hides it like in a corner on him and he books and upstairs\nI'm sitting in his living room now standing\nThere by myself she's in the kitchen I'm like she's got to come across me in our house thinking I'm trying to Rob the place\nSo I'm freaking out my heart is racing like crazy\nSo all of a sudden I hear yeah I'm home okay and I'm like oh damage she knows where here it's all about the say you've got us which she's on the phone talking to somebody so as she's talking on the phone I was just about the answer back and it didn't and then she started talking to the phones shut up real quick\nI snuck up the stairs now this is how she's a creek like crazy so every time you step the houses creek in and everything else so yeah I think it sounds like a thousand decibels she probably sitting there going to want to select the stairs and I go into his room I jump into his closet she's hiding behind his bed\nAnd we were there for like twenty five minutes ... home at lunch break or was bringing all of a sudden we hear the door closed in the car drives off we never get nap\n\nSo and it was such that we would Fisk I mean you and you ... I mean it's like this is like in the movies when you know you you Tucker on a corner I'd be the same time somebody walks by that's how I might explain the amount explain the correct but that's how we got in that\nSo you have dopey things like that in your high school boards and the year book\nI just told the story\nSo to sit there and to try to like snoop them through to create some kind of character formation of somebody who's Seventeen years old at the time or sixteen years old at the time and then apply it to a fifty three year olds ability to be a judge is it got so absurd last week that\nThink that you know the anger that he displayed was was something that I think that a lot of people shared not because they think Brett Kavanaugh was the greatest thing in the world or even no break having a stand for is the judge but they looked at this process is so fundamentally broken\nAnd this idea that you're not ... this this this Gulf between an allegation and proof and that people if you're a supposedly the virtues signaling that goes on that you're supposed to be um in order to be a good person you're supposed to just believe anybody\nWho makes an allegation without any sort of via verifiable proof and act like it like that they just take it as gospel is crazy there's some people who believe the presumption of innocence or that things can go ... when it comes to individuals who've been victimized by something or whatever\n[noise] not to mention that would actually took place\nA could bitter permitted five different things that weren't sexual assault\nSo you know this is what's going on in America today this concept that you're only a good person that you believe anybody who makes an allegation\nAutomatically and it it it\nFlies in the face like you have Sheldon Whitehouse who's going around telling people that we have to have an investigation to get more evidence why would we do that senator when you've already said who you believe\n\nThere are tons of senators who are say I believe her\nEven though there's all sorts of holes in their case\nAnd there's all sorts of uncorroborated evidence she sounds credible quite what does that mean\nAnd I agree she sounds credible based on what we're looking for signals and body language and everything else are you kidding me there's a bunch of people who have come across as credible over the years that have been found out to be complete liars\nKavanaugh\nOne day in the future you will see sitting Dianne Feinstein see Christine Blasey Ford that's my prediction now\nTalk to one woman is going to claim that after law school he was a pimp and Mississippi\nHe was actually the inspiration that proud of a song Sheldon Whitehouse will come on me well actually it's no one allegations when it when the gate and it's going to lead to more and more dirty up his name the guy did not self any favors when you have to convince the world almost you love beer well you agree with that\nYeah I mean there's a lot of things a lot of people do that don't do them any favors a it's a you know that was the man I have no idea where the truth is\nI'm shocked by the people who know the truth because even though they haven't seen any evidence or know about anything other than what everybody else knows\nI mean that's like a truly is what's that the Democrats\nWere ... ... during the Senate Judiciary committee here is that Democrats are cheerleaders St Louis are going to get this rapist don't you worry about\nYeah and it's amazing how in in ... and it's what's amazing is that people they they have basically accepted that he is committed acts that ... that aren't even alleged like they sit there and I talk about how Christine Blasey Ford been raped by him that was the allegation\nBut they're already still walking around saying that like it's just accepted you sexually assaulted her that's the same thing is seen somebody raped her when I actually heard people say that he's a rapist it's not even been ... and I don't nobody's allege that\nNobody's allege that he's rapist nobody and I think it makes a call nobody nobody said anything they've said that he was around when the the the last uh the allegation that came from the lady who was represented\nBy ... saying that he was president when\nOther people were were uh getting drugged and raped in room and the lines of people even say that he was one of them he's never been accused of being rapists ever by anybody\nAnd so that's never been an accusation but there are people walking around saying\nThat he is because you have you know your mission creep is like meaning creep\nWhere one thing has and it's just more is never been convicted never been none of this stuff and I'm telling you right now whether he makes on the corner doesn't I have a a a good I have a I have a a strong inclination to believe that all of these things will disappear\nEspecially if he doesn't make it\nIf he does make it on the court than they may stick around a while because it may be useful and trying to pull the guy off the court but if not these\nAllegations will disappear tomorrow there has anybody filed charges or or gone to the authorities in Maryland yet with these things supposedly took place I mean I don't know I like to put rape is in prison\nThat's where they belong in the depths of hell as far\nAs I'm concerned and so if there were people who are drugging women at these prep school parties in the eighties and what people remember them and they remember this and there were there and they were salted there there should be reports made to law enforcement tomorrow\nOr today even better\nAnd lifted determine whether or not there there is no statute of limitations in this kind of thing in Maryland and that's where it happened go get them\nAnd whether it's Brett Kavanaugh mark judge or anybody else that was supposedly you know literally guilty of this kind of thing or you know then you take them out\nAnd it's not happened though\nAnd so you know you you can't ignore the context of this is you're trying to figure it all out but none of this is\nProof and so what does the burden of proof what is proof to U. P. Jason Providence Peter your W bureau\nEight teams say gee I Am sorry hard times you're right that was okay\nIt's not the first mistake and I'm On a to point out that I think you made unintentionally sure which is that you that everybody's believing her ... da da da da and going on and on let's not\nForget to be intellectually honest about this that before the hearing even took place with Dr Ford you had Orrin Hatch and others on that committee thing I Believe\nJudge Kavanaugh they were doing exactly the same thing without facts and evidence\nWas because the allegations that were made word that nobody remembered anything\nWell but they were saying we believe him before she even testified if you go back and honestly we'll have to go back and find a but I'm the oil and a half to\nSay oh no I Believe he didn't do that I Believe he didn't do this and so and then with the funny thing too is to hear Donald Trump um our new imperious leader in the the republic we have now we have discussed this giving\nHigh freer to discuss this that's clever and he was over and high praise lasers that's constantly about how the other senators aren't\nAngel now that is laughable that is why is that laughable well\nBecause somebody who is a self admitted sexual predator and has a history of adult for behavior among many other situations in that rather for laces\nArea of life yeah he has no business pointing a finger at anybody [laughter]\n... group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy hours logged onto our car buyers are tough\nWhen he never say no no no I don't know it's never said that he said these people are no angels in other words he's doing exactly why are you an angel D. J.\nO. yeah pretty much thought to do list of adult trucks\nAll right well then you're just saying even if you weren't if you pointed out other people's uh you know hypocrisy then that's not a a I mean listen I don't know what he's talking about and God Knows if he's right or not but my point is does it do you doubt any that that's not true\nWell I mean you you you have to be you have to be willing to face\nIn front of a self confessed and self evident person of known impropriety in the sexual arena of life and his going around making abroad\nEncompassing statement about people with nothing to substantiate it\nOnly have to do All right so you don't believe him 'cause you're looking for evidence\nWhile I'm looking for evidence yet or if they were you looking for evidence\nHere and when it comes to the doctor for it's when you call it whole I find it more interesting that she is able to articulate\nParticulars within the experience is describing ... and the fact that there are other areas around it touches I don't know when I went home this the other thing that to me has a ring of truth because it is basically something I've heard from other people who are experienced things that I Know how\nWell I Would say this it brings I don't know if it rings of truth but it rings of possibility because that's not uncommon to have happen yeah and that's why I\nSay this other stuff is missing that is not to be surprised\nOne oh no no I agree with you yeah but but unfortunately a winds up happening is you don't have specific and so therefore it leads to a oh no you do I mean the funding for\nThings like turning up the radio covering them out these are things that that articulate a response of Mm that sounds interesting let me look into this war where\nWhat would you ain't got they focus on the fact that she isn't saying a lot of other things that they want to hear about\nYou but if you can recognize the the intricacies of people who have been victimized you also have to recognize that there's all kinds of possibilities like um you know we've heard about this about about implanted memories about memories getting fog each the only\nProblem with that as this is already going back to two thousand two when she when she tells her husband then going back to two thousand two thousand twelve ... you know there's a whole ...\nNarratives here that leads me to take the position that it's not as he put it a well orchestrated a left wing hits job\nWell I Would tell you this I don't think that her stories and the ... we don't have any evidence to the fact that her story's a left wing or extra jobs the way that this letter she didn't want to be outed and was outed and that's a well orchestrated left when your job no no I don't know what yes we still\nHave the opportunity here that one of her friends and she should\nPerhaps be more you know selective in her come in her choice of company could have let that go because he did listen if you were following the uh the whole thing with the committee hearing yes she did mention that she was talking to people about this and there were reporters showing up in advance of this coming out at her\nRent or you could be because the letter had been leaked to them\nYet well the information had been\nA letter to the information that she sent a letter to a congresswoman and to Senator Feinstein\nAnd she discussed this with her friends which was a mistake on her part but then again who am I to judge her feelings and\nWanting to no doubt as she said reportedly in public that she felt she had to come out and tell her story so that somebody else wouldn't\nAnd that's fine I'm more than happy that I Know\nNo I understand what she her hand was forced is my point and that's where the manipulation comes from where he was forced\nOut this is the Democrats for so come on man you know they can stop it all around they started out there because they want they did it a week I'll see you only have inclusions with nothing them down you know I'm just wanting to back it up just tells this story it is it's speculation she said that it right there on the on the in the testimony\nIt ... no ... nobody is saying that they leak that\nWhy you don't always emitting it as a matter of fact Mazie Hirono was asked about that by by uh George Stephanopoulos over the weekend and she dodged the question\nI Would see no who leaked it down I ... that you're ... like they come on here so lack I ended up take who wants to be out of the court where you know here's\nYour ... in your outrage and selective and what evidence you decide

the Seattle Seahawks are trying to do something with oral Thomas\nNow here's the part that I don't get\n[noise] world Thomas is a guy who wanted a contract extension\nHe was in the final year of a deal they paid him a half million dollars of salary not cap accounting salaried money a point five million dollars\nAnd the guy decided not show up now mind you unlikely beyond bell or Thomas was a first round pick he was number fourteen overall in two thousand and ten\nAnd it leads to this point\nOver the course of his NFL career Earl Thomas has made almost fifty six million dollars\nSo his first contract was good not great he got a decent bonus money in two thousand ten\nAnd then restructured bonus money where he ended up getting you get the bonus money that's cash in hand on the day you side\nHe was not a second round pick like lady on bell and it just has grown what his first contract was like as a second round pick your pay your playing for a Nicole's on the dollar being a second round pick\nWorld Thomas decides to come back and you heard that quote right there and we played for you it was too much money at stake and I decided to come back\nAnd they're all Thomas plays the game and he gets hurt and apparently he's broken his leg and he's done for the year and well being carted off he flips off his own sideline mhm\nWhat's the point of that I mean I I\nGuess why I went through all this rigmarole and all of this case there is a nap money ... million is guaranteed\nYes he's on a A R and I understand that as a guy who's approaching age thirty he does what a lot of guys are approaching age thirty dude who can still play a little bit\nThey want to try to get a contract extension because they know whenever you know whatever your name is in certain name here Tama thirty or higher the NFL starts to look at you differently\nWhether you deserve it or not the only guy who's been able to fight that\nHe's maybe Tom Brady and quarterback so the only guys at that position\nTo where you can get them to treat you as if you should be treated but it doesn't matter how old you are it's are you a good player\nWhen you filled rivers came available on free agency even though it was thirty eight years old somebody would still given twenty five million dollars a year because the guy's a winner and he can play but it would be a cold day in hell you saw a safety uh thirty seven years old get paid top line money\nSo I give them a little Thomas's coming from but he made the decision to come in and it was eight and a half million which isn't chump change Roach who's the flipping off on the sideline\nFlipping off the system on the sidelines which his team and his employer having to be a part of I I fear eyes and wondered aloud last week rash\nWhether or not levy on bell was setting himself up to be a Curt Flood type figure and for those not familiar Curt Flood had his name attached to the case that eventually got uh the contract situation and major league baseball overturned to the point where free agency\nBe can't came into existence there was no free agency\nBefore Curt Flood a and Marvin what's his name Marvin Miller Marvin Miller thank you very much the hall of famer or soon to be hall of famer Marvin Miller he is in the hall yeah took a took a case to court a course flood was long gone and in tending bar in my Yorker that's a whole other story right there that you can find on HBO\nBut I was wondering if bell was setting himself up like flood to be some sort of labor pioneer\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again for the board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... times\nThese players are fed up with the system and that's why when people bring up and I think you're wrong about eight and a half million dollars and a half million dollars is a lot of money\nBut the fact remains that no matter how much money a player in the NFL is making its is fairly obvious at least to me that that union and more importantly that league that leaves rather I should say treats its players like crap and has the union over a barrel and I think that's the general complaint you're seeing from these players right now and Earl Thomas levy on bell chief among them\nWell and it's interesting because the the situations between the two are are very different like Earl Thomas's made some money or Thomas willingly came back leave me on bell has had one big ... year oh big bucks\nYeah I just think the grass that what it is is that all of the players view any contracts strife now\nWhen they're not able to get an extended or when they view it as a team owes me and they're not paying me they're viewing all of those situations in the same boat now rightly or wrongly I'm just saying that while I'm with you the levy on bell and they're autonomous situation then they're not apples to apples at all they both find themselves in a position where\nThey believed that their team at the very least in good faith and at the very best\nOr just the marketplace and capitalism at large but they should be getting more money and that they should be getting new deals and so again I Know it's not apples to apples but for them it is because it's contracts contracts contracts and they realized\nThat if they want to get the contract situation in the league James they can't depend on their union that's for sure so they're gonna have to go out and try to make these changes on their own that's why I think you're just seeing the camaraderie amongst them up in that regard\nThomas is done by the way\nYeah I I'm not talking about Don as him because he broke his leg if this guy thinks anybody is going to pay him big box he's just delusional and and that's where\nThe book do the players give it a raw deal in the NFL yep\nI've come up with that if ... if players get caught with say forty million dollars left on their contract or percentages that should count against the team's captain cutting them so it forces them to write contracts that are real\nThe players can actually get the money for 'cause look at it and say how can I felt bad for lady on bell\nThe Steelers told them told him they love him so much they're willing to pay him fourteen point five four four million dollars for one year\nBut therein lies the rub look what happened to her old Thomas now real Thomas is a thirty year old guy who is gotten his big pay days relative to his position that's another issue roots that we have in the game that NFL players as much as I think they're getting a raw deal they're not being realistic\nIn that you know as a ... a second\nBaseman in baseball is never going to make the same kind of money as a starting pitcher\nSafeties in football or somebody's got to break through like when talk of girly just got his contract done with the rams\nPeople said well that's a running back breaking through and pushing the bar because other people looked at this and the league and said wait a minute they'll just making this for one year because the Steelers mismanaged situation\nAnd then you had to running backs they keep pushing the total higher and higher because they're back in vogue and in value once again I think every defense appointed looks at it and says I should make twenty million dollars a year because that's where quarterbacks make or that\nWould um eventually a guy like colonial Mac is going to make or that sort of better makes for a for the better well you know whatever your these guys are look at it and think well I'm a great defensive player so therefore I should get higher than anybody else in my position\nWe're just not seeing porters being more vocal about it look\nI've told this story before\nI talked to Jonathan craft and looked him in the eye as he said we will never make any player on the New England patriots the highest paid player and they said position he's he always said that and then you know how they you know they split the baby on that one\nThey made Vince will for the highest paid nose tackle\nBut that's not a position defined by the NFL if you look at the franchise tag it's based on defensive tackle\nSo they're saying he we we", "show_name": "no_show", "year":
