like video or whatnot and then it drops out and then it comes back and the drops out and it's an annoying way to watch something however it does work and I just kind of apply the same thing\nHere it's like when you hit the button on your cable remote back in the day to get maybe those scrambled channels that didn't\nFall I don't know about that stuff but I've heard hell I had a great\nA TV as a kid

room\nAnd I plug that thing in there you could you could turn the dial the John drugs to get the old scrambled channels in there and the first time you saw a hoot or you thought it was the greatest day your life\nExactly All right let's get to some generalities are those who are we getting in trouble before I get a job I'm not going to get in trouble I'm no no no you're right you're just you're so the over under\nCzar out in the NBA and ah there are only a couple of teams that are fifty and higher\nIcy five teams I owe ... sixty sixty six teams at fifty or higher I'm One of those of course is the Boston Celtics\nUh but we start with the top teen moms\nRhode Island's number one for dealer is setting the standard again and again for the board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like flood autos top\nNotch rode the Westgate knowing it with the west gate or west gate current but then the Golden State warriors at sixty two last year they won fifty eight games and I got to tell you\nI'm not vibe in them it's sixty two now absolutely no there you know now that doesn't mean they're not capable by the way and that's the danger and making that bad is that if all of a sudden they get locked in and say well we want to try to send your regular season record they have the ability to go you know to lose under ten games this year I'll\nSee here is the key grass to basically all of the teams that are pegged above fifty wins which would be the jazz the Sixers raptors rockets Celtics in warriors\nIf there is no competition for the number one seed and those respective conferences it's going to be mighty tough\nFor those teams to hit their respective numbers because\nThey'll all be thrown on the brakes and rest and guys so that's another thing you have to worry about in terms that sixty two wins if Houston's pushing Golden State but that number one seed or anybody is pushing Golden State but that number one seed I could see them getting sixty two wins I can see them getting Seventy wins I mean they're they're crazy talented team that's only gonna get better you would think\nWhen both your cousins joins the fray but if there was a competition for that number one seed I think it's a very small chance they end up with that\n... that's an interesting theory because I I think and even the the way that they've got the over under set up a they they got the Celtics winning the east and David at least got the raptors in terms of an over under three games better\nAnd then there comes the Seventy Sixers and then you get another eastern conference team until Milwaukee and they're over under forty eight and a half right\nNow right exactly so the third team in the east would be finished in like eleven games behind the so\nYou're in a U.S in ... in the situation is there you go but so we're\nLargely sorry the Thirteen would be filled so they would still be though five and a half games\nBy so we're both vibe in under sixty two for gold and say yeah under sixty two on the Celtics at fifty nine I think it's an over because I think they're going to win sixty two games this year\nWell there you go then I if you think that I Would take the over that number is a little too sticky for me I probably wouldn't touch with all\nThe wrong kids at fifty six and a half of the standing Carmelo ... uh last year they won sixty five games are that's not happening I Would agree on that um\nYeah I Know I take a again it's a sticky I'm with you I think the Houston is gonna win between\nFifty five and six games but I'm not confident enough to take over fifty\nSo I Would feel good going to the pay window and taking the over on the Celtics are the rockets would be stay away the raptors that fifty six wins there stay away only because of this reason\nI don't know how ... Leonard is going to blend in Toronto and if he's going to be their best player then there's I got to have some certainty\nThat the guy is going to be there and he's going to be engaged and then he is going to want to play basketball for them and I just don't think I I just don't think\nThey're going to win that many games but I I got to stay away on that one then you have the Philadelphia is usually Philadelphia Seventy Sixers at fifty three and a half\nAnd uh last year the Seventy Sixers one fifty two\nI could see Philadelphia being over fifty three and a half but not by much it's a dicey number but if I had to take it I Would go over and if I'm staying away from the rockets and I'm staying away from Toronto I got to jump on one of them and uh those fifty when teams I'd rather go with the Seventy Sixers than Utah Jazz right now\nI'm going to looking at this list right here I Know we're kind of been a little bit of a time crunch but I like the Indiana Pacers at forty eight wins I'm One of the guys who's been high on that team since about halfway through last year I Know they just ... miles turn into some new money I think they're a team on the ... which is why forty eight\nYou know I mean could they get to a fifty fifty two wins I think that's a distinct possibility because they're a team on the rise\nPatrol depot demand is a bonus et cetera et cetera\nHow are people not hammering the Lakers on the over at forty eight\nYeah why am I missing your golden to look at all the western conference teams ahead of them on that list you got Golden State Houston Utah Oklahoma City in Denver are all ahead of them so for them to get those wins this was in Cleveland in the east anymore it's going to be tougher for LeBron to get those when I'm not saying the Lakers aren't going to be good\nBut I'll abroad and what did they call those guys again that acronym became whatever it's him in a clown car full of do out there so\nFifty ones would be pretty good I think I mean come playoff time they'll be better than what the regular season record probably was simply because they have LeBron James but I don't think they're any sort of lock to win fifty five game\nKnow I'm looking at that roster and friends of the veil muggy while but you got a I mean Lance\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nGot a deal is not going to help you win forty nine games well when Stevenson regime ... veil muggy ... ...

I I think it's ... through factory right it's also I Would add extremely counterproductive I mean bearing on urban shop he was a charmer whereas these people the van Vassar and Sweden is just the public nuisance and the the people who are up in arms\nAre there there was that moment last week I puzzles about it but now I see it has a name broken\nPottery yeah where Beijing ordered the secretary of state of the United states Mike Pompeo to Beijing from young and he arrived and I I I we talked about Gordon Lane Wang in foreign minister\nKeep your costs down using non hospital lab like east side political ... get the same accurate\nTesting results without big hospital\nCost control your health care expenses even if your doctor is a hospital\nEmployee you still have the freedom to choose whichever lab you would like as long as that lab is participating provider for your insurance plan in Rhode Island and east science political except small insurance is he's sides clinical has been bringing relief to Rhode islanders for over sixty years 'cause you'd like more\nInformation about the benefits of independent lab services\nAnswers to other questions tends to find a convenient he's science political lab location visits lab choice dot org that's laboratories dot org [noise] take control of your pocket health care expenses and visits lab choice dot org you wouldn't\nPut a square peg in a round hole so why would you deploy a traditional firewall in modern decentralized network\nFire walls have new requirements for businesses leveraging fast paced applications and public lot platforms like a double us Asher and Google Cloud\nWe're in the cloud generation now so you're fire walls have to be engineered to fit right in reclaim your clock network trying barracuda ... generation network or application fireball free at barracuda dot com slash fire walls\nYou know our Jimmy Johnson even nine grain wheat some as the perfect amount of grain freak yeah it does any lesson to be green lacking\nAnymore to be a noxious ... it's just so confident I mean it says um high quality I'm substantial I'm flavorful but I don't have to prove myself to anyone this mine green weed scientists practically an inspirational poster I Want to possess the character's death of this nine grain we set\nYou guys talking about being that nine greatly southern again\nTry our new nine Greene reached out to me ... bachelor show [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI'm John ... with Gordon Chang the Daily Beast North Korea\nWe welcome our colleague\nGregory Scott ... the executive director of the committee for human rights and North Korea riding most recently in the wall street\nJournal about the diplomacy the gap between the president of South Korea Moon Jae in\nAnd the undistinguished dictator of the failed state of North Korea ... ah and the question here I Greg ... asks in his op ed and I'll ask him to help us understand it can you imagine Greg what it looks like for president ...\nTo move from a man who is obese and an ... to a an undistinguished dictator\nWho is learning over human\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new border states we're just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nIn North Korea in the imaginary future of reuniting the peninsula good evening to [noise]\nGood evening to you John and Gordon a that would be a very serious Chris of the imagination president Moon Jae in of South Korea as had three so I'm at meetings with Kim Jong un the sheer human rights was not raised once ... once\nI'm moreover we all remember that um while a president Moon Jae in was chief of staff to the late ... than normal here on a he was the one who consulted with the north Koreans and advised that South Korea should abstain on a\nU.N General assembly resolution on North Korean human rights condemning North Korea as human rights record so up presumably this is Don in order to appease the north Koreans in order to\nPress ahead with the so called national re constantly ... process\nBut the question that I ... I Would like to ask is I'm at ... at what point\nDoes appeasement at what point does neglecting North Korea's crimes against humanity\nTurn into endorsement of the egregious human rights violations being perpetrated in North Korea pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the state\nSo Gregg we could put that question perhaps in a different way you know people point out as you've just mentioned that to Moon Jae in a was a human rights lawyer and that's how he came to prominence um many people say well you know it's a course ironic now that is not raising the issue of human rights\nSo maybe the question is was he never a human rights lawyer all along that he was just using that to um basically gain power in the south\nTo pose a people who he um didn't like the military leaders and actually that he was very much in favor of North Korea and the first place that he was like his senior advisors now\nI'm very much sympathizers for North Korea\nWe don't know the answer the question we don't know what's the moon's head but the point is he may not be naive he may be complicit all along in North Korea is human rights violations\nOr he has certainly I'm invested tremendously in this process of engaging the north Koreans the south Korean economy's not doing too well\nThe unemployment rate among young uh college graduates is high and still on the ice remember that there were important part of president Moon Jae in support base so he's basically laying 'em most of his bed so all of his bets on this inter Korean rapper Sean process\nWell we'll see a human rights lawyer yes and he was famous for having defended some um democracy activists who are basically working against the military dictatorship\nUp until the late Nineteen eighties uh of course she was a a lawyer on several Robin ... says that involved a mark says said Marxist material course\nThe time um that type of materials bad so uh actually being a human rights lawyer in South Korea does not necessarily imply that ah that that one would be that equally active on North Korea Kim writes but then again\nBeing a human rights lawyer by formation a president Moon Jae in does understand the gravity of crimes against\nHumanity and ... go ahead\nPlease you in on that point let's talk about Amanda's letter I'm Amanda ... as a human rights lawyer she wrote a letter in the chosen ... the south Korean newspaper um tell our audience what amended asked of Moon Jae ... oh go ahead Gregory\nAmanda ... widow as my colleague she's our human rights attorney or a chart gate human rights attorney currently based thing so uh there was a terrific letters you published in the ... the very basic question that she asks from a human rights lawyer\nTo another human rights lawyer she tells him look I have witnessed\nUm I have a atrocities myself elsewhere in the world we both understand uh basically way\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are\nGoing to see your administration getting serious about the the the the human rights violations being perpetrated in the north\nIt's a good question so let me come back to moon does he have a plan to your knowledge to transition from this uh generosity that he's demonstrating towards a man who has no capability as a as a as a transparent leader of people\nThat is a contaminant just did do is there any significant body of literature that says that moon is going to move to another phase when ... when North Korea's engaged\nA well of course this is the argument that engages will make that engagement will bring about exposure to the outside world and implicitly\n'em a chance to improve the human rights record of North Korea but on the other hand if South Korea focuses on infrastructure projects tours of the projects\nEnergy projects pipelines do not talk to people Powell lives to not talk to people tourism projects can be tightly contained with few if any social side effects so we saw on the ... it projects that will help\nThe people of North Korea so far I have not seen any sign\nThat the moon Jae in administration actually has a North Korea human rights policy I haven't seen any encouraging well eight eight when encouraging statement and I would be very very very cautiously optimistic that statement by that\nSouth Korea and permanent representative to the United nations who said something along the lines that South Korea is an active participant in the drafting of the U.N General assembly a resolution on North Korean human rights now in ...\nWill have to leave it there Gregory scar lotto of the committee for human rights Gordon in North Korea Gordon Chang on John ... [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nYou know them from the Trump do two guys who don't mind getting dirty first talk now you can listen to my colleagues including national\nLet's go to another issue where we might disagree okay and that is supply chains there's a lot of people out there Allen who say look you know the supply chains are stuck in China it will never ever change agree or disagree\nWait I Want to crowd in with the economist conventional wisdom from lousy economy ... oh gosh ... guys it's my job in life to read the economist I've got a report what I used to be John I enjoy it a great deal I had an alternative life as an English public school boy okay that's where I Am fine alright\nThis is written from the point of view of understanding\nThe queen okay fine the argument is that the supply chain in electronics specifically electronics is deeply in China deeply engaged in China because China was there it's it's a miracle happened ... with the explosion of\nCommercial and retail electronics for consumers and therefore\nIt is not credible at this point at this point they're cagey about this at this point to replace John however there is migration underway\nTo Vietnam and Indonesia those are the two countries the economists mentioned and that going forward as the supply chain altered you know devices are getting smaller we're getting rid of chords are getting more mobile devices and less of the desktop so they\nAre the tablets and other electronics bigger ... the big box servers become little Biddy boxer as\nIt is possible that China can be augmented with other countries but not yeah\nKnow John that's not an unreasonable view but the point I think the economists tends to gloss over\nIs that you know first of all there are the terrorists that Trump is putting on and it's making life miserable for manufacturing and trying to but you know the more important story is that the jumping the Chinese ruler is making life miserable for foreign companies in China and I think what he's doing for various geopolitical instead he has\nHis making China an unreliable member of the global supply chain so companies\nFor that reason alone are gonna lessen their um exposure to China's geopolitical risks\nAnd therefore as they can move their supply chain um vulnerabilities and get out\nHow would you like motor joins twenty a gene trunk of the year for only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to forge twenty four to one fifty best run for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only add one forward and he joined the Oregon\nOh lord almighty ... let me fall off my chair for a moment in your leadership valid and they've got to this\nThank you so much um let me just make two quick points first of all what what free trade extremists uh publications like the economist ignore constantly is the fact that national governments much smaller and less powerful then the the the U.S government jerk around\nMultinational supply chains all the time in countries like Malaysia and Singapore and Thailand are constantly imposing conditions on inbound foreign investment that for all of this talk the multinationals rule the world the company's\nAlways wind wind up complying with so if Malaysia can do this certainly the United states can and secondly there's a great deal of that reshoring ... or I should say of\n... of shifting production outside China that's either already taking place or that's being contemplated because these companies know that we're only at the very beginning of Trump's China trade policies and they want to be prepared and PS\nThey are not panicking and all they have have repeatedly said that you know weight of course rather not do this won't be the easiest thing in the world but we think that within several years we can shift a lot of electronics in information\nTechnology hardware production outside China to other low wage countries I oh by the way that that includes Mexico because that would really help this country's southern neighbor which which\nDesperately needs it and what and would by extension help the United states tremendously and I think that that that is far from implausible\nFar on Gordon apple and apple most\nApple can move but it's going to be extremely painful because apple um hasn't stuff manufactured by Foxconn Foxconn of course is deeply embedded in China but we got to remember John Allen that socks on once was in Taiwan I moved\nTo China yes the economist reminds all of us that many of the factories were talking about in China are owned by the Taiwanese or Taiwanese investors have created them in addition that means that whatever we regard as the difficulties of portability has happened already\nAnd it's gonna it's gonna they can move again and also the other thing when you talk about automation and robots\nThat makes it a lot easier to move because that limit does not eliminate but it's certainly reduces substantially China's labor costs advantage because a robot in the U.S as we've discussed on this show before is just about the same cost is a robot in China\nAnd in fact the economists did make one good point and that is that\nThat as electronics products become more sophisticated of for the reasons that that Gordon mentioned because of their production is so highly automated there is no more China cost advantage and Foxconn in fact this in the process\nOf making a very considerable investment in advance electronics production in Wisconsin so we could very well have the\nResult that China still winds up making the vast majority of the world's walk them in perhaps but the more advanced office increasingly made\nOut of my life that that's a that's a severe use of walkman I was thinking about you know the everything you need to know about pac man is in China okay one more detailed ... one more detail or concern here that I've had for some time\nThere's a new song from Wall way and I've seen it advertised in the United states what the heck is going on why are we allowing that to happen in the United states\nWell thanks in large part to the massive transfer of advanced technology by us telecommunications companies to China Huawei has become a global leader in the latest generation of that telecommunications\nTechnology which is called five gee um and and certainly wall where he wants to be a big player in this you what\nYou were when you when you we don't allow packs of cigarettes for thirty cents on the street in Manhattan I Would say well why don't we allowing a wall way phone in our borders for that he was poisoned well\nYou're absolutely right and it's weird also because the U.S government and the intelligence community has already label called way as a threat to US\nGuards in his news to people I mean I saw the phone being advertised the latest from Wall way is that there is no privacy worthwhile way it can last\nLong ... yeah I don't think it'll last look I mean not only does one way but also the ... the Chinese we're\nAnd why it's the People's Liberation army\nWhat auto group was your car any make any model flood pays more than any dealer around because

right\nNow I'm at your ... is a great guy he's telling you what what has to tell you know it's not what people want to hear what I Would suggest is\nFirst of all find out the conditions are those guys were at least they have to be very specific they have to be very very confined\nWell he just he just mentioned that you can't go within three hundred we just played in the three hundred yard but I Will and\nAll right so now you know all that I Would I Do private detective for that group get some money together yes that's that you know the police are there to protect all this other stuff if you are watching this guy twenty four hours a day like any other animal like any other creditor gonna do anything\nBest to let him under sort of a the police and a private investigator get on with his life is going to violate those conditions\nThat's just right and that's the way it is unfortunately I don't see any of the way to catch this\n... unfortunately violating you you hope it's the three hundred foot condition and not and not and not stealing a child condition\nAbsolutely and that is a sad statement that that's where we are yeah\nIf you hire people and they're keeping an eye out of the police are not going to watch them twenty four hours a day this is gonna be a short term thing and then those poor people and they were going to be on there they're going to do the best they can yeah but I mean two guys twenty four hours a day is a lot of money and let's face facts that's what this was about\nWell I mean there's only so much yeah I mean there's also [noise] ... not\nKnowing what's going on in in in in in staffing to to lay people's fears of something that may or may not happen you know no it's it's one of those things and uh well let's put it this way I can imagine

WPRI email me and Dan is six three O W appear to come there was a question last night at this brown forum that I attended as to what's the most exciting what's the most important race\nUm I Will tell you that most likely the most important racist the speakers ration something there's something really strange is is going on right now [noise]\nI don't know if you saw the online edition of the journal today or was this in the paper I read the paper version I don't remember which but the this is this just on line so far in probably hit the paper tomorrow when\nThe journal read something on line in the mid day when it gets posted at one twelve in the afternoon generally is on the paper the next day uh I don't know who's reading what when it comes to the journal but two groups team up to defeat alright house speaker Nicholas met a yellow\nOr by Kathy great to advocacy groups that have bumped head toward the Democratic house speaker Nick Mary Elle over pay equity legislation abortion rights gun bills and the state statute of limitations on sexual abuse of children ... have joined forces to try to defeat him in\nHis home district and Cranston where he faces Republicans deep fry us this\nIs fascinating listen to this the Rhode Island national organization for women and the Rhode Island coalition against gun violence filed noticed with the Rhode Island board of elections on Wednesday that they've together put more than five thousand dollars into a new campaign spending group called citizens for corruption free Rhode Island\nI mean that's hilarious I mean good thought but come on man every dollar donated\nSo far has gone to a printing project or for direct mail pieces a press release explaining the joint effort said quote the groups believe the Cranston voters are fed up with their current representation and his loyalty to big campaign donors in high paid lobbyists that results in\nThe constant interference from passing legislation that would benefit the majority of Rhode islanders\nRhode islanders are ... tired of reading about corruption at the state house should the former state representative Linda Finn uh\nUh she CEO from the joint effort in President the Rhode Island coalition against gun violence and can you\nWe gave her call a little while ago\nAnd what's fascinating about this\nIs that they're trying to convince you\nIf you're a voter in district Fifteen\n\nThat a vote for Steve fry as is going to advance the causes that they're ... they're they're tagging on Nick ... chest in other words I had to tell you the stuff that they're picking\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln and Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nLeague going to agree with Nick met a yellow and most of the stuff that they're complaining about Nick Matty yellow over\nSo know that this this money that's coming this money that's coming in not big money but the influence five thousand dollars can ... you know serious mailers right\nThe money that's coming into the district race right now is about the big picture and who's going to run that state house\nAnd the irony of Rhode Island politics because there's always plenty of it\nBecause we're a lopsided one party state but there's all sorts of nuances that are involved in delineating between who's wearing who is what\nThe progressive movement is is looking to get rid of Nick Matty yellow and they sold their souls\nTo do so by trying to convince Cranston voters that he's wrong on issues that the opponents of ... probably agrees with ... on this you follow me\nIf I'm On me\nSo now I'm now I'm hyper targeting the audience in district Fifteen in Cranston I don't I don't expect to generate phone traffic at any length\nFrom district Fifteen and Cranston I mean we've got you know the five hundred districts between every state they're listening to the show [laughter] that would signal but this is the stuff that's fascinating about Rhode Island politics and about election day\nAnd that is this little teeny district in this little race have so much to do with the way this whole places run\nAnd what will be fascinating to me is whether the voters and Cranston in that district are going to I'm going to the sea to this idea that fry is is better on these issues that these people are complaining about\nWhen there's probably no differentiation between the candidates on this there's a lack of intellectual honesty going on with this effort is my point now they're they're they're they're\nPicking at Matty yellow for some for for not you know standing up enough on the meat to stuff he ran that sexual harassment seminar with his nose I'm sure held a ended a couple of other things in in in in his spokesperson Patty Doyle and it's only in Rhode Island Patty ... oil is a spokesperson\nThis is gross Patty ... is the spokesperson for ... yellow and she's also the lead spokesperson for the number one revenue driver in the state the state budget that twin river\nI got in Oklahoma they're working for a living but the incest Jewish this east either the either the talent pool for spokespeople on a political level in this state is so thin or nobody knows right from wrong conflict of interest or whatever\nUnder no circumstances should the agents who speaks on behalf of the number number one non taxable revenue driver to this state where they're supposed to be some healthy friction between ... and government under no circumstances should speaker of the house be sharing the spokesperson\nFor this one for the same spokesperson bet is dealing with twin river I got no problem with twin river I'm just saying by nature and how you lay it out you just don't do that\nBut nobody in the state knows right from wrong if any hit them and the dog on head\nSo I'm just kind of laying some of the stream of conscience out for you are in terms of what's going on in this state wide elections today you get all that for three eight zero Tom you're under the\nPR oh hello you're saying good afternoon my you're actually focused on the very thing I wanted to talk to me the people at the\nOf the ticket or or it's all going to be about Trump blue wave it coming you know a girl had a chance you

daily a former a news reporter of of great acclaim most recently for years I Would just news has dial the program Shaun how are you I'm well how are you very well you've covered this story\nI did and it's interesting that Richard gardener now is doing again infamously now what he did anonymously way back in Nineteen eighty nine all the way back then it gets from way back\nBlood Lincoln is southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTC and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of never against it ...\nOver a reign of terror and I'm not exaggerating that was what was playing out in these neighborhoods a it was a particular neighborhood in Warwick\nAnd I think it expanded even a little bit beyond that were kids who are getting snatched from open windows during a heat wave in the middle of the night it was literally your mother your mother or your father's worst nightmare\nOf parents just complete disaster scenario was playing out where this guy turned out to be Richard Gardner and at least one case I forget what happened to\nSeveral of the others that were sprinkled throughout this summer of just craziness and now it's just interesting here we are in two thousand Eighteen coming in from Nineteen eighty nine and Richard Gardner is at the center of it again and now we know it's Richard gardener before\nUh we didn't know who it was and they were it was just a crazy time where we gotta catch this guy they caught him and and now here we are\nSo he ... he sure according to the paper he was he was convicted a on three boys stories which are you telling me that it could have been more\nOh I didn't know what I haven't even read on the uh you know I didn't even this has all off the top of my head I didn't even go back and re read any of the ... the current stuff I was at three in the end I couldn't remember if it was more the richer guard I was playing it safe when I just said what I said excuse me Michael ... was the kid that\nI particularly remember remember because his mother was a woman named\n... and she was she and I just did well together and she\nDid all the interviews that I ever could have water or you know about who could have kidnapped her son you know and I only remember that one as a one hundred percent matter that he was convicted up well I Know you're adding to the detail that there are two more I'm only speaking about the one I Am saying\nThey are their license you since you put his name was it was you did was he found okay was you\nKnow Michael stakes in fact has since died it was he was not found okay it he had I think some mental illness is I remember I'm not a hundred percent on that but it was\nBefore before or after ... after the kidnapping know what's\nA legitimate concern in aggregate every paper that heater Iraq\nSo badly for so long but then it came out like during it every night at ... pm we invite everyone from all over it if they get kind of kick you out that in New York that I Know about is twenty four seven it is in fact this detector is outside of this house\nNow and we'll keep that up until we have to uh [noise] or [noise] or we resolve the matter\nTo him it was actually before the election\n[noise] alright five thirty nine here on the day in your show the telephone number is four three eight zero toll free one eight hundred three two one WPRI this part of the broadcast sponsored by Providence auto body the first and only facility in Rhode Island the mask certified to repair the all new aluminum Cadillac CPS plenty to say this about this story\nWhich is of that of a among Richard\nGardner who's now living in the Washington park neighborhood neighborhood for Providence and and and the neighbors are up in arms um the guys here just did a quick now that we've heard a little bit more about this a quick Google Search or we came up with the Providence Journal repeat story\nFrom the Patriot ledger or October Fifteen twenty sixteen this is a nightmare\nAn absolute nightmare by the way I Sean daily who gave us some color on this thing mentioned Jeff pine I just want to clarify ... was the attorney general who prosecuted this case\nUh back in the day in eighty nine ah but the uh it's a nightmare\nAnd he originally was looking at two hundred years\nWith this combined convictions and I'm not going to go into all the gory details here but between Massachusetts in Rhode Island some\nYou know bureaucratic justice system mistakes uh occurred which have been a attributed by the Plymouth county district attorney a Timothy cruise as a human error\nThat actually caused him to be free or back in twenty six\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nPolitic state park ...\nState park at the time of the story he was living in ... and then move to a homeless shelter in Boston a timely with historian October twenty sixteen so now he finds himself in in Washington park and people are lining up all over the place outside his home trying to shut them out of the neighborhood\nSo obviously this is a dilemma for the authorities and look this is everybody's worst nightmare you know my my thing\nAnd this has been we need legislation to these kinds of events it's he throws the key away\nConviction\nI mean if you look at the nightmare of this guy and what he did it take to throw the key awake conviction\nInstead what we have is this this thing where and by the way she didn't have to identify himself to the neighborhood\nOr via the website because this all happened prior to Megan slump and so he's grandfathered into all he had to do is notify the Providence beliefs which was supposed to keep a confidential but there's a leak from the province police that cause the neighborhood to go nuts last night\nUnderstandably\nThis this is this is kind of stuff that drives people crazy that there's I don't know at least a Scorpio the activists Jews a neighborhood activists whose voice you heard until you may have heard the conversation with\nLast half hour or asserts that there is some five hundred sex offenders in the city to look up all so it's probably true um\n[noise] did just it's just I I don't understand the ... approach and I don't understand this approach throw the key way because the ... after that there is no good solutions anywhere anyhow\nAnd now you probably have some kind of civil rights argument they would be how would you like to be the ACLU lawyer whoever's going to be that's going to come to this guy's defense holding your nose about who he is but talking about constitutional protections\nSo anyway having said that we've got a mayor who\nDecided to make it you know polling audible last night showed up at this event a ... a gallon who is the correct WPRI dot com reporter was on television for with me tonight for the show talking about a bunch of Providence is used in your state of mind seven thirty and my right to be in ... and Dan and I were talking about this is\nOnly a couple of minutes but he explained what happened last night fire way he does\nNot belong in our city he does not belong in our [noise]\nSo that's mayor lowers the last night running into a community meeting where people were nuts and then and then and then went to the street and went to the address of this guy who just moved in who preceded making his law who only had two privately notify the police department that he was moving in as a\nFormer convicted sex offender I'm somebody liberty and the police department told the neighborhood person that he was living there and now as we speak another plan for this evening to shout him out of there and a lures is leading the band and\nActually saying there'll be twenty four seven monitoring of the guy where's that in the budget\nYeah I don't know where it is in the budget and I've asked them they're still calculating what it will cost and that was a spur of the moment mayor showdown rockets crowd if I'm going to tell everyone I don't know if he would say if a mayoral race kind of thing where if it's just\nThe mayor and a lot of adrenaline in a hot room and decided to say something about that was not a plan statement last night I can say for sure [noise] he just pinned that responsibility on the police department as he sat next to major would pay and who I could probably feel a blood\nBoy when I looked at as I looked at his face look Peyton was more or less uh [noise] okay\nNow they'll figure it out they'll find a way to put someone in the neighborhood and they'll have him drive around them safe community policing and it won't be the end of the world I'm sure what\nAt what point and believe me this is why the magazine last thing in in in the whole thing I mean my my view is been through the key way with this kind of this kind of a fence throw the key way [noise]\nBut this is what drives people to drink this is why negatives laws you know levels one two and three I mean the housing values go to a heck of people end up seeing shrinks a does panic and sewing and then the notion God Forbid there is a civil liberties issue involved here you're going to even if\nYou got a trail this guy and surveilled this guy with no cause\nI Would venture to guess I don't think that's constitutional do I was my exact question I was in a city council meeting last night and then just watching on Twitter and that was my question is this legal there's something that you can actually do um I I Would venture to guess the ACLU will at some point way\nHow would you like motor trends twenty gene truck of

flood forward in eastern enjoy Narragansett\nHe portrays this journalistically is a loss of pulling this rabbit out of his hats\nThere was no preliminary planning there was no there's no discussion

I mean imagine\nA forgiving God\nGod Bless Justin currently under on that one you know what I mean it's a good guy a one eight hundred three to one to be P R O four three nine seven seven six well Dr Elias from WWE an expert first\nWell and that's what I Do man I'd find a way to give you the truth whether you like it or not there's absolutely things out there that I could say and do and come Monday night or something in store\nWell good and I'll tell you what if you if David Price stinks tonight for the red Sox that'll be an easy one\nAnd deflate gate low hanging fruit so I [laughter] I Know you can always go there so I Want to ask you did you always have the ability to play the guitar like how did that get incorporated into your character\nYes so since I was a young teenager either playing or just the gift that my dad gave me at one point\nAnd then over the years I kind of developed over my my\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again for Boeing has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nWrote my guitar and and I sat there and I told a story that dusty roads ... played by a guitar from that point on he said you know what that is something special let's keep that going uh and it's been there ever since\n... you'd do a dusty roads imitation\nNo I I I wouldn't disrespected by doing a bad one so I Can't do it\nI got ya so he just didn't look here and just do the whole or maybe you need to be playing the guitar in the ring\n[laughter] that that's pretty decent right there but yeah but it was along those lines a little more heartfelt though\nHow was it being around big dust before he passed away I've heard from so many guys down there next T that he was really the star maker he saw things in people that they didn't see in themselves how the dusty roads impact your early career under the WWE umbrella\nMan I mean you said it right there he had the ability to pull something special out of almost anyone even when they were unaware of it and uh you know I kind of pride myself in a way and maybe it's selfish that kind of feel like I was his last\nA protege or last guy that he really believed in before he passed away because I just broke it in to annex the at the time and he was he was a big supporter of the drift or a big supporter of allies prefer\nA wise from WWE with me here on the ground show on WNPR on Monday Night it's Monday Night Rob the Dunkin' Donuts center enemy bang doubt the northeast there's always treated WWE very well and ally so I Want to ask you about your past to annex\nTea and then WWE of being called up to the main roster\nYou know I Know you did a bunch of stuff in the northeast and you're in the in these for a while just kinda you know for people who don't know why you know whether you're a good guy or a bad guy there's a lot of work to get the WWE it ain't easy what was your path to getting to the big show\nNo right it's not man it's it's the hardest thing to uh to break through and then to break through it and at the end the breakthrough in WWE Raw it's just a constant fight a constant battle and that was a man from the time I started wrestling\nAround the time I was Twenty years old I have one goal in mind that was to get to WWE and I tried and failed multiple times\nUh but eventually guys like William Regal dusty road trip all age they took notice\nA and now you better believe that them and and the rest of the world understand the WWE stand for a walk with allies\nAbsolutely alliance will be here on the ground showing WPRI oh did you work in New England in the Andes why did you do chaotic or any of the places up here in Boston and I know the indie scene is really exploded here recently but did you do trips to New England before you went to WWE\nNo I don't think I ever made my way up there I remember I stayed in kind of the tri state area occasionally ventured outside of that but it was like Pittsburgh New York Ohio Virginia you know things like that\nYou didn't wrestle in West Virginia did you talk about a toilet\nHonestly you know what I'm not happy proud of it but yes I did\nOh my goodness you remember where by Beckley or somewhere like that\nI think it was outside we're\nAll the wheel another place that you need to visit one night a year for crying out loud so as you know how\nTo work on your skills on the road in terms of your music but you sit in the back of a car driving somebody nuts playing the guitar or are you just so good at it that you know Fifteen minutes that right I got what I'm doing here we go I can go in the middle of the ring\nYeah I mean that's it's kind of a\nYou know a little bit of everything that I I don't really I don't have it in the vehicle with me as I'm traveling town to town but every building I go to his got my guitar or a fender guitar ready for me and ah you know what I'll show up to the building I started playing whatever I feel like playing until I finally found I Want to play that night\nUh and then that's it man what does it go time it's time to play and and I've been playing for Fifteen Years or so I feel like I got it so\nNow I talked to a WWE superstar carmela a while back and I asked this question and I want to ask you do you know what town you are in right now yes or no\nYes yes I Am aware of right\nDo you know your loop this weekend yes or no\nAh I Am aware of where I'm going to moral [laughter]\nI Know that I I end up in Providence somewhere in between I'm not too sure\nAll right now and the reason I asked that is not the bus balls but to make people realize just exactly what your wife is white\nLooking for a car credit not break well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east British Janeiro against have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent NPR for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log on to what Tom\nThey're like I I Know where I start and I know where I end and how I get there I really don't know because it really is day to day WWE is not\nAll that's the truth man and I tell you what if you ask me where I was last week the week before the week before that I couldn't even start to come up with a list man I can take guesses but uh\nIt's just it's like that man said at the different cities every single night a lot of airplane ride a lot of time on the road it's definitely a you know you got to be built for it that's for sure\nNow I and and now for far wrestling fans out there they will laugh at this and for those who don't follow wrestling they won't get it you can ... be on this if you want to alliance but who do you ride up and down the road with\nA you know if they don't get it they don't get it and I worried about a man but uh that's the thing is I hang out with the Bible quite a bit a those are some good God I'm not sure the world knows that yet but they will eventually are so minimal revival we stick together\nHey how much of that and that's the product and the environment that they have you in like now you're in a different city every night for crying out loud and then it's the it's a little different\nHow much is that almost like\nA college atmosphere like if you were on a football team or a college basketball team where everybody gets together everybody is traveling it's very different than what you get whenever you get the raw or smack\nDown can you have just sort of give a little background and explain what it's like to be around all over the other future super stars that are in an ex tea and the bond you guys trying to make down there\nYeah well the differences whereas like we're on the road now with with raw I'll be with the robot specifically but I was with everyone when I'm In the cars you know you've got to go to the performance then are you there every single day grind in and out with everybody else\nAnd then you do do some traveling there are road shows that if he goes on the road here and there\nAnd they're traveling a bit but as far as calling it maybe college or in many ways that is absolutely true because Monday Night raw is where you want to be smackdown is where do you want to be because that is your your wrote to wrestle mania and that's where I Believe everybody wants to end up\n... where do you see your character going over the next year or so\nAh so the character will become a wherever my wife follows man because it's very true to my real life so\nIt depends what the opportunities are that come my way the situation that come my way but as far as I'm concerned I Would just be doing bigger more grand performances showing more of my talent and sooner or later I'll be getting a championship title a one way or not a one way or another I say\nUh whether you know the people like that or not it it's bound to happen and uh and and that's it man so that the character if you want to call it that my soul will of all just like everything has\nOkay so now I got to ask you because I'm a sports guy you make a lot of sports references\nDo you have is there a team out there that has your heart or your football guy you're basketball guy is there a team and then a lie is secretly in a room by himself will do like a little fist pump whenever they do well\nLet let me tell you something that I follow everything closely not just sports but absolutely sports and cars I see something that almost everybody can relate to but\nEven if there was a team that by myself secretly in a room I saw this bump too I Would never let the world know that\n... I like that because that because that would block the character from being able to crack on at least one or two teams out there and like you understand\nWow and you don't want that heat either you know what I mean like all of a sudden I'll find some wine shows up from a football team and its survival and Kevin Oh ones aren't with the euro ...\nGod me going to have to own a car like Jeff Jarrett and you know the next thing you know it's just costing you a bunch of money well Elias I'd appreciate the time and thank you very much this was a a this was a good chat\nZip recruiter smartest way to hire\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood what born in east British it never gets that have the best financed reason unbeatable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nThey're changing colors and with forty percent off my not change our to\nExperts are waiting with colors like how to market and following me [noise]\nAlso receive special type thing on ... interior paint starting I guess twenty nine fifty nine and\nYour neighbor had ... million store October Nineteen for the twenty second faith retail sales on like\nCalled carjacking ac and heating AT T three Ninety four hundred for the ultimate indoor comfort this winter\nSomebody a NFL and we should be from the New England truck solution studio this is the station you count on for news traffic whether we can do is talk Ninety nine seven AM six thirty W.

O. why the heck is that line minus two\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like flood autos\nMinus two and a half of the ... I think the sharpest might be waiting that's one theory they've already how they've already pounced once when I got to three they pounced and battered it back down to a two and a half\nI I don't know I think the patriots win like fourteen points in the scale when I was asked and I usually do my own horn I usually very good at predicting lines when people come that Israel what are your line is going to be because I just I follow that stuff obsessively so I don't know that that I'm pretty worthless but you\nDo that to be joking around ... Wyatt ... your arbitrarily ripping on the good folks of Beckley West Virginia Beckley sock well have you ever been there\nI have not not probably not to my knowledge I don't think so well what sort of state of mind would you be and did not know that you were in Beckley West Virginia well ah as a youngster crashed my family traveled across the country in a minivan twice so I was nine\nAnd eleven years old when that happened so I could have easily now can you see I'm Out of the ... and in Beckley West Virginia and not remember listening to your walkman maps or would have been the music of Nineteen Ninety five\nThat you would have been listening to a Ninety to the first time around ... we had some green day I Do believe a act tongue baby the eye you two album I think was bigger sets or CDs\nOoh I probably Ninety two probably a lot of cassettes and then the next trip by we moved on to you know impact is I just found a walkman the other day because the person that is true if three political encouraging about [noise]\nUh but it had the true in her in the old cassette deal and oh yeah no but it just it\nWas it for anybody who's like Parenthood children you you know that there are times where when they get into a snake or you say somebody they don't like it will be like um\nWere you pick that up please I can and don't and and like Kevin's looking Kevin our intern how old are you Twenty one point one they probably did that last while I was just laughing because he probably did that not too long ago\nAs you know who does that is someone who just recently learned the difference between ... and may and All right well may well I don't know yeah the ... to do it are you out to be if I Want to put some other country in the neck\nWas white and kids do it whenever they get like in a snack or they get upset with you David Price sounds like all the time is it he's a child\nWho is upset at someone that's why I made that reference because he's a grown man with kids with his own he's got dog she's got he's made by the way for me to go nuts over our boy\nHe may not be able to get the same kind of a money and is now trying to drive three hours south\nIt'd be miserable here he'll still get twenty million years somewhere and oh by the way he's made a hundred Ninety three million dollars\nSo we really hates it here he can pass on to do and not worry about it it's not going to change his life but will make changes as being in a place to make them miserable and that his boss\nThe unions are going to like that is passing on that extra money\nAnd you know what David Price will tell them just like he has told all of us right he done it to us he started to everybody here he's done it to the handicapped Johnny Miller so we really think that they're probably going to go you know what I'm gonna do wrong to everybody else but um\nYeah I'm actually listening to the union he's going to be like oh no no there you go\nThat is David Price in a nutshell in fact route you know what he'll be the one guy he'll be the area tight\nWho ... who will say to the union well you know I'm above it all and you guys just watch I'm going to turn around and get a six year deal that's not going to upset the market and for the most part he'll probably be right\nBut if David Price wants to take the step forward of not being called fingers taint Goldman\nAnd he wants to take a step forward of actually becoming a big boy in a big boy picture that go out and pitch with some balls tonight but I don't want to walk in tomorrow and have the big boss when I go pop in and she says three well you're right about David Price middle of the third inning they pulled him because he started to think\nThat my expectation I Hope I'm wrong I Know I'm not going to be that's one of these deals where if I knew I could take it to the bank if I could go if we had sports gaming\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and there were against it of the best financed reason unbeatable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto job\nTwo fifty on the third inning I may not get great odds throughout the years yeah\nThat'd be the favorite 'cause that's what this guy does and the kid I Want to be excited tonight I Want to believe they have a chance and if they're three deep in the bullpen by the fifth inning they're not going to win this price has to give them something\nThe kid just get yanked out of their early yet my expectation is is that that is exactly what's going to happen and it just ... you know again that David all used to do is say well we really haven't but I they know my veil ability and the decision has been made yet\nInstead it's passive aggressive typical David prize bull crap\nWhere it's cheaper to mystery or show smarter than you\nKnow which don't\nDo well most said the word dopey that do
