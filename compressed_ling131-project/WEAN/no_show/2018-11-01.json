R. E. S. H. so on Sunday night the patriots are going to get a very interesting test\nAnd the Green Bay Packers uh we all know Aaron Rodgers is the quarterback of the Packers because the only thing that and get ready for it NBC is just going to open our collective goal which show Brady and Rogers write down our throats he's still Danica Patrick\nAll yeah\nAll right I'm sure she'll feature prominently as well into the uh chronicling of the times of London Aaron Rodgers has now that she's not a racing NASCAR anymore you know NBC definitely does have that\nSort of skin in the game so to speak that you know if she is that Joe at stadium that um that they would\nProbably show her if they could uh get a camera shot of it I don't ... the NASCAR not if Danica Patrick where they are she'd be they they ... she probably unable to restraining order you know at some point in my life trying to hunker down and get a picture or something like that\nMy wife is kinda funny she wants the meat and see all these people but then she gets some of them like five feet of them and then just freeze but I think for Danica Patrick she probably rural right up there and that and say something to her but yeah in fact Aaron Rodgers roots and the other day\nUh they are strongly attracted to each other ...\nWhich means at some point if there's a cell phone hacked there could be a lawsuit because a video could be made who knows but anyway Aaron Rodgers has a hell of a football player I think we know that and I think we know that\nI'm for those that are in the moment if you say give me one quarter back right now to win the big game um there's really only two it's pretty much brain Ian Rogers I think people would go to\nIt was well you're building a team for five years who do you pick\nI think people would go Aaron Rodgers if it's I Need to win one Super Bowl I Need one game to when I got two weeks or prepare or I think you're taking Tom Brady ... they're the best of the best\nAnd ah earlier today Bill Bill ... of course these people get in front of ballot checking in the spirit of the whole oh Brady and Rogers deal\nI'm Bill bell check was asked they you know to fully worded question in terms of a jolt against the Brady and Rogers and of course you know\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition it bought bought any religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices love onto flood auto John job now\nIs because he can just jab step towards a down lime and then get into route excuse me get a free release and breathe he's putting it on him in stride and wrong is able to go do his thing\nYeah and and one of those things Gretchen I don't have ... target numbers necessarily in front of me I can bring him up where it's not really important because I think is going to fit right into the narrative anyway or compare maybe the targets of a guy like ... Jones but to the Jimmy grand point\nThose target numbers are so large that that kind of leads to what I was talking about because if teams were really afraid of Jimmy Graham back then in terms of afraid of him controlling the game Drew Brees wouldn't have been able to throw it to him a hundred and forty four times because of all the double teams all the coverage being rolled his way\nThere would have used them much more as a decoy and in the past and game and those target numbers again\nIt sounds almost like um dumping on Jimmy ... he's very talented player worth the money is getting its cetera and he's had a very fine career but in comparing him to a drunk\nLike again if you were able to do you think groggy targeting a hundred and forty four times now and the patrons don't have any wide receivers usually I mean more or less in terms of that guy that's true here to New Orleans right give their only one thing got out of the woodwork whether it's a Michael Thomas now or\nOr why might mark east coast and like they bring in guys are always reload and down there and and Drew Brees so you figure you had to throw the ball to Graham a hundred and forty four times\nIt was it ... it was he wanted to and could why couldn't because seems just weren't all that afraid of Jimmy Graham like they are ... of rock rock ... and in\nTerms of targets to the point rich or the the lowest of the triple digit number of years of targets for Jimmy Graham was one twenty four ... the most wrong kids had in his career is one thirty one and that was the two thousand fourteen season\nThere you go when they were leaning on him they have all the ... right exactly so and yeah like that that doesn't surprise me I Would have guessed maybe ... numbers were a little bit lower but again you're taking the low versus the high yes and uh so yeah that that kinda fits with what I was in a book\nAnd the weird and then the thing that's weird about growing this year is that he hasn't gotten in the end zone but I bet you I Would bet your dollars to do that I Would bet a hairy buffet spread\n... by the end of the year ... seven touchdown catch unless he gets hurt which none of us can really foresee want to hear to three to one of the BP R O four three nine seven seven six on the Twitter at the real grass G.

Gurley is eleven to five odd basically two to one yep\nSo for every eleven dollars you bet you went and fought ... [noise]\nUh Drew Brees is next at eight to one he was a couple of weeks ago five to one on the rivers and Aaron Rodgers are in next at Fifteen to one\nRivers is pretty flat and a Aaron Rogers was tend to one just about a week ago\nYeah but he was also one of the law in about three weeks ago and he's been going up\nAnd down Rogers bobbing up and down the MVP out there and then there is are more than football savior Thomas Edwards Brady\nAnd Carson wins yeah Brady adds up a week ago twelve to one odds he is now at Eighteen to one ... Carson when has gone from sixty six to ... to Eighteen to one\nRich what do you make of that was that someone coming in and ... I Would have to think a bunch I mean there's\nJust watch this guys go back let's go back a month on cars and went to IU on the third he was twenty five to one on the tenth he was thirty three to one on the seventeenth he was back to twenty five to on on the twenty fourth you went to sixty six so on\nAnd now he's Eighteen to an all I have to say is or whomever plop down that big bad at sixty six to one got some great value the rest of us grew\nA Jared golf has gone from a week ago being seven to one odds yeah he was seven to one six to one for two one five to one and now twenty to one yeah no value there uh and then after that it's a guy's you weren't going to win Cam Newton Kirk causing\nSee there you go gosh I Would argue that and I don't care Nunes not going to win the MVP that's one thing though I I I Am trying to teach the betting public as we venture ended his legalized sports all yeah baby and I don't know I can virtually guarantee that can do is not going to win the ... the NFL's most valuable player award however\nThat value that he presents at thirty to one right now may be too good to pass up because\nThose are just fantastic odds for a guy who basically is his team all due respect to Christian McCaffrey and they're deep and no one on defense is going to win the MB pay and this is such a ... century league look no further than the fact that Carson freaking when's who's often is incredibly inept or he just as a team that won and tied with Tom\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what for Denise religion there were against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto John job now\nNewt and only has to win most valuable player once every twenty nine times for that to be a bet worth making and do I see an up scenarios where Cam Newton has a three percent chance or better to win MBP\nYeah I Do but it's probably closer to zero but that's what you got to look at the value you can't be completely as I broken record it gave me a results oriented when it comes to the value because on these thirty to one these twenty five to one shots you can lose twenty of them in a row and I'm not saying just go waste your money be willy nilly\nInch [noise] [noise] what are these fifty six\nInches tall ...\nNot because five feet would be a sixty so\nThe the Bronx that rocky ... button\nMess yes and he said he had a button last week I hear that one more time\nAt is open to interpretation of the rough rocky but mass but now now\nNow hit a button that says oh okay I Know sort of macular situation well you know we have to ask these hard hitting questions here on the ground showed up here we do um for those of you who know I'm a bit of a pro wrestling fan\nAnd a sort of in this I guess political\nTime that we're in right now with you know elections coming up and again we'll get a good riddance oriole race going on here and stayed Rhode Island and all that well now I'm the WWE it publicly traded American Company\nOr where by the way the stock has in the last six months gone through the roof\nOr when they did those deals with a Fox\nAnd renewing for Monday in Iran USA and their TV deals around the world basically WWE in terms of cash is making around seven hundred million a year on TV deals both domestic and abroad and there are getting\nI Want to say they're up to like two and a half million subscribers on the WWE Network their digital service and that's at nine Ninety nine a month so just do the math\nBetween the WWE Network in their TV deals they're they're they're doing a billion dollars a year just on that [noise] let alone live events and they recently entered into an arrangement\nWith ah some of these princes in Saudi Arabia who have a ton of money and they love eighties nineties wrestling so WWE enters into a deal in Saudi Arabia and they had one show already be greatest royal rumble\nAnd you know they took some heat for it and none of the\nUh none of the female super stars of the WWE can perform on any of those shows are because it is still a part of the world that is a ... they're starting to see the era of their ways when it comes to women but\nThere are a long long way away\nFrom treating women the way we do here in America and even [laughter]\nHell look at a ... yellow and his group of people surrounding him and what's going on in the state of we're a long way away from getting a right here but we're held a lot closer and those people so the WWE is doing another super show in Saudi Arabia\nWhere they're getting paid a handsome amount of money a handsome amount of money to bring over their superstars and to\nOn a show now mind you when they go do this in Saudi Arabia they have to build in\nA Fifteen minute intermission\nSo that ah the people of Saudi Arabia can stop and pray but so they had to fly over friend of the show Jim Ross and others to fill this like Fifteen minute intermission where do you see people in the background of the show that they're doing they're like praying\nHow would you like motor trends twenty gene trucks with the here for only one I mean I Will say hello to port boards twenty eighty four to one fifty obsessed with the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars from us only a plug for it and he went into a narrative it\nBecause a are taken a big hit because\nOf the recent killing of the journalists over there whose name I'm not even going to disrespect and try to pronounce to showcase your show you that that word I think that's right and and you know more and more details have come out about that Saudi consulate\nTo wear a this guy was basically strangled and caught up ah and right now there is a big American backlash against the Saudis and their government\nAnd Vince McMahon in the WWE or like ... or sensitive to it but that's a big check and two of there are more famous performers\nJohn Siena local guy and Daniel Brian have refused\nTo go work on the show so on television they wrote those guys out of this big Saudi show\nAnd they replaced it with whatever they did\nBut they apparently WWE has said to their performers if you're uncomfortable and going you do not have to go now the females the last time they went to Saudi Arabia got what would've been the normal taught\nThen all of the different wrestlers would get on different scales for going over and performing on the show and in fact the WWE\nOr the last time out they broke out some of the stars of the the nineties and that attitude Arab nearly two thousands because that's what these Saudi princes want like they grew up watching Hogan and stone cold in the undertaker and all that\nYeah this is it's much easier in my opinion to look at this as when a rich person invites a singer to perform at their wedding or their child's birthday party or something because that's really what this is ... it's not so much\nThat the Saudi public as clamoring for wrestling they may be but this is more these guys and their untold billions of dollars yeah and they're like you know what a I'd really like to see some wrestling right now oh you know what we don't have that channel you know what I'm going to call Vince McMahon and he's going to bring the whole operation over here\nAnd they'll do it in my living room and that'll be fantastic and and what they've done to is they've essentially\nFor lack of a better way of putting it they've bought the WWE to be\nA bit of a propaganda arm like I watched all the WWE Network a that greatest royal rumble and they talked about how ah the Saudis are now letting women drive and I write like how ... right now\nI mean we're only a couple of years from driverless cars and you have the you know what will give them the right to drive now by the way no more driving for anyone in about five years but you know get that have a ball here five years they fungi stick shift is it's it's a lot of fun\nYou know and when Brady went over to cut her um you know when he's involved in best buddies and I told the story before\nThat they have a lot of people over and cut her who are handicap\nBecause the people with all the money\nAgain for a lack of better way of putting it just keeps ... with each other so they're cousins and brothers and sisters and all that stuff that are producing children\nThey're developmentally disabled because they don't want any of the money to get out of the circle that it's already in which just an insane way of thinking well the WWE is kind of position is as well\nWe want to be a part of their change to the point where\nWWE just had a monumental first time ever pay per view over the weekend it's called evolution and it was a about it was on an all women's\nWWE pay per view extravaganza they sold out an arena and it was just the women and they're going to go to a place so they can't take any of the women they wouldn't really be a part of knocking down barriers there\nAnd maybe that is something that the WWE is building up to I don't know but basically the way the WWE is positioning it is hey they're changing were part of that change we're happy to be over there\nAnd oh by the way uh we did a hundred million dollar deal with them on a ten year situation to where they're going to pass a ton of money to go over there like twice a year and do these super shows yeah that's it\nYeah that that's what it is and you're right in terms of\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit letter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nLike that it's a slow your role there on that one you just happen to be in the country at the same time but they happen to be tossing females of bone for like the first time in five thousand years or whatever it is uh just because like that just\nIt's easier for you know it helps the pallet in terms of your taking this money which a lot of people are going to be was dirty money and you're like yeah yeah you know what but but here is out here\nWe didn't make anybody come in and did you know they're letting women drive over there and write the freaking renaissance in the middle east and I've been Smith man and a part of it and in leading the Saudis into a new brave\nNew world in a place of equality and you know what that's all that's great lip service NPR but yes it's a very large check that is helping them forget about the things that they do not like about the region that is Saudi Arabia\nNow just quickly I did a Google Search and this is for what it's worth and it's from one of these guys named Dave melts or who does these wrestling dirt sheets and whatnot like I said that like there's Fifteen guys named Dave ... mall but they're one of the ... but there are a lot of people out there who have the wrestling dirt cheap right\nDollar Amazon dot com gift cards as your first payment is made on time to check your loan options had to get their special radio off

Gordon Chang of the Daily Beast [noise]\nIn summer there was a front page piece in the New York times about a report\nThat up to one million weaker as those are the turkey peoples\nOf shin John province in China each Turk establish a separate republic conquered by the Maoists in the late Nineteen forties up to one million leakers or worship for Muslims have been detained\nIn ... in concentration camps one million one million\nThe Chinese authorities the ... the ... is that Xi Jinping and his gang denied just live straight up not happening you you've been misinformed well that change\nThey no longer do not they're what they're saying is worse so we're going to Nouri Terkel former president of the week or American Association to help us understand what the latest from the PR see about there\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like flood out over time\nThe reporting is accurate you have been with us for many years talking about the persecution of the week goes by the Chinese authorities the bullies who claim that the weaker is attacked them with nine so they gunned down five or ten or Fifteen people and execute the survivors immediately\nThat was that this is now what is the latest explanations for us to one million people detained against their will\nOr good evening John thank you for having me on your show gang or the the Chinese government has been\nA trying to come up as a a a Congress strategy to a quote unquote trying to explain to the world why do they have to uh uh engaged and twenty first century and not the style catching fishing camps\nSo uh and the un are handled a call them out in August\nThe Chinese government has a big trying so hard\nAnd the different ways uh through their own publications and PRP again the trails to\nA one normalize quote unquote and then to legalize their um mass detention and criminalization of the week of people based on their ethnicity and religious practices now let's look at the Chinese government's motive which the narrative is pretty clear\nAh their actions have been widely reported\nA so let's look at their a load of their number one motive for the Chinese government or in other words unstated goal is to achieve the China Dream that belt and road initiative\nAs I'm Robert Kaplan pointed out in his an essay on the wall Street Journal the east took his time there's a big chunk of land that can either make the Chinese allowed the Chinese to get access to your Asia or block the your agent access\nSo the Chinese government one or two completely eh eh eh took control over not only the territory of the properties of the week with people but also the live because of the uh the livelihood\nIncluding the other tricky people and then the to the Chinese government wanted to avoid a by you know their self fulfilling prophecy that they have created that um the rigors at the ... national identity eventually will be a potential for them\nSo it it's it is truly a fantasy that they have a a a have been reactive through a brutal policies and then the third\nThe Chinese government has been very racist or this whole thing as a racist character\nThe reason that uh we believe and and this has been said by a a a China scholars we're experts that no government or in the twenty first century it was called somebody's ethnic ideology as the or as a a a cancerous tumor\nAnd no government around the world called Islam as a mental disease\nAnd also the Chinese government are\nHaving trouble to understand that their way of life to hunt Chinese people way of life\nTheir culture the language they called ah the truck sprints in life is not something universal and and they shouldn't be a imposed on people like Tibet than some of the week or\nSo often times the Chinese government um ... tried to tell the world that this was all about security social stability\nBut you don't walk up forty eight a well known academics\nSoccer player religious figures business leaders\nFlying through a pest musicians are under the claim that you're fighting against ... three evil forces it does it you know it makes no sense at all so the Chinese government said this was about security but when you carefully examine their policies there'd be have years uh it it clearly suggest\nThat this is all about your gym thing this is all about Communist Party this is all about China has struggled to dominate the world and this is all about imposing Chinese language Chinese culture by force if you don't accept will take you out and\nIn addition to what we have been covered some heartbreaking heart wrenching stories have been told recently a scholar based in Seattle wrote a if a published and as long\nSay a investigative report on foreign policy in China file that basically suggests that one million out one million in one million up means the Chinese government locked up a certain age group ninth or the individuals born in Nineteen eighty and Ninety\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nRooms those dining tables where Chinese cut right All right well they're coming into the week like so it is it is it is a dreadful situation that we're like spirit that we go home town\nWe ... a town see like a ghost town the day we could businesses have been or have been bankrupt because the owners have locked up\nSo that narrative is clear it is time for action garden thank God that the United states government has been very outspoken Trump station 'cause they're outspoken and they had some congressional leaders such as Marco Rubio Chris ... already be in the process that interview thing at legislation\nThat I wanted to I Want a ... I'm going to enter here Gordon is is this story challenge used to challenge Xi Jinping routinely\nWell no unfortunately not inside China but that's just not possible but outside China yes of course it is because this is a crime against humanity and something's got to be done about it the officials who are responsible for this need to be sanctioned and that includes ... himself\nSo winch CGI Xi Jinping or his lieutenant show up at international bodies to talk about global warming or some other utopian version of their reality they they can be challenged by a the United states and its allies\nAbsolutely especially those who are in the chain of command in these camps all the way up to ...\n... the former president of the week or American Association he speaks very carefully up the facts about persecution that is right now the major story for China the major story Gordon Chang of the Daily Beast I'm John ...\nTo ...\nOr to or\n[noise] if you need a passport photo head over to the place where they say cheese all day long the camera works on hope street in Providence\nThere's that dynamic here that it's not being measured by these polls just like we saw in twenty six to\nEight months connect the numbers to nursery blows in Memphis below the\nInfamous now for having said the jobs the tax cut in jobs that twenty Seventeen was problems we have breaking news this is to respond them is below sea this is Eric morass in the wall Street Journal or within hours\nAmerican paychecks rose in the past year at the fastest rate in more than a decade showing a tight labor market is paying dividends for more workers' wages and salaries paid to private sector us workers rose three point one percent from a year earlier in the third quarter Labor Department said on once he took\nThat was the strongest your over your game since the second quarter of two thousand and eight\nThe latest data add to this is a quote broader evidence that wage growth has continued trend gradually higher over recent corners Monica that's exactly what we've been waiting for to guarantee that\nThe Democrats were wrong to vote against the tax code and Mrs ... wrong to say it's crumbs it's the fastest rise in a decade\nEverybody knows is Monica the puzzle is the ... stronger the job opportunities you can leave your job and get a better job\nDoes that give them the poll you think it does so do I but these political scientists are telling us it's not it's a non starter because the Democrats so villain ours Donald Trump people are going to forget why their money in their pocket\n[noise] yeah I I think that analysis is incorrect that people are saying you know are so angry I mean certainly there is a segment of the population that has ... trumpet hates gods and are motivated to vote for Democrats simply out of that [noise]\nI also wish that the Republicans that made the economic messaging more front and center\nGoing into next Tuesday they haven't made some candidates have slipped by and large that national hold the Republicans haven't done that and it's it's been a source of great frustration for me but I also think that the American people a lot smarter\nThan than depressed give them credit for they do see they're stronger paychecks they see the wage growth they see their job opportunities I think they see greater prosperity in every direction a stronger economy and international position for the country\nHow would you like ... twenty or gene trucks will be here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty four to one fifty so that's the best price anywhere you one hundred and Ninety nine dollars from a only a port board and he's run into and there were jammed but\nThat that is true and as far as vilify Donald Trump I think we're in a whip around situation where they have done it so often and for so long that people are now tuned it out and they're likely to react in the opposite direction\nThe production by Nancy Pelosi is that she will be the speaker of the house again she guaranteed said on the Tonight Show I also stars they on the Tonight Show without laughing that what we need is a leader who doesn't divide us to bring us together she sent this without laughing however political science says that there is merit to Mrs pillows these prediction\nThat the house swings to Nancy Pelosi if that happens Monica the worst case scenario is that the house is still made they promised investigation\nThat guaranteed investigation subpoena power in all directions do you believe those investigations will sway the American people to a turning against the man they voted in the end of the into office\nNo in fact I think it will have the exact opposite effect the way the Republican investigations into Bill Clinton in the Nineteen nineties had the opposite effect\nOn people rally around the president even one is polarizing is this one he is still the president to the United states Bill Clinton same thing and the other thing that the two presidents have in common is a strong economy\nSo they were presiding they both are presiding over big strong economy whether it was in the Nineteen nineties or today and a strong economy a knock elites presidents from a lot of nonsense a lot of investigations and a lot of ... because people are willing to overlook that when things are good for them and their families\nSo I think you know if we get a Democratic House in my view this will be terrible we will have paralysis but I also think that Donald Trump is never as good as he is what he's got a foil\nNo better foil for Donald Trump that Nancy Pelosi a Democratic House which is over reaching every day with impeachment investigations\nAnd the rest so it was likely if that were to happen Trump runs against them for the next two years get reelected and flip to the house back\nThe Senate or the Senate is looking very favorable for the Republicans it's a good map out possible pickup up too but I Want to concentrate in New Jersey you're a Jersey Girl motor\nA Robert Menendez is a deeply troubled candidate a we know about the investigations uh we also know that the uh papers in New Jersey have acknowledge that there is married to those investigations and are recommending in a blue state that people hold their nose and vote for him and then\nI'm told that late in the game the national Democrats panic a little bit because they saw him and then does his numbers were weak and they poured three million dollars them to elect him what is your sense Monica will will the liberals of New Jersey vote for a man who has such a such baggage\n[noise] you know I grew up in New Jersey John I loved the Garden State and my mother is still there almost every day she calls me screaming about Sen Menendez [laughter] I'd have a tradition that he may God Forbid get reelected New Jersey has long been\nI think and I'm not alone in this assessment that most corrupt state in the union the
