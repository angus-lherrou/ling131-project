basketball prospects\nAs a part of a newly formed professional ... starting in the summer of two thousand nine team the G League will offer quote unquote select contracts\nWorth one hundred and twenty five thousand dollars to elite prospects who are at least Eighteen years old but not yet eligible for the NBA draft so to give you an example of that is I on William ... who went to Duke\nOlds ion would have been able to bypass Duke go to the G League collect a hundred and twenty five gr for the year then go make millions of dollars in the NBA\nI'm\nNow look you're also going to be doing this if you take this route you're also going to be\nPlaying in uh Portland Maine and a mutt\nJusto California Beckley West Virginia Beckley West Virginia yeah damn straight\nHigh hat and North Carolina but in all seriousness you're going to be in a lot of different outpost to where you're really going to earn your way and look\nYou can get your hundred and twenty five grand you can wait out your year you can get professional coaching and you don't have to go to school and you'd be a pro so you wouldn't be able to get the benefits there in that are given to professional athletes\nUh me\nTrying to think this is going to be a big deal yeah I think it's going to be the the fact that it's going to be limited\nLike the fact that you see the word elite in quotes a leads me to believe that there aren't gonna be a ton of these contracts to go around now particularly in the early going\nBut if they can make it so that there are\nA lot of these contracts available I I don't do a lot of people crash off at US News\nAnd the number one I reaction number one reaction I've been getting it is pretty funny uh people are like well they make five hundred thousand if they went to Duke or Kentucky would pay them\nTwo hundred and fifty now this this is a hundred and twenty five people grossly grossly overestimate how much money is being given to the college basketball players and that's not me being a college basketball hog\nAnd say oh there's nothing to find here in this in this federal investigators yeah on a David\n... apparently a bill self himself told Adidas to pay a player\nYeah exactly and that's still probably not going to change anything except from the vantage point of the shoe companies might have to pay some a wire fraud dot charge there but either way water for exactly it's not even a as well but if you want to get into that the the companies are arguing a what we were doing is an illegal like there's a whole\nHoward Hughes when he was running hunger it's where he's like hey I Want to make a law where you can't pay airline executives all around the block and they're not wrong quite honest right and wrong the coaches in the ... of away but that hasn't happened to my point I'm a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars is make no mistake about it is a lot\nRhode Island's number one for dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... times\nThe players that are being Greece to to go to division one colleges they're not getting much more than that if they're getting more than that at all so I think there's a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars especially they have enough of these contracts to go around will be very enticing and saying it's a problem for the NC double a\nIs a bit of a stretch just because they have such a good model built in and again it's a terrible model but it is a successful model though I go from that standpoint\nThat they'll still be All right and they'll still get enough elite talent and you know they'll make their own elite talent and maybe they'll have to go back to doing it with three and four year starters but they'll make it happen but I I'm a big fan of this I like guys getting paid and I would love to see another we developed a as a pipeline to the NBA\n... explosives and asked them why one of those positions those things are important and so a lot has been dominant for six weeks I'm One of the best

the lead to content strategist at the M him to be here on the ground show on WNPR oh get burnt a follow on Twitter at\nAlbert rear as his push for five hundred thousand has been done well you got to get the four fifty first scene far off I'm In your um you know in the notes column this week you had\nA the NFL and the players\nFigured out a way to calm down in some controversy and apparently they figured this out bird in August what can you tell us as to how they should have made that is you kind of go away for right\nNow well yeah yeah I don't know why that really mad when they came up with caulk and maybe a half measure strategy or policy of letting every game every individual if they make us all policy and fame that players should stand and\nUm you know from there or you know the office when it first came to actually\nFile the policies of the week the media got all of it and all hell broke loose and then you know they push the button and everything and reopen negotiation and falling meetings and the media and what they just thought it was\nThe best thing to go back to the old policy and just act like nothing happened and so you know they basically were ... they go she Asians are still going on\nAnd they spend a lot of single I see what happened\nAnd you know what happened was nothing and now you know I think that the all of us that\nThat before that if you're if you're doing nothing if you've gotten out of there are so few guys and yelling at that point\nThat it would probably just go away or right and so I agree that this month St Louis why they didn't make any sort of big announcement about telling a sort of agreement they just quietly agreed to leave that alone and leave the policy to lay it had been the last few years\nAnd they help to take care of itself in it and it seems like it hasn't been a couple of interesting points that one um they share with each other some data analytics where basically\nSaid that it was a trauma comments that were causing a problem for them it was one owners reacted the tramp Trump comments that was always causing a problem for them but it's sort of resolved the Trump started night they want to keep your mouth shut 'em you know and then then the other piece of that I think is\nYou know there are still they're still hasn't been a flashpoint so you know I did that they they're all still you know what are the fat Thursday and sort of flashpoint that happens in the next few months\nUm you know it's sort of like a change thing but so far so good you know the comments that strategy of uh just leaving it alone and not forcing anybody to stand and you know just kind of trying to take the focus off of the whole thing is is really weren't over the last two months\nAnd burn I think there's a couple of things on top of that number one TV stopped showing the anthem that help the number two is it I don't think media who covered the NFL\nOr is watch dog let's call it in terms of old that guy was kneeling this guy was kneeling that guy was kneeling and if you're not following that particular person on Twitter it's very easy to notice what area are to to miss what Eric greedy and some of the dolphins did early on in the season\nYet I don't think\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again the blood borne is over one of them are brand new borders games were just one twenty nine Vermont that's like one twenty nine Vermont blood is every color every option in everything you're looking for jobs\nOn the base that may well the instruction was one of the guidelines were like that you should take that said that all players should ban and it gave players the tournament and walk into so they go through it that\nYou know it's naturally going to happen gr ashes like you know hey you know\nCreating a dividing line and you're saying\nYou know you're either going to stereotype here either complying with the ... not complying with some people who might be\nYour on crime that they don't want to agree with the fires today all those guys would stay in the locker room so you'd be creating a larger group I'm Beth barely by doing that and really if you're doing that the media is going to be taking offense\nAnd they're going to be looking at who's in who's out and there's going to be a lot of focus on that before your game rather than the games themselves so\nYou know I I think it's just a lot of the owners have strong feelings on both sides the child or something ... that really want their players the bad and I have seen their business was affected by players dot standing and you know I'd love to have\nYou know I have some sort of policy where everyone was never an issue\nAlthough politicize you've got a lot of all you've got you know some owners that are sympathetic to the players Carson and wanted to stand up to the players\nI think you know on both sides so we're following up five that had to go on and saying we're going to do what's best for our business I mean I'm shot of all of that if they including the players that conversation it's now the players were being treated like partners in this whole thing\nThe owners could save the demand demand what's best for everybody is for us to help you guys out wherever we can with whatever cause you want but on Sunday the sort of try try our best to keep the focus on what you guys are doing out there\nAnd so you know you made the players there are partners in this rather than talking to that talking to him and saying oh you're going to do that I found is that it made it world's\nDifferent I'm we're the Monday morning quarterback dot com with me for a few more minutes here on the ground show on WNPR oh I'm going to be four teams the bills the raiders the giants and the Arizona Cardinals which team is the biggest mess\nRight now I\nThink sort of build the raiders of the cardinals and the and the giants\nOkay I'm I'm a real estate the way down here sales here and say that the ... law at least\nMassey at that group [laughter]\nI'm Sorry ... um I I have to do is we're actually had to use a spot here they're up in the band aid off they're carrying on I said my a salary cap the gusher quarterback I'd just like any job of Germany and Britain to be\nThe giants have their issues um there's no question about I don't think that they were honest with themselves\nAbout how big or rebuild they needed a undergo I think John ... at least listening to this week is acknowledging now what I think a lot of people and football new which is that they really need to rebuild the roster and go through that\nUm the cardinals have a first year at college they're going to have some decisions to make after a year I think the biggest masses the raiders right now because it seems to me like a non functional relationship right now between Reggie McKenzie and John Goodman bag needs to be cleaned up\nA there's the question was about damn near everybody on the roster and where's that going to be\nThe next six or seven months and so I'm not saying John ... can't get by saying ... view of his own roster was a lot different than uh the the view of the guy who built that roster wishes Reggie McKenzie and I that's why the writers have been\nPart of your players on the bench that were highly draft over the last few years being hurt by diminishing returns from some players they have a very high hopes for\nOnly a few months ago and they've got a lot to sort out again John during the first year there I don't know the relationship what ... what what right I can see right now is

rodeo Dan how are you good how are you\nWith the rollout which was a disaster\nRight and I will say that Governor Mondo it took a long time but she did apologize she did say I shouldn't have flip the switch so early\nI did have a federal warning but we we thought it only applied to a certain portion of the computer system and so I did it anyhow and she has apologized for that she had to fire a couple of people on that same day she happened to be a on the radio here with a guest host to fill in host if you will\nAnd so I called in since the program was mine at the time in the evening and I thought well\nLooking for a guard credit not very well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in East Village and there were a desert of the best financed reaching prices in cars with zero percent if your for somebody to much you can be driving a lot of words also models interest free log onto what auto job\nUm [noise] the governor's people or you know obviously listen with\nJust about two weeks two and a half weeks left right by Tuesday will be two weeks we'll have a countdown going to to election day or the governor's people are all over Twitter attacking Allan Fung and saying that he came forward yesterday with allegations and no backup well that's not true\nUm he had emails from these people they were their private emails they said and they weren't that the state emails ... if someone's going to give you a directive and they send it to your private email so he had rejected emails or will will have seen Clint good from our WPRI newsroom set it up\nIn the piece a but what's interesting to me is how defensive\nI mean we ... you have to be a Martian on another planet to not understand what you hip is when it was first coming out I Know it was a tough\nStory to wrap our heads around was complicated they tried to call it another name right we're island bridges tried to make it sound nicer instead of you hit which that's such\nA black cloud over it and then the days and months and sickening Lee the years go by when people still aren't getting their benefits for medicine for food for what have you nursing homes up close and finally\nFinally I Know it's interesting timing but hey\nUh Allan Fung says two people walked into his headquarters and they are now considered whistle blowers to say oh there was a lot of ... shenanigans going around and it's got to be investigated and the feds need to come back and take a look at this so here's the plant in from the WPRI news from\nThis was Alan ... press conference yesterday and then we'll let you hear what happened in January twenty Seventeen when I was asking the governor these very questions way back when\nI was falling shows the whistle blowers telling him that as data entry clerk said to work at contractor delights officers they foe seemingly made up Social Security numbers popped up and the troubled computers are still in a rush to get benefits to low income Rhode islanders at the outset of the u._s. debacle in early twenties Seventeen\nAccording to them they look like a real Social Security number the known would question\nHe referred than to the federal health and Human Services inspector general's hotline ho says it's a continuation of the problems that have driven up the cost of the you have computer system into the hundreds of millions of dollars in crime students Steve climb can WPRI ...\n[noise] so ah Allen fungus alleging fraud in the you have to buckle he says he's got his to whistle blowers he pointed them in the direction of the feds or one\nOf the current state worker wants a former state worker and he said well go to the federal investigators after they came and told his campaign as you just heard Steve explain that they were instructed to use generics Social Security numbers just put anything in there\nTo process the food stamp claims a and and then they some some other variation of the Social Security number would come up that's according to the to whistle blowers that\nUh uh reportedly\nWalked into Ellen ... campaign um I had heard these stories I Am I have communication with the data entry workers with the people at the department of Human Services I was asking governor among do this\nOr maybe she was unaware way back when in January twenty Seventeen you know are they just standing around not knowing what to do no guidance\nWell I don't think they just standing around\nAnd it's interesting um\nIt's very I I I'm looking at now at the Providence Journal article I'm I'm going to go with maybe governor among do just was included in back then\nA ... and I'm gonna let you hear her voice in her tone of the questions that I was asking her I'm going to go with maybe she just was included\nBut according to the journal story here as well and what what was said yesterday funk said the two data entry workers who he he's describing his whistle blowers walked into his campaign headquarters last weekend they explain how when they reported to work in January of twenty Seventeen\nHow odd that's when I that was the one chance the same time I was asking the governor these questions January twenty Seventeen they said they reported to work\nTo a building on Charles street in Providence had held offices of ... that's the company that built the computer system for the state ... said the two women at the time department of administration workers who have been transferred to help process the food stamp claims remember they were moving people all around the governor laid off like Seventy people\nAnd then they didn't know how to process as itchy flip the switch to early ... wasn't ready\nThey still can't explain what happened to the prior computer system which I was told that they were shredding documents and destroying things\n... group launched your car any make any model what more than ... around because we're a survive following center and will vie yours even if you do ... hours logged onto our car buyers are tough\nAnd so they started to move department administration people over there and oh my God we get more bodies over here so these women said they were told by Deloitte staffers that if an applicant didn't have a Social Security number the system would auto populate a number for them what is that me\nIs that a term he computer people is that a term just throw any number in and it will auto populate you with Social Security number that sounds a little odd to me well what do they know they're coming from the department of administration this isn't their job they said All right well we're data entry people\nThis is how this is what was going on in the moment when I was trying to get some answers from the governor either she didn't want to talk about it or she didn't know what the hell was going on while this whole thing was crumbling which is why I kept asking her don't you see that this was an emergency why are you not listening to these people\nOh just throwing number in there and it will auto calculate\nThat\nI've never heard of such a thing but I'm not the auto populate a number for them so for both of these workers it looked like a real Social Security number that no one would question said phone yesterday the first sign that things were a little sneaky here is that the details of their assignment were sent to their personal email addresses and not their state ones\nNow phone didn't name the women he said he understood he had contacted the inspector general's office of the federal department of health and Human Services and had been asked not to speak to the press until their interviews with those investigators have been completed\nAs a former the prosecutor Alan ... that I take these allegations very seriously are so some people are looking at this is a while you know how great timing two and a half weeks before the election day but I Want to go back at the time these women are saying\nThey would ask they were asking them to do what could be fraudulent things at least in the very least questionable things with Social Security numbers\nI was asking the governor the one and only time I had the chance the same thing or they standing around not knowing what they're doing who's directing them what's going on with the lawyer why isn't this an emergency let's play from January seventeenth that that same time when I asked\nThe governor what is happening with the Fed's number three\n\nWhat can you just walk us through what actually happened when you were briefed on the warnings from the fed because I've never been clear to me or the listener [noise]\nUh you know we weren't brief that there were some issues but obviously we thought that we had it all covered\nAnd there was an urgency to go forward because if we miss certain deadlines we wouldn't have been able to do open enrollment for the health exchange\nSo you know we heard them um we worked on it we were advised by Deloitte and the guy was advised by the team and Deloitte that\nWe had covered and we all go forward because number one and we're also under the gun from the feds to hurry up and get the system still alive because it was going to be out of regulations when as I Am at fusion\nThat the feds need to put this new system in but then it ... the word and learning to strong and maybe revolved is interpreted over the years that I haven't been on the bus rather I haven't been able to talk to you weren't there an actual warning or was it just you know take your time you know make sure the old system is is not phased out I just I don't there's no clarification on that up to them\nSo the main um not to get into too much beer critic mumbo jumbo but why people aren't really want to exactly so the main partner we had in the federal government\nIs the coliseum F no that's the main partner we work very closely with them and they gave us ago at they said ah looks good go ahead with a group that gave us um you know said are you sure you're ready\nIs the food stamp office at so it's a different federal agencies that much smaller partner\nAnd they basically said you know have basically do you have discovered have you thought about these issues\nAnd so as I said to you uh we did get to go ahead from the federal government we're also being told by Sam asked that Rhode Island's out of compliance and you have to you know get this system up and running we heard from the food stamp people please be sure you're you've got these issues covered\nAnd we thought we did now clearly we didn't and I'd say ... twenty twenty twenty and you know if I had known them when I Know now who knows [laughter]\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eight teams Ford F. one fifty the best for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at point forward and he went into and there were against it\nOff and then mayor Solomon because I understand the mere Solomon reached out to can swear to tell that story and then ... going to join us coming up after that to talk about the whole situation he's got like a little\nFire no pun intended a brew in in in ... I work um they gave him an unexpected oh you might have something wrong with your building after he sort of kept block yeah shouted out about it I have an anonymous tip about emergency lightning and can blocks office building which he doesn't even own you rent it\nSo that's going to be fun that's it says that's what happened to fight for a union man they just they're an enigma I sometimes we're going to start off from the the governor's spokesman spoke yesterday reaction to ... Allen funds a commentary about you have and he says it was a ... a desperate something tobacco desperation home is playing for everybody and see who sounds desperate\n[laughter] yeah with the fact that you are listening to you know it's interesting he's all on Twitter to\nYou should stay on Twitter he does better on Twitter [laughter] better it's better to for two hundred and forty characters like your finger\nDidn't talking I'd have a great weekend felt the ah talking turkey with the mayor will be on the website six thirty WPRI that comic I'm Still happening\n[noise] somebody a NFL from the New England truck solution studio this is a station you count on for news traffic whether it's half point hand news talk Ninety nine seven AM six thirty W.

a lot about municipal contracts are you working on a big news will contract type of a project tears something what's going on\nYeah so well with watchdog a couple of years ago we managed to pull\nAlmost all of the a municipal labor contracts and put them in one place on our website mhm uh oftentimes those contracts are hard to get you sometimes have to open records request them they're not searchable we make them searchable and you can search through all of them are looking for key words and stuff like that so we're in the process of trying to do that again\nAnd a real quick note uh 'cause I Know and we got to jump pretty soon I uh we're\nTrying to get Providence is labor contract and and most of the crowd is labor contracts are pretty much impossible to piece together because whereas the war fire contract for example is as a single whatever it is Seventy eight page document ... in Providence they doing them in the previous documents\nAnd they've been doing that for decades so if you want to know what's actually in the Providence firefighters contract when I last staff in twenty Fifteen they sent me deck documents going back to Nineteen eighty two\nAnd you have to stitch them altogether to figure out what the current contract actually is and if you had to sift through about seven hundred pages walk yes it's absolutely true and we're in the process of getting an update on that now happily\nOr unhappily I guess really we uh they did the school a bus monitors the these are the individuals who ride the buses and step off on every stop to make sure no one's under the wheels you know Providence his school bus monitors\nAssuming that they work twenty hours a week or more\nGet lifetime health care and they received to pensions\nWait ... those are city employees they don't work for ah for for students to bust Kobus\nMonitors not the bus drivers monitors\nOur city of Providence employees and we don't repeat this because it's so unbelievable who get if they work twenty hours a week\nFor ... lifetime healthcare\nAnd two that were the two pensions come from\nOne of them is with the Teamsters plan and the other one is with the the municipal employees plan\nWhat's that worth while the healthcare alone is currently probably worth twelve Thirteen fourteen thousand dollars a year and it's only going to go up [noise] what do they make an hour\nOr it looks like an average uh about a hundred bucks a day right so this this job isn't about the cash\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator was Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury him ...\n... ah that that wasn't that wasn't clear but can you imagine lifetime health care what that why does anybody need healthcare beyond age sixty five when a\nManager right\nSo you know it reading these contracts is crucially important and\nTo be I'm sitting I got taken I'm In shock plus I'm too pensions and I mean would you I don't know what they can be five bucks each I don't know how to pensions but health care for life a bus monitors\nAnd by the way [laughter] it's only healthcare for life recently for only the employee not too many years ago a it was health care for life for the employee and the employees spouse\nSo it's only a single plan so now so it's not a family planning board\nNow yeah now it's down to one but look I Can't imagine who negotiated this on behalf of the city of Providence but as Providence spirals down the drain and you listen and hear about give away like\nThis wow how can you have a ... read\nA a of any incentive to help them when they're splitting their own ...\nYou really do when that was ratified is one of those deals who's only been around it\nI mean when that particular thing was put in the contract I I don't\nAh but you know this\nIs this is why it's important to look this is like watchdog is looking at all the contracts this is why you know Rob Rob ... analysis of the contract and the effort he's put into getting to the point where he's gotten to here in Warwick\nYou know it really matters to look at these things in it and the the fact that all these contracts are typically negotiated in secret and the public doesn't learn what's in them until they're ratified signed\nIs a colossal problem right\nThere should be like a thirty day ... you know I was right when there was due to thirty days to everybody to read it to see it and then they vote on it\nThat's right because if you had to give away like this tucked in there the public needs to be able to know that it's there and they have to be able to express their disapproval because if you're elected officials are just in the pockets of the unions and their unions are essentially negotiating with a friendly other person\nIs not fair it's not good it doesn't make you look good it doesn't and dear you to the public it doesn't and\nDeer people I mean this this attitude that comes along with some public sector people in public sector unions where they have this mafia also nonsense attitude I Am telling you guys eighties the worst thing for\nYou and they don't get it they don't get don't seem to get it because it keeps doing it\nYou know the teachers' unions in the states stopped doing the uh the the work to rule stuff a lot and a lot of ways they don't like to do it they don't do because all it does is poison the well\nIf I'm a business owner in war and now you've now taking fire safety and public safety and you've put a political spin on all of it or tainted it with politics\nAnd you know when it comes to public safety that's the last dam thing you want\n\nAnd for people who supposedly all about the wood in man in about the little guy and this that and the other thing making it so that the working man can't work because\nThey don't agree with you or they might have a different point of view or whatever it is more concerned about wasting their hard earned money um\nIs this is as cowardly and ridiculous as it gets it can't be it cannot be countenance\nYou really can't you know\nAnd uh and the city or if there's going to be a lot of reckoning going on I think because the guy who's there for a long long time is Scott ... he was running the place and now there's a new guard coming in\nWhether it's the current acting mirror numerical might get picked or if he's if he stays in terms of the election coming up I'm there's going to be a lot of stuff that's going to be uncovered will join me on the line is that acting mayor by the way marriages of selling mayor how are\nYou sir very good thank you if you can pick up your phone I'd appreciate the speaker phone company here in the ... and I

mean I\nGuess you know are they looking to cut taxes are they looking to\nRedirect taxes ... non fungus talked about cutting taxes the governor ... it's more about ah well she's mentioned that she has

yet you'll have it is when they complain about the fact that they have to spend all this time reporting on nonsense and that's what they do and then I guess what they do they go back to reporting on

like I was just all this I have to crack open anyway it's just I just scraping by ... it was [laughter] [noise] uh but some of this stuff is legit some of it works really well\nI always wonder about those things now before the break we were talking about Ford Ford from the Libertarian Party and he was talking about outrage born\nAnd talking about you know the media covering the the outrage of the day in the in the campaign shenanigans rather than the actual um the news issues right and the the policy issues and there's a couple of things that work number one they do cover some policy issues\nBut there's you have to understand what you're talking about news in general and I think and I'll defend you know me I the bias in the media drives me nuts but there's this and I fall into this too sometimes I think there's a couple of things that work number one\nIntriguing is interesting to people [noise]\nSo have you have campaigns shenanigans or this person's says this to this person about the support and whether or not people can put it together\nThe political a backroom dealing and whatnot and the shenanigans that go on are interesting to people and so the interest will definitely supersede policies stuff I mean uh it's nice to say that and it's great virtue signaling but how many people would actually sit down and read a Fifteen hundred word essay about policy\nMaybe more than most people think but not as many as some others think know what I'm saying and\nUh whether you like it or not we live in a day and age where you know outraged gets clicks\n\nA horrible part of our society today it\nIs one of the terrible side effects of social media\nA and his ruining our ability to be empathetic our ability to to relate to each other our ability to coalesce into a compromise\nGiving us and I get I get criticized for the same as the other day it's giving us a warped sense of reality social media because of that very fact\nIf you go on to social media and all it is all the news in quotes out there is just basically what pet called outrage porn things that were that are written in order to get you to share them because your\nPast that everything you see is a distorted\nView of reality in order to get you upset and you walk around upset the whole time you sit there and wonder how the hell did this happen you have a demented view of the world that may not be real\nAnd it's all so that you are um you know how people always talk about marketing is meant to make it so that you are\nUm that you feel less than you know you're not that pretty but if you buy this makeup you will be\nYou're not that handsome but you buy this hair dye you will be by these shoes they'll make you look better that kinda thing exactly the same thing\nBut just in a different way here's something that is so ridiculous in a statement that so out of the over the top it's guaranteed to make you nuts and be so outraged that you want to make sure that everybody else knows about it too\n\nAnd so that's what goes on and and that's unfortunately part of it so it's part of its marketing it's about making people\nLook at it and I think it's that and the two smaller extent I Know for me anyway I'm\nYou realize a lot of times at these policies that they come up with unless they're major league policies\nBut what happens is very often is that the policies that people come up with are have been picked over and and and proven or just proven over and over and over again but still they do them and and you kinda get bored by it\nYou know sometimes I sit there and I'm like you know is this gonna work to some people say yes some people say no okay what do you want from me\nHowever if you get some you know backroom shenanigans like uh somebody slapping each other around in the old neighborhood that's funny or interesting\nOr or whatever like today we told yesterday we talked to Allan Fung regarding his ah his his whole complain\nAbout you

over to the to grab some voters from Armando that's her Achilles' heel the the unions out their public sector unions are reluctant Lee\nEndorsing her their reluctantly endorsing her because they got

the pension reform so if you can go ahead and become a constituency of somebody\nBy supporting them\nYou might be able to effect that change and Joe ... politically is very smart for putting out dangling out that that hooked in that state\nIt's the sign of somebody who actually wants to be the governor not somebody who wants to take out island fun and does not what the end result will be I don't know but that should have been done for a long time ago but that's a brilliant\nPolitical move now whether or not it's good policy it depends on what comes out of the commission\n\nYou know and so it's a commission so you get things like that and to determine whether or not that's valid\nOr takes a lot of research takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of points of view and today's modern media uh they're up against all those all the time the the expertise or the staffing all that stuff so that's part of the reason why you get it to get the type of political coverage you get\nI mean the cable news channels are twenty four seven outrage born twenty four seven you may get to some legitimate policy discussion type stuff maybe in a long form thing but the cable news channels that they are their stock in trade\nAll three of them is outrage porn and I'm telling you and people will sit there and roll their eyes about this but I'm telling you the news media is creating the public sentiment the public or the public's reactionary nature and consumer um reactions to it\nIs driving the the uh the media news cycle but then the new media news cycle is creating the very thing that they need to continue so it's it's just weird self eating you know self perpetuating thing\nThat's going to end us we have big problems with this is because this was going to create I mean you get the

NFL career I and then it defense of Chicago big difference because it's far better\nThan what the patriots faced on Sunday night but haven't falls out I think there are a lot of similarities Maggie\n... at the end of last year and a return things over to him and this system that he runs is very much like Andy rates you know they do along with their formations and their emotions to get what they want to do exploit\nMismatch is and force you to defend\nEvery inch of the field every blade of grass as they say to recall it was a\nReally terrific uh an exciting player to watch and now he's dynamic and the return game I Am and certainly is but to a a a back that uh is going to carry the ball a lot I Would imagine a the way that uh you know we've got accustomed to seeing\nOr somebody like ... Lewis but he reminds me a little bit of a of a young Lewis when he catches the ball and uh he says he he got patterns was game a bit after sorry killing them we seem to think what that is that from all over the place and they will lie to him up I just about everywhere trade and as\nA tight end that I've liked a lot going back to your practices between the patriots habit eagles uh several years ago we saw last year throw the golf course Philly Special and become a pretty good weapons for them the last couple of weeks and then they've got\nA receiver like Alan ... hobbled who nonetheless is a guy go up and get a jump ball for sure as heck reproductive crew unhealthy in Jacksonville and and it's had a good stretch in Chicago Anthony Miller is young receiver rookie out of Memphis that I thought might be on the patriots radar it's got to with injury like\nMy college a career at least toward the end of his career but it really is a a quick shifting class they did a lot of pieces with which to work\nHowever it is a a bat that was very productive for a couple of years less so these days but the role of the components from ... to do what he's going to try to do and that's what\nThe vulnerabilities or the patriots defense same league hitters in the last year the semi at a rate that\nActually comes down to the quarterback clay and one thing I'll see what you're ... and he's one of very effectively and there'll be some in all likelihood design runs for the quarterback on Sunday and we know that kind of problems patriots who've had when it comes to defending bubble quarterbacks\nAnd that Anthony Miller from Memphis big in the kick return game if they turn him loose he was dominant in college for Memphis in terms of returning kicks bomb Sophie here on the ground showing WPRI robot let's look inward at the patriots economy feels like and correct me if I'm wrong here but\nFor a couple of weeks the sees her rocky now would kind of feels like\nLooking for a car

two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nI think things are definitely studying for the football team but there's still a long way to go you know you look at the office of production the last three weeks and obviously a huge spike and there's a sense okay the getting back to when we come become accustomed to the patch without on land\nRound ... and all the continued development of Josh gorge a concerted effort last week to get him involved or perhaps ah you know maybe a it over a commitment early on in that game against Kansas City James White and Sony Michel ... and it's an all fenced dance but I'm\nThirty eight thirty and forty three near the same time it's Tom Brady has said what about a couple of times in the very recent past you know they feel like they've lost a lot out there and defensively I thought last week when the first half really\nThe defense played a ... in every way I think uh you know as as you would have hoped going into the game given the expectations of the game they got red zone stops and they turned up all over twice\nAnd they gave the fence and opportunity to go into halftime with the to score leak it didn't sustain that and the second half a and and I think that's that's a bit concerning\nBecause what strides they've made against both the Indianapolis and Kansas City were marked by regression and the second half of each of those games and then there's the issue with special to start it return or\nA Anthony Miller and there are others ... tone is a terrific pump returned her advice Callahan is a guy you may not even get a chance to return to the game he's got a touchdown on his resume and the return game she got is very similar or in in in that face and the patriots have struggled of late the coverage kicks\nThat's been a problem and it was a huge problem not only the Ninety seven yard or but\nAnother time as well on Sunday against the Kansas City chiefs and that's characteristic for them\nWe don't expect the patriots to\nHave a disadvantage at the end of the night when it comes to average starting field position and that's like by virtue of the fence and off as but it's the third phase which of course Bill Belichick values as much as the others\nBob do you have a theory as to why they struggled like mine is look to your point five six seven defensive backs more than ever now\nThat's where you now have a bigger concentration of those guys on your roster whereas a couple of years ago linebacker was probably the you know but why backing group was a little thicker in terms of numbers and you could deploy those guys on special teams\nYou combine that with you can't practice it it's hard to tackle now in the NFL maybe got guys that are out there trying to chase people all over the field\nI don't know that's my theory what are what are you seeing out there\nWell it's funny I met met these letters are honest this week with us and and talking to him about things you know you look at the the new roller you don't get the running start and because of the necessity of the return team to have\nA everybody but you know the three guys who are back to be up within Fifteen yards you're still teams on both sides on the coverage part of it and the return part of it go a little bit lighter\nUm and you know it's it's as ... ... playing by the Senate rules and I think when you look at the patriots ... they have more course special team players but anybody and\nYou're looking for brand and king for Nicholas Grigsby a Matthew sweaters guy that we we watch year after year of pro bowl distinction and Amy start at seven straight times that I think well at the end of his career making hall of fame consideration uh but you look at\nThe patriots personnel I mean they should be good enough to be a lot better than they are and sweater didn't\nOffer any excuses and it's one of the things I always appreciate about math you and and I think ... you know as someone who was very displeased with it and I I don't think it really has has has a lot to do with the guys that are playing defensively because you know you look at the other night key on crossing who's a rookie cornerback it really doesn't play on decent\nGoes down said he's got a chance to make a stop on Trayvon Smith\nIn a deep uh deepen the Kansas City a part of the

I mean let's remember that when a when they decided to get rid of ... at the beginning of this year who by the way it will be getting a World Series ring which is pretty crazy nice if they win it which I think they're going to\nBut that was old Alex poor came to us and if she has that during a relationship with Don browse ski he's ...\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln if there were against it unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\n... as much as I'm not a David Price guide I wouldn't even advocate taking him out and uh putting Steven right in there as much as price drives me crazy he had a pretty good regular season this year I could take it away from him\nAnd if they have all these things to that fits into this whole thing where\nA dump browse he's getting a ton of credit for native all the native all the it's been great so I Will give all the credit to native all the\nThe only reason native all these on this team is because Dumbo didn't want to go over the luxury tax that's exactly I mean are we really are we're not going to call a spade a spade here Brad Hand would have been on this team or name the other high end guy I'm sure diamond day was job at the bit to get that check book out until they told them hey\nWe don't want to go over the luxury tax code red Sox well you know\nThat's why native all day was here I mean and again great job by native all the great job by the red Sox for sticking with him and putting him in great positions in order to help them out and he's been fantastic\nBut again it's he's been oh they they scout at this diamond in the rough and native all the time it gave me a break it was a guy cost pennies on the dollar compared to the other people have bailed on the market that's why he's on the team I'm Glad he's here I'm Glad he's performed well\nBut don't don't don't be talking about diamonds in the rough when it comes to native all the they scattered them for months yeah OK\nAnd native older you will probably go out and make fifty million dollars is on a loaded on track somebody's going to give them ten twelve million a year or so long as it's not the red Sox could very well I mean if you were to David Price and they keep native already on a four year deal for forty eight million I wouldn't necessarily be against that however I understand the sentiment ...\nOr do you have any other David priced stuff that's going to drive me nuts yeah hearing afraid\nOf the here's here's all the various red socks or many of the various Red Sox are talking about how great David Price was last night it actually starts with David Price I think so let's take a listen\nOr myself in a Henry walking off the field you know back to the dugout from a from the bullpen yesterday and he sees motion to me that um that I Am today so that was awesome who's good you know it was it was good in the bullpen warming up\nUm\nWhen it got better as the game went on you know made a made some adjustments with it I think after a for the fourth inning and there was a huge\nWith David is a is about command from the adolescent who was a ... he used his change of a lot hurting the game a lot different than than the first started and\nI Do feel for whatever people think thought about maybe ... outside the clubhouse he's sort of a well in in the Boston Springer hits a ... and then he made a ... I saw the first of all well\nFrom pitch which one I'm a hacker just had that feeling tonight was going to be that night for him and I couldn't ask for you know the better team may you know\nThe ways he battled through and you know whole postseason talk isn't that um I think it really shows determination and become a competitor that's inside of him\nI Want to him together when a was a bit selfish for him to get it or they don't want anyone to where it is a lot a specific resigning rare [noise] a lot of people without it but one of our top guys and I was before\nI'm so proud of you know food everybody wrong he's a great pitcher [noise] um no he's he's worth every penny and um you know I Love 'em to death I use reading is ready to take the ball he's ready to get back on the mountain and and help the same way and a guy that come in last night so we can do what he did today\nHey I've got all those guys are behind David Price for the success of the red Sox they need to be how the ... he's controlling that narrative better than Dennis and why is that right now there's yeah boy because they're the only eat the things\nThat he's taken from the media you mean the media that he basically went out of his way to crap on the up and like ... if the price had performed away David Price had performed up until last night\nAnd had dealt with the media ... and respectfully instead of telling Johnny Miller to go get a shined box and check out you know what changes have made during\nLike this was all invented and brought upon David Price by himself yeah there were a lot of us myself included who didn't think he would be a good bit here and didn't want him to come here for that exact reason\nAnd I didn't you know his lack of postseason success played a large role in my reasoning as to why didn't want him on this team\nBut had he showed up in band you know just a good player in terms of dealing with the media sure he's still would have gotten rip Don and people still would have been oh I Can't believe we pay this got all this money\nBut the vitriol that these players we just listen to an alec score are reacting to Cora was basically like screw you guys look how great he was like how do you like David Price now and a dad who yes\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck if the here for only one I mean I Will say hello to port boards twenty eighty four to one fifty so desperate for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a plug for it and he went into a narrative it\nNormal for a while but it's like well don't you like this that the guy beat the crap out of me man I'm not going to come around so quickly just because now you know he donated five dollars to charity you know and that's basically what this is for me it's like\nThey invented this to a certain extent that the media just was out for David Price from the jump and they didn't want him to succeed and they think it's terrible and they think he's a bad guy when at least half of that narrative was created by price themself\nAnd you know what in an organization that uses all the numbers and saber metrics and stuff like that that's where they're two faced about it because our core knows the numbers\nBut it slipped through the finger wag right on the media people who've been ripping him because\nThey can look at the same numbers that out Cora can somebody gets amount it uh you know in the in the middle of a third inning because he's starting to whiz in a way and when I ... you know next time then when he gets in trouble\nAlex core if you really believe in him then do what they did river lander last night and leave him in there to pitch through it or if you get them out because the numbers tell you to then you're doing the exact same thing that fans are in analyzing David ... before he gets on the mount", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "19"}
