a fascinating\nMystery and I want to make sure that we ... you know I I'm very cognizant of the fact that there is there may be I think there is um\nEither well here's a here the possibilities there's either a person out there who made a huge mistake\nOr in his regretting it there is a person out there who is um\nYou know getting over their skis for whatever reason that they're doing something right and get screwed up and is trying to get over it as a person they might not be anybody out there that did anything it's just having the name or through the muck 'em and is you know\nHow would you like motor dredge twenty or gene trucks will be here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty four to one fifty so desperate for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for only a flood forward and he went into a newer games it\nThis kind of thing goes on what am I talking about well you remember when children White House was uh was mentioned in the ah Brett Kavanaugh a saga outside of his uh well having to do with this time of his his his position on the Senate Judiciary committee um he had gotten a phone call evidently um from constituents\nWho said that he had confronted\nTo people in Nineteen eighty five in Newport who had sexually assaulted a race I think we're a friend of his uh those two peoples one's name was I think Brett and I think they said was Britain mark actually named their names are and he beat them up and hit them or whatever and they were they were bruised and bloodied and whatever it is back in Nineteen eighty five\n[noise] so Senator Whitehouse according to reports takes that information and send it over to the to the Judiciary Committee investigators as well as a gives the constituent I guess the name of a reporter\nIs just can reach constituent of his now based and so what happens is Republicans the Republican staffers evidently the Republicans in general on the committee let that information out those reports were released so some people found out that there was a call that went into Senator Whitehouse is a office\nAh and I said but somebody making allegations from Rhode Island this is probably about a week ago\nIf not more than a little bit but we can a day ago so what happened was people did some slew thing\nAnd did some backtracking on the ah the information that was given and that report and tried to figure out who this guy was in Rhode Island they came across the Twitter handle that I have not said the name on the show because\nI don't know it's legit I have no idea might be a person out there at the same I mean it's been printed other places so I'm not keeping secrets and nobody else knows I'm just not going to be part of it because I don't know whether or not this person did anything I don't know if it's just the name the Twitter account as we reported as being a bought\nFor ... a lot of people are on Twitter there's no picture there it's just a bunch of weird stuff and and so you know we were asking yesterday whether or not this person actually even exists\nQuestioning whether or not this is actually even happen or if this person existed they actually make the call to Senator Whitehouse\nWith somebody else using their name these are things we don't know now Senator Whitehouse says the committee for leaking the person's information we can these reports you know the name was mentioned in there or you know should they should report you should apologize wants to the dump shows here you'll get an apology will come from the committee to his constituents\nHe's not confirming the name of the person\nAnd the only reporter that I Know that I that has you know actually well I think it probably a lot of people have tried this come close as far as I Know\nIs ... joins me in line right now Kim how are you\nSaying that I'm doing well are you I'm good did I did I make sense and link this whole thing out that it ...\nDefinitely definitely did ah it it's it's a little bit confusing because we really don't know exactly who this person is like that if if the\nTwitter that's been identified it connected to him or her or if it's just something that popped out there as you know like that have thought so we've been trying to answer the same questions that you are still asking\nFor a week after this author writes I saw you on Twitter saying this stuff did you ever do final report on it because you really I'm trying to remember if you did a ... only thing I Know about what you did was what you put on Twitter\nYeah so um we didn't end up including a what I put on Twitter in our on air story because you know we we ended up talking to Senator Whitehouse about\nAll of the um the result of of last week\nTestimony in hearings and um we did ask you about that topic as well but uh when I put on Twitter\nWas basically that we tried to track this guy down so\nWhat we're going off of it what was mentioned in these transcripts of this hearing that there were a couple of tweets that were quoted and something about this man being a hippie from Sanford and that was his Twitter bio right and so based on that information some reporters talented Twitter account that seems to match up\nA pretty much exactly with what with that and in the the transcript and from there you know we want the norm or is that a reporter with the way they tried to find this guy's eye contact information email address we've\nMade multiple phone calls and I think you mentioned just a couple of times the phone number that's associated with him on white pages\nThat woman in New port

passion\nSince the election but I have not seen this type of unity in the Republican Party and think about it think about what it would take I mean I I didn't think that you would see the unity in the Republican Party this soon and it's solid right now\nBecause I think they now see\nThat whatever their differences are with Donald Trump whatever irritates whatever irritate them about the the the president whatever they find unacceptable about the president and I'm Talking about the never Trump or is a lot of Republican conservative\nThey look at it and they finally have come home why because they looked and they've said these people are political\nOpposition is in saying that things that we hold so dearly\nHere in this country you know what what really binds us the belief of individual civil rights then you've seen\nThe complete capitulation of the American civil liberties union as as Tucker Carlson called them you're just a hack organization now they've gotten that they don't care about civil liberties anymore finally the realization\nTo Republicans across the board that you have a party that doesn't any more give a damn about the civil rights of Americans they don't care that the message\nThat has been sent to Republicans and that's\nWhy you have the type of unity that you have here as we go into the vote and as you've seen really come together over the last two weeks it's

raised that he should drop out now [laughter] so if you just raise just drop the allegation yeah and and Dershowitz flight away the germs were later on and said he goes yeah I I Know what I said what do you think about it 'cause we've been through this already\nMcCarthy ... you're not a communist right exactly\nThat's exactly what the same thing that liberals were outraged about yet not what they endorse\nExactly four on attracts user forecast\nPersistent weather pattern is going to bring some snow to be higher elevations of the Rockies rain snow into the great lakes basin possible and into the northern plains\nSevere thunderstorms possible over parts of the country today in New York will see Seventy eight degrees with some sunshine today Detroit under thirty percent chance of showers five Seventy three Chicago near sixty eight chance of thunderstorms both today and tomorrow\nWhether frontal boundary lingering around the mid west we can certainly\nHow would you like motor treads twenty gene truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to port boards twenty anti Ford F. one fifty the best drug for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a plug for it and he went into and there were against it\nFor example today seven hundred law professors signed a letter and asked me to sign it I refused I wrote a dissent saying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by liberal president who has been accusing what acted similarly I don't think a single one of those professors would\nHave signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test senator Booker why liking no there's just dead wrong this is all about partisanship defeat opposite what's happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up candidate everybody would behaving the opposite way and so it is partisanship and I think\nThe framers of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like I have great yeah\nI ... and ... and that's it I mean we we talk about the process you know it's\nIt's telling that we're at this point and still at this point in fact heightened your you'll likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow up until the main vote on ... late Saturday or Sunday Morning whenever it happens but we're at this point but it is all of this chaos\nBefore the actual vote and what is it that that matters it's only about the vote I mean this is further proof\nThat this was only about the delay delay it as long as you can in hopes an outside hope I guess that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation and withdraw his own confirmation and or the president would do it um that wasn't going to happen\nOr the once once the left got loud that wasn't going to happen but as president and and now we know very clearly it certainly isn't going to happen by the nominee himself but\nYou look at this entire process and it has been distorted greatly there is no guarantee here that that Kavanaugh we will be confirmed with the actual legitimate process of all of\nThis place well you know when you when you hear Dershowitz a talk about you know McCarthyism ... and and what happened at that time when\nYou know you someone who accuse you of being a communist and so you'd get enraged and they'd say well sorry you don't have the temperament the allegation itself meant you were blacklisted right the the the fact that you lost it at anything was used an a you know against you\nAre and I thought ... which you know really when he said he said it was so you've been a direct or forty years and now you're losing control because somebody's calling your comedy if you're on the temperament for the job so you're out your blacklisted from the the ... you know from the industry\nAnd it's something that liberals used to have in their mind and I think the important thing is and it's obvious because you and I have\nBeen having this discussion a back and forth because it is the left\nIt is you know antifa anti pies we call it this supposed to be anti fascist yet what did they promote what is their actual mindset it's authoritarianism and its fascism is it you must live the life that that that we that that we wish you to live\nAnd what you see here what you see here from the Democrats the mindset\nThat they're promoting everybody that you see Michael Moore and Amy Schumer and whatever whatever Hollywood people are down there screaming and yelling about you know a Brett Brett Kavanaugh and believe the accuser\nThat the the the defendant has no rights at all the defendant is automatically guilty\nThat is the mindset of a fashion yes that's not the mindset of somebody who believes in the American constitution in the spirit of America in the spirit of due process in the spirit of the bill of rights of the United states it is the mindset of a fashion\nWell and and what we call somebody when we say they had the mindset of the fascist we back it up with pacific's not just oh he talks mean therefore he's a fascist know whatever's exact words and what does he actually wish to implement\nWhen we talk about President Trump and you know they started on that uh and now they've moved on and this is a very very important thing for people to understand and I think that's what this is what maybe you're not in the Republican Party it started with Trump and enough people hated Trump where it's stuck for a while\nAnd then they decided to move on from Trump and they moved on to Kavanaugh and all of a sudden the realization as we said all along it was a bogus argument completely bogus and allies against Trump to begin with but then they moved to somebody else\nWho more people look at and say when all this is somebody who we really really like this is somebody who we really would like in that position as much as we don't like\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the here for only one Ninety nine brought will say hello to forge twenty Eighteen Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at flood forward and he's presidential Narragansett\nOh that can hit him than it can hit him oh my God they can come after me next they can go after anybody and that's what you learn with the fascists mindset they'll pick out an attractive target to get people you know motivated behind them even people of you know well of goodwill and all of a sudden those people of good will wake up\nOne day and say and sometimes they wake up in a society and it's too late it's not too late here in the United states and it's not too late in this instance and it\nLooks like that because people have fought back are you now have you know created this unity in the Republican Party but remember it only goes so far because people of good will buy into it at times\nYes because it fits their political narrative but it is the mind what you're seeing is the mindset of a fascist and the fascist in this case is not the Republicans it is the Democrats and it's not debatable\nWell I mean it's very simple when you look at the group that says they're anti fascist and their name in fact this condensed down to those condense from those two words\nThere the group that's willing to go out and hurt people use violence against people they disagree with\nPunish people for thought they're the ones who are acting on it they're the ones in California who create laws that if you don't talk the way we want you to talk we can send you to jail\nIn New York we can find your business to the extent that you will be out of this\nTell me that's not fascist you you don't create the ours\nSomebody wishes you to create we will destroy your business\nYou wear a hat you go to a restaurant and try and have a peaceful dinner we will come on to that private property and we will shout you\nOut you think like us you behave like us you reject the bill of rights and if you don't we will destroy your life\n\nRepublicans are finally coming around and you're not even realizing oh my God\nThat's what that party has become and it's not the fringe this is the important thing is that this is not the fringe this is the mainstream yeah this is the Senate Judiciary committee it's mainstream power of the republic or some of the Democratic party\nAnd you have a vaccine waters who doesn't get any grief from the left for saying this is what we need you to do this is what we want you to do go out and get in their face every chance you get\nAnd all of a sudden you've got pushed back yeah\nRight because the average American will put up or for a while until all of a sudden it's like whoa okay the lines been crossed and I believe many people believe now that this line has been cross I Hope they do let me put it this way I'm not going to make the prediction that they have yet it seems that they have\nBut my hope is that the American people have had enough yeah and that more people will start rejecting\nThe the mindset of fascism that is being promoted by the mainstream of the Democratic party yeah as we're always say tell us where we're wrong you can't eight six six Ninety ...\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for

some folks they if they don't see the um in the business we refer to taste specific\nItems that are in their house and maybe the rest of the world's not like um and then to where they have had belongings that they may have a hard time getting rid of\nIt that's absolutely true um a lot of people will develop an attachment to the stuff that they've collected over the years and you know they get the feeling that they're being part of it from there from their stuff\nAnd that's not reality reality as you're moving right and therefore you're stuff's going to be packed up anyway so many miles of start packing up early yeah I'm a lot of them get very emotional over it um I've seen people get very upset when you touch their stuff and\nUm because they think you're getting rid of it right when nothing is further from the truth [noise]\nUm but in the same token I was involved in the staging where you know the guy just had shelves full of books and a lot of the books had to go it's just too much and um but he was also an artist and so we use some of his paintings\nIn the decor you know who died out at a walls with yet which made him feel a lot better because he didn't realize\nThat we were making helping him improve his situation to maximize the sale of his home okay then that's rarely when it comes down to [noise] um I had another case where an elderly couple were willing to remove and and clean up their property\nAnd and they told me boy it took them a long time and I'm sure it did cause you collect stuff over forty fifty years and when you first get married yeah and it's tough to see the stuff go but um they did it they they swept through it and at a fantastic job some people are willing to do the sweat equity necessary\nOthers prefer that you come in and do it for them right um because they're just the the stuff's style jak feeling that they have with the stuff and they just don't want to part with it\nRight now do you ever have the um\nSituation where someone they bring you in and they say OK Lu I Want you to do a B and C it helped me do this in my house but they are kind of like that controlling person and they want you to do it but they want to supervise and say oh no don't touch that don't touch if do they you know like you see in the movies where they really can't let go\nAnd they make drive you crazy to say it does that happen in real life I haven't experienced that no other stages have\nUm where they're very very controlling yeah I prefer that you know they just leave the house and let me go to work [noise] um if you want to help that's great you know with packing up your items and not you know you take your family out for dinner or lunch or something and I just let me do my stuff\nYeah [noise] so now do you work with Kevin or someone like Kevin Ware when you take the stuff out and let's say they don't want to put it in storage or do something they want to get rid of it do you call up someone either Kevin or someone in his on his side of the business to basically help um you know remove\nAll the stuff absolutely it's um depending on what you kind of stuff that you have you know whether it's\nUm it looks like it's a lot of valuable stuff I'm going to bring in someone like Kevin\nYou know what the stuff over yeah if it's just a lot of stuff on you know that there's no value when at rice I'm no praise or I don't really know right it's you know will call in a state cleaners to the ... sorry I've also come across\n... group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\n[noise] um so the help you decide what to take out to help you decide what to keep and they'll help you move into your new place as well okay that's good so [noise]\nThey go through that period than the house goes on to agreement and then the regular traditional movers would come in and take all the other remaining furniture and relocated to the new ... that's that's correct yeah okay that's what would happen yes now right good thoughts you are listening to\nVariety store I used to get one of those every week to allow right in my brother's too and we never kept them\nYeah and that's why there was money though 'cause we never really kept them right yeah we've had him we went home and yeah ... right yeah I think something else okay so so that's the amazing comic book story that we had and then I Know Kevin as another one about\nI'm Tiffany but we're gonna come back to that later low tell us some an interesting story in your experience it's kind of they don't make everyone go wow\nI'm not to put any pressure on you [laughter] the big the biggest thing\nUm in selling real estate is the photography yeah resin did a study a number of years ago actually not too far in the back on the past and did a study with the listings in Massachusetts MLS system as well as those things out on Long Island ... and they found that\nProperties that are shot with DSL ours you know professional photography equipment sell anywhere from as much as as little as nine hundred dollars to as much as a hundred and sixteen thousand dollars more\nThan property shot with point and shoot cameras or or your cell phone camera right and there's a big reason for that uh the professional photographers are using the lighting for the space um you'll find that if you use a save points you camera the flash and or even a cell phone camera\nThe flash on those units are good for only about six to eight maybe ten feet max\nAnd a lot of the rooms are larger than that um you find that a lot of these rooms probably don't have enough lighting in them or just not sufficient lightning in them so I myself would bring in a flash or a number of flashes to help lighten up the space\nThe biggest thing is natural light you need a lot of natural light ... and I've seen plenty of pictures out there where you know agents of taking pictures of the property of the states are drawn right out of the room was dark you can't see a thing and the answer so you have to have a lot of light\nAnd of course in in in photography you really need wide angle lens ... or you could use the cell phone camera but what you wind up doing is you wind up taking a\nPicture of the corner of the room ... what does that tell you the whole idea with the photography is to tell a story mhm and when you're taking a picture of a corner of a room that's not telling you anything right and so you want the lens wide enough and where you're in the room so that you're capturing at least the back wall and the\nTwo side wall so you have at least three walls and the picture\nYeah see I have a much better feel for\nHow big or how little the room may actually be OK course it needs to be furnished and I'm a couple of tips would be one and make sure that you're\nA horizontal lines are horizontal and your vertical lines are critical brain how you want to make them straight professional photographers like myself would actually post process mhm um all of our pictures um 'cause it's pretty rare to get everything exact\nBut when you post process you can add ... more more light or if you've got too much tied you can take some out you can adjust for the contrast you can adjusted picture so that it's correct right um it's curiously the guy if it's not straight in the picture doesn't do any Justin\nAnd of course the biggest consideration when you're taking photos of rooms is that they're cluttered right if they are cluttered that shows up as a big keep up the mess in the picture\nYeah the thing I tell my clients to when we're talking about and had a realistic appointment this morning\nAnd it's you know having too much stuff it's like the the buyer is going to look at all the stuff on the shelf and they're not going to look at the room\nThat one that in certain ... and then if they have like items on the floor it's going to make the room looks smaller than it is and if you're selling your house don't you want it to look as big as possible especially if it's a small house yeah\nYou want the rooms to look as big as possible and you had the proper furniture and they're actually makes the room look bigger ... especially when you pull the clutter stuff out right um then the people are now focus on the space and not the stuff that's in the space yeah in fact the biggest consideration of course is\nYou actually stays the room for what is intended purpose was to bedroom it's a bedroom right you know unless\nA if it's a dining room it's a dining room but the living room it's a living room and that's how you're going to resent the space and then by having the space furnished\nUm when homebuyers walk in there analyzing the furniture\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in east British generic ended up the best financed reaching unbeatable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto job\nI Do what it can be used for right so by staging your property I'm to the fact that you can it helps to buyers the visual lies themselves living in your house yup\nNow have you ever worked with clients where\nUm they don't have enough or the appropriate furniture so you know maybe take out the old stuff or just ... ... you know rooms in the house are empty I Know I have\nColleagues in New York City and of course those properties across you know tens of millions of dollars they will bring in furniture to stage a house the way they want the rebels who wanted to be stage\nDo you ever like if you have a house that got you know Nineteen fifties furniture and it picked up to about something more modern in there so they reflect in a more modern way I'm\nAbsolutely ... absolutely that we will do that ... wires today want you know something that's more contemporary than something that's out of the ... in the sixties right\nUm and of course they want to turn out mhm now when I say turn key I don't mean that they want to buy the house didn't turn around and sell it right you want to be able to put the key in the door open the door and move in\nYeah and that's it yeah right exactly so yeah these are the real important things
