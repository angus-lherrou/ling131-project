surface\nTen o'clock at night whatever it was\nAnd now the general assembly stepped\nIn and said well you know parts of it but you notice they would not stop them the general assembly would it originally you had this idea that maybe we should make them illegal\nKnew we can't do that how else are we going to take these how are we going to take this see do you think about this house the speaker of the house at the time going to say you can't have this revenue stream after he is already cut off the revenue stream of the car tax\nWrite I'm sure that had to do something with it you know you're going to a aid to cities and towns is going to be limited by the amount of money that the car tax cost them that phase that's going to happen and then it ends right that's it you got to get that for the car tax and that's it and so\nTo raise it the ability to broaden it the ability to to to make more of it\nUm and so it's kind of restricted now they get a replacement now is restricted it won't grow\nUnless the ... the state decides to grow it\nUm and so you know speakers of the house have to look at the cities and towns and say they need to have be able to raise money and if you think this is about anything else but I I listen\nA commissioner Perry was on with our earlier today version of Perry will say till he's blue in the face of these are all he wishes they there was zero tickets because that means everybody and the one thing they have one incident that they basically point too\nWhich is a teenager driver that hit a teacher a few years ago terrible situation the teacher gets hit by a car dies it was an inexperienced teenage driver and they use that as an example that this is this is like a scourge in the city of Providence\nNow or I Would say that a speeding is a scourge on anybody's city right people go to fast that they were rush the city of Providence driving through the city of Providence is one quite frankly one of the more I'm In raging\nI think it was a breast cancer awareness walk or something going on they had the entire city downtown was all shutdown random streets cut off its didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it\nAnd I was a kid and it's hard enough to navigate some areas down there with the one way and this way and the weight of you don't know what you don't know it but never mind closing off random streets and everything else it was just it was completely bizarre\nBut that that stuff like that it's just across the city you you got to dodge potholes you're going to dodge ridiculous I'm\nNo lights that are not coordinated this just goes on all over the place and so people get frustrated\nThen you start adding that aren't too many to finally get a stretch of road where you can drive ten more than ten feet without having to stop a you get a little fast and now they're gonna wacky for the tickets so be on the lookout because the old cash grab\nIs back in ... it's back in session it's uh the grace periods over now it's time for the grease period which is where they grease the you know what they're going to [laughter]\nTo obtain a you know extra money out of your pocket\n\nYeah putting cameras everywhere getting they're getting the or the surveillance state up and ready to go anybody thinks and I love it you know I heard from ... earlier today talking about all you know we were trying to get this right we're trying to make it work would try to do this this is a testing ground in Providence folks coming to a theater near you because I'm telling you the votes of the world the grandmas\nAnd they go too fast down my road they're the ones who show up the city council meetings and yell and scream and against the city council we've all gay and they find ways of\nDoing it that are cheap that pay for itself and it's always nice when your body gets a job with them and is the lobbyist to the city to the to the state for their little place to pay him back and you get played with yet again and why do people in the city in the city of Providence have not made this a campaign issue to the point where people lose seats over this is beyond me\nBecause this is a you know this is as bread and butter as it gets\nI Know Didi Whitman who's running for mayor she said these are gone and she gets into ... into the into the office or halo is there was the uh you know it's kind of a guy the godfather this whole thing and they're not going to go anywhere in to him\nGeneral assembly mitigated it but didn't eliminate it\nAnd one of the little things about Rhode Island I always thought it was really good about the place and I thought I was kind of proud of is the fact that you know things like um\nRhode Island's number one Ford dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like flood out over time\nEverybody gets pulled over without any uh due process I was not due process or or um\n[noise] what's the word I'm looking for when they have or the ability to super outside your car because they have a just cause now and we're looking for you know what I'm trying to say you know probable cause that's what I'm looking for probable cause like there's nothing there\nAnd so this is just everybody's being watched everybody's being monitored everybody's being recorded\nYou know even if it's for a couple of seconds\nAnd then whether or not you're ... you're the owner of the car gets charge whether or not you've driven or not you're going to go to court you gotta go deal with all this nightmares nonsense that doesn't count on your record doesn't kind of a it's a bunch of garbage it will\nIt just a matter of time\nThis is similar this is my you might as well have a toll here this is similar to tell because if it's ... again I bring that this issue every time and they'll talk about resources how can't be done but the fact of the matter is if it's really a public safety issue\nThan the focus should be on stopping the behavior as it's happening nobody's been pulled over nobody's been told to stop you're allowed to go ahead and to speed as much as you want all day long until ... and if you care if you don't care you\nPay for tickets it doesn't matter so the actual action is never stymied the action itself has never stopped\nIts punished days later maybe weeks later depending on when they get the chicken\nAnd so beyond the lookout folks 'cause you know one more reason to invite the people that this is this you file this under the idea that taxpayers are the enemy\nThis is why I put this there\nAre things that we have the local governments in city governments and state governments do that or you know the the way you're treated the DMV if it takes a long time all that stuff whether it's low level stuff or you know any kind of customer service type of thing when you're not treated properly and to me that's like treating the taxpayers like the enemy\nAssuming everybody's guilty and soon it and trying to figure out under the guise of safety or under the guise of a service or whatever it is that you can figure out a way to put more money out of people's pockets\nThat's treating taxpayers like the enemy speed cameras red light cameras all treating taxpayers like the enemy\nIs portion of our show sponsored by Providence auto body certified by more manufacturers than any of the ... center in Rhode Island is a Honda accurate pro first collusion
