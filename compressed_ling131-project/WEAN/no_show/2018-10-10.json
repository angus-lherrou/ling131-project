P. R. O. from dance tavern on the green hello\nHello Hi Bob you're on the radio okay so here's the story a story Larry\nIn if I had taken my second job offer instead of my first I very well could have been your neighbor and when I think about the fact that you might have said to me hey Bob\nMy daughter's responsible the wife and I are going oh can you keep an eye on the house I may have reacted exactly like Joe a troll ... ah in responding to a\nHomeowner we challenged young men are beating on the door of your house so I\nMuch for that ah Allan Fung by your mission is a C. plus player at best I think I think funding\nHas no chance of winning even if ... were not around\nUh the Republican Party did not have the guts to support Patricia Morgan because she was the only fiscally conservative individual that's running and I was really impressed when I heard her speak in a number of locations that the one belt whether that she uses a\nShe thinks of the nine year old on a fixed income in her uh her congressional and hurt representative district that and how a piece of legislation will affect that well\nAnd you know Patricia Morgan was the only person who came up with\nThe idea of\nFunding wrote works without hanging out a big bond issue that is a giant mortgage on Rhode Island's a future so when I look at Patricia Morgan and what she considered to be the dream team a backing troll oh I\nI disagree a queen ... is an incredible long shot but you know what\nI also voted for Dave Anderson a John interest in a long time ago when they said oh you know vote for John Anderson is a vote for Ronald Reagan or whatever they whatever that diatribe was at that point in time I think a lot of people\nVote for people not because they want them but because they think they have a shot and in this case I'm voting for troll oh it's ... more in in the dream team\nSo [noise] [noise] oh my that's my two cents worth\nWell it was a that's Wil Smith bumped thank you for three thirty pure a toll free one eight hundred three two one number two you email me Dan and she's thrilled to repair dot com and don't get stopped by to dance to it on the green today are easy to find the the north you signed up for his right off\nA well you see the golf course on for three just taken left to the or the light if you're coming down from a root for you know Ninety five and root for in\nA bingo uh you're right here um\nYeah you know Bob had a lot to say there I I I don't have much coral was with any of it uh\nI I just I don't know who the referee is going to be you know what I'm saying who who's the referee that's going to stop this stuff\nI mean I'm I'm looking at it all of the audio from today in in listening and\nAnd I I'm a I'm going through something this ... campaign is becoming like a side show\nUm I I cannot remember the last time we actually had a legitimate discussion and natural organic disagreement between the candidates on stuff that\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's for nearly a century dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nDon't have the temperament for that anymore maybe ... maybe it's just too mundane for everybody maybe it's just something that in this day and age is a secondary consideration I don't know I I feel like there's a lot of you that you're earning for for\nYou know as an opportunity to actually distinguish between candidates on an stuff that matters now you know there was a little bit of the the back and forth and the and and and the antagonism that's natural between candidates last night on the Senate debate on channel twelve\nUm but for the most part I and I don't know what the number is I I I did not check on the overnight number I Know that the governor's debate last week had a very high number an average the six and a half household reading which is a very very significant number I mean there's probably close to [noise]\n[noise] you know forty fifty forty five fifty thousand homes with you know one or two or three people watching I mean that that that that debate may have been seen over the course\nOf its broadcast by near a hundred thousand people are in in the TV market I don't know a which is which is a big number a for local television I I don't know\nWe're last night's debate stands but I Would imagine it's seven eight o'clock in prime time that it was a a pretty good number in itself [noise] or at least those two guys for the most part were directed\nBy Tim intend to discuss things that kind of matter [noise]\nUh and we've got highlights of that we can play for you as we move along here this afternoon or is it that the but I I'd rather I'd I'd written\nOr you're disgusted I just I'm just trying to figure out how are you are you just rolling your eyes and disengaging or are you just disgusted at what has been the conversation on this radio station today a and I mean the you know the Joe ... back it was fun over his\n\n... his car accident in his youth and resulted in a death\nI mean it it's a it's a natural swing back but I\nIt it just ... but but he was drawn into it by Ellen phone that that plan to the story of the gene decided to go with this morning and it became\nA conversation that gets picked up now by the newspapers and now it takes on a life of its own and it's and it's you know I could dig into the actually the middle of the story get engaged in the street and ask you this question this is very cabin uh like in nature\nWhy this Nick Matty yellow get off in this whole thing\nI mean if we want to if we want to play in the nasty sandbox there's no doubt in my mind that Nick Matty yellow and Ellen fun cooperated in getting the story on genes lap\nBecause I Know the same players I I Know the same conversations\nYou know every hosts choices his own choice but I Will tell you that this is not new news [laughter] okay so so\nWhat if you want to go that route what was the man of yellow join in a group of kids scaring the crap out of some Thirteen year old girl who
