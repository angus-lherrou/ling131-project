we can we can accusing we can call names and we can we can\nYou know demand that your job is not and why should he what if he gets more than ... for crying out loud if you really be self esteem and he splits up the Republicans they're a mess they were running around yesterday the one hand to know what the other one was doing all they knew was to get Patricia Morgan out of there because she sided with Joe ... that was the main goal\nSome some of you might say I don't blame them who needs it\nYou're not going to support a Republican what are you doing leading the party right Mike Collins causing money Mike\nHow are you a good what's happening\nSo not much so let's go on about ... seconds criminal Seventy five years ago about looking for\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen

yesterday from Joe ... independent candidate for governor was that represent a Patricia Morgan Republican\nIs going on his team going to go door to door help him campaign try to win the governor's seat that way a ... you know garner more of the Republican vote anyone who was supporting maybe representative Patricia Morgan so they fractured the Republican Party no two ways about it and so the behind the scenes and I was a\nI was the one that was tweeting announcing stay tuned this isn't the last political bombshell if you will and uh\nThey got rid of ... gave her the boot knocked around her leadership position at the state house and they'll they'll have no one until uh after um the elections maybe after the first of the year so that being said I'm this whole idea of it you know I don't know how many people the insiders\nAnd in those that are heavily involved in the campaigns or the ... people who are really invested in politics yeah that group of people they were waiting to see wonderful Patricia Morgan will do\nAnd she dragged it out to be honest with you and she was telling at least me I'll come on your show and I'm going to tell you as soon as I'm ready and then she wasn't ready and uh and then they did this big event yesterday I don't know if it lived up to the building to be honest with you um\nBut it is what it is and they said you know Alan fungus not competent they call them corrupt he's not the candidates got to be Joe ... okay that being said the ... as quickly votes and says she's out of here\nUm got rid of Patricia Morgan they'll have a nobody in the seat until you know until further notice okay so that's her punishment\nDidn't mean anything to you at home all I'm hearing as\nThey did it again the Republicans they screwed themselves over here comes another four years of the same thing and you know what\nYou get what you deserve sometimes if you can't pull together I thought maybe there was maybe ... egos we'd get put aside but silly me I'm always thinking that and the ... you know they might old band together and and ... but it's\nCertainly not now we're now we're arguing over a phone call in a text message and someone not telling the full truth\nAbout the night of a will you support me will you not Alan phone calling Patricia morgue and she said oh we had a conversation we never had a conversation I Robin Smithfield on

... and and the\nWhen that announcement came up yesterday I said you know maybe there really is oh maybe it could happen because I've lived in another state and Rhode Island is so corrupt\nI I hate living here I I think but I live in the arrow every day and I I started doing that and find out what was going on because I had been away from the state for a while okay\nAnd ... when the announcement came yesterday I thought maybe it really could work because of the hourly I met her and I'm like forget his\nName Kendall I've you know we have an ... ...\nTrying to deal with your phone yeah\nMm

the people in your life how many people are those people\nWho take a situation look at it as a as an opening and go full on extremist on you\nBecause every small thing or every um loosely related issue is now the symbol for the entire a battle\nAnd this is what this will be ... ... where are the normal people do the normal people still exist do the normal people still in this way I think when you're normal you don't go off and put on a stupid pink hat and scream and yell\n\nWhen your normal you don't go off you you look for the best you try to figure out the best when you're a normal average everyday person you see the world as a giant struggle for power between genders\nAnd races and political parties and other you know you you don't walk around it's kinda like um [noise]\nYou know you see the world is human beings flesh and blood stone brick you see the world you see the UC of building the tree and you see a\nWalls and carpet and glass these people see like the matrix movie the matrix when they started looking at the code\nThe coach just comes down and it's just all ... it's just all like the ... ones and zeroes coming down they see the code and all that is as ones and zeroes fighting each other the whole time\nOff and on and off or not that's all they see they see everything that goes on and you know the celebrities that get involved Amy Schumer gets arrested that Emily ... or ... whatever her name as she gets arrested oh they sure they can what they can pack their Instagram feed with it\nAnd show off how will they are\nWhy will because probably well they they live in a world ... namely Hollywood that treats people like\nWell treats people like a commodity your body's a commodity\nYour uh your your looks or commodity everything that has surfaced about you as a commodity\nAnd you're now you're you're you're you're social media falling as a commodity and so they take that demented world and they projected onto the rest of us where it's so therefore it because they live in a world where you're treated like cattle treated like a pork futures on the on the stock market that the rest of us act like that too like the husband and wife\nSitting in their home tonight after their kid gets home from school can't have a moment where they're sitting on the couch together drinking some tea or having a a little quieter drinking a glass of wine and just thinking about what a great life they built together that doesn't never happened\nActually what's going on there secretly is that the whites dreams have gone on ... because she kept equal to the husband the husband using the patriarchy to keep his wife down the house they built was was actually just the symbol of the oppression because now they are slaves to the big bang stairs who want to steal everybody's money\nAnd quite frankly the um the education that they're funny what their tax dollars is is corrupt unfair and completely and totally I'm\nBiased against people have different colors and different creeds and quite frankly what they should be doing rather than enjoying themselves and have a good night together they should be out there protesting all the justices in the world\nAnd since most of the Ninety nine\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than any jailer around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our high car buyers are tough\nEasily they're more easily can't a camouflage in the mainstream but they are extremists they are are people who either you're coming to different people different stripes majority of what your negative I think there's some good people out there that really want to make sure that those who don't have a they can't take advantage of\nThe new societal norms that exist out there are are hurt and treated like human beings those people I celebrate because those people are good to give you a voice of the people out there who don't have a voice then they have the others who just want to watch the world burn\n\nThey have a a diseased way of looking at the world they think it's either they either filled with resentment or they just want to watch the world burn because what they get to go ahead and get pick a fourth or fifth\nShot at a a Marxist utopia is that what they're looking for and so what they do is they adapt the adopt these philosophies where human beings don't have any sort of interactions that have anything to do with cooperation with love and respect every interaction human beings have is it is all about power\nAnd so with that demented thought process they go out and they look at everything through that's like looking at the matrix with the ones and zeroes you look at\nYour wife you see your wife you love her you want to protect her you see the mother of your children to the person you're going to build the life when you can sit there and hopefully when you both a hundred and five years old hold hands and die\nTogether after long fruitful life\nHopefully you see your husband is the same thing or you struggle together to to make that happen all your work together you love each other you you'd go through you have hard times you have office ups and downs you give each other meaning that is what you see because your normal the demented people think you look at your wife or your husband UC ones and zeroes what have\nThey done for me to day how can I get over on them how can I squashed their dreams how can I make them more of the way I Want them to be how can I take power from them how can this is the way they think\nThat is not rational it's not normal it's not correct but these are the people that get all the time in the media\nAll the exposure on social media on line the ... and I'm thinking that you know while I'm listening to our lean on with terror earlier today talking about how I think the democracy as she thinks the democracy is broken I don't think that democracy is broken I don't think our representative republic has broken\nI think we are broken ... or or at least we think we are broken\nBecause we'd allowed those with those with a larger voice than they should probably have to tell us demanded things about ourselves that are not true\nAnd until the rational people who realize it's not true speak up louder ... and ... or ... or just say All right be quiet and slumped these people off and actually show up on mass\nUm it'll continue\nAnd then what happens is those regular normal in the middle people start to have to take sides and they become extremists by ... by just the nature of having to survive heads intimidating Ted you're on WPRI Ted\n... a good\nTime when I met ... yes I Can't go ahead yeah I I'm\nNot going to vote is going to go have in our way I feel like he drank out here trying to monetize their their vote and\nThey what they want to go to a final vote they're not really you know because the ...\nYou know they're trying to go vote is actually going to the road we're in this final and the final vote though I Know you're a true\nThat this guy can get I get confirmed that all the activity in the last week mhm it just it would be true I mean like another election victory guy actually confirmed though I just want you to know that\nI think that it's not going to happen tomorrow I don't know why dumping critical on I Hope I Hope I could call you on Monday Night well\nYeah I don't know I Would say well see I have no idea I mean when they scheduled for tomorrow the main vote they did a cloture vote today which they pass through forty to fifty one I'm which means that the debates over and then it gives you the full\nUm is it the homes don't you thirty hours they have to wait for thirty hours after that and they can go and do the full vote and I think it's going to be tomorrow it whatever it's more an afternoon Steve's in Providence Steve you're WPRI Steve\nAnd like I like how you get to the psychological core of the

manipulated any which way and it has created a mess\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury him ...\n... listen if you want to solve all the problems we have in our society there they they originate from us and so if you don't look at the psychological the sociological if you look at the way we interact and see the world and see that I mean you can sit here and talk about political strategy all day long but the fact of the matter is\nUm that's those are the physical mechanisms by which we are you know manifest the stuff that the baseline of us right the the foundation which is our psychology the way we look at the world where we viewed the world\nAnd uh and I think that there's so much of this now it's pervasive in our society where we just look at everything that that has um\nThe D. construction of our everyday uh systems in institutions in from the family on\nUm it is it's going to have it has records to it and if you don't if you if you constantly look at the the institutions that have kept mankind them live on mass\nEspecially western societies institutions including by the way the ability to reason the ability to honor the individual the ability to have a baseline of sea thinks the call a baseline of rationality to which you would hear see this is the difference between I think\nArlene in a very uh very and I think a student\nI'm a\nReferencing this whole study she talked about talking with Tara the thing that Arlene was was mentioning is that you know it did happen to the time of Madison and have whatever and yeah I did and but the thing was there were these ... these uniting values these people walked in and it seems to me based on the history that I Know anyway that there was always a possibility\nAnd it was a an accepted value that you could ... way somebody with debate they didn't want political parties because political parties stopped debate from happening\nYou know what I mean I mean to political parties happened because you know it's just a natural way of things but they were you have to convince me with your logic give me a good debate make me move me with your words and\nMaybe I can be swayed to your point of view and they took pride in that and that was a shared value when you when you literally think\nI just ordered a book on post modernist and by the way they're gonna start reading this guy Steven Hicks if you really do 'cause they there's a lot of those these philosophers that are creating this post modern philosophy has now infiltrated\nUm a lot of our thinking but if you live in in some of these post modern voting people both imposed monitors believed that literally logic is a tool of the oppressor that logic itself as a tool of the patriarchy\nIs the two of the western culture as the ... like it's not something that actually works that doesn't mean that that that actually will lead you to the truth it's just an oppression tool\nThat men created to keep people down\nI mean I don't know what to tell you I don't know what to tell you Bob's more Bob your WPRI Bob\nI um yeah I just wanted to point out something so if you look at the age group or\n... a lot of the purpose of the yo yo ... or you know twenty thirty thirty five yeah and if you look at when housing market crash occurred in ... and then we had a recession a lot of these kids are getting out of school ... they couldn't find jobs because of the recession under the Obama administration\nAnd it's also a double a double hit because it's also the social media generation so\nThat's a lot of reasons why I'm not really going on but it's a lot of reasons why the ...\nYou know it was once said that that would work shopping yeah I don't mind\nYou know you know and you know a lot of these kids is or pairing\nGreat I got to tell you it's a it's a great it's a great point\nUm because you know what's funny is and this is one of those things I Know I talk about a lot on the show because I'm just in it continue to be impressed with his mindset and also others that they're around him but there's a doctor Jordan Peterson talks about this all the time where the young people in this country had been set a steady diet\nOf rights and privileges yeah\nWhat they haven't been fed is responsibility not responsibility as a burden like here's a here's a lead way his ... and you have to carry responsibility is a thing you adopt in order to grow and achieve something it's a way to control your life their\nTheir entire existence the Penn is was looking at social media and come home they did\nNot have work right they had all they were able to do with say\nIf they did was work that couldn't get it couldn't get it done for them right they ... they were fed this idea that they had to go to college and take on ridiculous amounts\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lighter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln and Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Marjorie impeccable surface\nThey can and they you know my parents told me you're you're going to college they're going to college you're going to college going to college

B. R. O.\n[noise] some mass Allen's show news talk Ninety nine seven FM and I am six thirty\nWPRI your yesterday on phones had a a at a press conference having to do with the uh this is my guest is criticism of some things are going off the C O T and they ... he's not going to\nPush the whole issue for some remove the tolls um [noise] now how that works will be interesting because I don't know whether or not [noise] whether or not there's an executive function that can just go ahead and take them out or just not put them up for because ultimately\nThis that's that revenue stream is there to to pay back the bonds I'm going to be used to borrow it have to fix the roads and bridges apart a road works and if you don't create those um those those tolls those cancers if you know create that system I don't know if that's a breaking of the bond covenants or not\nUm unless you just ... I I Can't imagine if you just say yeah we'll we'll we'll pay you obviously I'm was going to give this you know we're just gonna give you the money rather than go ahead and raise it off the backs of truckers that the I don't know if that's that's a big deal but you know you got to I don't know how specific those things get\nBut for me\nThis is one of those things that people\nAre missing the boat on and I get pushback on this all the time 'cause out whenever I see a story about this always posted on Facebook page and make a commentary just to kind of push the agenda there a little bit and the agenda being that if you're going to have a\nInfrastructure that is going to be that it's something that everybody uses in benefits I mean it's probably one of the things that government provides that\nAll of us it's somewhat I mean you can ... it doesn't take very long to be to be a to B to figure out and then there's like a lot of what is it what are they called the steps of of removal or whatever it is steps away to figure out a way that you directly or or very closely indirectly benefit from infrastructure\nMean everything you buys you hear from the truckers on their uh their ... their commercials and everything you buy is brought here by a truck\nUm and so whether it's supplies that you purchase of the grocery store medicine to just getting to work every day or getting back and forth to the doctor and be able to go for more business world I mean I Do need to tell you this that the infrastructure roads and bridges and the state of Rhode Island across the country are\nCritical to us getting anything done and to me that's something we should a burden that we should all share and because the powers that be overtime have determined that the the tax dollars we spend\nOur now to be divvied up into a into basically for it to get involved in every permutations of existence to the detriment of our infrastructure that now all of a sudden we got to go out and we got to find a Patsy\nWe got to go find somebody to blame for all this the argument that the governor makes that the trucks are the ones who do all the damage and all that horsemen nor is complete malarkey\nThey use the roads yes they do\nThey are ... they are convenient Patsy for the governor to point to so that you don't get upset because you're not going to be paying the tolls you will however\nThis is an absolute and I've been yelling about this this has happened and I pray to God it's somebody's such a listen once in a while but then at some point this is an absolute\nInroad to totaling regular people on a regular basis in the state of Rhode Island you pay for roads and bridges already who your tax dollars and if you let them go this way they will double tax you in this way and it's it's unconscionable\nOn top of that even if they don't to target one specific business in one specific way is show against what government should be doing\nHiding it as a user fee and also the garbage is completely the antithesis of what we should be doing this state for businesses in general that there should be in my opinion one of the many things you decide to do when you when you look at ... and and take into consideration when deciding who to vote for\nAnybody that goes about and I know Mike re other communications guy over at the uh the governor was with the governor's office now with the campaign loves to throw this round this this is the BS line they feed you that if you're against the toll\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than

no business being symbolic of\nUm you know that\nNonsense that goes on where we start to take things and brought them out to to mean fifty other things that they really have nothing to do with is like one of the more disgraceful things that happens to modern\nPolitics um it really is a vote for bread cameras a vote against women okay do you really listen to yourself\nDo you hear what you're saying does that make any sense to anybody who's not brain dead\nBy\nRichardson foster Richard you're on WPRI hello Richard I'm hello I should I tell you that that\nJust about those polls they caught a fly because there's so many ways around this little mini state of ours hey wasting their money on that one\nWell here's the thing uh so far they have what to up to any side on ... and it's and it's that bringing in more money\nThan they thought that they say anyway no all does that does that that that could change once the state is littered with him right so one sided but\nHere's the story I'm a retired truck driver I'd go tractor trailer for years I were in on the road to Chicago and we play soccer stadium big enough for them to war if that many colds so he'll spend more money than what they'll ever bring in trust me what I tell ya ... as\nWell you know you might be right but either way I don't care if it does I don't care if the thing if rates in a ton of do\nIt's not right oh of course a lot ... it's not right it's not fair to shouldn't be there\nThat's right and they were actually only hurting themselves because you know what when these drivers are going around to get away from those polls and the ones that will lose it out\nWhat's going to end up happening Richard this is my prediction is that this will stay there as a matter of fact Allen Fung became governor tomorrow a joke so became governor tomorrow the speaker of the house has already said that these knock them this is not going anywhere it's going to be a campaign promise that will not be met because the government won't have the power to do it\nIt'll stay that way and it won't become a thing until it sits right on the on the heads of the people who drive to work every day and that will be sooner rather than later most likely because the court's going to say well you can do but you can't just pull trucks\nAnd so they're gonna go after everybody with these things that's next I guarantee it oh yeah I\nI Believe it I really believe that when you were saying before about who can afford all that water those thousand dollar or you know well I guess for our go don't want to kind of water\n[laughter] they\nShould have been why the million dollar treasure chest or has lowered it\nWell I don't know what if the people at the campaign headquarters of nice like Seventy five it's

themselves that just when they have the money that they splurge on things like that\nI just I don't I think even if I had that money if I had like fifty grand to blow on something I Would feel like this uh this old school guilty to see some of these old people that are rich I mean they're completely loaded and they won't spend the time\nEven though these people are like they're old eccentric people like my ah well I I tend to start my father in law tells me story but an old neighbor of his that was completely eccentric and I don't want to I don't know if I should tell it or not but\nUm I

laugh out loud funny but he said something today earlier to tear up can we played cut three here from it from that interview a Alex please\nNo one really asked the question you know what is Joe what is Patricia really getting out of it you know what the hell did he end she caught with Governor Mondo 'cause we've seen historically\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again for foreigners over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right and one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nCutting deals with our governor [laughter] people are getting frustrated because of what's going on and Smith hill for years and that's what Joe trail Patricia Morgan represents [laughter] look Joe without a history of cutting up at the state house for sixteen years I don't promise jobs with support\n[noise] watch [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nOh what a straight face [noise]\nI don't promise jobs for support Allen stop it I mean you know what it reminds me it reminds me of this that zone from a candidate for governor Cranston mayor oh this I can promise you there are no cramps and city jobs benefit hired because of support [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nYou know I just want I just want as a citizen I just want someone to be honest when they're running for office\nThe patronage system is built into the political process it doesn't make you a bad guy you know I don't promise gestures he's\nSo full of it he's so full of it\nI don't know what is natural I color is put rhetorically in is deep brown\nShe's so that he doesn't have an original it seems the most disconcerting\nThing in the world I Would love to support the Republican candidate for governor I wouldn't say Gina Raimondo upended\n\nBut it's just a shame by roads fought Liz vacuous empty garbage coming out of this guy's trap\nIf you just [laughter]\nDon't let me tell you this when Ellen ... loses this race it will be because the Joe ... it's because he's in ...\n\nOh my God what is he coming in here again so I can tell them all these things I ... I get my I gave him a stern talking to last time he was in here now I gotta sit there and go through all these stupid things he's saying as a really uh you want to go down the roster Cranston city hall ...\n\nOh they're insiders me ... they're insiders the Republicans have been knocking under the image I have the I I I I don't know if there's actual audio that goes with this number ... ... ... ... I never asked Alex or or or max define this but do you remember\nThe the movie Rudy I Love Rudy\n... if if I'm flipping by television when they shouldn't be and Rudy comes on I stop everything I I miss appointments you know it's you know it's one of those movies those ten movies that you can't stop watching you know you see the Seventy Sixers\nAnd you already have the video I mean I have the DVD and if it comes on TV I still watch it\nAh [noise] which is really done by the way on my part\nBut you remember the scene you know when he finally gets to Notre Dame and he's and and as a student and and he wants to go he desperately wants to actually I think he's on the practice squad and he just he didn't have a ticket I think\nHe's already on the ... I Can't remember the chronology but I think he's on a practice run in ... and ... and then I Would take and he wants to get in and the game is going on and he's and he's in these kind of jogging around the outside of the stadium and you can hear the roars and you can't get it\nYou know later we figure out the figures out a way to get in through the custodial ... to the window we kind of price would open\nThat's how the Republicans have been in the legislature trying to have an impact on the way this place runs do like Rudy outside the stadium\nI mean you I mean and and every ... is the thing is everybody knows it\nSo that's why Alan ... and his people and who are the rocket scientist to keep telling him to do this kind of stuck with ... ... keeping him just this way\nThose people have to be collectively as stupid stupid like Forrest Gump stupid\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new borders games for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nThis comet you've been cut three run that again would you this is this is the one that I Love them if I'm by the way I'd rather talk Red Sox Yankees so we're going to get to that you know sooner or later this is a big night tonight\nIs it ... this is this the way it's supposed to be another way to get predictions about the series just give me right now and for three eight dirty bureau toll free one eight hundred three two one WPRI just play this this this this this comment is reflective of the Rhode Island disease\nYou know one really asked the question\nYou know what is what is Patricia really getting out of it you know what the ... the end she caught with Governor Mondo 'cause we've seen historically because those to walk the state house for over two decades now that I'm even supporting the governor on her pass budgets with millions in corporate welfare and expanding our sales tax [laughter]\nAgain again\nIf you know how the state house works and without a line item veto and without the kind of and the guy the guy did whether they voted for or against the budget was meaningless they've never had the numbers them and the impacts of what they do is they try to get a little bit a little bit actually I Will tell you a lot of things you know how it happens\nRepublicans will come up a good ideas and then they have to wait two years when it comes out as democratic ideas\nAnd so if they if they're too much you know ... and a China shop and vote no one budgets they just don't ... them get hurt at all\nAnd end these days Republicans in conservative Democrats are starting to come together a little bit because it's the progressive Democrats that are about to take the place over and so there's a little bit of a kinship they're mostly on your on your tax paying ... you know asked saving\nBasis benefit [noise] God\nDavid Cranston Iran to repeal row hello Dan I'm I'm I'm completely beside myself\nWith this governor's race because\nUh you know with Gina Raimondo that her handling of the U.

I got some news if he hadn't said anything and had resigned this'll depends still weren't going to like him so I don't think he's necessarily drawn a line in the sand from once he cannot return\nIf anything that only would have happened had he said something else you know in the in the negative and like well never coming back here then it would have been well okay we don't like you and here's why\nBut yeah I mean I'm Glad that he said it and it's encouraging if you're a Celtics fan for sure that he came out and uh and felt that you know he wanted to say it and it was in a good position to say it but yeah until you actually signs that extension that it's all really just talk\nWell and the thing is is that it's not going to happen until the end of the year right and I think what we have is\nAn agreement where everybody knows that it's going to be the most amount of money right I mean there's there really is no negotiation it is he going to stay or is he not\nAnd I want to look up an old article from um a Boston dot com and I was a little off on the numbers\nIf if are being left he could get a ... worth a hundred and thirty nine million\nWhereas if he stays here he can have a deal uh up to one eighty eight and then if it's the supermax you get into the to hundreds it can be anywhere from just under sixteen million to eighty nine million then he could leave on the table it's really all about his\nWhat their Chevy GMC ...

incredible prices are going to flood auto John job now\nWell it's never going to be what it was and I mean a lot of things on a daily newspaper for one so I mean I understand that its evolution and baseball doesn't have his grip on America like it did and even going back porch in years it's never going to reach those types but that said I mean clearly\nYou know there's baseball playoffs going on and this is a lot more appealing than you know Rockies brewers for instance I mean people you know around the country can get into this and and the fact that\nYou have two of the top three teams in baseball in the first round series that enough itself is good and then you had all the cause of the history and these two teams and the cities and yeah I think it's really good at the same maybe it'll never approximate what it was back in the day\nThen I Know that it's going to work out for us we get Red Sox Yankees buddies baseball doing it right should these teams be facing each other in uh divisional series\nUh yeah I I agree with you on that I think that I was I think the winning the divisions over rated in all sports it hockey's got this going on now when you had Boston Toronto in tamper all play each other the\nFirst two rounds you get two teams eliminated too quickly so uh I Would have been the seeds play the wild card game and then and then received from there I just think it creates a little bit of unfairness and my God you mentioned the victory of the Yankees lost that game winning a hundred third best record on after one wild card so but\nYeah I still think you know you've got eight teams left to the top three are playing each other early so that's that's not their\nPinch honesty the Boston Globe here on the ground show on WNPR oh Chris Sale is a great success against the Yankees this year I Know we didn't talk about it in the press conference the other day which I did make me chuckle because then as you and I know sitting through those press conferences asked a question don't make a statement but anyway\n... score and said that sale is healthy where are you at relative to the expectations for sale heading into this postseason\n[noise] well I think no one knows and that's one of those scary parts about this if you're [noise] root of the Sox fan and he really wants and the way you just the team that they can't possibly know what they're going to get tonight which is not what it was like in April May June July ... ... or last year\nSo this is a game and they are they're hopeful that set all the positive things but no one knows there's no evidence that he can be\nA Christian Bale that everybody loves today I mean you might be that guy and they were holding back but it's alarming that he's pitched you know Seventeen any since July twenty seven and had the lowest fastball velocity of his career this last outing and was unable to stay in games so\nAh how that magically turns around and they say yeah well this is what we had planned all on to this was the pastry said bullets they'll look great absent that it's going to be like they knew he wasn't the same they couldn't on it but they had to take a shot so it's one of the other\nDay and where are you on David Price I admit Dan I'm hoping this guy rich through the post season at a record rate and that he thinks he can opt out and maybe get equal money with some more years tacked on like I'm hoping he does well enough that he walked out the door\nYeah I think it's too much money I don't think it can replicate the money and it kind of an opt out even if he's MVP of the world series I just you know the numbers aren't there at his age with the elbow the last year but I understand what you're getting at 'em hey if they can have the price who pitched you know\nJuly and August or you want that guy even at thirty one million and uh it's just an enormous amount of pressure he can't get out of it you can't get out of his head I think that it's exponentially I think if they lose the game tonight it's just it's so much war for him so much more pressure that he's just a guy who thinks about it a lot and I think that accounts for the\nThe terrible postseason record for a guy who's really been to a dominant starter asleep protected\nDan Jones see in the Boston Globe here on the ground show on NPR oh previewing Red Sox and the Yankees who has the edge and manager Dan\nI

know over you know in a short series\nI really think it's your talent I think it's more the managers more the long haul and you know they're here for a reason hay and that an eighty six and John

translates into this this event five game series but overall they have no one who's done it in Boston no one and I mean every guy has something to prove that there's a lot of\nThere's a lot of bad

prepared for if they get called upon yes such limited practice time now how do you go about balancing that it's very delicate\nWell it's it's math I mean we go ahead and and we will practice with the the starting quarterback for the wraps it and then the second team go get to and then we'll go for more reps and then the backup guy get too so you know it's it's less repetition but\nYet equal amount of times in the film Rome and uh do under numbers called you know with the\nYou know the the amount of work you've had through spring practice in training camp feel like you've got a pretty good chance you know get on out there and perform and then it just becomes a question to the backup like wouldn't veto came in last week to step up and be able to make a couple of throws what she had a couple of near misses for big place\nIt's the one hundred and third meeting between brown and your eyes down at ... stadium it's for the governor's come and you are I head football coach Jim plumbing is with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh college when you flip on the tape of the brown bears what jumps out to you\nKnow what jumps out to me is that you know defense of leagues over there they run around they they're into to a new freedom scheme that they have been working in the past\nAh they've got some big bodies up front and really big bodies all through and so they they've been playing extremely hard on the fence outside simply you know the quarterback that can run it and sling it a little bit with the no three really legitimate receivers of big tight and that you know kind of has a little ...\nFlavor to them and uh you know they do a bunch of you know reversed type things perimeter things that attack you that you just got to be really conscious of how you fit each each and every play so I think that they're a team that is going to come in here and there everything on the line\nAs a fill Estes him saying yesterday you know they don't have many opportunities come in and face wrecked opponent put all the records go out the window this is for the cup you played in it you understand the the rivalry and\nYou know we really do it to our fan base and are you know people in this state that support us to go in there and play a very good football game and get that governors cut back here where it belongs\nYang coach I Know they're playing in that game it's a whole you know be ready for the unexpected huh that's nice to say but as a coach that kind of thing that can keep you up at night can\nYeah you know you try to prepare for it you know I Know that there's some along the line tomorrow there's going to be you know a special teams fake there's gonna be something that\nUh you know that that they try to do to us and it really becomes question who's going to pull their who's going to shoot their bowl at first we got them some things prepped up as well so\nYou know we'll see who's going to fire the bullet first unusually opted for bullet goes than the other team response so\nGo play that one by ear and well you'll be able to witness it tomorrow\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and

don't drink the Kool Aid you know you're not as good as you think your your you never really as good as your really as bad as like sharks you're always somewhere in between but a dark live at a very good mindset leaves the verbalize things we've really been hammering home which is to focus on\nReally the next game going to want to know if we can really when you break that down at one point in time so you know how we handle at first it becomes a critical piece\nAnd so when you look at how we we slept without versus Harvard and are we spoke outburst Delaware really there's no good character this group and I think they're really just focused on\nAnd he'll continue stucco where we've been lean into when Carl I'm all for years and you're on the fifth now and I think each and every game as an opportunity to put it when we come get us closer to ...\nI'm going to ask you a question that I Know you're going to hate but it needs to be asked how do you address\nAfter this game how do you address\nThis team with six see a game to go and you know that the playoffs can be had do you discuss the ... word with the team knowing that it's a goal and everybody is thinking about a coach\nHow do you go about balancing that and telling them hey you guys still need to work hard but this is what could be within reach if we all work hard and stay together here through the next seven eight weeks\nYou know I think our kids you know already understand that I lay out are those goals or we go into this and our goal has always been a single minded and that takes care of everything has to be conference champions ah we've got a long stretch a fetish of the ivy league this weekend\nA see a game so I think our kids are really adopted and didn't believe it and the value on one of the time I think the benchmark of any season as always for me is able to get that number six\nAnd you get to six we got to pick up four and five so I'm In a pretty simple terms that math equation but when you get to six you know you got it when the thing that we've got to find a way to get to more and I think you get to Europe or to the end of the playoffs\nAnd I think our team is you know mature enough and dollar trouble enough about the system so that it is a possibility but there's a lot of work to be done\nAnd I think you know the focus for the present them is that we had a very good September we got we have to have an equally good October and then you have an opportunity to go and play those games that are truly do remember that the fire whether or not or chicken or with a chest if the play offs\nNo question and and coach I Know that on a November seventeenth your plane New Hampshire and that is way down the road but\nIn Nineteen Ninety five I was on that field when we lost the Delaware I Want to say it was twenty four to Nineteen we ended up seven and four didn't make the playoffs back in Ninety five it was only sixteen team tournament\nBut you know to think about what could be against the team like New Hampshire\nYou know in a situation like that I've been there and boy gives you a goose bumps I Hope\nThat opportunity is there for ya at the end of the year coach congratulations on a great start I'm Glad to see that everybody is rallying around this football team go grab that governors cup and I'm sure we will talk a couple of times before it's all over here
