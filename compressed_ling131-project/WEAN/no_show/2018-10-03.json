know where she sling it she just is going to stand there and she's going to fight for him and um\nYou know it'd be really interesting to see it as something that she really felt compelled to do you know left at all on the ice so to speak like a hockey player and went to bed at night put her head on the pillow and just said I'm good with that and woke up the next morning and in the same thing over and over again with no compunction no sense of queasy no snow\nOr worry about whether or not she's losing her credibility in the world pass this job or whether she had to cross your fingers and toes or any of that kind of stuff seems to me the way she's you know been full fire at this thing for the length of time she's been since she replaced our guy from Barry ... and I think\nAh I I\nI think it would be fascinating to know but why in the hell is she making this kind of why would she be stepping up to be talking about the president's family life and his deceased father\n\nIt it it ... it all all the all the natural flow of rules\nHas been lost with this administration in in ways that are profound and in ways that are new launched this is nuanced\nYou just expect her to defend him no matter what but\nI hate to break it to her to the president to anybody else is listening that's not her job\nThat's not a job\nThat's not what the tax payers are spending the money for her salary for she's there to to speak on behalf of the president on things that matter to the presidency this particular story is a life critique a it's a lengthy I had a I had a doctor's visit today\nAnd\nI was in there for ... an hour and ten minutes before I got in\nNormal specialists checkup I'm\nAnd I'm thinking this is a nightmare I got through most of the New York times story in the waiting room\nAnd didn't I didn't finish but it's it's it's a lengthy and it chronicles all sorts of stuff that\nWould just kind of blow your mind even if you feel in the end\nThat you're okay with it the weird part of the story by the way I don't know if I I I don't know how many I have no way to gauge how many uh percentage wise of this terrific audience is actually invested in any time to read the story so I can be talking to a very small percentage of people right now who\nCan react to it because they've at least skimmed\nOr read stories about it\nBut what strewn through it I thought it was kind of a peculiar is\nThis chronic reference to real money value today so four hundred and Thirteen million dollars I think is the number in today's value\nIs\nIs the assertion is is that Donald Trump you know I had a running head start in his life to the tune of about today value of four hundred and Thirteen million dollars being data gave him the money\nUh\nAnd so you have to have a calculator with you as you're reading the story because they don't tell you\nOften enough sometimes they do but not often enough they don't tell you what the actual dollar amount was back in Nineteen Seventy whatever uh when you know he was given X amount of money for X amount of things or he had a piece of the action in this business did nothing for it and was paid\nThis amount of money and they keep referring to today real value and I am\nPerplexed by that\nAnd I haven't seen any coverage of the story that goes to it and the answers the question is do what was the objective to do that why\nI uh I Would have been just as impressed to know that\nTrends actually occur between his father and him that you know was worse than money you know three point five million dollars into the money you know nine point seven million dollars I ... you know I I'm I'm is um is loaded\nLooking for a car credit not played well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against it have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log on to what it was tough\nHundred and thirty seven million dollars that's an incredible amount of money and it's quite impressive so\nThe only ... the place where I think people could quickly try to argue hyperbole and biased by the New York times is the use of that real time value unless I'm missing something and you you've seen this you read it and you understood it to be\nUm you know the proper way to refer\nTo the value of these transactions in cash flows and\nWith the times would say fraudulent tax avoidance schemes and all of that if if if if you get why they did that uh bring me for three eight nine seven seven six four three ... pero toll free one eight hundred three two one\nOh nine seven seven six one eight hundred three two one WPN ... I'm assuming she sometimes these things occur and I'm In a rock and a hard place I Want to be able to reflect on what the world is talking about today but sometimes the world meaning you don't have a chance to 'cause you're working for a living you know you got things and do you don't have a chance to to to catch up\nAnd and and read the stuff for the the stuff that is now part of the news cycle landscape and so your reaction to it as slow or delete or you know next week when you get a chance to see here or or at least I just more of what you think you understand about\nA but it is a it's a fascinating read and I honor done with it I guess and you know the doctor says um so I can sit in the\nIn the waiting room and get some reading done\nBut it it is pretty fascinating it really is and the essence of it for all intents and purposes is that while the president has repeatedly said that his dad gave them a million dollar loan\nThan it had to pay back with interest which allowed him to grow this you know ten billion dollar portfolio that he has in the valley which has never been proven\nOr we've never seen tax returns from the president and the other give everybody pause\nA I've never been one who advocated the politicians have to give tax returns but with all the scrutiny you'd think he'd give up something something but he hasn't but this particular investigation bears down that it is pretty clear that a Trump money is is Fred ... money\nNo he did make some moves and he did use some of the money to go is business to the point where\nNot exactly sure what value it is\nBut there's some there's some incredible stuff in his once as saying one person said to me on the telephone today very smart person said you know what bothers me most about this whole thing and I said was that\nHe says the idea that they put the shell company that allowed then inevitably to pinch their tenants\nAnd Jack up the rental fees with this false premise of expenses that were running too high you said that really upset me this is this is supposed to be the every man guy\nWho who in many ways man living exploiting the every man\nOr\nSomething or read or this part of the broadcast ... by province auto body should if I buy more manufactures than any other clues and center in Rhode Island as a Honda accurate pro first collusion repair facility massage Wakefield WPRI oh hello\nI I Can't you know being ...
