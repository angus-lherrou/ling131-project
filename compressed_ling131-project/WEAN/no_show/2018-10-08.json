I'm doing good how are you get a\nCouple of things never won the state of Georgia was written down to six months ago they had a real problem with all kinds of Charles the welfare problems especially around Atlanta in Savannah and the governor Nathan Deal put together a child welfare reform council which which took the best minds in Georgia society along with\nUs citizens group and so forth and started I'm implementing reforms in the system which had a dramatic effect of turning it around\nI think that type of an effort where it's an accurate medical effort will we grow up on everything and all the stakeholders and it would have a great effect rather than just child advocates office but I remember the twenty southern report a member reading and studying it for for an editorial about all the\nImmediate needs which apparently I haven't been addressed or at least haven't been addressed effectively\nBut there's another factor here that we're not talking about there's been a population demographic composition of change in Rhode Island we still have like ten years ago about a million fifty thousand people but ten years ago and for that matter Twenty years ago we had much more ... many more middle class people\nThan a working class of welfare class people that have changed because Massachusetts really tightened up their welfare or a qualification yeah and I was a result people have migrated south and now we have a much greater influx of welfare class and working class or making up ... million people\nSo I have the results are more dependent on government\nWell I don't think Massachusetts has one out of every three I don't think they have thirty three thirty four percent of their I'd have to look it up though I shouldn't misspeak but we have a third of our population on some kind of a benefit and for a steep decides you're talking you know for you to go to the grocery store today that one out of every three people in line or on some kind of assistance as amazing\nIt's amazing that it's catastrophic for our state long term at but a lot of this has to do with the exodus out of mass in the last ... years because those laws tightening up\nAnd and because of the fact that we are known in New England as an easy welfare state\nYes no two ways about that yeah and and have been now for for years so\nBut but we have to have people that have the um the strength of character in our public officials\nTo want to touch the third rail and possibly alienate voters\nActually do the reform that's needed and that's what we don't have what we don't have this

avatar or profile pick and wasn't right wrong or indifferent I mean that's that's their choice they want\nTo do that uh it to to\nTo comment and and throw harsh words towards different state agencies should those people will be blocked\nAnd I I think in all honesty I think the the the way it's done with\nA Twitter I I think they're almost the ones that are just starting to see growth again shorter hadn't seen any growth for many years uh they have started to the last quarter report\nThey were up I Can't remember how much percent but they were the last quarterly report as far as they're like just their overall growth a\nAnd which is a change from the trend because they were they were training downward Instagram has been growing huge Facebook kinda hovers at the same it doesn't go really doesn't fluctuate one way or the other two too much\nLinked in is like the the fast one of the faster growing once linked in an Instagram of the two fastest growing ones out there but it you can\n\nCan limit on Facebook if people comment under what you post you know when the settings as a business or even as a person\nYou can either make it so people can't comment or share whatever you post or you can make it\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen

another comparison\nTo [noise] that I can use as a person who has a blue check Mart other than beyond say because I often say that and I mean God Bless those who are close to me who who here that you know if if if when people ask\nI use that line 'cause it's funny but I mean\nI kind of am the beyond say of Rhode Island when it comes to social media but that's fine I can I can find another comparative analysis or another person to compare myself to um\nAny suggestions you feel free for one for three eight nine seven seven six one eight hundred three two one WPRI oh\nYou can find me on Facebook bend a cash or what the blue jak mark just like just like\nWho you tell me out there who I should do who use the comparison right in the meantime Twitter which I Am not verified on because they they they stopped that whole process it and to be honest I'm not a big tweeter I don't tweet a lot\nFollow a lot of people on Twitter I have some lists that I follow on Twitter that I've I've put together a I've spoken before that I'm a volunteer fire fighter I have a list of what they call fire buffs\nThese are are men and women who likes to go out to fire seemed kind of keep tabs on what's happening\nHave a traffic left meaning if I have to go somewhere I Will\nEspecially when I was working for ... furniture if I had to drive up to one of the stores in ... Cape whatever I Would\nFifteen minutes twenty minutes before I left I Would pull out the the I just checked the traffic listen and see if there's anything major that happened recently on the roads so I was aware of it and it's just it's essentially just as a subset of people and and accounts that monitor the traffic and the same thing with fire and and there's some other things\nOn there as well and so I use Twitter as a tool to help me uh to get around and and and find different things out the other day when they have this this ah roll over there with the\nUm the the tanker truck there on the Alan's have on ramp\nI happen to see on Twitter I just\nLooked at my phone I saw there was an accident so I went to my fire list and I saw that they had activated the the Rhode Island marine or the marine strike task force\nWhich I'm part of with the war on fire department so I called up a a another member I said hey ah [laughter]\nWe might be going for a ride sure enough we we were dispatched to we were turned around shortly thereafter 'cause you know just we weren't needed in the end but yeah you see that kinda stuff anyway that that that's how I used to wear ... I'm not a big I'm not a news person where I'm Out there you know you see all the the\nThe talent here meaning the the on air personalities here even the station in general\nAre on Twitter the various hosts the various radio show CEO they'll use it a sweater to to get news out or to talk about what they're talking about but I just for me again it's it's never been a big big thing I've never been a big Twitter more on Facebook or Instagram or\nYouTube and a Lincoln but regardless the discussion here is about from today's Providence journals are in the political scene you know the Rhode Island agencies that are grappling with or whether they can or should ban is hostile followers and of course that that also stems down to\nA not only agencies but political figures or you know\nThere are local figures who have drawn some scrutiny\nUm because they walk people and\nLook it it's one method it's it's a of of of getting the message out there and some people you know some people sure it will hijacking and and sabotage their the person's ... by getting up there just constantly tweeting a obscenities or\nTweeting you're just just it's\nAnd and so I I I ... I don't necessarily blame\nAh the people for blocking I've watched people\nThe question has come and it was a court ruling about five months ago by a federal judge thing that Donald Trump

buyers are tough\nOr has employed some very strong filters and sometimes the filters work sometimes they don't and\nYou know when when somebody goes on there and just goes on like an inappropriate rant or whatever and just it blocks that you could still click on it to show it but it blocks it but when you if you're an agency or a political figure or a a a a a radio personality a TV personality somebody who is a public figure who\nYou know wants to report somebody continuously just\nIncessantly nagging and\nJust throwing up\nNot even negative is way it's far beyond negatives sometimes it's it's just it's it's it really inappropriate uh comments and just terrible you know things\nFacebook says block them I mean it's usually Twitter they say I'll just walk the person you know okay yeah you want to report this harassment okay you can go through these different steps if you want to report somebody\nThey if you go through it sort of just so it was blocked the person and now the ACLU wants to get involved now the ACLU wants to to to a\nPotentially take some legal action to address the issue if it's not favorably results\nSo\nIt just I don't know it's\nOne of these discussions where who who would've ever thought that Twitter is is you know with the federal courts had to make a ruling on a president's Twitter\nAbout what happens with the president's Twitter people may not

the the anything that\nIs written you know all the notes that are written on by the president or any of these you know major leaders that stuff is archived that's that's historical documents\nWould be at ... forty four right and those are the ones that those are the ones from his his Twitter that are archived that would be All right and Twitter\nTheir\nTheir wise decision making decided to go ahead and secure up at ... forty five at port is forty six at port is forty seven you can't go on and and get those remember when the Internet first came out everybody you know all these these people who are kind of like a early Internet savvy people\nStarted buying up all the major names like I'm going to buy WWW dot Coca Cola dot com and and when Coca Cola once they get paid need lots of money [noise] and then the ...\nSuit started and a cyber stocking rather and\nYeah so you you it's kind of you can't can't do that now and and hold it for ransom but\n... you know you you can fight it in court and do all that other stuff and and good luck but the the\nThis to block or not to block it it's a simple question but it's it's one that you know some people you know they're taking it a bit far\n... states that he's still block from the Rhode Island department of transportation is worried that he's not going to get emergency notification from our duty 'cause they block them\nAnd so that I say well you know uh you just you got to ... you weren't nice\nThey didn't like what you said and so they blocked you\nIf there's no policy set in place then that's going to happen you know 'cause somebody's going to advise that on one of the biggest things I'd done with with with a variety of of folks is developed the policy to begin with\nChurches and organizations you know we've got to develop the policy first or you know how we're going to handle this I wouldn't use it but\nIf there's no ... if Twitter if the platform itself is saying okay you're ... you know you filed a report you you're saying a person's we're asking you the same these bad words saying these things you don't want to hear from a harassment okay ...\n... ... it it it doesn't it doesn't discriminate\nWhat their

Madoff and takes away the title because it creates oughta magic interest already there's interest in a chubby McGregor fight part to McGregor is already call Dana White and said I Want a rematch\nBut if we get suspended and the lightweight title was up again\nThen that's going to lead to Tony Ferguson fighting Conor McGregor so it's one of the other five fights left on McGregor dance card for us see there will be big box office and you're waiting to pay off the rematch and is focusing beats McGregor\nYou can still have to be against Ferguson and to be against McGregor now they're two very different things here there's the booking or the matchmaking element of it that I just laid out and then there is the looming specter of the Nevada state athletic commission\nThey have always been tough in situations like this they because it's in their backyard\nLike if McGregor did what he did jumping into that event\nAnd throwing Dolly through windows of buses in Nevada and not New York we would've been a very different outcome I think in terms of how it would have been handled McGregor ultimately getting back in the octagon\nSee I think those grants if you want to see once this credibility that they so obviously crave a we hear all these people talking about or whether it's Joe Rogan Dana White ... our friend John ... mirror or talk about how that was a black guy for us see this that and the other thing they need to get out in front of this again I think that was great for the sport and I think it feeds right into everything\nThat the fans of that sport are all about and like and that is not meant as I'm not talking down to anybody I Know that there is an entertainment out there for all sorts of people\nBut if they want to be credible if they want to claim his credibility they want to be like the NFL major league baseball they get out in front of this and they suspend him well before the Nevada athletic commissioned even as a chance to open up an investigation\nBecause then they're taking that stand that this will not be acceptable in\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit letter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator one linking of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nOh they didn't they didn't I thought they were terrible eyeball\nThey lost any nor did they cover thanks for your sanity and health and safety bags mundane did very well without that pick coming through\nOh good good good well that's the you know really what it's a worse\nAs a generality than when uh you know usually is when people only point out your losses yeah but it's close second is that noise when when ...\nWho didn't well I don't have enough being a veteran part of the generosity of everything I didn't know that mhm yeah that game went to overtime in Texas and then one twenty to fourteen\nSure did I thankfully for a lot of the better is out there that number closer Kentucky better as I should say that number closed at six so ah but not so lucky for bags modern but fortunate for the rest of the hillbillies that um you know or some of the soil I should say that put some uh put some money down\nAnd you're all over LSU right now [laughter] you know when I saw that score I ... you were the first person I thought a because for the Florida when yeah the foreigner way because I mean when you go ruled out that pick out as like\nOh no no no for me and I'll be ready but you know they're five in on overall\nAnd the thing was that would that game I Know we don't want to get bogged down with this ... a lot of the predictive models or had Florida listed as a favorite which is why I was a pretty confident about them\nYou have the oil missing you will ... road game\nI did not although I did get Arkansas plus thirty five and a half hour they held that number by do believe a point\nTo leave five thirty one that's right a mix but you got a plus you won by the what the point and a half fare and\nThen so back in three oh and one coming into tonight has New Orleans minus six and I have a\nFight scene parlay which you know if you followed me on the action network which is again I Can't say enough about the action network app although I've been just winning pretty much nonstop which is probably why I like it so much but if I team parlay that will pay off a tend to wonder if a New Orleans or just straight up wins tonight\nOh ... I like it yes I like this ...\nBeen very lucky in terms of in this part of latest parlay a included the Carolina Panthers winning against the New York giants so needless to say it hasn't been smooth sailing completely\nHey listen not all of them are big winners they just have to be winter and did you see how the giants Carolina Panthers game ended their grass yeah we'll go through it around the NFL criminal record as limits to that ah how about this uh another country hurt for him when it comes to this fight right\nSo the whole uh how how far we're the tentacles of could be versus Conor McGregor in terms of reaching fans outside the U. S. C. core\nAre longtime friend Leslie Chris has just hit me up on Twitter really saying I'm really need an insider breakdown of the fight from you in the room uh-huh how about that when\nWhen did you send literally guys three minute okay Bye bye I just didn't want to I wanted to make sure that it wasn't center like Saturday afternoon known and you're trying to student off now is what a great\nFriend of ours who just they just came through that a\nA R Fred ... but it goes to show you again the reach of Conor McGregor are and how it gets different people paying attention\nTo the U. S. C. brand which is why I think guys like Joe Rogan and dominant cruise now by the way some of the crews is a champion in USA and has been and said look if there's one thing we have to do is respect the sport and respect each other\nBecause they're people outside who we want watching this who don't respect the sport I think that was his big thing which is there were a lot of eyes on it don't create a spectacle that's what turned into it\nNow this is interesting because to be the day before\nThe fight and one of his open workouts cursed the Irish people ah McGregor is bad I mean up and down right\nAnd then it can be after the fight saying oh no I'm a greater did all of that stuff I didn't do any of it and I don't understand what's going on\nUs all sorted so I took a couple from\nNevada so today there's I Know this is not my besides you know this is not my descent you know I'm ... I'm like I Know understand how people can talk about I jump on the case you know what about he talked about my religion\nTo talk about my counter to talk about my father he counter broken and he broke by you almost have a couple people what about this what about the\nWhite people talk about I jumped over the cage\nWhite people are talking about this like I Know on this\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nAnd uh\nI told you got these guys\nNot on the him was old team\nAnd him they tap mushrooms you know I told you guys when you put him wrong way\nYou're gonna ... you know what happened today like they call him to time also I'm going like toy glasses but today's top this while humble la ... his ear undisputed undefeated deal so I took a job than I Do know and I wonder if it comes to something like um\nYou know like people need to be a\nSmart people I think it's media media a little bit change it my my this is respect sport you know this is not ... this is this supposed to like I told ... I Want to change his\nGame I don't want to people talk about like apartments talk about his father like like\nReligion you're you cannot talk about religion you cannot above Mason and all that you cannot talk about this stuff and you know this I mean we're going to show is\nThem that's nice to be the problem is no one watching the fight no why you went\nAfter McGregor is trainer\nOther than it looks like you lost your cool and wanted to go beat the hell out of someone who did not sign up to be in the octagon and regardless of how much trash they talk you know what it is it's the equivalent I think courage of\nThere's there's always a guy on an NFL sideline who ain't playing buddies barking right will finish people both for the players all that kinda stuff\nCagey in the playoffs perfect example that's great that's a great dropped to play there\nI'm like that happens he can ... white collar McGregor has never stood up there and said I Want to change the sport and make it all about respect but he is never faked\nHe really is he's rolled it out there can be says all these one things and people want to get behind them and go the other way and you know it's interesting it again I keep going back to what Joe Rogan a dominant cruise sit on the broadcast\nThat is a dominant Cruz said he was like we've got to get people to buy into this sport but it's not a bunch of\nCrazy I hate to say Toni Ferguson's because that's the way it came across like those guys are getting the octagon there are a little different to begin with just like people who jumped in a boxing ring but there's gotta be\nThere's there's got to be a point where you draw the line now here's what's interesting is it Dana White\nIs now catching all kinds of grief from the assembled media and the others did they didn't have enough security and whatnot they wind a one point said ah\nAfter that fight we've never had more security for an event then what we had for this fight tonight and it still went sideways on him this was the immediate reaction of us she had Dana White right after that event and doing this\nFor Eighteen years and uh um [noise] the biggest night ever and I couldn't be more discipline and you know you know me I'm usually mad at everything you know not even that I'm ... I'm just really disappointed\nData of you you said that the bus incidents was disgusting that press conference was the darkest press conference ever today you're disappointed do you regret using the bus footage which kind of incest cutter I mean but I mean looking back to kind of how it ended up right now\nWhich is the same again I Would okay or to the store where it could be worse could be right now is there is can be are we gonna be able to talk to them or do you know I'm I think so yeah he'll be here did you get a chance to talk to counter um apple is it and kind of way that in my frame after the fight at all so he didn't\nCare he didn't care about the fire few men in the fight after he was more concerned about the fight\nFight fight what did you say what did he say listen I'm ... I'm a sound given you're caught any of that stuff you know we don't like each other whatever he didn't press charges you know you know he doesn't like Habiba ... in the whole deal but he didn't press charges against him and his team he doesn't care about that he cares for the last five years\nHave you talked to convey right to have not\nWhat did he say to you in the ... who had ... you're talking to him in the article\nA silver beep I said where he's put put my belt on man and I said no we're not going to put the felt on you because I I think that the fans are going to go crazy and they're gonna throw stuff\nWhat their Chevy GMC ...
