complete and really unusual house they've taken a one hundred euro seaside house that when it was originally built was probably never intended for anything other than summer residency they bolted on a

coming up this hour to get all the details on that project straight from the Shia which team\nGoody Kevin O'Connor Roger cooked plus norm ... will be by to talk about a very special miles to reach by

mean that figuratively and literally because not only are you are now but you've been a friend too many homeowners now for\nMany many years in your role as host and congratulations on the forty a season this old house wow\nYeah well he's a forty forty years it's something we're very proud of his you know I Can't take any credit for that I've only been doing it for the last Fifteen or the other boys are at twenty five years ahead of me on that but it's a testament to\nWhat norm Roger Richard in time he started back in Nineteen Seventy nine um that it's still going that it's still popular

com\nKind of a draft these small inefficient summer home to watch probably one of the most efficient homes in the areas and it's been expanded a lot so you need to figure out how to make space for all that in the landscape so tell me about that process because I think a lot of our listeners maybe\nHave never worked with a landscape architect mhm [noise]\nWell we uh we took a look at the lot and on a lot this guy is usually try to use every square inch and a lot is usable Spain ready for the people that are here\nAnd uh so we we took a look at the layout of the new house and try to relate spaces outside or inside so there is a a kitchen backdoor entrance where\nThey come and go most of the time in a trash comes in and out who we placed a grill near the back door a there is the barn or that they're in and out of the new projects it's a it's a family of of of ah constructors\nRight this ... stuff yeah they definitely builds yeah\nSo we created a working yard off that garage in off the kitchen with a a with an old flat open space a little area of of paving little vegetable garden and there's a sliding door between the garage in this open space so it's kind of the overflow workspace\nSo and so it's kind of like I'm bringing the indoors out in the outdoors in addition to carry space where it's just very comfortable moving from one zones in the next ... exactly that's where the design comes in in his eyes from the design\nNow you've got to actually play in the physical elements actually perform what that intent is yes oh yes so\nWe gave them both a in an area of heart surfers in an area of grass a it designed fenced or this kind of the back wall of this space put up a hedge between the house\nAnd the working yard which takes out some of the view of the mess that might be there in the back yard right out of the out of the kitchen windows ... uh and then that's also the circulation space in the back into the back back yard a which is a larger grassy area for their two young boys to get out and do what\nYoung boys do no\nIf folks are listening to this thinking you know\nWhat process you go through if I Want to improve my backyard space what kind of chips would you give them to kind of get them started will either which you mentioned before about relating the inside of the outside is vitally important okay so you can have a great space out saying that you can't get to it\nIt doesn't do a lot of good right [laughter] and and you want to go inside and look out all the windows you know because you're going to live in a in this New England we live inside quite a lot of the time I owe a lot of views out the windows are just as important as the views of the house or the news in the open space\nAnd then to zone those different areas as they relate to the house and then as they relate\nTo the outside property lines we don't really think of the outside as being rooms but sensitive ... exactly in the room and and the smaller the house the more useful those rooms are more important they are right if you got five acre lie to you have a house in there it's usually in line and you know everything kinda bleeds out\nWhen you have a small house like this those outside edge has become more defined\nAnd they become more integrated into the living in the house\nSo all really important things to keep in mind if you're\nYou know if you just completed the summer and you're thinking about now\nIs one of those are planning for next year you got about six or eight months now the start staring at those windows in thinking about those bases that and you know really living through it and your head ... may be making\nA paper model of it I always just because people sometimes can't imagine space and make sure everything fits sack but now the time to do that and that's great information so congratulations on well done project\nHere Tom Ryan landscape architect on this project thank you so much for stopping by the money that great thank you and you'll find this old house and asked those little house on your local PBS stations plus\nFor more details and behind the scenes photos that this little house dot com or follow at this little

types\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Marjorie impeccable\nGo welcome guys welcome you so this is a house where the environment is really at the forefront and you've chosen a type of Turks here\nThat is extremely sustainable and pretty much defines a environmental sensibility for for a landscape let's talk about you call it micro clover what\nIsn't the micro clover is just what it is it's a clover but it's not like the Dutch clover right minimally flowering non colonizing clover okay that we've mixed in with a call to ask you mix and is very trout tolerant\nThe clover takes the atmosphere nitrogen converted into nitrogen at the grass can use so you don't need to fertilize\nHer Roger when it comes to fertilizing and getting the the long chemicals just write that something trips a lot of people up right\nWhere we spend a lot of time on our lawns trying to get them just right and usually it's in the past it's always been a bluegrass lawn right bluegrass lawn so a lot of water and a lot to feed and then you go to spray for weeds and bugs and everything else\nSo this is the type of turf if you see a lot of commercial is it unusual to put it in a residents\nWell we just started growing this in the past few years in right so it's something that's going on we see is the future is going to keep going rancid exactly\nHow does it stand up in terms of like wear and tear I mean this house has has two kids are growing up in it you know the top of that it's tough for that at the idea house a couple of weeks ago here for this old house so they had quite a bit of traffic and cross that lawn and uh I was back there last week with the professor from Penn State that is a research on this\nStuff look gorgeous use a very happy to see so when you put down a side Roger as opposed to\nYou know growing one from scratch once the prep involved or that I think it's the same as we've always been doing right we take what soil is here and we wrote to scare a fire and losing it all All right so that the roots that are coming in can get down into a tank of themselves or get whatever moisture is there\nThen we find grade we'll ... we'll put in some lime if it needs it and they need to see this on\nNow we're in the midst of a parental rainstorm right now I had to eat I just got a health issue with the irrigation today but does it take the same amount of water or less or more than you wear traditional long we'd get\nAnother one of the beautiful things about it is does not use a lot of water and ... yeah we have the effect we have to educate people who are not watering so much\nThat's right yeah at the idea house I've already had to contact the irrigation contractor and say shut the water off the I had enough [noise]\nSo how can you add this to an existing or do you always have to start from scratch with San ... I think\nWith the micro clover you can over seated into it but I Would say wouldn't want to do it into a bluegrass lawn because that's not really a drought tolerant we're on our lawns and essentially right correct and that's just not they're not going to get along [laughter]\nThose two types right now we've put it in with the tall fast you that's more drought tolerant\nThough this is a harsh environment because it's right here on the coast I guess it's an appropriate product for a seaside community\nAre yes it is is your last salts and all that it's actually more of salt resist them blue grass is well that's why I Love about\nThis old house I mean you know you were things that you just wouldn't imagine really exist I mean the fact that there's this very specialized type of side that has all these benefits to it\nIs is so cool I'm In a while you guys\nThey'll always sort of pushing the envelope and coming up with this stuff for projects like that it just you know it just keeps fashioning the audience that's probably why they're around for for forty years now is the end of the forty a season so congratulations on all the good work you put it into that Roger ... some around

need to know is the type of wall covering and the type of wall surface that's underneath\nNow in most cases walls are either drywall plastic you say tell on the field plasters harder smoother than drywall now says drywall has more susceptible to water damage it'd be a lot harder surface to remove wallpaper from\nNext need to know what kind of wallpaper you're dealing with if the papers the type called strip of all moving it is pretty easy you just grab a corner and feel but more than likely it's not which leaves you with two options soaking in scraping Demian off\nNow if you're stuck in the paper that requires just the right amount of warm water wallpaper solvent be applied to it on drywall though and it gets too wet walk and become damaged\nNow wants that wall is wet paper gets scraped off usually a little at a time and it's a pretty slow process and the other option is steaming now with plaster walls you really can't hurt them too much\nFor Dr but once you get any need to be

well own homes come\nWith a lot of old wiring and that was certainly the case with this old houses well lots of wiring that had outlived its usefulness including what would have been probably the original wiring for a one hundred your own home it's a type called not into\nIt with us to talk about the safety of all that old wiring and what needs to be done with it as electrician then Giles welcome Ben Adler you we're good thanks for stopping by the money pit this is a interesting area lots of lots of history right here\nLots of old homes and would you agree that ... it was probably the first ... wearing the than as these buildings\nYeah for sure that was the first modern type of wiring that could be afforded by your average person it wasn't as steel type installation or something that was highly labor intensive to install so it was pretty widely used in the early Nineteen hundreds as one of the first real residential methods of wiring\nNow it's interesting for those that are unfamiliar with not been tube or actually talking about real knobs and real to cheer when it was run through beams you drill hole and it was like a ceramic tube through it\nTo sort of inflate the wire from the wood and then when it went perils of the themes that would be strung on these ceramic knobs and it was essentially an air cooled just so air had to circulate around it\nBut then we decided we were going to have these homes in an installation and what happens\nWell it heats up the other thing I think that happens to a lot and he's older homes as you know in the homes were originally built designed they weren't designed for things like vacuum cleaners dishwashers air conditioners all these modern appliances that we have today\nAnd all of those things these days are grounded a lot of the time so\nWhat you get is people kind of tagging new wiring onto the old system in unsafe way race\nAnd using it incorrectly a and again those systems were never intended to carry those kind of loads coupled with for installation techniques of newer wiring and the and the increased loads of the homes are just create some dangerous situations but the original installation the way that it was intended to be used was actually not a bad one writer has fairly safe\nIt was it was the environment changed around it now for this house here in Jamestown did you find any existing nominate two that are still active\nOh yeah there was definitely most of the house had some now been two minute there were a lot of things tapped off of that now and to just like I just said people trying to get something that they didn't have and make it work with the existing system [noise]\nUm so it was definitely a relatively dangerous situation in this house you know the things that definitely needed to be taken back to narrow and start over\nReal education and I understand that you spent quite a\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood born in east furniture

Brian will be aboard\nHaven't heard from ... in a while I'm really haven't gotten his thoughts on anything that's gone on we'll talk to my ... beds during the second or whatnot but\nPatrick Peterson is arguably the best corner in football the problem is he plays for a team that can't get out of their own way right now and that's the Arizona Cardinals\nNow they did drafted quarterbacking Josh Rosen but that's not going well\nAnd I am I'm going to take ... I I don't trust this former player turned to an analyst but I'm just going to read his tweet ... who is it Bryant Mix at ... ... ah was a defensive back for the Steelers to be confused with Brian to McKinney no this is\nBrian ... mix fat and Florida State seminal ... foreign Pittsburgh Steeler he tweeted out twenty four minutes ago saints eagles and patriots are all showing interest in trading for Patrick Peterson per source\nThat we know the eagles were in or at least according to Florida the eagles were offering a second round pick you out for a Mari Cooper who was traded for a first round back to the Dallas Cowboys you'd have to think or at least I'd have to think they'll do is offer at least that for Patrick Peterson I Would think so ... contract now\nI Know that the normal thought process would be you don't train for ... for a player on another team in okay look ... the league his change if you look in yesterday and I'd have to go to the actual numbers to sort of figure it out\nI Want to say that this past week these past two weeks I should say we're probably the most amount of dime defense who New England patriots have played in probably two years and dined defense means six defensive backs\nSo if everybody thinks they're gross sucks and everybody attacks him\nIf you did trade high level currency 'cause that's what it's going to take to get Patrick Peterson who was signed for the rest of this year and two more years afterwards\nSo you you'd get a first round pick you're looking at four years in an option you get Peterson you're looking at a two and a half years on that first round pick Albany elite player who's twenty eight years old and then it goes from then it's Peterson on one side Gilmore on the other\nI you know I'm looking at the Dodgers series the Dodgers were certainly team in September at one point and I think it's another opponent it on paper right now the red Sox absolutely out class going into the series\nAs you look at the twists and turns up the bullpen has there been anything day that has surprised you either in a player performance that you didn't expect or in the way our score has gone about managing the pieces that he has out of the ball\nBut yeah that that's the one thing in the I'm not surprised that the fact that he has used\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the only twenty eight teams Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of Narragansett on parallel Marjorie him\nBut the guy who surprised me I think ... jump street going back to the regular season was Frasier I mean we really didn't see that coming that was sort of out of nowhere\nAlex coral will tell you that he liked them in spring training we all know that story by now we called it a lot during the season ... but the fact that you know he did it and now he's asked to do it on the biggest state there is\nThat has surprised me a little bit uh probably more than a little bit I think the fact that he's become a go to guy is it's been a big story for this club\nYeah I'm with you on that that it's the old come out of nowhere and you know I don't know if our score has sort of\nGiven Frasier enough opportunities to where he naturally trusted him or if it was kinda like necessity is the mother of invention hey this guy's pitched well I Need someone I got a plug in and give them the opportunity first\nThat's what I think happened I think it was a case of\nOther guys like Matt Barnes are temporary or other guys Scott ... in that role over the course of the season the the season is so damn long I mean so it's bound to happen guys are going to have those peaks and valleys so you should this guy and you remember it through Ninety eight miles an hour in Fort Myers on Saturday afternoon Dylan was watching\nAll of a sudden you know he's he's a go to guy but he he's a great story because he wasn't even pitching in the in the major leagues in Japan he was in the the freaking minor leagues\nAnd you talk about pulling one right out of that that a stack that that's an amazing story but you know I think the starting pitching and obviously what price did if he continues to throw like that\nI don't think there's another club on on the planet right now they can hang with the red Sox because if it's self pitching along ... like this was going to be as effective as they think and crisis found Ninety four Ninety five along with that change up made right out of the gate the Dodgers are going to be in deep trouble as good as as Clinton crushed shot is\nBut you know ... is not the same guy that you and I remember three and four years ago he was Ninety two miles an hour and I still has that the ... of that incredibly funky delivery I think the red Sox will pick up on that but it might take an ending or two in game one before the gates that liver\nKnesset Dave O'Brien with me here breaking out in the world series on the ground show on WNPR oh uh Dave in terms of the bullpen now ... what is your read on Craig kimbrell at this point is he just is this just wondering is that he's going to\nMake all of us freaked out maybe have heart attacks every once in a while do you think there's just a lotta years there and not that he's maybe coming to the end but he's coming to the end up being one of those the lead lights out just kind of shutdown guys which I read on kimbrell because I Know a lot of fans are very split on him\nYeah and I'm I'm with you because I'm On the edge of my seat I'm having a heart attack like everybody else because I'll tell you this it's easier to do the games it's easier to broadcast the games than to sit like everyone has to do and watch because\nLook at somebody said it was you know several of his teammates or maybe he was chipping in and thought he was tipping has pictures in the Astros serious but\nHe was walking people and his is you know propensity to walk people really started in the second half started after the all star break so that continues to be troublesome to me you might be right that that's sufficient that here's a guy who has thrown a lot of ... at his age he's doing a ton of innings\nUsed to own a lot of Ninety nine mile an hour fast balls in his career maybe he is starting on the downside of that but\nI still think he has great performance was left in him and I don't know if I Would have felt that way and not just the way he did in game five I thought he looked really good and game thought that was a long flight all of the one who tracked it then it said he ran down I Know but at the end of the day he locked it up\nAnd the guy does have five saves in the postseason they have all been right on the seat of your pants pretty much but I mean at the same time you feel like\nYou feel like he's gonna get it back 'cause he's still throwing a hundred miles an hour he's bouncing too many curve balls I still believe he's going to get back to to something closer to what we were used to maybe he's never going to be a like a guy anymore but I still think he's got some bullets in that chamber\nDave as I look at Chris Sale right and you know Boston if you if your blood and guts you play her\nYou play well while you're hurt you get a ton of love\nAnd then there's the whole but if you're not performing and we don't trust you\nAnd then there's no way we can lobby and I think that might be the David Price category but relative to Chris Sale he I think he joked around about the whole infection from the belly button rang he was in the hospital there's a photo today where he's got ... giant red thing on his elbow\nWhat ends up with Chris Sale at this point like Dave I really wonder what this guy is going through just to get out on the mound and\nBlood Lincoln is southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of never again ...\nNow the one thing I Will say is maybe this is a great thought\nThat he uses Lucy goosey as you've ever seen him because he is as intense as all get out certainly every fifth day\nBut you know he does have this other side of of him he does have a playful side of him and I think maybe he just wanted to bring that out a little bit now I'm with you you know I grew up here I was raised here I just want them to go out and throw a hundred miles an hour strike everybody out and laugh about it later you know then then let's go for around a little bit\nGet it it is the world series but at the same time you know this part of me thinks Chris Sale is just really enjoying the beat being in the world series for the first time and he's having a lot of fun with it and\nEnjoying it now we'll see what he's got tomorrow night I mean Chris Sale at Ninety five would that slider is probably going to be good enough\nTo compete and beat the Dodgers but I'd like to see Ninety seven Ninety eight again I Want to see the June version of him\nAnd he's going to have nine days now a nine day break that's whether he was in the hospital or not for a stomach you know but he still should be really fresh and really sharp so I'm dying to see what he hits the gun out right away because\nTo me unlike a lot of other guys like with poor cello and even price it's not that big a deal although price was the one Ninety five and Houston that was wonderful to see that was a throwback\nBut with this guy where he is on the la city where he is on the radar gun is a huge huge predictor of what he's going to be like the rest of the night\nDave O'Brien that same with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh the interest of full disclosure I'm not a David Price guy he drives me nuts I wanted him to pitch low enough to be able to leave\nIt wasn't happening he was great in Houston I don't know if there's any carry over day we know what the history was we know what he did most recently where are you add on David Price and all this well\nI mean he got that one done you have to give them all the credit in the ... it's it's only one or you know a guy his talent a guy visibility should have done it many times I'm I'm In complete agreement there but he did it in a in a clutch situation you did it in a closed out game so\nHave to tip your cap I think you also have to give him credit because sale wasn't able to help\nAnd the red Sox basically one that series without Kris sale I didn't think they could do that a big reason they did it was David Price so I think he earned a lot of respect that he was he seemed to be a different guy in that series in terms of how he dealt with the press you know holding his\nIs his son and all of that I thought that was that was pretty wonderful but you know what what he's done so far in a Red Sox uniform\nAnd and the things that have gone south for him I don't think you make up for all of that with one start with one starting to play offs\nBut I Would love to see that continue because if he can put a great run together he can wash all of it away pretty much I think I think it would depending on what he does now in the world series but look at the post season so every star every next start is the biggest star of your career game to that's the case for him as well\nAre you comfortable with ... bats at second base and if so maybe a little back story as to some of the work did move he has been putting in very quietly during the season as to why maybe we all should be comfortable with ... at second\nBut you remember Red Sox got 'em in when Ken's got hurt earlier this summer and of course the ball found them right away you know the very first play in fact there were a couple of plays but he handled very nicely and\nIt's just such a tremendous athlete I don't think you worry about him I I think what Cora is wrestling with right now is what do you do with Jackie Bradley\nWith a slew of left Anders that you're going to face from Los Angeles cursed Sean hill everybody else\nYou're gonna phase almost nothing but left hander isn't and Jackie struggles like crazy against left these even though we had the magical series and the Arabs see as can you expect anything like that again from him or is it going to be a lot more swing and miss so\nIf Jackie doesn't play then obviously you have a decision making and we'll keep bets doesn't wind up playing second base but if you want to keep them in there and obviously Jay he's got to play\nA then then we'll keep playing second base I've gotten more and more comfortable with it\nAnd obviously came up as a second baseman we all know that I think he can play there at least a couple of times you don't have to worry about it in Boston you only have to worry about it in Los Angeles", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Gresh Show", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "22"}
