great offers across their full line shops are local Nissan store and she was Nissan dot com the two sided instead I\nTry to Kelsey for the Kansas City chiefs and Rob Gronkowski pour the patriots to this point this season Kelsey is ranked number one advanced points per diem Rob Gronkowski has ranked\nNinth twenty eight catches for Chelsea to this point twenty three for ground cows and on the year three touchdowns for Kelsey and one for Gronkowski you\nChris continues to I guess deal with\nWhatever his ankle stream spraying ailments he is he's playing but he's not maybe a hundred percent\nYeah I don't think he's got a hundred percent I think part of that to before was not having joined Edelman there to take some of the coverage away from him but he still does not look like\nThe same guy looks like there's a little something missing their dog will keep an eye on that obviously with Rob Gronkowski you would like to think again last I Want to say last week but really you know asking may play ten days ago against the Colts was\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit letter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln if there were against it unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nWay and the passing game but growing tells me he's a better locker and and the other thing about it too it's not just run blocking ground tells you the guy that you can leave in the past block and he can to nip it can lead help you\nWith a major pass Russia ... he's not doing that and I like Travis tells you a lot as a player I think Nobel checked sort of hit the nail on the had this week that\nYou know tell the is more like a big wide receiver yeah and that's what he is and there's a lot of value in that yeah the guy who critics layer not a great all around ... he's a great receiver he's a great pass catcher in the body is I think that's where he sort of\nMakes his name right I mean plenty of highlights their money a great catches plenty of touchdowns all of that but in terms of the all around game it's not fair so I'll I'll put it this way because Romney Harrison talked about it this week\nSaying that right now in terms of who's harder to cover who's harder to deal with in the passing game it's Travis Kelsey which you have to factor in the health of Gronkowski right now\nAnd just that tells you get fewer miles on a ... you know the same age I did not held in rock house here the same age I didn't know that by Kelsey has a lot less time in the NFL\nThat sort of comes down to see a think he's younger he's not there the same exact age Travis Kelsey great pass catcher but I'm with you I mean if I'm building a team and I need to tighten the guy in taking his drunk always yeah and I think\nYou can looking at different ways look I I think he's been more durable Bronx So you know if you're sort of subscribing to that theory of dependability is more important than ability then you have to\n... a little bit there because he's been up in the past if you're going to document a comparison I Would say that Kelsey doesn't play nearly as physically no he doesn't as Roger on ...\nI mean again I stayed in my case it's wrong but I'm just saying in fairness it if you're doing this devaluation if you want to look at it the other way I mean I think you would have to factor that\nThat into it but to me you know there are different types of titles right not every wide receivers the same you but you wouldn't compare like Julian Edelman and you know Julio Jones those are different types of wide receivers at the same thing for me with Chelsea and Gronkowski Kelsey is more like\nWhat Jimmy Graham was sort of in his prime which is\nMostly a pass catcher where's ground cow skis and all around tied in\nAll right uh this week I mentioned Rodney Harrison had some comments about this match yesterday that also robbed Nick of its former patriot a guy who's played against Kelsey talked about it he's made headlines for going on a radio station in San Diego talking about this very topic\nI mean that's the thing is healthy and I've flown um around like he's a little golf so regarded as one block so when you're on titan and you don't want to block you're not really it is so\nI Would take growing and I'm not just being by it because I played with them and I know I'm just giving you my honest opinion if I didn't know Rob I Would say Ross Baker of the fact that he can block and you see him run in\n... and you see him run in all the different types of route combination plus shooting in the crack people so I mean he's willing and able to do a lot of things that are\nTrue tired and does well he does is exceptionally well so I Would say that Rob is a complete cited and healthy if you're a receiving bigger the earth that got another one block so I Would say that in general\nJust overall broke out is that the height and\nNever play the game because the clay and block the strong and they can get anything with this radio so I mean I think it's healthy and and he can't block or maybe try it\nFor nothing there's somebody want they they'll walk through there but they just don't have the talent ... like I don't want to block you know you feel like that's not my thing I'm not into that like that will be like that and he just wants to\nTouch the ball and you know do all that and you know because the ups and the side of it that you know that hurts so I just think that is but it\nGot pretty personal there yeah Rana ... I I thought it was going to bring up the dating show there Kelsey had yeah I Would say that he's you know Nico not a fan which makes it sound like\nKelsey sucks right and maybe if you're sticking to the full rundown of titan characteristics you say well he just doesn't do half the job so he can't possibly be good he is good it's just it's just one dimensional it's when it comes\nDown to it but I Wonder what an inch and it's really really good agree and that's why I think\nYou know when he says I glorified receiver that's that's not a bad thing ... no not in the NFL teams there's a lot of teams that would love to have every team I think we'd love to have a glorified receiver like Travis Kelsey\nYou know yeah every seemingly even this one that has Rob Gronkowski yeah you'd take him and put them on the other side no problem absolutely that happened once with Aaron Hernandez you know Aaron wasn't doing a lot of law Aaron wasn't a blocker no and Rob Gronkowski was and they ...\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what board and they were they were against it that's right over two hundred for your own cars always all models and incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John job now\nAlongside Chris Jasper getting ready for Sunday Night Football here is ... between\nThe patriots and the Kansas City chiefs I'm now who's ... who's honest we go around the NFL\nIt's presented by big all those T hate New England fans football weather is here cheer loudly support your team and make sure you do it with a mug pull your favorite big low T joined pillows team grab a mug and tea proudly Chris uh speaking of football\nWeather being here a little bit cool tonight for this game it is first time it's going to feel like a ... like fall yeah is that fair to say I think that's fair to say but I think it's a great night for football but yeah certainly starting to get a little chilly yeah sure is I'm noticing more and more people coming in with their winter coats on\nFor this game today a couple of blankets a lot of heavy heavy sweatshirt yup patriots blankets that type of thing or what do we get to some of the games from today including the ones that happened in the AFC East including a win for the doping Miami\nHere is [noise] they say forty seven yard is up\nIt is over thirty one twenty eight till they just wouldn't ... score for the dolphins moved to pour into any perfect three you know plain and homeless\nSeason well the most important thing about this game was that Ryan ... did not start did not play was not active an old friend brought us why Brock Tobar within this game and the lead the comeback\nFor the Miami Dolphins that big win obviously for the dolphins as you mentioned they go to war and two\nOn the year the bears or the next opponent for the patriots they sort of cop this went away warmer dolphins kicker\nCody park he had had a chance to win it in overtime for fifty three yards he met dolphins go right back down in the ensuing possession and they get that game winner and nobody is more happy about it than Kenyan Drake who had a brutal brutal fumble inside the one in\nOvertime for the dolphin ... twenty eight forty four through for three hundred and eighty yards and three touchdowns and he had to pick well he's still ... leave those out you know what Michael bart he calls them ... calls him the heights\nOh yeah the heightened that's his nickname yeah for for ... over as you are now calling him a Pittsburgh got a much needed when today they've started disorder right the ship Chris\nA winning at Cincinnati twenty eight Twenty one of the final score there are Steelers moved to three two in one they have no idea when the bell will be showing up and at this point\nIf they straighten things out without um I just say forget it stay home we don't want you\nWant me to wait on line and hunter has played the way that he's run the football and he did it again today you know you look at it and you say I don't want to sit there and they do they need the guy but if the guy's not interested in playing and not committed to that and I respect what he's doing for a business standpoint but they still haven't heard from him in terms of when he shows up or if there's going to show up whatever the deal is\nJames ... Turner a pretty good path for them yeah so you just sort of keep it rolling in and say hey if you show up that's great if you don't we're going to keep it moving here with James Connor Antonio Brown at the winning touchdown you know in that game and the fourth quarter it seems like he is reestablished his connection with Ben Roethlisberger I Know that you and I are\nHaving some problems with the wife I hear yeah no problem with the wife by connection now which I liked that O'Neill round nice job better authors burger they have a strong connection once again unlike the one we're dealing with right now\nI thought that was a very smooth on your part and if you don't know earlier this week Antonio Brown describes his relationship and and on the field relationship at the moment with a with his quarterback is like why sometimes you have a strong signal yeah sometimes\nYou haven't done it this week but you're always connected as what he sent me the James Caan or they're great game\nHundred and eleven you're rushing you touchdowns ran today a Nineteen carries yeah forget it they'll stay home running backs running backs\nOverrated Chris overrated I Know we're not going to get into this game there you know say calling Barclay continues to look ... right I mean I just want to make a lick a different special player yup no good at going to have a hall of fame type of career the way it looked at this point\nAnd they will still be wrong in New York for having taken a running back before they take a quarterback they will still be wrong no matter what it is I mean it depends on what the other quarterbacks do but I hear what you're saying you know what I mean it's just like yeah yeah you need a quarterback you didn't have one if you have a quarterback the by all means go ahead and drastic one bark\nWell it's a quick aside here I mean I must say this look back and junior I don't condone the way he's got about his business the last couple of weeks yeah you have to be more professional but he's not wrong\nLooking for a guard credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood what born in East Village and there were against that have the best financed reason unbeatable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto job\nThey don't do that or twenty nine I'm Sorry I or they're yeah go after neither do we do we have we got an answer it you know the answer is\nHow he well known jak or hygiene decker ... who is also the voice of Florida State football so anytime I can hear Jean decker ... that makes me how God\nGene or graduate personally I Am even prime nobody else cares about well how can he knew he was that's because we know it's well you know during the national football when I was an older guy he's a very knowledgeable guy knows these things\nAnd you know I'll tell you what was your name on the other ...

slug it much modify wait wait a minute cell phones once again\nHere's my for a trend and Chris Gasper\nThat has been patriots previous to this point now for coffee with the coach ... with the coaches you'll by Dr donuts\nYou have a question for the head coach visit Ninety eight by the sports up or your chance to win patch tickets and a twenty five dollar gift card from Dunkin' Donuts America runs on Dunkin' Scott do lack standing by with the coach\nOr build ... joined now by Patriots' head coach Bill Belichick checking a coach or three games twelve days you can get a little bit of time off how'd the last uh ten days ago prepare for Kansas City tonight\nOr what we needed a few days just to get some rest and kind of get caught up um but I think we've had a decent week this week there her team for for um but we play them on every year here for the last few years so we have a little bit of background with them and their explosive or they do a lot of different things um but ah hopefully will be ready to go to night\nSeems like I could have the same discussion with him about the Pittsburgh Steelers that's always whether you're playing here whether they claim they're the same type of skill sets a what's the one thing that jumps out you know when you look at a team and you've been in the swamp before you know how hard it is they undefeated what makes them when the game's type games um and I know they scored some big point zero in New York what's what's what's one element that you see in her football team when you look at him\nWell other than the Denver again they've gotten off the very start and they played for my head a from a anywhere from a couple of touchdowns to 'em for touchdowns against a San Francisco so\nUm yeah that would get past Russian and so when they can crank the pests Russian a state balance and they're they're all sense so they're they're they're hard they're hard to be and so um you know one thing we don't want to do is to replace gave her behind so [noise]\nHow would you like motor trench twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best rice anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at flood forward and he joined Narragansett\nThey have a good football team and I'm sure whoever's out there will be ready to go\nHave joined back not only an office but special teams seems like you gave you got to spark and apart returned you had to one called back but it seems like you get some stuff out of your pot returned game\nYeah we started to show some signs of life on that so hopefully we can do that and and um make some place in the kicking game um\nOr we can certainly use some more of those after the first third season uh we didn't have as many as we would like to have so hopefully that'll that'll change around but it's good to have joined back and um it seemed like all the receivers um had a good role and were involved last week so hopefully come out with the titans and the back so we can get good production from our overall sense of ...\nAbout ... seems like he worked through a little bit of an injury I Know is limited this week we'd be able to go to night yeah it should be ready to go a Sony Michel no he did some work on the bikes and stuff but out here we are day of game of looks like he's going to go to I think it will be okay\nI'm ... coach against Sandy Reid teams before you know he's been criticized for lack of clocks measure that but you know he seems to give you something different at the start each game doesn't ... uh as opposed to other coaches that you say okay this is what a team's going to do when I go out and do it\nYeah you have no idea what antics going to do to start the game it's usually pretty effective and\nAs I said earlier getting ahead of the big part of their game and they do a real good job of that with the script and with the um the place that they run in the early part of the game um\nFormations personnel groups in this direction so forth a\nLot of times catch the defense a little bit off guard and get a step on them and and get turned into a big place oh Andy is an excellent game plan coach and not just the beginning of the game but in all all throughout the game and I'm certainly the way they came back and be Denver on the road when they're when they're down by the time the fourth quarter is pretty good\nA testament to their ability to to play from behind and and manage the clock and do what they need to do to when\nYou got a hell of a tight in here they have a good one and Kelsey too does that complicate things defensively because it's not a true why that you can light up and say okay here's the here's a here's the leg heading tight end that this guy can move around he's almost like a receiver\nSo he has a receiver Kelsey very good receiver he's very athletic he's quick uh he is very good um obviously ball skills run after the catch ability but he has the ability to to get open with his quickness and um and obviously it's a big target so\nHe's our guide to handle their very good skilled players running backs titans are Sievers opposite quarterback so are they [laughter]\nThey would ask you about him so I've come and they moved to ... points yeah but the kid I mean if you look in the homes his ability as arm slot you know where you don't have to be a true tactician where the feed on Saturday he can make all the throw scanning\nYeah he has a great arming very he's very good thrown on the run um\n[noise] he can run but he is very good uh throw on the wrong guy out of the pocket and and see receivers across the field down the field or in front of them and uh extent plays or the left hand that story made against Denver's a good example of that it seems kind of never\nA place not over until the whistle blows so he's got to really we got really work to finish our place against this guy and and the entire often\nI Know there's a plan to police it was a Carolina when I looked at with you on TV with a play with the oh Atlanta at Seventy five yards and you're like it was nothing\nYeah now he's got a tremendous arm and he can stretch to field throw the ball with the sideline throw the ball down the field I'm In you know it's a good inside runner so they attack all all areas every spot on the field you gotta you gotta defended off\nTheir off at some line is it more of his own block and skiing because of the way they stretch it with the jet sweeps and everything or is it is everything predicated on timing like the passing game as\nA it's a lot Arpaio so uh it's a lot there's a lot of his own with some type of pattern combination on the other side of it or they do have some gaffes games but overall they like to get on the ball down hill on on zones read zones where the quarterback and keep or you know read the defense of and that type of thing or\nGive it to him in the outside plays in the defense take take that away and then they converted into in our field pass play so I'm more on the map\nAll right let's not football question for Bill Belichick hall of fame how do we did this past friday a it's a fifty year you know how encouraging you what the response we're getting for the community not only that but guys like Tony La Russa a ... there obviously Jim ... and of course a joke Tori on set with you I was a hell of a night\nThat was a great night and not for shit all your help Scott draw Mayo uh we had a couple of guys that a great job and so um yeah the sportsmen amazing and we've been able to uh to raise quite a bit of money here that are will get winning foundation here in the next few weeks\nOkay time off of the debate on this question weight comes from Wendy reads a meta let's talk about the Sunday night game so much of the rest of the NFL do you watch you know you got to get your football team but there's a lot of games go on during the day how much do you watch proud of your game\nOr a oh I was kind of watch some of the games that will you know teams will be playing here in the near future obviously the bears and and I'm In uh buffalo and it seems like that that are too far away so so send them play but not a not a you know intent latest kinda casually to just um you know see what's going on\nI coach collect tonight against the other
