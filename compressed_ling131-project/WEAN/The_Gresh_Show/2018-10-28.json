jobs\nOff or not they're going to be spread more often not they're going to win\nOn your mind on our [noise]\nI Witness news is you're a local election headquarters from our studios in east Providence a debate between the two candidates for state representative and Cranston district Fifteen hello everybody I'm Tim white thank you for joining us\nBoth candidates will have an opportunity to give a one minute closing statement at the end of this debate and the candidates are from left to right on your screen the incumbent Democrat Nicholas Matty yellow who is an attorney and speaker of the house and his Republican challenger Stephen Fry us who was also a practicing attorney\nNow I Will be moderating this debate along with my colleague Ted Macy\nThank you again to Mr Mandela Mr ... ah for agreeing to join us in this debate once again as you were here two years ago [noise] fortunately you know our rules since you've been here before we have no strict format we're looking for an open and honest discussion of the issues but if you're not answering the question or you're taking too long\nDead or I Will jump in so let's begin to Mr Frank I'm going to start with you um you've made one of our reports of big issue in the campaign trail the scandal where former representative Frank Martin our junior received free tuition while working as one of ... top staffers you sent out thousands of negative mailers\nAbout the controversy and have harped on it in the media but you aren't running against Frank minority you're running against Nick Matty yellow or is it fair for you to blame Mr ... for the scandal when there's no evidence he knew about the free tuition until we exposed it [noise]\nI think it's fair to talk about it to him you know explain why basically was ... when he found out about it he could have done something about it basically you could've Terminator ... immediately he didn't do so for two weeks he basically defended this Mr ... said it was a problem that the governor should look at\nAnd then after two weeks of public pressure finally Frank mocking our agrees to give some of it back ten years interest free now when something is wrong I see it in a few ... we have a lot of abuses\nAnd we've seen abuse you stop it if you don't it goes on and\nFrank Martha now has teamed up with the speaker they've been representatives of our community for thirty of the last thirty two years they've been running our show in our in our community and in my feeling is we need a change we cannot have self dealing in insider dealing and what's ... represents and the speaker in two thousand six ran against that\nRan against the moms and our machine but then he joined forces with them and that's why we need change\nWhat what about you know you're asking for Mr ... to make a rush to judgment here\nWe follow her story and you immediately want him to terminate Mr Amano you immediately want him to repay all that money shouldn't Mr ... will be thoughtful or does he get any credit for being thoughtful about what to take a step back take a look at what happened in ...\nI Would always when something comes up I Will bring the person in and ask what occurred here\nWhat happened and he had two weeks to do this he went on radio and talked about it he defended it obviously he could have brought Frank moss narrowing said this Frank what's going on you need to pay this whole thing back\nOr you need to go he didn't do that he defended it and on top of it I think I can see when it comes to this issue is that he\nFrank month and I was sort of the Nineteen eighties there was a huge Tucson called with or without you\nCan't be with or without Frank watching are that's why we can't let him go because he needs him for his campaign but he also drags him down his campaign Mr\nMany yellow you sit in a letter to your constituents that quote as soon as you learned you ordered ... to repay the tuition but that's simply not true more than a week after our report you told WPRI radios Mr price referenced and I I Will quote your what you said directly\nI Would be the first to say the benefits should not have been offered but once you offered I expect an employee to take it\nThe mistake is on the college is not on the individual\nWho took the benefit yes I and I still believe that I I don't think that was inappropriate benefit but that doesn't mean that I didn't speak to Frank my now robotic pet that's between the union in Rhode Island college has nothing to do with me to stay home so let's talk about what I've done but the ... and they will get into your policies\nAre my question to you is your letter to constituents you can see right now that that wasn't accurate\nOr no it was absolutely accurate data because I had my private conversations with ... mile an hour when I told them what I Would suggest that he do and he did follow through with that but he had to have conversations with his wife wife and so forth\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's for me or luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTC and the only twenty eight Lincoln Navigator one leaking of never against such unparalleled Marjorie impeccable search\nYou're in in Rhode Island college my statements are accurate nobody knows when I talked to France sooner you learned about it or not we lack in I had to learn than I did I was like you wrote your constituents is it now you look at a very nuanced\nI I think he's looking at it exactly it was written and said no way so that when you heard all the U Haul heard all the ... All right let's let's let's take a reasonable read once I learned about it I had a conversation where Frank and then he talked to his family\nAbout it but we're talking about something that happened that Rhode Island college I've been the leader on ethics reform ate the jurisdiction of the general assembly subject to the ethics commission foot\nIra financial disclosures on line a lobbying reform campaign finance reform I've been called the most active most a reform oriented speaker in those in recent history by go local ... by the by the Providence Journal\nThat's where my administrations about Rhode Island college has the answer for their own policy why doesn't he get credit for all that before me just rattled off well basically\nFirst of all in regards to the other condition reform\nHe was dead set against giving a journal simply oversight or excuse me ethics commission oversight over journals simply he said it was dead on arrival and then what occurred is that there was a possibility I could run against some ... and he started thinking maybe we should do something here and then re Galston his appointee is finance chairman got busted\nHe got rated and he had to resign so now the general somebody's in panic mode we got to do something to look like we're ethical so now we pass just uh the the legislation\nIn the west has said that I can see itself was a couch we all know 'em that are for that at this commission movement and secondly we all know re Galston\nCame first than the legislation was introduced on the other aspect look he can cite this and you can say that and you can quote people called the ... professor of Providence College who was talking about his low approval numbers in this state and he said that he wrote the speaker medical represents the old Rhode Island of corruption and insider dealing\nHe can talk reform but where's the line item veto where's the inspector general who may have caught Frank Martha narrows abuses where's term limits\nWe don't see any of that where's the legislative branch changes\nOn that right now they could find a word in the ... I I can address\nThat you know the lead the inspector general is a political tool we have the order to general we have the office of\nManagement and budget we have departments that do exactly that so I just look at it from from a cost perspective but I Would say that anyone that takes a reasonable look at our operation\nOr the speaker's office today it's been reform oriented any third party valid data will tell you that they have said it they said it very publicly so we've been reform oriented and we've been working on moving our economy forward and we've got tremendous results to show\nAll right let's move on to an issue that dominated this years assembly session that was the Sox\nUm stir fry will start with you unless you were a vocal opponent of taxpayer support for a new ... stadium in New Hampshire Mr Mann yellow on that issue any I Know Mr Mandela back to build it was so stingy in effect that the teams now leaving from Worcester his decisions mean round taxpayers won't be on the hook for new ballpark now so it doesn't leave their credit from you on that and\nThat's like somebody who tripped over themselves a and fell on a bed of roses and it was by untapped\nOkay I mean this is what happened here was\nHe was ... around politically so let's start out with this quickly twenty Fifteen he supported a new paw soccer stadium improv is where the cost taxpayers a hundred twenty million dollars used to attack people who opposed it then he almost got defeated in twenty sixteen\nNow it makes when it comes to this and also other things such as\nA DMV these gas tax so we are paying more in taxes under you you can talk in the car tax why we pay the Carter says how did you there because you ended up you you wrote back to phase out in twenty times now you're trying to make up for it and everything is even raise taxes so\nAll I can tell you is CNBC rates is is the fifth force in the country all these people rate is is really bad so you're basically saying we've made progress yeah they got from the bottom of the ... to the top of the bonnet about and you're out of that and that's not fashion\nWell briefly was we were low when I took over and we're moving in the right direction and would doing much much better than we are third party validate its will tell you this to free us looks at the Internet tax that was always attacks and you have to you have to be fair to see a brick and mortar stores\nWe got I got a call one time from from address completely place people go into a brick and mortar stores\nGet a number and then buy it on the Internet and we're hurting the brick and mortar stores that tax was always do miss the phrase is doing what he always does she mischaracterized\nIt was like in his southern Rhode Island's for me or luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln MTC and the only twenty eight Lincoln Navigator one leaking of never against such unparalleled luxury impeccable research\nStick with you the state Republicans have been very critical of Mr ... for tapping heavily into the legislative grant program if you win will Cranston residents just have to accept that those grants which funds such things as you know I was little leagues in Utah keep programs that those are just going to disappear if you went\nWell basically I won't be promoting legislative grants I won't be asking for them I won't be given them out and so I think what's going to happen is that if there's less money coming in from the government and people see that they'll put more money themselves that's a charity was the legislative grants or a new invention they've only exist\nCivilian you're predicting that if you put more money into government people will be more philanthropic and that's going to offset\nIf if you if the government's doing something people don't give they say the government's doing that for you that's why we're one of the worst places in the country for ... till entropy if they see that the government's not doing it then they'll step up\nI contribute to local organizations and I think other people contribute and I think that's what's going to occur which later ... grant program where to end in this state I think more charitable work would happen\nAnd that would happen over the long term should these programs expect that they're going to see less money if it is state Representative Steve fries\nIf you are dependent on legislative grants you will not be getting a legislative grant from me\nMr Mandela let's touch on this real briefly as I reported you lead the pack and dishing out individual legislative grants and the house you're one Seventy five house lawmakers but make up ten percent of the legislative grant spending you always claim your budget conscious why is this program off the table for cutting well\nFirst of all I Would consider cutting that we actually had that conversation with my colleagues and what the Senate and nobody wants to cut it and I I'm not the only one in the general assembly so if everybody wants to cut it I'd be open to it but as as long as it's new and\nCut it on your own five are handing out less a legislator grants\nGood as long as the programs there and their needs in my community will meet the needs in my community\nBut there are whole needs at least humidity and the talk it there needs to the community in when socket and Central Falls in your community gets the most because you're in leadership\nMy community does well because I have the tools at my disposal to take care of needs a senior centers what little leagues we have beautiful feels that out that kids play on and have the benefit of\nBecause I look at it needs to assess them and I take care of them as long as the program as they are and I'm able to help folks were going to do exactly that we're going to take care of us seeing is that kids and everybody was needed in our society\nWe want to ask you both about your leadership positions and your political parties and so many issues that have real politics recently there's so many of the debate over Brett Kavanaugh I'm Christine Blasey Ford Focus new attention on the me too movement here in Rhode Island you put representative candy in charge of a commission on sexual harassment after she alleged that was a problem in the house of representatives\nThey came up with a group of bills none of the past do you think sexual harassment is a problem in the house and if so how have you addressed that\nWell a sexual harassment is a problem throughout society in the house as one segment of society we've uh address that by requiring training for all of our employees and we'd made the recommendation for our representatives and that's the first way we did we created the commission\nThe bills all came in at the end now as you know I'm a pro business speaker that's how we've lowered or our unemployment rate from eleven to fall we're more jobs than ever before so you have to take a look at the impact of some of these bills and that's what I told representative tansy and everybody at the time\nWe will assess that but we need a longer period of time to have conversations with\nFolks and to see what the impact is going to be on businesses so that process will will start up again in January and we'll have conversations and will move the bill so long as as as appropriate at that\nTime as speaker have you ever taken any action deal with specific sexual harassment allegations\nAre the issues come up here in the U.S and we've we've address them are you satisfied with how they've been addressed I I Am\nAll right Mr price you serve on the Republican National committee which is working hard to support President Trump in recent weeks the president publicly mocked Christine Blasey Ford he called the woman horse face on Twitter and he praised the congressman just last night for physically assaulting a reporter as one of her down top Republicans do you think that's sort of rhetoric from the president is appropriate\nYou know\nI don't talk to the same way the president does\nI never called anyone a horse face\nFelt they've been through a tough time\nAnd I believe in the first amendment\nI even when you guys\nDon't agree with me and say things I don't like respect your right to do so and I don't\nEncourage people to physically assaulted\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne as over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right and one twenty nine Vermont flood of every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nMinutes before we have to get to our closing statement so I'm gonna ask each of you to very brief question so let's keep it brief um Mr fries do you support or oppose in person early voting\nIn person early voting right if I could get away with the ... get rid of the male bell system that's been\nGoing to use them in person or I Would consider okay Mr Mandela\nYes absolute alright and with thirty seconds left before closing it's been sort of a tense time last thirty minutes or so to cut the tension what is the best restaurant in Princeton Thomas pizza [laughter]\nI had the feeling at the end when or where you can only get away with it when you're a favorable view of what's happening [laughter] All right as I said\nEach candidate will have a one minute closing statement the order of which was drawn randomly prior to this debate first up is Mr ... Mr ... your one minute closing statement\nWell thank you both it's been a pleasure and honor for me to be here and a pleasure and an honor to represent the citizens of district Fifteen in my time is representative and and the speaker a Michael's been jobs and the economy\nUh that's why are unemployment rate is down from eleven to four percent or three point nine I think it took down just in the last few days on that's why we have more jobs than ever before but we have to continue this focused and we have to continue moving in the right direction um the contacts so to something that\nI recognize the the will and the needs of our citizens and we're going to work on facing the battle\nSo thank you for the honor of of of serving you and my focus will be on jobs and the economy and keeping us moving in the same positive direction that we were moving in\nLike Mr ... thank you very much now Mr price you're one minute closing statement Hi\nMy name's Steve and people ask me why my running against ...\nI have three good reasons\nMy oldest is twelve years old\nHe's been alive almost as long as the speaker has been in office\nSomeday soon he is going to be going away to college\nBecause the state doesn't produce the kind of good jobs that are you deserve\nAnd it's been happening like that for a long time some people but the state house while they think that we can get by being a high tax state with a reputation for corruption maybe this outside of the status quo maybe they know a guy I Know this we should aspire for more\nWe share a spy for excellence if you share my aspirations for for me give me a chance we can change the state house but we got to change who run it that's why we need to clean house\nMr prize thank you very much and I do want to thank both of you for joining us these things are never easy so we appreciate you accepting our invitation to take part in this debate and for viewers\nRemember eyewitness news is your local election headquarters was complete campaign coverage on WPRI twelve and WPRI dot com\nThat is always where you can see all of our debate so far the season including in the race for governor and US Senate\nAnd we will have a Providence may oral debate two weeks from today here in the WPRI twelve studios so make sure you tune in for that one protect me see I'm Tim white I Want to thank you for watching this debate again if you missed any of it is on WPRI dot com take care of [noise]\nWBAI Wakefield W.

executive suite on anything and we're talking today with John Hayes in white junior to longtime chief of takeout which is based in Cranston but growing quite a bit right now which is what we've been talking about you were talking about the Italian acquisition just had job and you mentioned earlier to talk about Vietnam China\nUm for people to think of takeaways Cranston uh how how far around the world are you operating geographically in these day to take\nWhat we actually um we did an acquisition about ah three years ago of a company in Nashville, Tennessee other makes a different kind of product can we do what they make pumps for agriculture in mining\nAnd they actually had a facilities all over the world over the country of course we have been forever but uh they have facilities all over the country they also had which came with the acquisition of foundry manufacturing stainless steel parts in Vietnam\nPushed off on that for a year because I didn't like what I you know what I mean I was had all the thoughts that you know sweat shops and now they're\nSo I spent some time there and I I I learned about it my goodness bought a great country and what a great place to says it's like walking into\nGoing Chris Rhode Island it's clean and safe and it's happy so we moved to head with that and that's just been a great thing for us who were there we have several facilities in China for a sourcing products\nUm and this is an important point I'm going to come back and and and now the the company in Italy\nIt's important for people to understand we were not up a ... you know we don't run to China for costs and what not but I have made a conscious decision in the last Thirty years not to chase cheap labor I won't do it because I've got the best workforce in the world and Cranston Rhode Island okay and then Fall River Massachusetts [noise]\nAnd uh so I'm not going anywhere on on the labor side but it is in Paris for for a company like mine to chase worldwide material price I Can't compete if I don't have the same material huge part of my\nOpinion now I'm a profit last statement is is revolves around materials of course you know steal copper and you know all the things we buy so uh [noise] uh so it's important to be able to buy those things the way all my competitors five\nWhen I ask you on that kind of thing I've seen that have been a couple of studies out the last couple of years really interesting about just how hard hit Rhode Island was by the rise of China the rise of cheap labor from abroad because of the mix of manufacturers we had and if you well know a lot of your peers are gone brown and sharp others who around when you get into this business\nUm they often say we had no choice you know we had to move either move those jobs overseas or we couldn't compare fell apart you found a different way do you think those companies could have if they try to different approach or do you think you were in the right at the right industry maybe the right ... well positioned to to be able to strategically work around that you know I think in fairness to\nAll of those companies that have left you have to you have to you and how I Would have to spend a lot of time understanding their business\nUh the the costume jewelry business so I don't know that's a tough one right into the guys that have succeeded in staying here ... people like that\nThey're they have shifted their business model to something else you know the coding or the things that they can they can do without a um a lot of the labor that might be involved in benefited from off shore if whenever you find your your labor content outweighs your material cost\nThen you must look at the cheap labor I don't have that situation so unfair I don't know about Russia but never understood that one they had a great thing going right and and yet the Japanese holy mackerel could magic competing with those guys in the seventies and eighties on on the ... right there and nothing like those people\nAnd so I Can't speak for them I can only speak for me and this frustrates me at ... I don't mean to go off here but\nAh one of the things I saw in the study done by the Brookings ... I Believe me I'm On the board of the Brookings and I'm all for those guys but the notion of having to chase biotech biome and high tech high and that and they caught on ... minutes whatever\nRight [noise] um [noise] you know what we have a workforce here which which is the best of the world I I Would put my little company up against any company in the world\nWas like in his southern Rhode

fall as in phone rang you might be finding that between all that patio furniture and a lawn mowers an outdoor equipment and anything else you've got for the warm weather Steve and you're running a little tight and outside storage shed can be a great solution and also at the ... project our project\nBut before you began that there are four important things you have to can hitter and we've got the tips in today's ... project presented my homeland visor dot com\nNow first the average cost to build a shit is a pretty wide range we're talking about between eight hundred and four grand independent going to choose choose whether you're going to build yourself or hire a pro but what do you decide to be a white or not there are several basic questions you need to ask you something before you start shopping\nYeah first of all do you need a permit I think a lot of people forget and think oh it's my house and I can do whatever I Want and I'm going to do this thing or I'm going to put up a fan\nYou can't always just go and do that you have to check your local building codes first to determine if you need a permit to build this chat on your property now you don't want to find out after\nYou finished the project that it's got to come down because it violated some building codes are unknown in code I mean that's the last thing you want to do is in fact a bunch of money and then have to take it all down and then do it again\nNow the other big thing you've got to think about is what size does your ... and what do you want it to be you know do you need something simple and you know primarily for just business needs putting things in there and not making a cute or any other functions or she wants something decorative\nThere are so many different styles and science is out there that you really need to evaluate your home and your property and how you're going to use that that you can determine the style from what your ... going to be\nYeah and part of that as a society where the shed is going to go\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against it of the best financed reason they don't send cars with zero percent NPR for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto job\nTo the house which makes running power in ... or sometimes folks will talk it sort of to the side or the back of the property so that it's less obvious but put some thought into that because you're gonna be going back and forth a lot and you don't want to regret that decision\nAnd finally what's your budget I mean did you get a tight budget you can do that very simple should that gets the job done without a lot of frills\nBut it's got some wiggle room you could think about ending some extra features like integrated shelving inside decorative trim on the outside or you could go all out man cave or she shed and maybe and electricity heat swimming\nWall to wall stereo I don't know you know you can really totally decked out those are fun too but I think it through in mind that budget so that comes out just the way you expect\nNow if you do go pro we recommend getting estimates from at least two or three contractors before you choose the one that's going to help you with the project\nAnd I have a project for them to make their dot com went home and there you can get matched with top rated homes servants credit in your area we verified review is an appointment on mine all for free\nNo matter the type of job home advisor makes it fast and easy to hire the best local approach\nThat Tammy until I got on the on the line who's looking for a better shot or\nWe say um Hi I'm calling because I wanted to find out um I had an old Victorian house and I have a three three three\nI have a back on my way back when when the fact that and when it wasn't a shower the second floor and then I Want to take a shower or when the water up there on the air for the shower go with coke and I've been ... contractors and my plumber and I'm not getting dark so I like to remedy that come to our remodeling\nOkay so are you opening up walls is part of remodeling\nYes I Am completely stripped down to the fed\nOkay great so first of all the reasons you have reduced water pressure an older homes are generally because you have old steel pipes that suffer from internal resting and they clog the closed down ... like a clogged arteries and then you can't push enough water through it\nAnd that could be your main water pipe there could be the supply pipes that are inside the house\nOr a combination of them and so since you're taking the walls of the general rule of thumb is that whenever you expose these old steel pipes you want to replace them with copper pipes um or with tax was different to newer type of plumbing pipe now the other thing is you may have enough water pressure coming in from the street\nOne of the departure is not that big of a deal because I think that the pressure kind of guy is just that like basically we have to bear from them out and you can only use one at a time by the water completely goes ice cold air to shower somebody on than eager to think\nWell that's because the the pipes may not be supplying that hot water may not be moving into hot water what size water heater do you have\nUm forty hours or less a minimum size but should be okay for for two bathrooms okay and as an an older water heater\nUm no I just replace or to hear\nWhen you replace it that they're changing the plumbing around that this is going through the steel pipes\nThey changed the hype around the no I don't think\nYou need to talk with your plumbers about what kind of pipes you have whether or not that's concerning the problem and you know with all the pressures of the street because if you're not getting enough pressure that could be the whole cause of it\nOkay now I go there and I saw something online called a um a pressure ballot now where there were many issue at all\nSo pressure valve valve is designed to be used primarily in the shower and what it does it keeps them mixed between hot and cold balanced so that you don't get scorching or freezing cold waters when the pressure drops so if somebody wants to say run hot water downstairs and now ... hot water from the upstairs shower\nIt would not change the balance of water from the mix of water between hot and cold so the flow would be less you'd have less of a stream but it wouldn't be the temperature wouldn't change okay right okay no that's not a I don't think that's the cause I mean that would that would certainly be a good thing to have\nSomething you should consider but I don't think that's the reason you're not going to hold on the second floor I just don't they can moving in a foreigner up there\nOkay so basically what I Need to do is tell them to check the piping around the water heater again\nA plumber should know this not only to run the water heater basically if you're going to one of those walls will kind of pipes do you have\nAnd are they corroded and should they be replaced to help groups are up to help alleviate this okay I'm In of all else fails you could always had a second water heater upstairs if you had a checklist water heater which would be a really small unit and it was supply additional water that second for bathroom\nWow okay okay okay well I think that kind of remedy the problem\nAll right thanks so much for calling them money pet Haiti fresh clean water\nEvery tapping your home\n\n... group wants your

filters 'cause the amount of time between filter changes really very to that type of cleaning can you have and where it's located\nIn well it's a function of water quality again I mean you know ... years ago we we had this filter that was so good that it would clog up all the time and people hated it but the water was perfectly clean because it was taken every bit out of it\nSo it's this is this balance point between taken out the important stuff but not having to be that you have to change it every month or every every two weeks you know what it is important\nTo change it when needs to be changed because I remember in the Twenty years it's been as a home inspector I'd seen filters that folks put in with great intentions and then never touched it again for two years and in fact if you do that I guess it could become unsafe\nI think it also becomes almost something you put on the list of when you're gonna change the batteries and smoke detectors right and it's an annual thing it
