kitchen and shuts down to sheet rock and we'd like to uh put texture and at a but I'd like\nTo do it as simply as possible so she can go next year and I and I watch more information about that or would you recommend\n... to use an additive in pay but frankly usually get the opposite question most people calls willing to take the texture away so [laughter] so I Would say ... you're really sure you want to do this because once it goes on there it's hard to make it or they could go\nRight yes I mean our other walls have some texture I mean and it's not a heavy texture it's just a little bit to make it and just not the flat sheet rock\nAnd it's a texture and the painter is an actual texture within the drywall itself almost like a ...\nWell I'd rather not go that route is the the ... um I'd like to add texture the pain just to give the wall something other than the mood drywall\nWell there's a couple of different techniques that you can use 'em first there's something called the linen technique that's done with almost like a wallpaper brash sort of a very short\nStiff bristle that's you know maybe it twelve inches to Eighteen Inches wide and you put the paint on and then you shouldn't drag that brush through and that gives you a linear texture to it and that can kind of look like wallpaper and you can do it with one color or do a base color and the love that dry and then\nPut it in their coat on top and then dragged outlined through um you could do something that's almost called the I guess it is actually called of the nation plaster but that involves you know sort of marveling the texture on and and furnishing at and rubbing it really is a heavier coat of paint and plaster but that gives a really interesting sort of\nCloudy textural look that sometimes has a high shine to it um there's a slated texture I think Ralph Lauren is one of the paints that makes that\nAnd that has um it really does look like sway that has that sort of like rubs softer not looking texture to it there's a standard finished with there's actual sand in the pain sometimes I can feel a little rough almost like a sand paper\nBut I'm back in the nice texture to they all have different application technique so if I were looking at a paint that has a specific texture and homo center and make sure that I really read the directions and looked at what that manufacture was recommending for the application process and get those correct tools and do the proper prep work for it because some of those textures or\nYou know kind of labor intensive for the wire and you want to make sure you get it right\nAbsolutely [laughter] okay well I'll look into the uh\nThings you suggested here and make a decision that I Hope that helps you out it does thank you so much\nWell now we are entering the heating season and maybe a lot of your actually already is and the heat in full swing this time of year you really want to try and get the most out of your energy dollar and to do

comfortable all winter long name can you get the name of the day\nI got to issue if they only leaking feeling I'm not sure if it's got an from from my roof or from our conditioners or doesn't do it all the time but sometimes it rained it comes down to the top spot right and they have\nAbout [laughter]\nOr or or got caught that allows we've got a metal roof structured house\nRight now I'm thinking maybe the drip edge it they don't want more goes into the other end you know but like I said I've not had any luck because now they have it fixed and then it it will come a rain and then again\nIt comes in again right so what have you been doing the fiction that he knew stealing the seems in the in the metal roof\nYeah we we got up and put a from ... in the stuff on it or you know where to edge of the stuff was and that are supposed to be a twenty year roof and we had an older house probably\nAbout ... at least a metal roof is most of the uh uh hungrier roof metal roof last a long time here's what I Would do I would try to make it so I Would go up there if you can you get up there that area with a hose yeah so I Would try to make it leaks I Would try\nYou know the normal light duty rainfall when it falls down from the top and she died than anything and then I Would try some directional pressure\nAgainst those scenes and see if I can figure out what type of driving rain storms coming in your ... I suspect that is do the rain\nA driving in those in it might be trapped in there and that's why he comes out days later after rainfall I don't know but I I think what you're gonna have to do is to try to figure out what part of that is breaking down and then once you do if you already going the Koch route I Would just taken apart that section the roof\nAnd then putting it back together with the proper ceiling to make sure you get it done once and for all\nRight okay All right now I got a ...\n... we've got to require the Salem to or not or a proud to say on\nYeah I Know you don't want to you know you you got his gun yeah and by the way when you do repair that ceiling mysteries primer on it because of you know prime over leaks means that they're going to come right through enough in Spain

small enough that I could fail and aren't on my lap and I just wondering 'cause I don't know I don't let a narrow lead in our home depot anything like that and things like an hour and a half drive away on its own local hardware store about ten miles and you know\nHats with what he or do you need Cohn ... her back then I don't know what the different are\nOK so first of all the type of repair Mitru uses different type of material you would use if you are say pouring a new concrete slab and you mentioned quick read that's a great friend and they have a wide variety of repair products um you have the option to repair the cracks you could also re surface that concrete is a product for that\nAnd in all cases they the difference between that type of product a repair product in the original sort of concrete ... is it the repair parts are designed to adhere to the original concrete base\nYou know if it's if anything is loose course shift a pop out and restore it but\nI'm sure that there are plenty of country repair products that are out there and you know you're going to obviously have to get yourself to hardware store or a lumber yard and find that you can do some research on line

whatever the hell do you watch this on line so that's just me and that is a respect for everybody and that's where I'm like this is how we do\nThat now for who's hot and who's not and I can tell you a huge Jackson is on the definitely not far less ice cold huge access or let's get through it who's ... who's not presented\nBy Bigelow T a New England fans football weather is here cheer loudly support your team and make sure you're doing with a mug bully your favorite Bigelow T\nJoined Bigelow steam grab a mug anti proudly ew Jackson today fired in Cleveland he is gone and how about this that Chris he has been six straight coach to be fired in Cleveland after facing the Steelers for the second time in the season\nSo the Steelers seemed to be like the death cab for coaches Cleveland it's ...\nThey love the Steelers yesterday and Jackson is out the door today now many people myself included had sort of assumed that with John Dorsey bringing it taught Haley this year to be the team's offensive coordinator that once you Jackson was fired that Todd Haley would take over as the head coach not the case\nTodd hey we scanned whether they were both said packing in Cleveland\nYeah the I don't understand that I mean that doesn't make any sense to me and I am not because I think that\nPot Haley is this incredible head coach but they they anointed Gregg Williams the interim head coach defensive tied coach to base in that situation just to get through the year in for continuity say go you know there's a continuity say can Cleveland\nIs an oxymoron a look at you you just you just say head coach defense head coach often let's just get through the year they can't even do that the ownership there its future is terrible if you could fire in owner and you they should fire that has them they have no idea what they're doing and they have ruined that franchise\nWell here's the one thing I can say that if you're looking for a possible reason that would be a good reason for the team to move on for ... or it might be that Todd elite would be upset\nFor not getting the interim tag as the interim head coach Gregg Williams is not going to be the Internet coach um he may have been upset with that if he was not going to be their guy on top of that they may not want to give it to him because if he does take over and he is the head coach the rest of the year we'd all said oh this would be like a try out for them\nWell maybe they don't want him to have a dry out because they're thinking bigger and they don't want to be in a situation where he is a sort of straightening things out and the team is better down the stretch and then they're sort of forced into this uncomfortable territory of having to hire him\nRight or being forced out of your hand Forsythe as well as in hiring Todd Halley set a good thing here would be\nAre they assuming or they are they thinking big are they thinking of doing something going with one of the younger coaches out there a Lincoln Riley from Oklahoma that's a name that I think it's going to come up in terms of coaching circles like a name that Bert ... is that a number of times from Iowa State is Mac Campbell that could be a name\nThat is sort of on their radar I Would not rule out someone like\nJim Harbaugh being on their radar if he chooses to leave Michigan and I also wouldn't\nEliminate the name Josh McDaniel\nSo I think there are\nThere are a bunch of different big names that they could go after their thinking bigger longer term they're not looking for the short that they're looking for the next\nLegitimate real guy and John Dorsey who's now there knows that they don't have it and he's thinking bigger he's thinking better and they're going to do something big in the off season in terms of who their next ... years and you cannot deny Chris that that job\nHas been a major upgrade this year because Baker Mayfield is there still may feel being their them having a quarterback for the first time in what seems like forever\nIs I think a big factor for a lot of coaches who prior to this wouldn't even give it a thought and wouldn't consider Cleveland I think now the Baker's there there are guys that would look at that job differently\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood what born in east burn a generic ended up the best financed reason unbeatable prices in cars with
