per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nAutomate striking lead I Can't give it up and I think with price that was kind of more of the thing because we've seen how he's been pressing a drug postseason over his two ... two years when the red Sox but I Would say\nLast like the biggest thing with him is he definitely learned from his outing against Yankees where in the postseason you can't just handle everybody like you do in the regular season he made his adjustments for the Yankees but at the same time\nWhen I I've seen it was ... cello where you had the formula that works regular season and he goes to it it doesn't necessarily work that's what happened to him and his ... year against unions when they went and smacked him around price was outside outside outside with the cutter towards the end of the year it was great but the Yankees were ready for it and jumped on it and I am the S.\nA. L. C. S. now he's going and going out he was still a little jittery and that's why you had you know give up a home run there and maybe at times a little too aggressive on the inter half of the plate but all in all grass\nDavid Price was fine you know if you want to blame Bogart for that play in the whole um well wasn't really that much the whole to be honest I blame him I'm I'm kind of in that camp right now you got to make that throw over to first base quicker or you got fired over there it's got to be one of two can't mess around with a posting them\nBut I think if that play doesn't happen for price of oil for goes the other way I should say then we're looking at a much better audio or maybe it's four innings two runs the navy he ended up going five innings so I think with price we saw like he's making adjustments he's learning and then in the post game press conference says Yani WPRI yesterday\nHe cut us sounded like\nHe's not a sigh of relief but he's kind of accepted what has happened up until this point in terms of the criticism about him and I think now he's like All right I accept that I deserved it and I'm ready I'm ready to move on\nBut if he ready to do something about it Nick like when I saw Rick for civil come in in the eighth inning\nI saw a guy come in there with a little pie and really it will be and vinegar for crying out loud I somebody that wanted to come in and be in that spot never do I look at David Price and think he's doing a hunker down here we're going to get the eyes staring over the globe the way you used to with Curt Schilling\nI think like David Price can talk all the narrative Betty wants Mick what are we going to see the sky pitch for the little gumption out\nThere I Do want to make sure we get too far so afterwards but I appreciate the throwback to show him with the eyes over the glove very underrated ... if you clean your football guy but you are a baseball bat truly um but anyway so David Price um\nI don't know that we're going to get that killer instinct I just don't think that's true she is you know you guys see him in the press coverage is 'cause it it it goes out to the public\nUm you can see how he handles himself how he talks in my one on one conversations that I've had with him this year he's pretty much the same guy in terms of you know he's fairly monotone he'd always kind of\nCalm I guess you could put a one way or just slow in the waiting talk does not Boston I mean you're listening to me right now I'm Talking fairly quickly I Would say he he never talk like this and it's just not how users no intensity high how he talks any kind of carry over to the mountains I'm usually\nI don't know that we're going to see what we're seeing from poor fellow at a price on not that's not what I'm saying but I think\n... the type of picture ... is he doesn't necessarily need to be that what he needs to be comfortable because I think that's always the problem is just so\nAnxious out there and he's afraid to make a mistake and when you're like that or whatever sport is you know that you're ... you're bound to make that mistake and I think if prices more comfortable which I Believe he is to some extent now\nThat I think he can succeed him and his death my definition of success for him versus sell our two completely different things the price and go do we can get again in let's say game six if it comes to that\nUm that I I'm okay with that as long as he leaves with believed that they did what we need him to do is thirty one million dollar guy and he doesn't deserve money\nBut I'm trying to get past that and you know accept the fact that this is what he is and he just needed to give you the leaves the office and you'll relax a little bit in the ... the bullpen has some level of breathing room\nMitt prior with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh we're talking Red Sox and Red Sox pitching\nBefore I get to your expectations on Chris Sale what's finished the fog on our route for so long and what you've seen out of him not only as a starter but in these bullpen appearances where I don't know man a huge pretty damn good that a sitting last night and the thing that I like did you didn't mess around he got\nWhat we can in southern Rhode Island from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the only twenty eight ... Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln if there were against it unbearable Marjorie impeccable service\nI got to look back at his pitches because I don't think ... in that outing which she did and I don't think he threw a change up there either which he did he was slider he was hook and he was forcing fastball that's it that's a power pitcher right there and I and he wasn't going in touching Ninety six\nBut the thing right now that is so valuable about reports cello is\nThis ... when he goes into that one inning he has a really good car bomb them in a fairly good slider where they work off each other in his sports team or while he knows how to pair those pictures up\nHe's a completely different pitcher as the set up and and the thing is as much as we know what he is and you know the ashes of go back and look at what he's doing they don't know fully will report cello is in terms of his approach\nWhen he's out there as a reliever as a one guy 'cause he can just throw everything that you can just have to get to he doesn't have to hold back and try and taste and stuff it's just the kitchen sink and everything else with it and it's kind of hard to adjust and game playing for a guy who's just he's not the pitcher who thought he was a report cello was turning into\nA knot Andrew Miller or coach you a horrible something different but I I wouldn't be ... somewhere like you know next year we see someone else trying to replicate this because this is Rick or sell right now is the best eight and the guy the red Sox out\nWhat would they be pitching him in the eighth inning Nick if ... if you'd actually address the issues in the bullpen if Steven Wright didn't get hurt\nOr well if the rocky how to dress the bullpen and not relied on talent for very after his the guys always been injured or no they wouldn't ... you wouldn't be dealing with that right now question a perfect world that wouldn't happen um and then when it comes to write I Would say Steven Wright would have been the eighth inning guy\nBut you would have been him because it's not going to be any of the other other bullpen guy says course tried it with all of them and it has worked for some reason none of them can really hold that pressure whereas Barnes\nWill do it pretty much everywhere else\n... is the seventh inning guy right now so a joke Kelly I mean jeeze he's been great to I'm stunned by that more than anything um but no task force your question no if right was around he would have gotten that first crack at it and if they had gone and got a legitimate eighth inning guy wouldn't be in this predicament I\nOrganic prior prior dot com here on the ground show on WNPR OU also read them in the Providence Journal occasionally and hear him\nHere on WPRI ruined for me are you mentioned earlier about the expectations for sale he was hospitalized yesterday with the stomach flu issue I Know we're supposed to be a while before he used to pitch\nA how concerned are you about him being sick for maybe more importantly how concerned are you with what you're seeing from sale on the mound trying to warn is obviously he's trying to pitch something seems\nIt yeah you know and one of the most confused by is how did he get the stomach bug because it wasn't food poisoning or anything eight because that does not eat anything um but I I you know aggression I was up to believe that the red Sox were hiking or were trying to\nHave the sale get some rest and he was actually injured for the longest stretch but now that we've seen he cannot get his philosophy back up to where he is you're absolutely right there is no doubt in my mind that there's something wrong with him physically at this point in the ... the thing is though\nI occasionally with stroll over to other clubhouse throughout the course of the season just to talk to guys about their thoughts on Red Sox pitcher you hit or whatever it was\nAnd one thing that guy said to me was about sale that Ajmi had they rising fast ball like legitimately arising fat or you may hear on the television broadcast that some guys have a rising fast or only guy that actually does its tail because of his arm slide so funky it's not\nIt's you know 'cause it's side are but at the same time just a bit lower it create that illusion for hitters and that makes it so difficult to hit the other thing is you know and making that jumped to a hundred guys like he was hard enough at Ninety to Ninety four to deal with never mind that a hundred if it's impossible to handle it", "show_name": "The Gresh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "15"}
