'cause it's dolphins up uh twenty to Seventeen\nAnd then the Hubbard ends up yeah Harvard ends up having a ball and right in his lap he runs in for a touchdown twenty seven Seventeen the final and that was at but the dolphins lose their three into and I think we're finding out that ah they are they're just a you know they are what we thought they weren't there are the bills were hosting the\nTitan and I guess so [laughter]\nYeah well here's the problem so I get a phone call today around\nProbably ten thirty and it goes or something like\nThis can you know we we can\nInsert F bomb I in the state of shock I again can't bully Tennessee last I Know that was one of the teams have bad guy\nThe thing there's always a deflection from Perry when it comes to a bad pick we yeah and the whole I Know you like them yeah uh the bills today last\nSecond field goal Stephen Hall ...

Powell ran for Ninety nine Arnold only through the wall twenty two times\nHow about this on ten completion on twenty two throws yeah Sam Darnell had almost two hundred yards and that three touch yeah because I think to completion for a hundred yards went to ... yeah that's exactly right and the two of those touchdowns\nTo Robbie Anderson as well but ah the jets find a way to get a win and the Broncos were were finding the Broncos are finding their level\nYou can lump I still have high hopes for Tennessee but I mean I guess you can't ... bicker with those who want to lump them in with\nWith

don't care what happened last season I'm about evaluating the eagles this year they don't look good and I'm not it's not even one says fault necessarily but they just look like they've they've lost that love and feeling\nFresh they do not have a defensive edge\nWhere you go they go and that's a team that you know for how long queue Douglas basically defined that team from the edge there with that out what what was the uh what's the what's it called there when he's on down on all fours a white eight or why\nDo it's like a white eight why not why nine points and all that\nStuff yeah they used they used to make their money are coming with pressure off the edge maybe that's it but the little there just doesn't look like the team that doesn't look even really close to the team that won

I mean basically the Arizona defense won this game\nUm\nYou know this goes on the field for like Seventy eight play right in\nSan Francisco the limited amount of play makers they actually had going into the game was immediately decimated they lost ... and one of their wide receivers not named Peter ... junior or for the games actually it's the Peter ... as\nI say our guard\nSince and brought out it it's the ... jamming with the little thing on the G or the sea or wherever that is\nBut uh yeah I mean chemicals found\nIs that right Carrie kills it very well but other than that they don't have a lot of weapons there in San Francisco so CJ beat hard uh he got you got to\nBe pretty hard a in a in a game that was really good in the afternoon the rams beat the Seahawks thirty three to thirty one and and the rams had to find a way to score nine in the fourth quarter to be able to win this one in without Brennan cooks right and it's really the first time roots that uh I think uh teams really press the LA\nPut them in a situation where they were down in the fourth quarter and ah I thought Jared golf\nAgain some mistakes early but in the fourth quarter golf didn't want himself\nOr all three and a Twenty one yard touchdown to pick stocks girlie ran for three touchdowns are they ran for a hundred fifty five yards as a team did the rams\nOr however conversely Seattle ran it for a hundred and Ninety on that Ramsey fence and you would think it wouldn't be able to run against them considering there there's two big defensive tackle is in the middle well the Seahawks weren't afraid and it almost got them a victory but the rams\nHave to choose me an hour on their record the five you know and then on Sunday Night Football\nHold on a second I I just have to wonder in terms of that game if that wasn't part of the strategy with the with the LA Rams because to let them run Mike Davis and Sean Alexander and whomever or else they got ... Carson right exactly Chris in a bread penny I Do believe the former Red Sox pitcher\nChris Carson and Mike dates you go Mike Davis Davis a former first baseman I'm Johnny Carson former entertained\nThough it was very high oh yeah but I mean if you're playing the Seattle Seahawks how are you going to lose the Seattle Seahawks that's Russell Wilson is going to beat you and so not that they were playing rope a dope necessarily but you look at those numbers you look at the skill set they have a front them being the rams and you would have to think there was a little bit of that going on or else\nYeah I mean it's not this vaunted rushing attacked the Seattle has but yet they were able to run all over the rams I think that was more matchup oriented\nThan anything well the Russell Wilson still on the phone three touchdown passes only Twenty one froze which was pretty amazing and a\nNear Seattle not known for their off and said all it'll be interesting to see how they evolve hey look there's a spot in the NFC for one of those teams in the west you would think in theory if they can win some games well let's get to the disappointment in the heartbreak that has the Dallas Cowboys\nThere is there a few better things in life\nThan Dallas Cowboy fans weeping and they love Jerry Jones they love the fact that he's the owner of the other team Andy\nHe's also killing them at the same time because all he does is keep with Jason Garrett so to keep for down moment in overtime against the taxes on the road it's game is tied at sixteen\nIn old team now uh Jason Garrett decides to punt gives the ball back to the Texans and then bang a field goal wins it for the Texans they're now to win three Nineteen sixteen the final on Sunday Night Football\nAnd there are few things better than the than the cowboys losing right few things better than the cowboys Lucy I Love it it's great because their fans are just such cry babies\nAnd I can't wait to see Dave York Tomorrow and

I'd like to get your thoughts on this and we'll get to the way Peyton Manning reacted to it or in about five minutes here on the grass show on WNPR oh and that is\nThey win the super bowl and then what happened to Drew Brees right after that\nIf I remember just off the top of my head here I think it was three straight seven and nine seasons\nSo you know you get that Rob is the quarterback you win a Super Bowl and then\nYou have three bad years I also think playing in New Orleans doesn't do them any favors in terms of national notoriety what is New Orleans known for having turf it is the best place\nTo have a Super Bowl ... just a great party John and John I'm a huge fan of the city of New Orleans yep I've told we we've told the story of the guy who is\nStanding there a whole ... wiener playing craps because he had to go pee and he didn't want to ah he didn't want to give up his spot although hazel may walk by the guy my ... I got\nAbout Greece eaten a venue hey one block from Bourbon Street\nI I Love these I Love these kinds of stories like I walked up to a crap stable and saw Joe sees them in ... uh lose three hundred dollars in about a minute and a half and he\nDrops the loudest F bomb and then walked away it was fantastic ... instead of paying off he said oh my leg and he limped away [laughter] he actually uh popped off in large part of a leg and he he reached in and grab a couple of hundred dollar bills and threw it down and said All right we're square now\nBut a New Orleans is great place to go party and hang out I don't know if it's great for notoriety and and turning into a big star and by the way Drew Brees has become a big NFL star even though he has played a new\nNational endorsements and I was I was serious so when I was talking about the turf I think a lot of football naturalist old school what have you doesn't even matter you could be new school I'd that I'm sure you could still think this way a lot of people right off quarterbacks\nYou know light Kurt Warner like Drew Brees because of the success they've had indoors and on turf and so I think that the knock against breeze right off the ... tons of people say Gretchen\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again for the board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine Vermont flood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nBust of this generation to me begins and ends with\nBrady played out doors and those guys played indoors and it's to me it's not so much the turf\nIt's the domes they player in those guys were guaranteed eight games a year if not more inside and sing about whenever you went to Detroit or back in the day St Louis\nYou know when you started we started to add that hey right now Drew Brees was playing in ah she's got eight of the dome well then you get one in Atlanta so that's over half the schedule right now playing indoors and\nNever crossover with India you know what I mean you start to do the math and you're trying to figure out you know Detroit's on the schedule more often than not for New Orleans they go up there that's another dome\nI think the dome is a big part of the narrative enemy Drew Brees is still ah he he's a I Would probably put an eighth overall he would be in that second tier but I think when you compare him to people not named Brady and manning\nEven though he does have certain advantages like playing indoors he's still better than a lot of guys in the game and the world championship does\nAdd a layer of credibility to him that other guys don't have\nOr at least if you look at him compared to say a joke Flaco who to me would be a contemporary of Drew Brees it's games that I mean it's it's not even close Flaco in ways really not even in the conversation robs intimidating one sitting on Drew Brees rub your undergrad showing WPRI road so brother\nOf grass say might disagree with you on the wrist he's every bit the quarterback is bread I think he's better nice fault that he played indoors Brady at a team around him a lot of use breeze not have the defense look at last year he left the field with a lead one miss tackle and the Minnesota Vikings\nMove forward now Nick save is always going to be known as a great college coach because he passed up on them look at a completion for Senate looking you know pro will receive is\nThat this guy played with\nWho Drew Brees is great and like I said I don't think it's disrespectful and and Rob thanks brother I appreciate hearing from your baby don't be stranger [noise]\nI I don't think it's disrespectful to call Drew Brees a top ten all time quarterback mean in fact I think there would still be some people there would quibble with me in saying that Drew Brees is a is a top ten quarterback but when I I again what hurts him\nIs in San Diego do\nYou know what the overall record for Drew Brees was in San Diego when he was there they were thirty and twenty eight and a member of the New Orleans saints there were one six team in Seventy nine now the reason I bring that up is because\nI hate it I hate it when people say\nWell so and so's great quarterback or so and so's better cornerback 'cause he's won a championship that tours crap to a Robin ... point the team matters in winning a championship and there were many years were Drew Brees really didn't have a lot around him\nBut boy you look at five thousand yard seasons holy cow I mean he he is lead the NFL in total passing yards seven times out of his Eighteen year career that's pretty hard to do and in the last three seasons\nActually I can go back five years his completion percentage which really tells me a lot\nSixty eight point six sixty nine point to sixty eight point three Seventy percent and last year Seventy two percent and after last night Drew Brees completion percentage is Seventy seven point nine percent that's pretty stupid that is orderly ridiculous quite honestly\n\nWe will get to a what Peyton Manning had to say about it a little bit later we jumped in with Rob thoughts we can hear from a\nPeyton Manning a little bit later on\nWho was actually pretty funny with what he had to say to Drew Brees but congrats to him we've been very lucky as football fans in this generation to see Brady manning and breeze all play in the same era\nWhere to look back on this ten Fifteen Years from now be like wow I might have been the golden age of quarterbacks will get you line up some

Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Marjorie impeccable surface\nHas achieved a Stanley Cup\nTitle and and it has achieved all of a success\nOr he's really humbled by it but the one thing that's interesting above version or on grass is we talked to him during the pre season about getting to a thousand games in some time in December right before Christmas or barring any injuries are games missed a he's going to hit\nThe thousand gained plot which is pretty impressive especially given the fact that\nYou know he missed basically a season and a half because of the lockout and he also there's basically a season because of the serious concussion that are maybe suffered back in two thousand and seven so everything that he's accomplished you know you got to you know give us thick topped guy just because\nYou know he's done it the right way fans love him he's one of the most well respected guys and the national hockey league or you're never going to hear a bad word and maybe the ... the worst thing you're going to hear about these birds Ron from other centers in the league saying that he cheats on face off that's why he's one of the best and the leak but\nUh it's just a it's a joy to watch this guy play and and watch how we how we performed and how he prepares and that's why these younger guys in the pros organization\nThat kind of they're they almost like a sponge off from him and and all the mission that it can give and just watch when he does on a daily basis and and it's impressive that it really is\nTalking Bruins hockey with Joe McDonald of the athletic here on the ground show on WNPR oh\nCassidy said he was pretty happy with the third and fourth line that I Know one in the cold years that those winds were dependent on with Cassidy I Know we use them a little differently but Joe through your eyes what's the ceiling for the third and fourth Weiner's can they be consistent contributors this year\nWell crash as soon as they figure out exactly what that consistency in the bottom six will be I you know he's cracked Cassidy is tinkering with a lot of different line combinations in the early ... early going here um so I think until they maybe find that consistency\nThat's what he's going to continue to do a there was originally they thought that she probably could step up into the third third line center role I produced a little moral offense or given the fact that he is a a responsible defensive player a and he's gritty we saw that last year where he was the ... center\nAnd then there was some talk about okay what is running than I Do play than I Do play on the top line with with birds around and Martian or is he is third line left wing on and so birds are so Cassie I should say has been taken with that and he's going to continue to\nTo do that until he finds something that you know brings consistent success to his team on one thing that we all know is that\nThey do have that in the organization where they can they can kind of take ... take her with it a little bit uh and you know who knows what's gonna happen in the short term here but the one thing is that Cassidy has options and that's always good and plus\nThat old so bodes well for that internal competition that the Bruins want so desperately in this organization\nJoe McDonald talking hockey with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh dent in high noon another one of those guys who got slid down to the third line are you worried about him a little bit you often not a very good starts so far\n[laughter] don't dress I totally totally messed up my pre season predict should we had to pick one that\nSaid you know really keep an eye on this and I'm and I really believe that and I was going to be that guy corps they've come out of the shoot and and really do well in that top line a part in the second line depending on where he landed and obviously out of camp he landed on that cycle and with great team and um and Jake depressed\nBut the one thing about and we saw that a lot last year that you know he he dealt with those typical ebbs and flows of that rookie season and and you know I hate to use the word sophomore slump but you're right I mean he he's off to a slow start\nBut the one thing about him is that he does have that work ethic uh he's got the ability without a doubt in Cassidy really trust him and he knows that okay we put we started during the second line on the right side it didn't work out in game decision we pulled you put your back on the third line\nAnd he's basically doing that to try to spark kind in a little um has worked yet\nBut this kid really we sort of season goes that he does\nA you know anytime he faces a diversity you know he always comes back\nA better player so it's going to be interesting to see how didn't hind and kind of continues his pro development at the end each level um but again if he continues to struggle there are options in the organization that they can they can turn to so uh but he knows that I mean he\nHe's a talented kid he really isn't it it's just that\nHow would you like ... twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one Ninety nine brought will say hello to forge twenty eighty four to one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at what board and he went into a narrower gambling\nGrizzly but uh he she struggled big time on Monday in the home opener and\nUh with tore Krueger or out for at least a couple of weeks with the\nInjured left ankle or you know they're going to look to grisly to play a lot of big time minutes especially on the top ... power play unit and also on the ice at the same time when birds are on the line is out there because they want to move in defense been\nTo that puck up by so quickly to either brat a bread Martian or you know trees birds around ... you know the kind of\nReally you know continue that all sense of threat that Cassidy as\nYou know basically has has been known to do over the last\nSeason and a half of the Bruins coach show or the ... you know I'm I'm really not worried about it only because you know the newcomer John more it's going to take him a little bit of time to kind of get used to the systems and how they play like you can run through all the drills in the pre season games in during training camp it just doesn't\nIt just doesn't you can get you through it in till you do it in the regular season NHL game and and I think once he kinda gets settled in that kind of help as well he's made some mistakes here and there and the first couple of games um but\nYeah you know you're going to get from Charlie Mac or you know you're going to get through to the shower and then it's a matter of the trickle down effect and it's again it's gonna be interesting to see what happens when tore cribs healthy um because probably mad crazed like who's going to be the guy out\nIf crew didn't get hurt so I you know I wouldn't worry too much about it and in the early going again only because it's such a disjointed training camp in pre season schedule that you know it's going to take a couple of games for these guys to kind of get going here\nI Know true grass is normally a yearly discussion points on sports talk radio and yearly how about we I mean but if you know it's the same thing all the time he's overpaid he doesn't come through in the big spot why did they spend so much money on a backup goalie\nI think we've got to recognize what governor guys on the roster he's engaging as well where are you relative to to get at this point in his career\nThe thing was to go is that he's he's a very good goalie at and I mean the numbers show it and a lot of people will say well you know he's he's never won\nThat big game for the Bruins and look I've said that written that\nIn in ... he's you know standing on the ice you know hopefully in Boston one day and all then the Stanley Cup over his head then he can you know silence those critics but\nThe one thing about two ... is that you know he's the type of goalie that he's a product of the team in front of them and it just when the team defensively as a whole struggles in front of him he's going to struggle to uh and they were many times last season where\nYou know he bailed them out big time I mean he was really good for a long stretch last season I and he had to be this thing here is the reason why they went out and they got\nYou are a whole lot is because he's a true number one guy and he is going to push to cook and everybody can say wow it's really there's nothing to that will know yeah there is there's a reason why they went out and got up in time to do with the exactly what he was supposed to do last season but he was a backup goal and\nIf too could struggles at any point clock is going to be the guy and we've seen a lot in his career as a type of goalie that when he gets hot he can sustain that for a long period of time and being a true number one\nCassidy will have no problem going that way if that need\nIs there a and the one thing about two guys that you know he has his attitude of like a you know it doesn't bother me well you know deep down inside he's he knows that some guy behind him ready to take his job and Bruce Cassidy is also the type of guy would be like hey we're going with who's winning and\nYou know that if it was a perfect example after the Washington game they get blown out he gets pulled Polack goes back and I thought for sure given back to back games that\nEven though Cassidy said how awkward starting in Buffalo that second game I thought for sure he was going to change his mind and come back to that would be like okay it was a terrible game all around here you go but no he stayed with the routine or the schedule\nAnd he went with locked in a lock was really good ah so it's going to be interesting to see how that ... who plays out throughout the rest of the season but you know I'm with a lot of people that you know took it needs to take this team deep into the playoffs before you can say that he's in a legal he did in two thousand Thirteen before they lost the black\nBut in order for him to be really I think\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one Ninety nine brought will say hello to port boards twenty eighty four to one fifty the best drug for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at point forward and he went into and there were against
