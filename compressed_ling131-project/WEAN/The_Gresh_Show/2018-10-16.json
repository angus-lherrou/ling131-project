I I Would agree with that and case keen him just close if there were ...\nWhat auto group once your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nI'm we know neither defence is very good and it doesn't really matter you know I read it in the fourth quarter it's it's no big twelve foot ball in the NFL where just out score each other and you know you look a couple of weeks ago a marquee matchup between the Vikings and the rams and you end up with a Thursday Night Football shoot out\nNow you got a marquee matchup in the AFC and you got a shootout and ratings are up and fans love it so you know from patriots perspective I think\nYou'll get us off and that did enough to win forty three forty and I don't think it's headed strike yet I think there's still room for growth here with Josh Gordon And Julian Edelman getting back into the mix and Hogan settling into his role so\nFor them to keep pace with you know the next big thing in the NFL this Andy Reid Patrick my home I retail off balance I think that's a really good sign and\nIt's a big win I mean you lose this game and I know we're only in October but there was a good chance you might be going to Kansas City in the playoffs and now if you have a rematch there's a much better chance that rematch happens that Gillette Stadium so I think the patriots reestablish themselves as the team to beat the conference\nAndy to me it kind of felt like watching that game that as you mentioned New England\nIs sort of just beginning to find their stride off offensively\nAnd Kansas City definitely had some things taken away on offensively by the New England defense and you know I Wonder if they're going to become Jumo homes happy like we know they can make all those big plays in the running game but I don't know if the run game is going to be consistent for them I don't know maybe it's just me\nI came away saying okay\nThat that kids the city team as they can flash and they can be people would speed\nBut are they really all that good at the end of the day\nWell I think they are very much rely on the big play whether it's tiring killed Travis Kelsey Korean hunt very big lie often and if you take away that big like now it's easier said than done I mean you leave that game was around harm and stuff on Gilmore those guys saying retail is the fastest player they've ever seen in their lives they've never seen anyone faster so\nYou know when he's coming across that zone\nThere was a reason why he runs right by gr on Harman like standing still but I think if they play a little more fundamentally sound\nYou're right you avoid those big place and I'm not sure Kansas City is in that mode yet of\nThe long slow drives the key play on third down after third down the things that we know that Tom Brady Rob Gronkowski they've proven their metal in that area but I Will say Kansas City also left points on the field you know early on and they all talked about it they missed throws your guys wide open and that's what happens when you're\nA a young quarterback or just not\nAt the top of your game just yet and those are throws you can't miss if you're going to go into Gillette play Tom Brady and the patriots you can't be giving away free touchdowns that are available in the first quarter because generally you come up short late in the game\nThat's what happened with them they kicked a bunch of field goals and they end up losing by a field goal so you know I think it's really interesting it'll be interesting to see if Andy Reid 'cause we saw it last year you know they were hot out of the gate repeat the patriots now it's a different quarterback I understand that Alex Smith\nIs certainly more of a gay manager and and the ... maker but can can Andy Reid gets that team over the hump and maybe if they get a little healthier on defense can can they slow somebody down but I'm the biggest takeaway for me is is what I started with uh you got two teams that can play shootout football because\nThe chief scored what forty thirty eight plus for the fourth time in six games patriots were thirty eight plus with a third straight game\nYou know there is often the AFC it's in Kansas City and it's annoying\nAndy Hardy majors football weekly with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh in almost kind of back some of the comments Brady made recently about\nHey the NFL is morphing into college football just spread 'em out throw it trying to play in space all the time although I Know you and I over the years of talks a lot about the patriots willingness to run the football\nMan it feels good to say that this is the first time I think maybe in the Brady era minus at the beginning when they had Corey deal in the running the football is an actual priority for this team and\nNo question you're looking at five straight weeks and I know the first couple of weeks\nWith ... show weren't great weeks two and three but since then they've dedicated the time to it the effort to it runs through it and they've had it paid off yet two hundred yard games last three weeks and the other one was whatever Ninety six Ninety eight yard so essentially\nSony Michel spin a three time hundred yard Russia jump like he's in the top five in the AFC now we've talked eight in the NFL\nAnd this is what we we thought he could be I mean anybody who saw him in college saw the ability to be more than a I think some people\nWhen the Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition at what point and he really Janeiro against the wind over two hundred three on cars all may call models had incredible prices log on to flood Otto John Tom now\nThere's no question Josh McDaniel has made a commitment to the running game and if you've got all kinds of credit your boys your big boys up front and I know it's the chiefs\nThey have a terrible run defensive banged up on defense but they own the line of scrimmage just wasn't like last week where it was one yard run one yard run thirty art Ron okay you end up with a hundred yards\nThis was six yard ... yards short yard as you move the trains this was trumped plays gassing them consistently and that's a good sign their balancing out the fence and that just makes them more dangerous it also\nI've been a big believer that when you can run the ball you should run the ball and I get into a lot of fights with with Paul thrill over this he says all that does is low the game down keep the score down well you should run the ball last night you did run the ball last night scored forty three points so stick that if you're low scoring game\nNow I'm with you on that man and and I think that it does a world of good for this football team to know\nThat you know it's always been stopped ... stop the wrong guy that went on third insured well you know there isn't there's never enough chatter on winning on third in short on off and then it's always well radio figure it out well\nIt's nice to take it out of Tom Brady hands every once in a while and quite honestly I think Tom Brady loved being able to turn around and hand off the phone trust that they're going to get true yards when it started in one\nNo question and I mean we talked about complementary football a lot with being off and defense specialties that's complimentary often that you can\nDo anything you want or at least have the threat\nOf doing anything you want it's not a\n... it's not a coincidence that you score a lot of points in defenses are struggling to stop you in\nYou know you mentioned not since bill and really you know there were these stretches where it would get to November or early December and it's like all of a sudden okay you know what we're gonna try to run the football now doesn't work that way you don't just flip a switch and decide you can run the football you know whether it's with even jak center like one or any of these guys it's hard to do\nWithout putting some effort into it early in the season and and and being dedicated to it and that's what I like to see and you know you're going to be able to throw the ball ready to rock radio Edelman you know that's coming and even the the Gordon\nBut if you can mix in Sony Michel I think it's really intriguing to see\nHow you can lean on that and it gives you another weapon in the tool box right you know you have those days even the oh Seventeen you have one of these days where the past Russia's getting during the Superbowl your scoring is down to turn to just be able to run the ball with some consistency and and I think they're they're putting in the investment now and it could pay off later\nAndy Hardy patriots football weekly with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh through six weeks the patriots kicked coverage units have been now not grade\nThey had the big hit up last night as well Andy my theory is you know normally it's a lot of those defensive backs that around those teams and now that you're playing five six sometimes seven defensive backs last night\nI Wonder if the way the game is changing in terms of spreading it out and put in five and six defensive backs on the field is what's hurting the patriots kicked coverage unit cheerful\nIt's a solid theory hum I don't know if it's it's you know the answer if that's really what's going on I Know you know some people say oh is it has to do with the new you know schemes and the new rules and you know late guys are lining up and I know\nYou know there was discussion or early in your talk coach Bela checked for a few times about it and some of the TV production meeting sort of the personnel on the ... coverage team and even the kick return team and how teams were doing it all a little differently and you know some teams going was safe over line backers or\nYou know defensive vans over linebackers and some spots and sort of changing their personnel and I wonder if that some of it with the patriots as they work through this the defensive backs the line backers the defensive and figuring out what what the right combination is but\nYou know the answer is simple they're not very good right now and you know I don't know if you've caught it last night but after they give up the long you know Ninety seven yard or and they check the next one back deep for a touch back\nThere was a Bronx cheer at George stadium and they deserved it they're kicked coverage and their decision the way they used the kickoff has been horrific and you know I think what really frustrates people is when you look at it and say\nOkay there's Matthew Slater running down the field and Brandon King and Nate ... Gino gruesome and these guys you're like these guys have one job and it's to play specialties to make sure you're not giving up thirty to Ninety yard returns with so much regularity to have them dead last in the NFL we kick off coverage when you have a very good kicker\nIs just unacceptable and you know they need to figure it out sooner rather than later because you know you have issues on defense\nAlready you don't want to be given them extra yards you know you certainly would\nWhat their Chevy GMC ...

different every night we know that Tatum brown\n... referred a Kyrie\nYou're probably not going to mess too much with them\nBut they're going to play games where Aaron Bain's meets white twenty five

where he's got to be happy playing nine minutes and having just gotten into the game so as much as we go nuts about starting five\nI really think it's about who becomes the closures for this team and even then routes it's still gonna be match up to ...\nAbsolutely I mean if you're coming down the stretch against them all up and simply minded team you might want Marcus Martin there and if you're coming down the stretch it you need more points you might want to hurt rosier in there for for an easy example but yeah I'm with you in terms of\nI'm not really worried at all about the starting lineup matter of fact I doubt I'll even recognize what it is on a night tonight bases in terms of oh I Can't believe so and so's not in there because I think it'd be stupid enough to play match

how much Brad Stevens Danny Ainge love this position was basketball that so and vote right now\nSo I mean you go out and you get all those six six six eight guys that are very versatile you don't want to leave your bench I mean who cares what a MBA you know tradition says you can play five small forwards if you want to play five small forward then the games definitely trending in a direction where that is not an outlandish a strategy at all so\nI Would expect the Celtics to play a lot of match up\nAnd don't be surprised if you see like I said all three of those wings on the court at the same time for extended periods of time especially once they were really get to speed under\nFive big questions about the Celtics that's where we're hitting with you one eight hundred three two one WPRI oh four three nine seven seven six jumping on the conversation right now question to how long will take Gordon Hayward to return to full strength\nMe or not I'm kind of talked about this but it was a couple of weeks ago I think it's going to be a good thirty games before vent than the Celtics and Brad Stevens and Gordon Hayward\nAre comfortable with where he's at for him to be able to cut loose and then really start to play some big minutes\nI think at times\nAh honestly Gordon Hayward is gonna be the score off the bench because they're going to be times where it's not going to be in the game and if you need scoring you're not always going to turn to Terry rosier you would think putting Gordon Hayward in there would be ... that's something that he could do but I think it's going to be slow early on her\nShe I agree I mean there's no reason to rush this guy ended the rotation yes I mean granted you want home court and would it be something to look back and say if the Celtics miss out on home court by a game or two that they should have brought hey we're back into the fold sooner rather than later sure but I think ultimately you just want him and everyone else for that matter healthy and ready for the playoffs are on\nThirty game seems a little extreme to me when I'm going to be focusing on is\nWhen they play a lot of games in a short period of time whether it's back to back or three games in five days or what have you and see what his minutes so like in the first instances of those games 'cause then you're kind of know or as opposed to just a single game sample you'll know how they really feel about him and where he's at in this condition and his comeback\nBased on how comfortable they are playing him a normal allotment of minutes on those back to back type situations\nQuestions three where the preseason hiccups of bumps on the road or a sign of some slippage\nAnd uh it's as simple as this there's a lot of veterans and they were in cruise control in the pre season which is why Brad Stevens went out of his way to rip the hell out of them\nYeah what was the record in the pre season ... nobody won one in ... or whatever and now I'm not I'm not worried about the\nPerson number four can Brad Stevens keep everyone engaged with minutes this is the biggest issue I think with this team this year because the one thing you cannot control as much as Brad Stevens is great communicator\nBut one thing you cannot control is when a pet chewing NBA player talks himself or has someone in his ear telling him\nThat his plane time isn't good enough and something isn't right even though the team could be winning we're talking about guys who wake up and just go\nStamina I should be play twenty minutes a night and the fact that I'm not as all the coaches fault that somebody Brad Stevens can't control it's only something he's going to have to manage and that still makes it very danger\nYeah like I said last week when we heard from all cheeseburger there the fact that markets Morris was basically saying that he knew that he was going to be the sixth or seventh the guy the first or second guy off the bench in the ... and he was openly talking about that as part of the team strategy that bodes well for what you're talking about but yeah who knows if happy Walters and mark is harder [laughter]\nWake up on a happy one day and want like fifty five minutes a game or something like that but you know if anyone's in a position to handle it Brad Stevens has shown us that he is probably a a good man for that job so I'm not really all that concerned but again I'm I'm basing it on the words of markets more so I tried lightly\nYeah that is true ah old burger a slim down a little bit looks decent Beshear hey we'll see if he's not planning a ton of minutes though you could you know\nBalloon up and he and his brother go jumped somebody in Harlem alleging that is true and then finally the fifth big question facing the Celtics in two thousand Eighteen wheel Jason Tatum in jail and brown take another step forward on both ends\nI think uh we're gonna see jail and brown just progressively get better and better I think Jason Tatum is about to take quantum leap in super stardom and there's going to be no denying this kid then at some point right now it's calories team in\nThree years it's Jason tapes team\nI see for me the question is what\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nYou look at him and you know that he could be like a Dwayne wade type player where he is the guy on the team and he can donkey can shoot threes you can do it all his skill set is always going to be tantalizing but I'm with you in terms of I see both of them taking a

explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury is ... is\nOh of course you know I'm running I'm trying to win no I'm not I'm really trying to ruin this campaigns but anyway\nIt was a for operators who is a sports books in the state twenty four million dollars in revenue they handled one hundred and eighty four million dollars a waiter so\nConsidering the fact that they lost a few months ago those seem like some pretty pretty huge numbers I read a and yeah it's going to only get bigger we're not even close to mature marketing a Jersey there's going to be a more grow more marketing more people getting into the market so\nI'm pretty early days that are out of the good side of things to come for other states that are going to legalize it\nJustin is there anything about the gambling that is in what's being gambled on that has surprised you in any way like whether it's golf or is there a sport or something that was off the radar that's getting a lot more action to maybe you anticipated\nYeah I mean obviously September of ... was started about these and then I fell in college and there's a lot of betting on that but\nYou know what we've seen over the first few months of there's a lot of interest in in other things to definitely I mean obviously people are betting on baseball but seems like golf is pretty pretty big sports about on in in New Jersey there is actually a PG tour event there in August so I think people are getting a lot on golf especially with the return of Tiger Woods to to prominence I think\nA that's an intriguing a vertical watching the sports betting\nYeah and Dustin I look I follow NASCAR and I know that at the most recent NASCAR race in Dover, Delaware from what some of my friends in the sport told me and what I've heard talked about\nIs that it was almost like there was a stand or you could get your French fries where you could get your collectible and where you can place a bet on the race can you walk us through a little bit how Delaware has handled it in terms of\nHaving something at and the ad and event like NASCAR race where you wouldn't think a lot of those people would be dropping shackles Tibet on their favorite driver\nYeah so the NASCAR event there is actually a right on the property area the property of Dover Downs which is one of the three sports uh three casinos is allowed to have sports betting in Delaware\nYou can only have a physical sports books and celebrate can't have on line or mobile wage reading so what they did is actually set up a temporary little standing next to a right outside the grandstand there and ask a NASCAR than there and just said hey if you want to come back on it here's a here's some ... you can bet on it so\nDefinitely it's a you know there's a going to be more of that I think at events a an arena is I think I think uh there's owners out there ... because of the Washington franchises those franchises has said he must have kiosk unforeseen ratings arena so that's the kind of thing and especially if you have on line way during you're going to see that a lot to\nDustin Gallagher legal sports report dot com with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh talking about sports gambling across the country hey were there any early returns on how many people actually took advantage of that chaos there with the ah Dover racetrack or is it still a little too early to get those numbers yeah\nOh yeah well the waiting till next I think later this month early next but yeah I mean I saw some extra is there's a there was a line for for the waitress so I think if you were a you know the all the the advertising you solve the stand and you're a NASCAR fans like why not\nWhy not put a couple of dollars down on the race you are already there that is one of the advantages of sports betting right it's a way to you know engage fans during during the events keeps makes the event more interesting if you have a little bit of of money riding on the outcome I lose the needle I mean not like some amazing amount of money but I think I Would imagine\nIt got a fair bit of a traffic it interests\nThere and I also they do something to think we need to remember is this the first time that that was available when\nThe first time always be the smallest number but the fact that people now are hip to the game and they understand that it is a possibility maybe they weren't prepared for this time but next time you can make those kind of preparations and I got to think especially when you have it in a live event sporting a v a\nVenue that those numbers are just going to increase dramatically over the next couple of years\nYeah I totally agree ah you're going to like I said you're going to see another place do you know Delaware's also looked at online we drink I'm having it actually the phones in an online so you're gonna\nYou're still early days right there's ... there's so much marketing that needs to be done to uh educating the public like uh the the the Supreme Court ruling just down in may were just what five months later so uh we're not even close to the end of this we're way more like the first sitting or the started flagged for NASCAR to see that an hours\nVery good I don't see her legal sports report\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything around because we're sort of by buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nAs to how long it will take before we have it in every state of the union or will there be some states that will hold out and not jump into the sports gaming industry\nOr there's definitely not going to be in every state like there's two ... Hawaii and Utah which basically have no one of the gambling and also I think you can pretty much scratch them off the list for sports betting but\nEverybody else is at least the possibility I think you know I I don't know what the the law tail is but you know within five years I think I'd be shocked if we don't have sports betting in at least half the states and eventually given a long enough rising maybe like two thirds we're at\nWe're currently at six different states right now that that has sports betting what's Rhode Island in Pennsylvania go live as\nA later this year will be up to eight so and then we'll probably you know I'd say that I Am a year and a half down the road will will have doubled that number so it'll be a little slower I think in the beginning but they are going to your caller is I'd say how the popular after the states in the union of sports betting within not too long\nYeah Dustin it's really interesting around here to me is somebody who's lived in New England for healthy chunk of my wife we have to monolith casinos over in Connecticut in ... son and their state legislature can't figure out how to get some sort of legislation on boats\nTo let those two entities jump into the game in Rhode Island is reading every one two punch here in New England\nI Know that our governor has very high expectations\nYou know some of the numbers that she put into the budget some people laughed at thinking that you know they're going to get twenty four million in revenue every year from this I think that number is very high right now\nBut are you surprised that Massachusetts and especially Connecticut in particular weren't ready for this and that they're going to be to the market by the smallest state the union\nYeah I think ah I think there's something to be said for that I you know what your project the production that they're throwing around twenty four million I Do think that ... year one especially with retail sports books on Leno online where you drink but yeah Connecticut was talking about it kind of all or even before passed a and a and then after and then\nThey just the laughter sports betting ban came down and they just couldn't get they get their their stuff together and time to do it uh for this year so I think it's going to be a a high priority for them I also think Massachusetts with both MGM and when having properties now in Massachusetts I think\nThey're definitely going to move quickly I I kind of be shocked if they both don't do it but yeah Rhode Island has kind of set the tone and you know I think there's something to be said for\nThese first movers the you know we can see we've seen in Mississippi for instance which is kind of it on an island they've they've legalized sports book they've seen a lot more interest in their casinos they've seen a lot of people go in their sports books and I can't imagine there's not some kind of casino tourism or people are saying hey let's let's go check out the sports books in Rhode Island if you have a choice between\nA a casino without sports book and one on one with the that that has one and one that doesn't I think you're going to check the one that that does all things being equal so I'd say Rhode Island is going to see a little bit of that bump in the short term until anyone else in the region gets up and running\nThe sitting governor of legal sports report dot com here on the ground show on WNPR oh in terms of the industry itself like I Know how the bet on the total I Know how to bet on the side I Know how to parlay\nBut where is the growth and a lot of people talked about in game betting Dustin I where is the highest ceiling in terms of once people sort of get hit that they can place bats is there is something that the industry is counting on this going to just add\nMore to the chills so to speak\nYeah in game betting like you say is uh where it's going you can already do that in Nevada to kind of limited extent you can bet on odds and and the spread and the total as as the game goes on constantly move those lines\nAnd you're going to see more of that and Europe at the pretty advanced products where you can bet on all sorts of things are in play the game is going on\nAnd I you know we're here in the United states can do a little bit of the offshore books but I think it's not a super robots product that you're going to see a lot of innovation I think you're going to try to see a lot of people trying to capitalize on on that education of saying hey you know you can't you know\nWhile you can bet on before games you can also have you wrap on\nAs things are as games going on and just as bad as things go on to and just you know maybe maybe it's just a couple of dollars if you go but that's that's where it is and you know and and larger than that it's ... like like I said Rhode Island doesn't have voted off the bat so um you know if you want to fully capitalize on sports way during in any state you definitely have a noble Adrian\nAnd finally I'm Glad you mentioned a mobile dust\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln ...
