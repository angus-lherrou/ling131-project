which hardly anybody ... you don't have to step on it to go to other parts of the house\nAnd it looks fine and I was wondering if I could have that taking up underneath this hardwood and I wanted that every finish it but my carpeting in my bedroom which is smaller\nIs warm and I was wondering if I could put that carpet in the bedroom\nI don't see any reason that you couldn't do that um you know pulling the carpet up is pretty easy to do as long as it was put down correctly to begin with a little caution you if that space\nIn the living room turns out to be not one piece of corporate ... carpet with a scene in the middle of it does seem could be your weak link\nAnd the Mets he may not be obvious to you if it was done well to begin with but when he took the carpet up you may find that it's basically two pieces of all the wall carpet seems together would seem to have and then if you try to move the peace upstairs the tape could break apart because now you're kind of disturbing it\nAnd you may have a bit of a mess on your hands [laughter] but I see no reason why you couldn't use the carpet it's certainly possible that said I think the most expensive part of this project is going to be the labor because you're gonna have to have a professional carpeting store do this work\nAnd considering the fact that the upstairs bedroom is fairly small be added cost a brand new carpet might not really that much to the overall project so think about the economics of this okay\nIf you're going to spend money on those dollar is going to cost you X dollars to to have them come into the old carpet out kind of new piece to fit upstairs mood upstairs and how much more can the carpet possibly cost you especially if you bought around that or something of that nature\nOh I see yeah I think it's one a long piece I really\nDid it depends because usually the votes of carpeting or Thirteen feet\nSo if you've got a run of the room that's bigger than Thirteen feet than you know\nYou're probably going to have seen somewhere in there the other thing to consider is that twenty year old petting might not be reusable so you might have to get new patting whereas if you got new carpeting they're going to throw in padding for the most part so you think of all those things\nAre a little good luck with that project gave me some stuff to think about it eight six six six three nine seven

types of floors are generally considered to be the most eco friendly first there's work and it's a good choice for several reasons first of all it's sustainable\nIt looks great it lasts a long time and it's quiet now the flooring is made from the bark of the cork oak tree which is stripped every nine years and then it goes back and it looks no damage on the tree whatsoever\nNow banned in another great option foreigners manufactured from the band or plant which is actually a type of grass which makes them ... percent tangible\nThen but it's going to grow very very quickly and any little water to thrive bamboo is going to grow back within five to ten years as opposed to the thirty to one hundred years that it takes to grow traditional heartland and that makes than but one of them are eco friendly foreign products of animal\nBut the other big advantage of bamboo is that it's really ... I mean during the manufacturing process strand bamboo becomes one of the hardest most durable natural boring options in the marketplace and even though bamboo is a grass it actually looks and feels and most importantly you kind of reforms just like aren't with\nMhm and it's gorgeous it's really a great choice and that's today's foreign ... presented by lumber liquidators where you'll find him Morningstar bamboo flooring\nMorning sorry the naturally beautiful and ecologically friendly product that evoke the feeling of luxury it's available and you know they're just trying to capture and in a variety of things an extra wide wet like new Monticello bamboo making Morningstar bamboo flying up complimented any brand designed\nMorningstar members ... lumber liquidators stores nationwide and online and lumber liquidators dot com\nEd ... is on the line but the heating and cooling question what can we help you with us today\nOf good at home or if there were that dial on the base about three thousand square feet and companies have upstairs room in the kitchen and dining room Pedro feeling\nThat part of the house fame about ten ten ten degrees warmer than the rest of the house I'm Heather ate the check and they say that arises adequate but I was wondering if there is a insulation problem and as a way to correct\nWell it's basically he lost and yes whenever you have 'cause he's real feeling you can't get as much insulation in the ceiling structure and because he rises and you've got the ceiling up there you're going to have a warmer second floor so how do you combat that well there's a couple of things\nOne of which is do you have ceiling fans up there here right and the ceiling fans are not helping the pushing the warm air down so that it can be cool in the summer\nIt held\nOne of the things you might want to do is considering supplementing the second floor with a split duck with system or him and his foot Douglas\nIt's usually easier to do that then to overrun the ... the main air conditioner to get the second floor cooler and the long run you use less energy that way\nSometimes in in uh in reading on the home designed you're going to get a warm area of the house that just can't get enough air delivered to it because of its design\nYou know in in my home I've got er an office on the west side of the house and it just happens to be pretty far from where\nThe air and water isn't so it always stays a bit warmer and I put his foot Douglas system in there and just to kind of supplement the central air we still have central air in the same space for the split ... supplements it quite nicely does a really good job of keeping a very cool uncomfortable in those warm summer days so I Would suggest you consider that as an option here\nOkay now what it helped to put a like a power ran in the roof\nNo because you don't have an addict you have an out of you have a cathedral so there's no attic space there plus those uh exhaust his editor exhausts fans typically take as much for air conditioning air out of the house and they do hot air because they depressurize the addict so much that they tend to draw down into the house and steals some air conditioning here at the same time\nOkay All right All right ed thank you very well thanks so much for calling us at the end of the money to\nGet ahead and do you feel how life process of picking out a pink collar\nWe feel your pain guys are going to share some tips on how you can make the right choice and now the twenty ninth team color on the air\nOut all ready and in fact Tovar all a mess and more when the money can\nFreedom doesn't dark and the White House dot in your house here's how incredible on Halloween thousands of college students can costume party the bugs are tired of being part is a fun but this year they found the PC police in charge and campuses cracked America when universities at it\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln him Casey Lincoln him getting ...

I don't know if you hurt or you know any of these people thought maybe that certain Kansas City chiefs and the team as a whole ... over perform the expectations of the public\nMaybe they placed wages down a matter of fact I don't know one of these people myself maybe you'd do though and so I think that's why the line is the way it is is that the patriots were huge Bay Bridge and it's been bet down because of the strong performance or the bar by my Kansas City chiefs\nSay so really grandma is the one that's moving this body but there were a couple of things that jumped out to me about\nCity the New England is going to be able to take advantage of now which be real clear on this for those of you to look at the box score\nAnd you see the ... for four hundred and thirty yards and that ... that was about as high low or four hundred yard performance as you're going to find in the history of the national football league\nWait portals was yeah I Know I won't use reaches wide I use my own\nBleak portals was hot\nLooking for a guard credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east religion Narragansett have the best financed rates of unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what are those are tough\nNow you know why is boy portals like no one saw the great boy portals\nAh kids the city saw the real Blake portals who was thirty three sixty one for four to thirty yards a touchdown for interceptions at five sex that is the real Blake portals but they moved the ball on the Kansas City deep\nAnd this is the difference between a New England and the Jacksonville and\nYou can talk about all of the different individual talent the Jacksonville has on defense you can talk about that till the cows come home\nCan you perform on third down in the red zone\nThat's how great defenses are judged\nAnd Jacksonville their defense allowed them to hang around in the game\nBut it just wasn't enough to be able to get it done in arrowhead against ... Holmes who was okay uh-huh you're great no three Thirteen no touchdowns two interceptions\nBut the kid didn't get rattled and that's what impressed me about my homes is that it didn't have to hang on his head it was All right skip let's just get back up there and let's get on the wagon and let's go try to score more touch downs\nBut there was one big thing that jumped out to me and why Jacksonville didn't stay with this I have no idea\nThey ramble and Kansas City and I understand that there are some of you know 'cause it's not a mean issue I Know there are some of you in patriot nation\nThat running the ball means you're giving up because if it's not let me throw it five hundred times a game with our morning football savior Thomas Edward Brady then why would we wrote a play that might only get three yards when you're on the ball hub Gary\nAnd part of that is because there been a lot of media rooms who just switch whatever their opinion is year after year and keep rolling that out there every one but the only way to win is what the ball and Tom Brady sands\nAnd I think what we're learning is see that men who heads words that ballot check him and that's when golly that he's got locked away in the basement there that guy named Ernie Adams roots close personal friend a root for\nThis I think he he woke up and said Hi we got to be able to run the ball good boy and herds worth was like a ... you're right [noise]\nWell it's built up that way now they're not one dimensional don't get me wrong but people like make it out that the running game is a dirty thing it isn't TJ yelled at an average five point three yards per carry on ten carries\nAnd then they just stopped throwing the ball\nLike I get it that they were into getting into the fourth quarter that's twenty three seven game there's no need for Jacksonville to come out of the game plan but if you watch that Kansas City defense\nThey can be pushed around and think now I Know I say when is hurt but think of all of the moves\nThe New England made in the off season to be able to have another way to beat or keep up with a team like Kansas City\nAll the moves along the line all the bringing in the old line and let's mix and match and see who we got and then they draft Sony Michel\nAnd sodium show he's starting to come along I Know those of you read ... grades yesterday in the Providence Journal yeah that's right big Sunday billing for aggressors grades this week\nYou see one I've written about Sony Michel when I told you you're on the radio which is just the way\nIt's only going to be a matter of time because the kids a good football player and now you're going to throw in a little bit of James White who's got some wiggle to him and I'm not going straight thunder and lightning\nBut the patriots will run the ball on this Kansas City defense now\nI may be a step away from declaring this uh Kansas City defund straight garbage but they're pretty close that is not a good defense Jacksonville killed themselves yesterday I think come in here\nI don't think most homes is going to be as much I'd just praised his poise [noise] um\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and super all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition it was more than ... religion or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all make all models and incredible prices are going to flood all those on jobs now", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Gresh Show", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "08"}
