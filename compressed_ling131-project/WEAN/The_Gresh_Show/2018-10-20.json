yet so far for three to Rob bags among men rolled out a bunch of numbers in terms of Drew Brees playing outside of a dome and how about this and he's just really good and I think New Orleans going to win this game because I'd only Baltimore and keep up often simply\nThis number will ah both ... both of our opinion on this uh situation which again if you could use a number to support your point why

Series game that we're on the air for a a preview and we couldn't be happier about that by the rest of around the NFL Dallas is at Washington by the\nWay our bags by men revising that game's moved to a pet so I'm taking my point that I was giving the or the Dallas Cowboys it's been a twenty minutes I'm I'm doing\nOkay that's where I have no record it's within the same show yeah I thought it was fair yep I've got no problem with that\nBecause we want to teach the people crash it is very wise to take advantage of line movements when at all possible damn straight it is\nNow I'm or make up your

you know I forgot to gain some can't go back to bed\nDallas at Washington yeah I have no feel for this game whatsoever\nYeah I mean I just my field grass is the overreaction\nOn Dallas croaking Jackson they're not good I don't write down again right and as you know if this came as a pick then that means that the odds makers rabbits have said that on a neutral field Dallas's winning by three and really that interested\nMe the link and but yeah I don't know I don't know why they were able to be Jacksonville but I don't think it was some sort of change and philosophy where all of a sudden Jason Garrett's figured it all out and all those wide receivers that ... got not I just think they beat a team that was still running the ball when they were down twenty eight nothing for some\nYeah in a team that's just not playing very well in Jacksonville right here it's called Jacksonville wrong time and they got a great performance white portals that day I said to the idea\nIs that Kansas City probably the second sexiest game on the board read behind New Orleans at Baltimore and a Cincinnati is going to put up a fight yeah because they're among the few teams who have the ability to score points in bunches and if you look at\nHow would you like motor trends twenty gene truck of the here for only one I mean I Will say hello to port boards twenty eighty four to one fifty so desperate for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at point forward and he went into an arrogant but\nWe have a lot of play back you up they turn they get they get big plays they get a turnover they turned it into points uh I'm not a big fan of the red rocket ah any Dalton but you know that guy is a better than average quarterback a and how will Kansas City react\nComing off of a loss and did New England do anything but says that he looks out and says are okay so that's how you slow down this play or that play or that scheme and then on Monday Night the giants at a\nWith the downtown atmosphere you know what it's like you're not on the black and gold and setting with the three rivers in stadiums\nAre right on the on the river across from downtown where you've got your child before it intersects with them and I get ill in the Allegheny and uh you know that's a great ... that's a great venue especially in the in the late fall in particular when there's a ... year\nAbout ... having gone there December of Columbia fourteen and the history of that\nIs living and breathing there and also the way that are in and the newly renovated parts of ramble field they have been able to lend now all the amenities of a modern stadium with the things that you appreciate about the old ballparks and the old arenas in stadiums it's\nIt's it's really a wonderful place it's a bucket list places a football fan you've got to get\nThere yeah I I definitely want to do that patriot voice Bob so see here on the ground show on WNPR at well Bob would get to the bears and I know there are a lot of ties with Kansas City with many negative and some of the things that they're doing all fence simply too which I kind of ... during the week okay you can run the same scheme when\nYou don't have that same kind of speed like you were dealing with the Kansas City Bob did the best of your knowledge and research how similar ... medically will Chicago be to Kansas City even though the ... and the Joe's are different\nAnd I think it's very similar in and certainly you're not finding a cure following quite going on to do with the speed\nAnd the ability of tiring kill delete them catch it off the item and men land on the ground I just turn on the jets and run away on a Sunni weren't well off but that being said\nUh you know they and again they don't have a lot in the caliber of Kelsey but well they have good players at those positions and I think the difference in this game you know at least on the surface going in and they're really two big differences one in Kansas City or when you're comparing the two opponents of mess\nPatrick ... homes with his arm strength and and what he shut us with the ability to throw the ball down the other just what he wants to get almost immediately in his NFL career I and then the defense of Chicago big difference make it because it's far better\nWith the patriots faced on Sunday night but haven't sold out I think there are a lot of similarities ...\nCall place at the end of last year had to return to talk with him and this system that he runs is very much like ... you know they do a lot with information's in their emotions to get what they want to do exploit\nMismatch is and force you to defend\nEvery inch of the field every political process they say to recall it was a really terrific uh an exciting player to watch and now he's dynamic in return game I Am certainly is but to a a a back that uh is going to carry the ball a lot I Would imagine a the way that uh you know we've\nGot accustomed to seeing or somebody like you know Lewis but he reminds me a little bit of a of a young Lewis when he catches the ball and\nUh he says he he kind of patterns was game a bit after sorry killing that we've seen for him I think what the heck is it from all over the place they will lined up\nOr just about everywhere trade or in his attack on that I have like the life going back to the practices between the patriots habit eagles uh several years ago we saw last year throw the ball of course Philly Special and uh he's become a pretty good weapons for the last couple of weeks and then they've got\nA receiver like Alan Robinson though that horrible but nonetheless is a guy go up and get a jump ball for sure as any reproductive career when healthy in Jacksonville and and it's had a good stretch in Chicago Anthony Miller is younger\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of never against it on parallel Marjorie impeccable surface\nToward the end of his career but it really is a a quick and shifting class they did a lot of pieces with which to work however it is a bad fit you know it was very productive for a couple years less so these days but the role of the components from ... to do what he's going to try to do and that's just like\nThe vulnerabilities or the patriots defense ... Peterson last year in the semi ... that I just they comes down to the quarterback play and one thing I'll see what's your ... and he's one of very effectively and there'll be some\nIn all likelihood design runs for the quarterback on Sunday and we know the kind of problems patriots who've had when it comes to defending bubble quarterbacks\nAnd that Anthony Miller from Memphis big into kick return game if they turn him loose he was dominant in college for Memphis in terms of returning kicks Bob Sophie here I'm addressed show on WNPR robot let's look inward at the patriots is kind of feels like and correct me if I'm wrong here but\nFor a couple of weeks the sees her rocky now what kind of feels like everything is home around this football team is that a fair statement\nYet I think things are definitely studying for the football team is still a long way to go you know you look at the office of production the last three weeks and obviously a huge spike and there's a sense okay the getting back to what we've come become accustomed to the patch without on the\nGround ... all the continued development of Josh scored a concerted effort last week to get him involved or perhaps a you know maybe a it over a commitment early on in that game against Kansas City James White and Sony Michel ... and it's an all fenced it has put a\nThirty eight thirty and forty three and yet at the same time it's Tom Brady has set up on a couple of times in the very recent past\nNow they feel like they've lost a lot out there and defensively I thought last week and the first half really\nThe defense played a ... in every way I think uh you know as as you would have hoped going into the game given the expectations of the game they got red zone stops and they turned up all over twice\nAnd they gave the elephants an opportunity to go into halftime with the to score leak they've been sustained that in the second half a and and I think that's that's a bit concerning because what strides they've made\nAgainst both the Indianapolis in Kansas City were marked by regression and the second half of each of those games and then there's the issue with special ... it started a lot of return or\nA Anthony mailer and there are others ... tone is a terrific pump return to embrace Callahan is a guy you may not even get a chance to return to the game he's got a touchdown on his resume and the return game she got this very similar uh in in in that face and the patriots have struggled of like the coverage kicks\nThat's been a problem and it was a huge problem not only the Ninety seven yards but another time as well on Sunday against the Kansas City chiefs and that's characteristic for them we don't expect the patriots\nHave a disadvantage at the end of the night when it comes to average starting field position and that's by virtue of the fence it off as but it's that third phase which\nOf course Bill Belichick values as much as the others\nBob do you have a theory as to why they struggled like mine is look your point five six seven defensive backs more than ever now\nThat's where you now have a bigger concentration of those guys on your roster whereas a couple of years ago linebacker was probably the you know but why backing group was a little thicker in terms of numbers and you could deploy those guys on special teams you combine that with you can practice it\nIt's hard to tackle now in the NFL maybe got guys that are out there trying to change people all over the field\nI don't know that's my theory what are what are you seeing out there\nWell it's funny I met met these letters are honest this week with us and in talking to him about things you know you look at the the new roller you don't get\nThe running start and because of the myths that should be able to return team to have\nA everybody but you know the three guys who are back to work within Fifteen yards you're still teams on both sides on the coverage part of it and the return part of it go a little bit lighter um and you know as as as letters sent us all is said let's look at that point in by the rules and I think when you look at the patriots\nMay have more course special team players\nAnybody and you're looking for brand and king for Nicholas Grigsby a Matthew sweaters guy that we we've watched year after year or pro bowl distinction a and Amy start at seven straight times that I think well at the end of his career making hall of fame consideration uh but you look at\nThe patriots personnel I mean they should\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in each bring a generic ended up the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent NPR for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto John come\nAnd I think ... you know as someone who was British pleased with it and I I don't think it really has has has a lot to do with the guys that are playing defensively because you know you look at the other night he on crossing who's a rookie quarterback and really doesn't play on ... goes down said he's got a chance to make a stop on Trayvon Smith\nIn a deep uh deepen the Kansas City a part of the field and and missiles on them\nI you know in in in in and you get your seen guys knock it off blocks and uh you know they've got two or three of the best special team originally meant just Slater but you'll you consider native dramatic rich me as a guy that ... billion harmful or since his\nAcquisition same thing with bragging came that's why he's on this team so we've got to be better and better\nBought last thing for you know the patrons don't have a road and when is that something about what you can use to keep their tension or is that just happenstance and it's all going to work out at the end of the year because it always does\nOne Fifteen a sit in the game's going into the season\nAnd there are lost in Jacksonville uh they

our telephone number online at ... dot com let me ask you a question about your investments that's a big subject these days with the recent market volatility that we've had over the past couple of weeks [noise]\nWhat is the rate of return you're expecting from your portfolio on average per year\nOver the next ten years now I'm not suggesting it should be looking at what you're ready to return ought to be this year or what it is the past quarter or what it did yesterday or you know earlier in the week no I I mean\nWhat rate of return on average long term would you think is a reasonable expectation to receive\nWell here's a guideline for you that might be helpful the Ohio public employees' retirement system\nThis is the state of Ohio which manages money for the retirement of all of the employees who work for the state of Ohio they manage one hundred billion dollars on behalf of tens of thousands\nProbably hundreds of thousands of employees and the state of Ohio they project how much money they're going to earn on their investments for an annual basis and they have just lowered\nTheir assumed rate of return from seven point five percent to seven point two percent per year\nSo was your gas was your expectation when I ask you the question higher than seven point five I suspect that for a lot of folks the answer would have been yes we routinely come upon people\nWho tell us that they expect to earn eight percent a year ten percent a year twelve percent a year\nAnd I'm here to tell you that the average annual return of yes and the five hundred since Nineteen twenty six according to ... it's ... percent a year if you have a one hundred percent stock portfolio and you leave that money invested entirely in stocks for decades you might be able to\nGet a ten percent return you might\nJust because that did that in the past doesn't mean that is what you're going to get in the future we all know pest performances and guaranteed future results will understand that

financial or a little unhappy with me and I want to share with you why\nBecause there's a lot of really important financial planning lessons regarding us that could help you [noise] uh\nBack in September I said back in September last month in my newsletter inside personal finance and we publish a among the newsletter sixteen pages it's one lots of awards are very proud of it I I wrote an article\nThat was called a choice to critical to leave to children\nAnd it was about how allowing your child to select the wrong college major can lead to future financial stress what I said in that article is that twenty four percent of recent college graduates who are fully employed so we're talking about recent college graduate have a job\nOne out of four of them are getting financial help from their parents which is astonishing to me parents are helping their kids pay their cell phone bills car insurance car payments\nAre and so my message in the article was you can't allow Eighteen year olds to choose college majors based on their wins I wrote you need to help them choose colleges and majors wisely pursuing degrees that will be marketable when they graduate\nAnd allow them to earn a comfortable living and I cited a study revealing that ten worst\nCollege majors for getting hired and here are six of them\nGeneral social scientists anthropology philosophy liberal arts English and fine arts\nWell that generated emails from two of our clients Judy wrote to me and she said wreck\nI majored in psychology and when I retired Eighteen years ago I was making two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and my daughter majored in art history and she ran an engineering firm before she retired\nThen I saw the obituary for Robert ... who is the chairman of the Federal Trade commission he majored in English\nSo how 'bout surveying your most financially successful clients to see what their undergraduate major was you might be surprised that there were many liberal arts majors that was Judy\nJak also wrote and he wanted to voice his displeasure with the article to he was annoyed that the article made no mention of the other values of education regarding liberal arts and he felt that my article overvalued monetary gain\nIn the educational pursuit well I really do appreciate Judy's and Jack's comments and hey you may have similar feelings but you know what Judy Zaidi for her daughter is sixty jak\nSeventy to the world was so totally different when they went to college\nJudy went to college sixty years ago back then a liberal arts degree was of great value not just individually but also to help securing an Exxon career she proved\nBut that's no longer the case today students spend a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more plus six years on average to get a degree uh thirty students drop out in their freshman year even after they might have spent thirty thousand dollars or forty thousand dollars less than half of students graduate even after six years\nBut they still walk away the student loans an average of thirty grand per student\nHalf of Americans today have student loan debt\nToday going to college is a huge financial commitment with an enormous implications on the lives of the students so yeah sure I'm willing to bet that if we pull our clients is Judy suggests\nWho went to college Thirty years ago forty fifty sixty years ago yeah liberal arts majors will in fact be revealed to have had successful careers but that's driving by looking through the rearview mirror\nThe fact that it worked in the Nineteen hundreds doesn't mean that those degrees are properly preparing students for the futures that they're\nGoing to have now look I'm a liberal arts graduate myself so I Know the full value of that education but when I went to college in the Nineteen eighties I paid sixty eight bucks a month for housing tuition was twenty five hundred bucks a semester\nToday tuition room and board is routinely exceeding fifty thousand dollars and so yeah sociology psychology history poetry they're all very important but we've got to examine these majors for their economic viability due to their cost so yes get that knowledge\nBut we need to do it more cheaply get it on line through self study or other ways and we need to focus instead on what college has unfortunately\nA platform for career preparation the U.S economy according to the apartment of labor now\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you do by hours logged onto our car buyers are tough\nThis doesn't make any sense first time this was ever happen according to the Labor Department how was it you've got six million people out of work but seven million jobs available there's only one reason for this the people who are out of work are not trained for the jobs that are available that's the problem\nYeah I'm afraid that um the cause might be lost you know the notion of going to school for personal enrichment and development might be lost and I say that with limitation because I shared Judy's concerns and I share jacks concern\nBut as a financial planner my duty is to help our clients get their kids off to a good start in life without jeopardizing the parents owned retirement future\nAnd so I simply can't endorse the decision to let an Eighteen year old decided to major in a career\nAt a private out of State University that will cost two hundred thousand dollars over six years that isn't going to lead to a job opportunity you know I'm Sorry when someone says to me that they're going to major in philosophy and my great you're going to go work for a philosophy company\nMean it just it just doesn't seem to make any sense anymore higher ed is not what you and I fondly recall it to be it's a brave new world nowadays\nAnd so I've got no choice but to help our clients and their kids navigate it effectively I'm Sorry that that's the situation but I figure it's better to acknowledge it\nThan to ignore it and if you want any evidence of this just look at the announcement made this week\nBy the c._e._o. of bank of America he says that he has just finished cutting one hundred thousand jobs in less than a decade at the ... and he said quote it was all caused\nBy the ability to apply technology to processes and capabilities unquote\nHe says they're twenty six million\nOf the banks customers that are using the mobile banking at therefore they don't need any human interaction artificial intelligence and robotic process these have allowed the firm to cut out eighty four thousand work hours a year you only work two thousand hours a year they've just cut out eighty four thousand hours a year you do the math\nHe said the bank had too many managers about thirty thousand of them and so he fired a third of them over just the last couple of years is it any wonder that according to Gallup only forty eight percent of the American public has a lot of confidence in higher education\nAnd this is why it's so important that we apply a proper lens and the question of will my child go to college and if so what will be that major and what institution will the child a chance to get that degree\nBecause spending two hundred thousand dollars on the degree that doesn't provide the economic reward\nIs setting your child up for failure not success think about it because your child's financial future depends on it [noise]\nSo if your child headed to college if you're struggling to figure out what college you

due diligence that's Susie Orman did for choosing an investment but she also says quote\nYou should do lots of your own research before buying an investment unquote so let me get this straight she's telling us to do lots of research before picking and investment but she picks a stock\nBecause it was a cool name and she liked the idea of being an Amazon\nGet rid of that who is on businesses that

na [laughter] welcome\nBack to the gentleman show we talked often about the need for Americans to prove their retirement security clearly retirement accounts like for when the plans another employer retirement plans or a key element of this Social Security plays\nA important role as we talk often here on the program and to help us further the conversation I'm happy to welcome to the show Lynn Doug like she's senior vice president of global retirement and compensation policies for the American\nBenefits council Lynn thanks so much for joining us on the show today a pleasure thank you for having me\nSo at present four one K. planes around the country pretty much everything else for three D's for fifty sevens the thrift savings plans for federal employees all these retirement plans in the workplace they they tend to be filled with mutual funds\nThat's pretty much the investment of choice of rebel ability for millions of American workers and it's up to you as the worker to figure out how to invest in the plan\nBut that's where a lot of the attention and focus goes with the real key\nIs when you're in retirement how'd you withdraw the money out how do you generate income that's not only going to meet your needs today but income that will last an entire lifetime\nAnd and so it kind of makes sense doesn't it to offer lifetime income opportunities so talk about that Lynn\nWell that's an area that policymakers happy and to get their arms around for a long time the focus had been on accumulating assets\nAnd I think it has the focus has ship that part of that is because so many people are close to retirement lifetime income options as a form of distribution as a way of receiving your money\nSuch as a monthly income over the rest of your life has not been a common distribution option that was included in four O. one K. plans\nAnd so what is happening now is to figure out how would I Do have that kind of option in their plans\nIn my experience as a financial advisor most of the training that advisors get\nOn helping clients put money in one of the contribution limits what are the investment options how do you build a portfolio is relatively little training on how do you take the money out and how do you do so in a manner that well not only mean declines needs today but unable to sustain that need over the course of the entire lifetime\nBlood legion is southern Rhode Island's Vermeer luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit wider of Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln MTV I mean all new twenty or gene Lincoln Navigator ...\nAlso was really focused on that road or more holistic motion of world being so limb share with us we're that's all about\nThat is an area of of extreme importance to plan sponsors\nMany of them have adopted these very broad financial wellbeing programs that covered the gambit of\nHow much should you save what our barriers that are keeping you from saving because many people do have barriers to saving such a student loans or\nA lack of emergency funds or just not great management skills not not a lot of budgeting management skills and then they want to help people understand\nWhat the different investment options are how to how to manage your money as your career progressive and then how to manage your money in retirement including\nNot only how to make your money last\nBut you need there there are other things that you need to consider as well things like what will the cost of healthcare be a how will I manage a where I live uh how will I manage a you know the allocation of my money\nTo uh investments versus income because even in retirement you're still going to want to be earning some money on the amount of money that is invested so these are all things that you have to think about\nWhat percentage of employers are engaging in these kinds of programs or for their employees\nSo when you talk about the very large companies the fortune one hundred even the fortune five\nHundred it's growing exponentially so a very large the larger the company the more likely they are to have these programs\nOne of the problems of course is that most of America is employed by small companies small businesses\nYeah that's exactly right so one of the challenges for policymakers is how to help small employers do the same thing\nWhat advice would you give listeners if their employer isn't providing a wellness program for them\nWell the first thing you you want to do is ask them if the the company offers some educational information I'm also I think asking yourself how are you planning to pay for health care and retirement\nAnd the other thing I Would tell people is that you should look at how much Social Security will pay you\nPay attention to Social Security\nI think that a lot of folks are over estimate and how much money they're likely to get from Social Security especially higher income Americans because there was a max that Social Security will provide the average check\nAs you know Lynn is about Thirteen hundred dollars a month for Social Security retirees\nAnd of course the Social Security system is under threat right now because the trust fund is being depleted and that's why the American benefits council has joined the funding or future coalition talk about what your us versions are and why you decided to have the American benefits council joined the coalition\nThe funding our future is in really incredibly important initiative across the country it's it's important for multiple reasons one\nIt raises the profile of the issue to to your listeners into the public so that the public is aware that they need to be thinking about these things\nWhile they're working not thinking about them at the end\nThough if you are close to retirement you should start thinking about them or even in retirement be you know think about them now\nSo part of it is that part of it is also to create a momentum\nSo that we as a country can engage on a ... in a discussion about\nA policy that uh you know a a country wide in a society wide policy of how we can help people in retirement and how we can address the gaps in retirement and work with policymakers to come up with\nVery pragmatic practical solutions that work\nUh for people and for the employers that are providing the plans\nSo I'm really glad you were able to spend the time with us on the program Lynn thank you so much for doing this I really appreciate it oh you're very welcome\nThat's windows ... the senior vice president of global retirement and compensation policy of the American benefits council and a

investments will you have enough income to enjoy yourself\nAnd will your income last for the rest of your life\nHi I'm Rick Edelman now you can find out if your savings and investments can generate the retirement income you need the income you expect for your entire retirement and you can find out for free without free retirement review\nThat gives us a very high degree of confidence of course I have to stress as you well know that past performance is no guarantee a future results in the assertion of the countries of federal sense right we know that but it's the only thing we have to go on so we can with a pretty high degree of confidence say that\nIf I've got a Fifteen or Eighteen or twenty four year time horizon putting a hundred percent of the money into stocks makes a great deal of sense and so that's what I Would recommend for the account for your daughter\nNow your daughter is not allowed to own an account she's a minor minors can't own assets you as the parent has to create a custodial account on behalf of your daughter it's called the UT em a uniform transfer to minors act\nAt UT amazing account that simply says you're going to set the money aside for your daughter\nAnd uh the problem with it\nIs number one you're going to pay taxes on that camera manual basis and number two when the child reaches the age of majority you have to turn the money over to the child and instead of using the money for college she might use the money to buy a Corvette\n[laughter] so ah for that reason especially since you're targeting this for college we button said recommend a five twenty nine college savings plans which are available and all states all around the country and\nIn this way you own the account not your daughter your daughters the beneficiary of the account\nBut you control it you determine how the money's invested you decide when the money is withdrawn for college and if you indeed use the money for college than the withdrawals are completely tax free no taxes at all it's fabulous and that's\nWhy the five twenty nine plan is the preferred way to save for college because you can use the money to any college in the country for any college expenses tuition room board books pretty much everything except travel\nOr if you don't use the money for college then withdraws will be subject to taxes and ten percent penalty but you could always transfer the money to another child if you've ever have another one or two cousins of your daughter you could even leave the money there for your daughter's children in another Thirty years so\nLots of fabulous flexibility associated with a five twenty and on planes so that's what we recommend it to five twenty nine plan targeted for your daughter but I Want to emphasize one other very important point that might have slipped\nPast us without focus\nRemember I said that in any Fifteen or twenty year time period stocks have never lost money on that basis you can go ahead and put a hundred percent of the money into stocks right now\nRight but\nYour daughter is twelve she's no longer going to have necessarily Fifteen Years before she uses the money\nWhich means as she ages we're going to want to ramp down the allocation of stocks because the closer she gets to college the less time the money will remain invested and the greater the risk of the stock market crash\nUndoing all of the good effort we've tried for all those years so a one hundred percent stock allocation makes sense now but it doesn't make sense when she's Fifteen\nOr Eighteen that makes sense yes so we want to create something called a glide path picture of the airplane you know with traveling at forty thousand feet but not when it gets near the airport\nAs it approaches the airport it alters that's glide path and as it gets closer it gets lower and lower so that by the time it reaches the airport it's really close to the ground same thing with your daughter as she gets closer to using the money\nWe have less and less of the money in stocks so that by the time she's sixteen if you're going to use the money at age Eighteen she'll have virtually none of the money in stocks because we're so close to using\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nThere are two ways to do it one is to choose your own asset allocation and you control how much of it as in stocks you put a hundred percent stocks today but as she ages you declined that hundred percent down that Ninety eighty Seventy sixty forty et cetera overtime as she approaches the use of the money for\nBecause that's a nuisance that's for sure that's difficult a lot of parents don't know how to do it\nMany five twenty nine plans offer what are called target date funds where they'll do it for you and the target date fund you choose a fund that is targeted for when you think your daughter will use the money so you would choose for example a twenty year target date fund\nBy choosing a target date fund they will create the glide path\nFor you they will alter the allocation as your daughter ages automatically without you having a fossil they\nUnderstood\nSo either do it yourself or let them do it for you would either way do excellent I appreciate it thank you it's my pleasure I'm Glad you called and I'm really excited that your daughter's getting off the such a great start in life and are you guys keep that up and a boy oh boy oh boy will she be able to
