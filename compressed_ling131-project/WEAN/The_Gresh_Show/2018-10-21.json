there and I took it all it man\nThat's probably a couple of years ago All right let's welcome and Greg with art Boston sports journalist not get too distracted [laughter] let's talk a little more football here on the ... stock market patriots both game show Greg how are you at what you make it this way by the patriots\nOh this was one of those were just get on the bus get on the plane go home move on and next week and certainly the against the bills on Monday Night\nDo you think that a Rob Gronkowski is availability being up in the air and late in the week may have impacted how the patriots approach this game op ed simply because\nI don't think they would've left him as a doubtful had they known it was definitely not going to play like they they thought there was a chance he might be in there\nUh I don't I mean that might be the case but I don't think it uh I don't think it affected anything I think you know you look at it you look at the way they came out on the first Dr\nOr they obviously had things dial up and scripted correctly because you couldn't do much better than you know the opening Seventy five played Dr where they just went down the field did anything they want it to 'em I mean you know suddenly shells running and he's not get in touch for Fifteen Years down the field I'm\nEdelman bowling in the end zone\nI mean that tells me\nThat the patriots had a bead on this bears team and then you know from Iran out I just think it was you know a lax the lack of execution and just you know some key mistakes\nGreg of Sony Michel is gone for the year he's down for any stretch of time watching the patriots do with that position in terms of adding that there are you know ... or so they just ride with James White Kenyan burning here\nYou know I mean they're going to have to ask somebody um and I don't think it's going to be I'm Ralph Web I mean I haven't looked at the emergency list a yet but I think you know my ... out there you know at least he knows the you\nKnow he knows this that the system I'm you know the patriots they will have by this point but every position they've gone through um what's available and they've created them and so whoever's at the top of their list they'll you know they'll bring them in I mean I think that\nYou know one of the things that's\nYou know sort of a trickle down effect is um you know how does the ... if they had an eye on may be improving someplace else\nI'm said before the deadline with some of the cap space that they freed up a with the Gilmore restructure um does this throw a monkey wrench into that or not but\nYou know I I I don't think it should I think you know the patriots pretty much um you know look at the running back position is sort of you know something that they can figure out make do with so I don't think they're going to panic too much over this\nGreg why do you think it was that Jason record he didn't play a lot in the first after this game and maybe beyond today\nBecause he was really bad last week um\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Marjorie him ... service\nCertainly make that case but there were also um there were at least two two of those plays the ah the cream\nThe cream hunt touchdown uh when they weren't covered too and I'm a court he didn't carry him down the field and got beat and then also that tire ... killed touchdown Seventy five yard or\nTo me and I don't know I'm just guessing but\nMe it looked like the patriots were uncovered three and which means that Jason record he has a responsibility for that deep third field and\nOn that play he was messing around with Travis Kelsey short um with two others offenders and you know so I think he had some issues ... last week and I think um you know the patriots wanting to take a look at some of their their options I mean I just think in general\nI think this is a game that shows you that they really don't know what they have in the secondary and what they're going to look like\nThe second half of the season I stay still think they're very much trying to figure out what their best combination is and I don't blame them for feeling that way because you know it has outside of Gilmore um and he's had his moments um it's it hasn't been good to this point in the season\nWell it felt like it so you mentioned Gilmore melt like he had a good game same for pat junk but that's just me watching any were there any defenses standouts were the patriots than you\nOr I didn't I didn't see many I mean this is\nYou know I I Know I heard you guys talking about the replays and things like that see see you guys have to get you guys aren't used to these um you know when you cover other teams like the dolphins and the Packers when you know when they haven't been very good um you know you get used to these\nNon national games where you don't get a lottery plays\nA there aren't very good camera angles um things like that so it was very hard to see him plus soldier field is one of the worst stadiums I'm first sight lines and things like that in the league since they they did the\nUm ... it's a terrible place in general and so it was really hard I tell you I mean the hardest hit general they are bad how hard is it rewind it just watch it again or\nYou know I mean you you have these other cruise the other producers who like have like fancy shots lined up and you know they they don't have their eye on the ball like these these number one cruise you know and producers which they're there for a reason on the best games because there there used to you know doing things a little bit more on the fly\nThat's bad that's sad but the NFL can't find enough cruised actually decent replay coverage\nWell I mean look you can blame replay all you want but I mean if ... check really wanted to challenge that plane could of and then he could have gotten all the all the replays reviews we want it to I mean you know sometimes you just got to take a leap of faith but you know I don't have a problem with him um that early in the game making that decision\nYeah I don't think it's important enough to throw the flag at that point without having seen it and if it was inconclusive and re watching it I still think you know flag in your pockets just not\nReally I mean as bill said I think we need to go out and you know have a a a yard sale or a bake sale for the NFL to get more cameras\nSad it's unnecessary like CBS now yeah I don't know if you've been watching Greg CBS know terrible for baseball mhm now Greg I'm On a quote\nYou on Twitter during this game watching previous years like watching early Ryan tannahill so odd needles and they were not impressed with the second year quarterback\nI was not impressed with Mitch Tammy hill at all he was a he was terrible I mean there were plays and even though it was texting me during the game he's like\nAnd it's the\nTalk of recovering\nIs on the ground is driving in the south of the gift [noise]\nOff for a turnover sort of

about one yard but I think for us to to get it went on\nFor somebody to talk about what we need to do and we play a little bit better than I think there's still a lot of things we do better than there's ever been teams so it was ... and\nI Would disagree with John Brady than it was a great team when it was a way yeah nothing about it I Would term great\nI I I I'm more aligned with what does that the the broadcast we we just go all would just be happy to get out of there but when\nWe get out of this place yucky six words that it's not a Gemini zero Ninety eight by mark ... that's what they'll pay to replace a box bro you're on the job market may treat most game show gyms and the guard Jim\nOkay yeah I I I think the story of the game really is just how God awful ... and it and it's awful in Seventy two point on I challenged underlined an old state\nWe gave up or hundred and fifty yards three hundred and twenty five passing to\nWhat you term an awful quarterback yeah sixty nine she'll be are we gave up three hundred and thirty how many are going to get a win getting all those kinds of numbers and you put an asterisk on this when I Do\nThe second time I've been at home and I know I I'm not putting an asterisk on this when when there's a wind in the NFL especially when you're on the road and considering how well the often played it wasn't that includes the there no the deepest was again you know there's a lot of issues there they didn't get you know\nThey got some pressure on your busy but the fact that the numbers I think what other he put up today were added and it was in ... you know it was in garbage time again both in the second in the late in the second half toward the end of the fourth quarter in the end of the second quarter\nYeah I'm not too concerned about the art itch how many real point did they give up is what I really really know how many\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve

talking like thirty eight Seventeen something like\nThat thirty eight fourteen yeah I don't know I'm thinking maybe yeah Seventy Seventy okay it's a lego Seventy real point no there's no asterisk almost went ugly when ...\nDefense doesn't have its fair share prompt or you [laughter] you know a drink label and spend a lot\nAnd I was so excited for him was built on campus the pre season games

hear what the narrative of running backs don't matter once\nWhy Michele went down I was like please please don't do a decent job\nAnd he did do a decent job and I'm Sorry Pfleger that running backs don't matter and one more thing before I hang up I Know you've got to laugh at me but um what do you think about you know\nWhy you looked pretty good pretty low on the side of the ... ... what do you think about maybe bring an end and take a look at maybe ... homes or ... or ...\n[laughter] I thought we were going to get a\nLot of times when I was waiting for some of them are going to get into\nRunning I'm like waiting waiting I knew it was a prank [laughter]\nBut he went with real names breeze homes and Anton Smith\nWas pretty good uh what's that you're about Fifteen Years too late

right uh arts in multiple art\nTai boys how're you doing tonight what's happened\nOver good guys you know up to lift things everybody a you know all the all the moaning and groaning after this gang calling at you guys I think you know I think the bottom line is very very simple or all of us who was used as so many years of watching a well oiled machine do their thing\nA week after week I'm not giving up big leaves not giving up huge pleasure and I try not to give them up\nTo watch this the first seven games it's been very very painful it's really the answer to this is what this team has been\nA for the most part over the last ... years very very on a ballot jak like\nUm and uh it's it's ... it's just difficult for everybody to sit back and watch compared to what we would have been used to I think that's kind of the bottom line yes they won the game but it sure was a pretty ugly out there as has been the case several times this year\nSo uh I think that's the bottom line you know we're used to such a a well run the situation you look at this it's it's it's hard to watch\nI guess I get your frustration in terms of slumping as bad turnovers uncharacteristic poor play like that I'm with you on defense though overall like look I I didn't expect it to be all that different because the personnel the change that much from last year I think it's highly of it last year the last couple of years really\nAnd it's just kind of have a leak is too and it's been a tough adjusted for a lot of people mask complains about it every single week now is this what the league is yeah that that that you have kind of bomb quarterbacks putting the quarterback ratings over a hundred week in week out you get shootouts thirty one thirty type games or you know this bad beer scene putting up the\nThirty one point they did today yeah that's kinda neat that's what the NFL as the defenses down overall not that I'm trying to excuse the patriots 'cause it's not great but this is just the league has become\nNo I look at it and it's the one thing that I think it's the saving grace of the situation how do you feel about your off and\nI feel there'll be just fine you want me to write and to me that makes you a real contender oh you've got Tom Brady is your quarterback\nOn your expect to have you know help you expect to have Rob Gronkowski out there where you make a return after missing this week you know you'll be fine yeah and all your defense thanks yeah well who really does have a good defense anymore you don't really know who's got a dominant defensively I think the closest thing to do it is maybe Jacksonville\nNot not Italian right that's had a very ... not a tally name but you got it down and then that's that's why yeah what do I don't have an air\nBlood like

today is a very exciting show for us because we're coming to you from Jamestown Rhode Island\nThis is the site of the latest project for the forty a season of this old house and today is the final day of production we're right here and actually in the garage it's a lot nicer than that sounds the surrounded by the cameras and the saw us to bring you the story of a very cool just completed\nBy the spectacular team at this old house now if you're not familiar with this area it's a very unique place with a lot of history Jamestown Rhode Island is a coastal town it's it's just across the Narragansett Bay\nFrom Newport which is home to many many famous mansions\nBut if you didn't happen to be named Vanderbilt door after Duke you may have decided to build a more modest cars right here in Jamestown and many of these houses do from the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds when summer visitors\nBuilt them to enjoy the ocean breeze isn't the Sandy beaches but today many of those dwellings remain on insulated\nAnd since they were originally built just for the summer season there was really no need for insulation back then and that's what brings us to this old house which was rebuilt to increase energy efficiency but keep the old charm\nNow to kick things off I'm joined by this old house we're told me any contractor Richard truth do we work and Richard thanks so much So Richard when we say that the goal was to make this home energy efficient we're talking like insanely energy efficient here because\nThe plan was to make this a net zero house so those are not familiar with ... year olds kind of explain that\nThere's a bunch of components to one is to make it insulated really well to make it incredibly tight and so we did that with our thirty walls in our forty feelings and [noise] and we made it\nTight tight and then on top of it we we did another thing called aero barrier to make sure that we we controlled infiltration unbelievably I'll get back to the minute right so you got to make a place where the ...\nThen you got to be able to make some electricity so\nLooking for a car credit not bright well isn't it taught you financed with lots of nice furniture Narragansett have the best financed right that they don't rises and cars with zero percent NPR for Seventy two months you can be driving on a fourth also models interest free log on to what I Do not have\nTelevision show this old house you can follow the progress on line at this old house dot com and catch the latest episodes on your local PBS station and if all this talk of home remodeling has you thinking about your next project\nYou can call in your home improvement question now to one eighty they money pit presented by home advisor dot com\nWell this project involve both remodeling of a one hundred year old building in the building a brand new addition bringing those two together it was the job of our next guests Jeff swinger welcome just thank you now you do a lot of building the Narragansett area and then we have a lot of summer\nHouses year that we're probably never intended to be year round residents isn't here we are putting heating systems in them and air conditioning and insulation and trying to make it all work in this case you had even a tougher job because you had to make this net zero so that it basically\nEssentially made all the energy that it needed now to do that you need to rely on a lot of systems or one of which was the installation still talk to me about the installation that made it possible here\nYou know as you said this was a summer cottage are designed a you know in the Nineteen twenties or so where you had some structural framing members that were only geared to support\nYou know the roof load itself right a now today's standards with the insulation in the energy codes we've got to make room for insulation or\nAnything like that does not even a\nSo we had to do a combination of insulated from the inside with super high a fish and stuff like\nQuote sell a spray foam right then we also had to insulate on the exterior of the building so we added to the outside just as much as we added to the inside because we didn't have all room on the inside right they are they advantage to the adding to the outside is that you create that thermal barrier\nAround the the framing members which are much more productive and transfer heat last so\nSo that was a critical part of this project now to the inside the finish I'd had a chance to walk through the house earlier just amazing carpentry in this job you guys that are really terrific uh works here with all of the detail and the trends in ceilings and stuff to talk about not\nWell uh I give credit to the architect on powers who are really just thought about every space in the house and took advantage of\nHis expertise and the design world and and really created a masterful\nA depiction of of water cottage built in you know cozy atmosphere would be in a you know all we did was follow his lead and not and execute um but I I give credit to him he he took advantage of every single corner and the house\nAll the sounds are those are good partnership and unusual for you to have the architect is the home or you're killing his wife has the designer\nYeah well it was it was really a little bit intimidating to start with that because um I you know held to a little bit of a higher standard has left us through it it really turned out to be a really mutual relationship you know we collaborated on a lot of things Don wasn't a\nSo you know a male to thaw already you know right we were able to exchange ideas and um\nThey were right down the road so it eliminated a third party in the middle so it really really did work out well\nAnd but as you say communication really is key now the exterior of this home and a lot of work done landscape you hit a landscape architect helping with that but ah you had to organize a part of the construction as well what was the challenge\nWhile the challenge was a it was a short period of time where we had to make a lot of things happen and we had three different porches which uh\nYou know cascaded down into the hard state\nAnd then we had a really extensive landscape plan you know it caught me by a little bit by surprise but when they started bringing the trees and the plants and I was amazed at how many plant things we ended up having\nAnd then they the landscape architect Tom Ryan did just a wonderful job that segment in different areas around the yard which are all\nMeaningful and well planned in a you know it it it came together\nWe can't wait to see it rollout chefs winter and the builder on this project thanks so much for stopping by the money that\nIt was my pleasure you can follow along with all the progress here in Jamestown on line at this old house dot com or on Twitter and Facebook has tacked tier wage Jamestown welder team it this old house didn't get all the work done here

guys had to offer you a there were probably hundreds of least of those tapes that came in what was it like to get the call or email it was that moment like for you guys once you start counting\nTook a minute for it to sink in that I uh I actually thought that I didn't get it because the the uh contact us about a week after when they told us that we're going to do a little bit of education right\nAnd then a center called me and told me that we got it and those kind of a kind of taken back by well yeah it was a good a good experience and a road that hired for a couple of ... and and married thirty seconds or what was it like for you\nAnd and I kind of little [laughter]\n... yeah never imagined it right out all the while you're representing a lot of young people that are

season of America's most popular home improvement show this old house and one of the guys\nWho's been part of the fabric of this old house for over twenty five years is general contractor Tommy soul to be just keep getting younger don't\nYou tell yeah [laughter] well almost thirty five years there while five thirty six years to make yeah man it's amazing I hear and I'm Down in the first few years [laughter]\nWay played hard to get I ... well maybe that's it that way and turn it down because I work for my dad we would just do my dad would he didn't want any part of the details anyway but now we're too busy\nTo act on TV and stuff so I Want to talk with you I'm first about the fact that a lot of the construction here was pre fabricated and I think when people think prefabs factory built into well maybe it's not as good as what you could do my hand but that's not really the case here and ... you weren't your circle you had two things that you did hear that were this fascinating to me\nThe foundation first she said oh you can make everything in the house but you can't make the foundation\nNow you know you guys actually got a foundation three hundred miles away and brought her here they bring\nIn ... well pre cast foundations insulated it and it has a concrete reinforced steel reinforced studying it\nThey're insulated so there's no thermal breaking that in that position and the studs a pre drilled for the electrician to run his wires through and it's a fast efficient way to put a foundation and that's basically waterproof at same time\nWhile in the building that we're in right now this is actually the garage ... probably the nicest girl jak you've ever seen right but this was factory billed as well as soon as\nThis free cut building well you put it together everything caught on a on a CNC so yeah so you know what's going to fit exactly right you know put the puzzle together and you've got a beautiful barn that looks like it was built onsite\nNow the challenge on this property was building into net zero which means that basically has to be so tight so well insulated and uh so perfectly heated ... essentially makes all the energy needs to operate that involved a lot of different types of insulation or want to ask you about that because I I think it's unusual to see spray foam used to different types of Spring Hill open\nAnd close close though and then you had sold ... million which are actually I Love that isolation I mean I think of it is it's basically rock right into a fight and molten rock radio and and\nAnd you it's a great installation but sounded need for insulation and its water resistant well you know if it gets wet it's going to dry out\nNow you guys use a technique called warmer blanket on the exterior walls what does that mean well\nThat's where you take the insulation\nThe disown will actually right now are you can also use rigid film and you apply it to the exterior surface of the building so you framed the building in this case we had the old building we had to deal with the conventional walls right those will spray foam on the outside of the sheeting you have to put a thermal barrier\nBecause you have to worry about the thermal bridging of the structure when it when it meets that different installations so in other words it could be some transfer of different temperature\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Marjorie impeccable surface\nIs that makes sense though it does enter the sandwich right so in other words you're putting something like a um it's it's called like a house wrap that you put on before you put your installation on is like a range screens you know of any any condensation should occur in between that installation it will run down and not damaged she\nBut it certainly has to be completely storm only separated get more than I ever yeah it's almost like when you're building ...\nBuildings you put separate walls and never touch the same idea here right what's your thoroughly separating everything she had good shape and insulation exactly right yeah that's the trick now you also had to install the solar right which is on this building and you also the beautiful wouldn't shingle roof here now which single roof ... is there not done right and I've seen an awful lot of them I Know you have to rewrite like\nCrazy say rye fast if they're not you you have to ... you have to think of that ... uh which singles today is not like ... it was say fifty two hundred years ago right the wood that you get from lumber is really farmed trees younger trees because all the
