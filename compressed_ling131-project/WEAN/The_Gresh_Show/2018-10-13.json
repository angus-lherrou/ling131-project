Ali\nThere as well and it used to this guy to add a couple of facts against the patriots back in twenty four scene at a sack get patriots last year or the ... the guy who really did a great job of frustrating ... last season and we won defensively Everett Barry tours\nLeft Achilles in that game and he's been bothered by white heel injury that's kept him out of line up ball all season long to date\nNow that from the defensive side authentic this cat that each team\nIs better because of my home and the people ability consistently Alex with last year through the long fall far better than at any point in his career\nBut I think with ... there's a different dimension they'll certainly you look at Albert Wilson versus savvy Watkins the way that she had used Watkins that's far this season at least with one really a breakout game\nYou know there is maybe an upgrade their it's an extra year experience for a guy like Kareem Hunt Cal she's also a terrific START I think it's a comparable team all fence to flee\nAt every position and better at quarterback and what the patriots face last year\nBob so the the voice of the patriots with me here each and every week on the ground show on WNPR oh previewing the Sunday night battle with the Kansas City chiefs again you can hear with an aide twenty kick with Bob and so so uh Bob I I don't know if you were around for you know there's been these narratives with the patriots you almost a year to year\nWhy all the when the coin toss then they're going to different or because they want to double up the score and I know there was a year or two where it was got us for first got to put the first points on the board and\nI'm starting to wonder if this is one of those years for the patriots Bob too where that's going to become the mantra once again get the lead gives events a little cushion maybe you get a stop in the offing puts another one on the board and then maybe you're often running\nHow important is scaring first for this year's New England patriots\nScoring first is huge in this game in particular because Kansas City is candidates dominated the opening quarter at it and you know when you talk about a young quarterback especially along the home's really his\nInexperience and his age\nOr in a lot of different ways me watching the choice that he showed late in the Denver again even improvising a ... and doing all in a substantive way it was a flashy hotdog out there to all of this left at a noodles doing it it's something you've done in college I yeah I think the Kansas City as soon as you definitely don't want to try to\nPlay catch up against authentic is that they're just so tough to to stop there are similar to what the basis for so long in that sense you know we sort of Jacksonville game take the ball sorts or we have seen that periodically where they have one of the coin toss and put the all sets out there\nInitially whether it was because of wind conditions or it was because they wanted a fast start off as I'm not too late or from the ... in this game I I tend to think that you're feeling is that you're you're better off and I think it's consistent now across the board and football it seems like more and more people\nAre doing this for the different and take the kick in the second half you're better off having the opportunity I think\nTo prevent the Brits scores and to have that that chance herself to do to put together the scores going into half come without a half and half adjustments between offensive series and you take the ball first\nThen you don't control the possession that first possession of the third quarter\nBombs so see with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh Bob Josh Jordan's been now into this off in two weeks and there was a little mini by here where everybody got some rest\nDo you feel as to how Josh warden will ultimately fit in like we know he has the potential Bob we just haven't seen it yet but I'm starting to wonder why ... we know they want to run it elements\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition I wasn't born in east religion or against the wind over two hundred three on cars all makes all models had incredible prices are going to flood Otto John gum now\nAnd and make some place after the catch and I think back to back components of the patriots in particular the twenty four teams using what Brad all the fellas gave them I think and Gordon's case he can give them that\nAnd the guy who can burn you deep so you know ... similar to Kansas City does a with a guy like ... kill in ... in a different way because Gordon is a much bigger player by far\nA ... you get the ball on space with a guy like that or over the middle he breaks a couple of tackled and he's gone we saw that against to keep the leap back in twenty Thirteen when he was playing for Cleveland so I think he is more than just the guys are lung deep routes and has proven that and and try either to beat the defense deep\nOr to draw the defense away from the underneath stuff\nHe's been on the field for Eighteen snaps in each of his first two games he more than acquitted himself as a blocker and that's gonna earning more reps in this all fence or in the first game against ah the Miami Dolphins in fact I think there were more running plays record them and then the second game\nAnd now I think we're going to see his lap count continually increase and I think they're going to ask more of him an a week in week out basis\nHow big is running the ball this week for me Bob it's one of my he's not only Kansas City is very good at stopping to run\nAnd I think we I'm hoping anyway what's the drafting of Sony Michel ... at least if not the you know the coaches and some of the fans will get over the whole well Tom Brady has gotten a fruit fifty times to win this to me kind of sets up from one of those games were balance might be the key\nI think for sure and he and I think you know can city has been vulnerable uh against the run one of the things that really her Jacksonville last week was the absence of for that and then grab got hurt\nReally in that game and they became and they fell behind to they had to chase and they became very one dimensional and really you know I had a lot of self inflicted wounds whether there were turnovers or just bad passes by like ... and if they still had over four hundred yards of often but I think you have to be able to run the ball\nA and I and I still believe that that is a tenet of any team at any level or in in in the NFL especially\nA it's not to say that they're gonna dominant the turn into a you know the old three yards and a cloud of dust approach\nBut I Do think it's imperative for them to have that balance and be able to run the ball and and pick up some tough yards they didn't do last year and I go back to that first game between the patriots and the chiefs in two thousand and Seventeen in this valley as it got away from the past and the fourth quarter of\nA lot of respect that game was settled early because the patriots had a Seventeen Seventy and\nThey had a couple of short guarded runs to prolong drives early in that game and they got stopped\nAnd they've got to be able to convert those particular place in this game and it's not just to keep ... homes in this and the cheats off that's off the field but I think it's as well to it at a certain dominance will be lost the line of scrimmage and control uh in in that sense and and I think that's very important thing moving forward\nBond with me here for a few more minutes on the ground showing WPRI oh what is your theory Bob as to why build ballot check ins had such success over a long period of time against in the ...\nWell it has but any rate is really out of a lot of success against bill on little ... when I think back to twenty four to route in Kansas City\nUh that was the the first encounter over read coach team with Bill and that was the Monday Night debacle when everybody out the window at not only closed on the bats would it shattered\nAnd then there was the game of course in the playoffs in in a thousand fifth the patriots had a comfortable lead in Kansas City\nViolently tried to come back and they pick up my ... minutes the score a touchdown older within one score and the fourth quarter of that gay but that was pretty competitive game overall on it if not for a yellow stretch deflection off alcohol leads Julian Edelman the shield at ... ... ... what a bit of difference or two\nAnd then of course last year we saw Kansas City run away from the patriots or the fourth quarter\nOf the season opener so\nI I look at it you know ... separating but and he reads teams in Philadelphia did against the Baltics because really the only difference is different eras in a different ah generations of those teams the patriots against for example the eagles Super Bowl thirty nine\nYou know a much different kind of team then today in in

the Carolinas again on Carolina's boy they just can't catch a break lately right or with hurricane\nMichael we'll talk a little bit about that on the program and also boy when it rains it pours because we saw what happened in the stock market's starting on Wednesday right the stock market the Dow Jones industrial average fell\nEight hundred thirty two points on Wednesday alone on oh my goodness gracious ah a lot of folks wondering what does this mean what do I do should I get out of the market than ...\nAll right let me tell you what's going on here the Dow Jones industrial average dropped eight hundred thirty one points on Wednesday and five hundred and forty six on Thursday is across the media as you'd expect\nWednesday was the third largest point drop ever and Thursday with the seven genes worst point drop ever\nIn stock market history now I Want to emphasize that for you by\nBut on a percentage basis neither day\nNeither neither which would have been neither will go with not\nNot in their day was in the top twenty worst days of all time neither one was in the top twenty on a percentage basis in other words Wednesday and Thursday were largely irrelevant and this was kind of proved by friday when the Dow closed up nearly three hundred points\nBut still this saw me there are a lotta people queasy I mean over the last three days the decline now was about a thousand points still is not a big deal\nWhy not well why does it feel so bad\nDo the garner such media attention well you know a thousand point drop on the market eight hundred alone on Wednesday it's real simple the bigger you get the bigger you fall in other words the Dow Jones industrial average closed on friday at twenty five\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you

lose IQ he's on meds to read [noise]\n\nGoing back to the program Rick Edelman here for hanging around with us on the show today I told you that you really shouldn't be making any changes in your investment strategy as a result of what's been going on in the stock market this past week\nBut there is something that I think you do want to do and I'm Talking to you gentleman who are listening to the program right now\nYou know it it's really fascinating people are fixated on what's happening in the stock market this past week due to the volatility of the markets what you really need to be paying attention to is what's going on in the bond market according to the Bloomberg Barclays multi verse index this is an index of all bombs all around the world\nThey fell in value by about a trillion dollars this past week [noise]\nA trillion dollars why because the fed is raising interest rates as interest rates go\nUp the value of bonds goes down so here's what I find rather ironic and almost comical people who are upset about the stock market saying oh my goodness I'm fearful of losing money in stocks I think I'll run the bonds for safety only to have their money go down in the bond market because rising rates are causing bond values to fall\nSo here's what you need to do beyond all else gentleman\nAs you're thinking of how you ought to make changes in your investment portfolio you're ready for this here it is I Want you\nTo talk to your wives and girlfriends\nAnd do what ever they tell you to do why because according to research firm fidelity women consistently earn higher returns than men in their investment portfolios an average of almost half a point per year why\nBecause women trade less often women are more deliberative the more methodical they are more\nConsiderate they evaluate more carefully they aren't quick to make a snap decision and that translates into not jumping out of the market merely because the market went down one day\nSo men before you do something dumb [noise]\nAnd before you have to pay for it when you explain to your spouse or a partner while you do what you did have that conversation hey honey I'm scared I'm thinking of getting out of the market what do you think\nAnd she'll tell you to go do something else for the afternoon okay it's really that simple but uh\nIf you really do want to know what you should be doing or want to be doing well here's just you know you're always looking for that latest and greatest investment opportunity while here it is I think I'm going to say this was targeted at women that is probably ridiculous as sexist thing I'll I'll narrowed down this was targeted to my wife I'll leave it at that okay\nOn friday a first of its kind ATF\nHas been launched\nNo HGF has ever been

looking for like ...\nWe we got them that we [laughter] seriously you're investing for your life savings to provide your own retirement security is really serious thing and it isn't for you know [noise] I really don't think they're gonna be finding very many financial advisors recommending the Wii U T F\nHere's what I Do want to talk about though mentioning financial advisors do you have one\nI think that maybe perhaps you do and I want to ask you the question\nHow old\nIs your advice or what is your advisors age and is your advisor\nWorking in a solo practice or a very small shop in other words does your advisor work pretty much by himself or herself or part of the larger team\n'cause even at the big box brokerage firms like Marilyn and whoever else uh you'd be asked them and wells and so on even though they might have tens of thousands of advisors in the from each\nOne of them is often working independently alone they got a cubicle and they're doing their thing and they're Cuban they're paying no regard having little contact with the folks in the cubes surrounding up\n... nobody but that advisor you're dealing with knows anything about you or anything about your investment strategy or anything about the investments that you have in your portfolio only your advisor knows what you're doing and why you were doing it there's no continuity between your advisor and other advisors\nIs that the case with the visor you work with and that's bad enough if you're working with an advisor who is all by himself or herself\nWith no network no connection no colleague with whom\nThey share effort that's that's bad enough but it gets even worse if your advisor is say sixty years of age and what do I say that age because that's the average age of financial advisors in this country\nAccording to a new industry survey from practical perspectives more than half of the nation's advisors will be gone within ten years according to all the latest industry research the average advisors in their late fifties early sixties in fact there are more financial advisors in this country who are eighty then who are thirty\nThis is an aging industry\nA lot of young folks don't want to get into the investment management business because of its negative reputation and concerns over not being able to make a whole lot of money at it they're going into other businesses like investment banking or law or accounting where they think there's better career opportunities for them there aren't a lot of young folks in this business so the average advisor in this industry is older\nSo I Want to ask you a question as you're focusing on your retirement have you given any thought your your advisers retirement because according to some industry statistics half of all advisors in this nation will be gone within ten years they will have quit or retired\nIs that possibly your advisor and if so what happens to you and your account\nIs even if you retire you need to continue having your money managed right well not just a retirement but through your entire life\nIf your advisors not going to be around who do you turn to you want to make sure your advisor as part of a team part of an organization that has the ability but it's going to be here long term to provide the continuity and consistency of the advice of services you've grown to expect\nFrom your advisor so one of the things we love best about are from here elements in April we've got a hundred and sixty advisors in forty three officers nationwide we work collectively as a team so no one client is dependent on any one individual for the advice and services and quality that they're receiving\nAnd that's what we would recommend for you as well have a conversation with your advisor about their career expectations and plans and make sure their plan is in your best interest I'm Rick Adelman you're listening to the truth\nAbout money triple a plane wreck online at ... dot com click that red button schedule a call so you can tell us the day in time you want us to call you know voice mail no phone tag will make it simple and easy for you to get the answers information you need for your personal

Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free on tradition at what board and he's religion or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all make all models at incredible prices are going to flood auto job now\nYou do need it and you go from there so in order to find out the answer for sure we need to do that math we need to do those calculations to evaluate how much money is your employer offering you and can you reasonably expect to generate a similar amount of income\nFrom an investment strategy crate on your own\nAs I said usually the answer is yes we can do that but not always\nAnd that's why we need to go through the exercise we actually have an office in Troy on in your neck of the woods and so happy to sit down with you and go through this one detail looking at the amount of pension benefit your being offered and contrast that with a lump sum they're willing to give you as an alternative to see which strategy is best in your situation\nThat sounds good\nSo yeah but then there's there's like I said it's largely straight math that doesn't require a too much judgment will show you the spreadsheet analysis and say here's what you have this way and here's what you got that way which number looks better to you and it'll be pretty self evident\nYeah if you sit out the the growth uh especially be taking it ten years before I ... for the fall out so there's\nA lot of room for growth that money\nYeah those ten years yes and so you have to calculate what you would expect as a reasonable rate of return over the next ten years and what kind of investment strategy is ideal in order to achieve that goal or as opposed to the promised pension that the employer is providing so the good news is that fact that the employers promise\nIs a guarantee the employer is saying we will give you this money every month\nFor as long as you live no matter what happens in the market\nBut on the other hand many employers many are both the state as well as private employers are struggling to honor those promises there's a huge pension shortfall in this country as many employer\nPension plans are underfunded and if the employer proves unable to honor its promises\nThen you could be discovering that eerie they're not getting a monthly check or you're getting a lower check than they had originally promised millions of Americans are finding themselves in that situation so you've got to counterbalance the so called safety and guarantee of their check\nVersus their genuine ability to pay that check his promise for the rest of your life\nFor all these reasons Paul I'd recommend that we sit down and go through this over a couple of hours what I'll do is put you on hold now get your phone number and I connected with my colleagues in our Troy office and a sit down and go through the numbers with you and go from there are right I really appreciate you giving us a call here on the show today thank\nYou wreck that's Paul from Troy if you're facing the pension question you don't have to go it alone do appalled did call the professional financial advisor not your neighbor not your friend that the guy in the cubicle next to you as a school is as you you've never done it before but we've done it thousands of times and we can put our benefit of our experience and expertise to your advantage\nJust do it Paul did call us a triple eight plan wreck that's triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty two\nYou know I find Paul's um question really fascinating and really timely because limb road just came out with a study showing that fifty two percent of workers you know so we're talking half of all Americans say they don't know\nHow to translate their retirement savings into monthly income it's a very question Paul was asking about his case whether to take a monthly pension or take the money out and turn it into monthly income on his own half of American workers say they don't know how to do that\nWell I'm not at all surprised that you don't know how to do that because you've never tried to do it before none of us are any good at doing things we've never done before so have you given that any thought at all\nI Know you have given thought to you've given a lot of thought to putting money into your accounts contributing to your retirement plan at work adding to your savings you've been doing that for forty years and you've gotten pretty good at it and that's why you've got as much money as you've got\nBut very seldom do people turn that upside down or inside out where they say okay I've got this bucket of money I've got these accumulated savings\nHow do I turn that into income\nAnd that's an entirely different question because we have to make sure that we're minimizing our taxes as we do is\nWe need to make sure we're generating enough money to meet our ability to maintain our lifestyle we have to keep pace with the cost of living because inflation makes everything more expensive over time and we want to make sure we\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard I get an again fought board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's

five year period and they discovered that nice people\nOr a greater risk of bankruptcy than people who aren't nice\nGo figure and the reason\nIsn't necessarily because people are nice it's because nice people according to study don't value money as much as people who are mean\nAgreeable illness was associated with financial hardship lower savings higher debt and higher default rates on loans\nSo being a nice guy means you're probably in an effort to be nice or just because you're nice you tend not to\nCare as much about money and therefore you are at higher risk of money mismanagement according to the study their data included following individuals over twenty five years and they discovered that when they measured agreeable mess in childhood\nIt predicted greater financial hardship later in life\nSo mom and dad look at your five year olds are they nice or are they not nice because if they're nice [noise]\n...\nI I don't I don't even know what the advice as I Would give them so we were supposed to teach our children not to be nice\nI just I don't think so but maybe maybe maybe what we should be simply doing and saying look we know you're a nice person that's fabulous that's wonderful\nBut recognize that that could cause you buy your nature to make decisions that aren't helpful to you when it comes to your money management you might be willing to loan money to a friend\nAnd not care if they pay you back because you're nice don't do that you might\nBe willing to buy a bigger house than you can afford because it's the\nIt's nice it's a fun thing to do and later you will discover that you struggled to repay that loan and your default rates will rise so don't do that maybe you'll spend money that you shouldn't be spending on credit cards what

just I I Love the house almost as much as I Love working longer\nUm you're right for many people their houses their largest asset outside of the wealth that they have them in their Social Security benefits and a tapping home equity I think is actually going to be\nPart of the answer going forward or the difficulty here is the mechanisms they're they're basically three ways to do it one you can
