the end of the day and they choose to go forward and they choose to do whatever you got to make them\nStop here you go the leaves ... exactly yeah you know if you can't stop 'em then that's really all on you but here's the thing rushed the unwritten rules of every sport\nShould be written and should only be applied when being not when we're talking about little league players and stuff like that they should be written down and instituted at the little league level it in some places they are I'm not saying they aren't but these unwritten rules at the professional level these people are all

other umpires didn't meet certain standards in terms of tenure or number of games work or whatever the are doing very directly the idiotic red tape or loophole that they found in order to get this guy in there but yeah not not a good look for major league baseball and again like again sort of set of jokingly but\nYou get enough performances in prime time from guys like angel Hernandez and you'll

and it's like me just they give them a little jolt Megyn loop Penelope interacting with that [laughter]\n[noise] kicking dirt on me does nothing [laughter] I mean are they probably\n[laughter] ah [noise] ah so\nI heard a quote today from Brad Stevens and it makes me think he doesn't like his team right now now let's just rewind a little bit [noise] I Know the Celtics play they preseason game over the weekend their final preseason game in which chair Smith and a market smart ended up at all stuffed up and\nThe pre season's over and Brad Stevens put the team on blast last week saying that it was an aunt in what he is seen so far in the pre season has been on impressive to say the least he basically called them out\nA little bit better performance against Cleveland however the Celtics are now where Brad Stevens wants them to be and today he spoke about his group and it's more of the same of what he rolled out last week\nLast year or\nEvery cell\nPhone and that's the last year why are they really are like really really uh [noise] you know he wants to go back to Washington playoff there were some [noise]\nSome of the long haul that well\nGrid I Want to\nBe a social jet I think we should start a new season [noise]\nFor miners are harder to health care who you are\nReady to go on the high level\nI mean what what did he leave us and talking about last year's team how hard they worked and how they competed and mobile as Brad Stevens issue with his team last week he did not feel like they were putting an effort and they were not competing\nHe is clearly sending a message to this group he is clearly caught the vibe that veterans must be on a cruise control right now I'm sure those guys know their bodies and they know how to take care of themselves I Would never deny that however\nFor Brad Stevens to be this vocal about it early on he must be seen some things that you don't add up or some stuff that he really doesn't white\nNow I Know I tease it as Brad seeming hates his team right now I think that's all relative because every ... look every coach that I've ever played for there have been times where they painted the team\nYou get down on them or the kids aren't working hard or something like that well these are pro different now and I think for the first time\nThis payroll is to a point to where a lot of these guys don't have to be hungry for money anymore\nAnd a lot of NBA coaches have dealt with this guy's making fat contracts who they know they could turn it on at some point and do what they want the coach wants them to do which seems clearly doesn't operate I think it's very easy to see\nAnd I just think the he's got to be seeing something that just isn't right for him to be saying stuff like this and she sees the ... just let off the third inning by hitting Andrew been intending in one of ...\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nCrash is it doesn't jibe with\nPretty much every other piece of sound we've heard this far out of Celtics camp in terms of\nThe mindset of the team and the players I mean we lauded cheeseburger Morris last week because it sounded like very fair he knew his role on the team\nHe's like hey I'm I Know I'm the six or seven guy but that doesn't mean I'm not going to bust my ass out here and work as hard as I can\nTo to fill the role that I Know the team wants me and\nThen you have on cultural Kyrie Irving or all we've been hearing all season about is how hard he's been working to get back on the court same for Gordon from Utah where all you hear is about how hard has been working in how he's ahead of schedule you can jump off both feet and also makes Julian fries I mean you can do pretty much whatever they want 'em right there\nSo it's a little odd the only negative thing we've really heard from some or lead to the started camp has been that Robert Williams might be dumber than a ton of bricks that is true like outside of that everything we've heard has been positive and and more to the point positive towards the work ethic end of it which is why it's sort of surprising\nThat Brad seem so down on his team's effort now maybe that's just lip service in cheeseburger and friends of cheeseburger were just telling us exactly what we wanted to hear but it\nSeems that it might be a little bit more than effort it might be a little bit that he feels an idle mentor maybe a little bit of that but it and again we didn't get that do from listening to these guys before I mean the reason titled he thought the earth was flat until about two weeks all yep yep yep yep so I mean you know they are who they are but yeah it doesn't it doesn't exactly jibe with what we've\nBeen hearing so I'll be interested to see if it's a lack of buy in which would be bizarre or lack of effort which I think would also be odd but yeah you're right Brad Stevens something is not passing the smell test right now for Brad Stevens that uh Celtics camp and ah I'm sure he wants to get it right or sooner rather than later before these problems rear their head during the regular season\nYeah and if you have some veterans who and look we've talked about how veterans will take a night off every once in awhile\nTo look in jail and brown and Jason Tatum might be to be more veteran eyes young players that we've seen so who who's the troublemaker here who's not buying it who's not working hard I mean I think it's\nOne of these deals routes where I think the team takes their cue from Kyrie and if Qadri happens to come into a game like the proverbial or ... you know Sunday\nThird weekend of December in Detroit with the clock started when you want to be watching the NFL I mean crates even your friend the one doctor rivers was trying to get thrown out of games to go watch the world's top or whatever the hell was\nDanny Ainge so we know that the ... I mean if I head coach was doing that would have some of the players thinking but that's not the world the Brad Stevens operates and he's not tapping out to go watch you know but we're in the NC double a tournament on an idle Thursday night in Oklahoma City you know what I mean\nSo you're right there's this is worth watching because if there's one thing but you derailed the Celtics it's themselves I mean I just sat in a meeting earlier today telling a you know our our tells people people here with the Celtics are going to be like a sixty five when team\nI Know people don't like the only I think the over under for them right now is still in the fifty six range fifty seven maybe not maybe it's gone up since but I thought the over under last time I checked I Want to say it was around fifty seven I'd be pounding that over\nI don't know how they do it at at worst\nThey shouldn't be sixty two and twenty out worse unless there's major injuries and then that's a whole different discussion altogether but if this team remains pretty up right they should crush it in the east this year\nWell that sort of what I was just going to say is well sort of pick it back to what you were just talking about\nThat might be the mindset of Brad Stevens right now where the team might be fine the market smart Terry rosier Kyrie Irving all those guys could be fined that could be showing up to work punching their punch cards giving max effort but\nBrad knows that they're still half a step away from that killer instinct and maybe that's why he's doing is maybe they were surprised maybe there was a surprise as I Am ads cheeseburger sitting at home right now I'm thinking of himself well you know and it doesn't appreciate what I'm doing I'm going in and out right now [laughter]\nOff my place with a bunch of bacon\nAnd a bunch of delicious eats but yeah maybe that's maybe this is all just a motivational tactic and Stevens isn't really disappointed with the team he just knows\nThey need a kick in the back side if they're going to get where he wants them to go\nYeah and that's his job as coach that's what he is supposed to do he's supposed to try to move these guys in\nA way where\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what for Denise religion they're against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto John job now\nWeakest broad you've I wrote down the credit union more than just banking already here from dance tavern on the green will be hanging around for another hour or so with the listeners and just a shooting the breeze going by going into the when the sixty five inch L G smart for K.

town the game you will hear on Sunday night at five thirty for the pre game and eight twenty four the kickoff\nRight here on WNPR oh I'm a little break down and Casey for me quickly there was a couple of things that is true that are or concerning number one\nThey\nUse a lot of eye candy and it's funny because in one of my coaching calls getting ready for one of my college games a couple of weeks ago\nI\nHeard a coach said that and he was like you know we can't get do tend to all of the eye candy that they do there's a lot of quick promotion jets sweep motions you you you can't let your eyes wonder you've got to stay disciplined that's one thing for the patriots\nDefense here's the other thing too is\nIt it's been put out there on Twitter that the scout team\nAre lining up three yards past the line of scrimmage against the defense suppliers\nSo that these are offensive guy or the defense of guys who are dealing with the speed and the Kansas City all fence\nVisit the patriots are dealing with the sudden this of them\nBy starting them three yards down field whenever they're taking their reps in practice which I find interesting teddy Bruce ski upon that information getting out there taking to eat it out but that's what they did when they played the rams the greatest show on turf\nThey wind up those guys three yards down the field so that it forced the patriots defenders to have to think that much more quickly\nAnd I am really hoping and wishing folks um I'm praying to the football God's\n... the patriots don't try to over complicate this offensively I Know they have all their weapons I Know they want to spread 'em out and throw the ball and well dressed something the Tom Brady said about that coming up here on the graph showing WPRI oh\nBut this team can run on them I ripped through that Jacksonville Kansas City game today\nAnd I'm telling you there's I'm going to highlight this New England nation we've talked about how the draw game has come back for the patriots and you get the full back in there and you show those numbers then bam you handed Sony ma shown right up on the need to tackle\n... group wants your car any make any model what pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nGuard of the Jacksonville Jaguars wide thing is that Andrew nor well isn't\nThe first Jones the one who punch someone in the bum a I Do believe so yes that is correct is probably something you could work there on the film as well I Would say no I mean all over that he didn't get a little ... probably earning special assignment this week to see how the patriots could take advantage of the random bum punching that may occur\nWho's got the bomb that could take the hardest hit made sure we do lose a guy who was thought about this for\nThose who don't know we're referring to Ernie Adams bill Bela ... dollar\nA minute idea they've ended up bump ... if you're a patriots fan and you haven't learnt Ernie Adams yet when we need to get you up with the time I'm just like a child is curious about finding ways to beat NFL team absolutely and I'm sure he was in the lab\nTrying to figure out how to slow down this Kansas City attack I guess I'll just ... yeah well\nI mean all coaches are even though he isn't a code she still plays the role of a coach behind the scenes one eight hundred three to one to be P R O four three nine seven seven six and the interesting part of taking a Kansas City\nIs that Tom Brady made some comments this week as to how the NFL is sort of morphing into the way they played college football where it's all about spacing it's all about the personnel grouping\nAnd if you go back and watch Travis Kelsey his biggest reception against Jacksonville was nothing more than really kind of a five yards shopper out and then he jabs steps and goes the other direction and that's one thing that the Patriot you're gonna have to be aware of\nThese Kansas City receivers even Kelsey the tight end they're good at catching up putting the foot in the ground and then re directing from the direction your coming from so it's one of those old Lacey later you run right by the guy and then there's no one there to help and contain we'll\nGet to the comments from Stefan Gilmore coming up but Rafi in Vermont ones in on the Yankees Rob me there

Joe ... Cincinnati how did you handle what happened with the governors company stadium on Saturday\nProbably a little bit of a you know we really need to\nLook at that moment trying to figure out why we had made some\nVery good and broken from game one to three and it seemed to go right out the door and gave Oregon's Rhode Island no I think one of the things you have to do is you gotta get run out a lot of credit they're really good football team at speed die right ability\nUm and they took it to us I guess you know I said at the press conference\nThat you can take these games it doesn't matter about the record of either gene\nIt's expect the unexpected while the unexpected happened a week didn't you very well uh I think we're better than a forty eight to nothing beating but uh we didn't deserve\nA just showing up and deserve to have a chance to win so we needed to break that down and kind of said this is why these things happen learn from them and then move on\nHow did the kids respond on Monday and Tuesday did you get the response you were looking for\nA absolutely I you know Andy we're\nWe're a young team we had a lot of guys defensively that did not playing that game that were hurt 'em\nBut what will get them back and I I just think that they they work in progress they understand that that my biggest thing is and I tell them about this week is well\nI'm not worried about the scoreboard I the score board is irrelevant right now it till we can get our gene ... the other so that we're responding to the games and and the coach you on that we're trying to get across\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nA good football team in a\nLet's go to and I can't believe I'm saying this because this guy might be ten years younger than me but a guy who's been on the radio in New York City now God what almost Fifteen Years I think everyone Roberts of the ban in New York and my little ahead of the game on that or am I right\nI mean I'll take the Fifteen Years it's more like twelve but you know what I'll go with fifty actually you know what we're doing I think you're right you're this student doesn't Eighteen right yeah oh crap\nYeah it is fourteen years now\nLike well you know it better than I Do price you started on the air when you were ten for crying out loud so [laughter] I got\nI got a little bit of a head start but yet that have very long time a lot in the last ...\nI Know you have you seen Yankee wins and losses so as long as the Bible the fan base today in New\nYork they were pissed they were upset and they\nBasically all the things they were worried about for the last five ...\nCame to ... they were worried about the manager they're worried about his handling of the bullpen that turned out to be the case or are\nThey worried about the teams that have built you get to a big hit\nThat got in the playoffs worried about gr over reliance on the home run that turned out to be the case in the playoffs\nAnd they're worried about Carla they're worried about ... clutch and that turned out to be the case so everything that they were worried about one hundred when record season turned out to be their downfall postseason and so there's a lot of anger or there's a concern that bothered being the cause of all the red Sox\nI think they lose this series to the Indians there ticked off but not the same anger\nOh I think there was a lot of\nSelf hating that went on this year and all of those things they worried about her to have to be the reason why this season ends or\nYou know having all that stuff that you mentioned a lot of the guys that are there long term are tied into some of those issues is very into oh my God what have we gotten ourselves into field or hey we can work our way around this kind of feel in terms of next year and beyond just standing going anywhere anytime soon\nDo don't tell that to a Yankee fan actually think that they think they can sell them to the Dodgers can move on from him oh they're\nThey're they're leaving that they're dreaming about that that's the hope that they can pull that off but I think that\nRealize that this roster is pretty much what they're looking at but for the last ... years remember Yankees having spent like the Yankees they still have the high payroll but they haven't been\nYou know two hundred plus million dollar payroll they've talked about tax Rush Holt and the whole reason they've done that is this dream but now they're going to travel and Bryce Harper so I think there's a fantasy of them doing that\nBut there is a fantasy right now that they can find a way to treat John Carlos\n... magically to Los Angeles Dodgers I Would think that that's not happened it that is a little fake reality Yankee fans of dreaming about right now\nHaven't Roberts does Mitt days on the fan in New York with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh with the vibe of New York city All right you're kind of indicated to me some thoughts on the manager I don't know where you stand on Aaron Boone I may have a gas so let me ask you this way grade Aaron Boone miss\nWhole season what kind of greenwell you give him as manager of the Yankees\nI must say I mean I think he was a really good kindergarten teacher I think the players like him and wasn't that really part of why pride catchment hired ... gentle he's nice put\nTired even my big concern with them was ... he never had it wasn't nearly as good as Joe Jr already and I think that's the other problem the Yankees had a good manager with the manager didn't meanings perfect it didn't mean it was for all this\nBut they had themselves in my opinion on the matter and baseball and Frank has been decided to go on that part I wanted to basically higher so he could control more and that's what ... was so\nI give them see but that's mostly because the man who pulled it was pulling the strings with Brian Castle in a way I look again for is that the computer malfunction you know Arab Buddhas the computer he has a plan and the game dictate something different and instead of being able to adjust like a human being the computer went haywire\nAnd he didn't know what to do so we stuck with you about a stuck with Louis Severino the game before and so I think that his biggest issue is what we saw in the play offs but\nThey want a hundred game tonight knowledge that and that's not easy to do so that's why I get him up from it I give him a C because they didn't have a good regular season but this is about the general manager with essentially was manager and Brian catch\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nThis general manager was running the show and we used to make fun of Joe Jr already binder that was the whole big joke joke already got a binder looking back on it shows he ended up managing more with the good and I feel that our moon every day\nSo it's funny how things work out the thing that a lot of people didn't like in Joe Jr already the guy they hire to replace them with ten times worse when it comes to it\nDo you think Alex Korea is a good manager or he just happens to be managing a really good team with a pretty good roster\nI think he's a ... from from what I've seen I think he's a good manager I liked the bruising at All right that's what I liked about Alex corn I tell you as a Mets fan that was the guy wanted to see manager this team I wanted to see our score amendments that I'm not sure that would have made a difference\nBecause Carolyn his talent Taliban's with one thing I liked about Alex ... is that\nWe have a little bit of an edge when he manages but you gotta have talent that's the bottom line it away\nHeaven Robertson WFAN he's got the ... days down at the fan and has for years with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh haven't we appear have talked about the and I'm using air co air quotes the rivalry between the red Sox and the Yankees\nI don't know what it's going to mean this series up here it seems like people are trying to turn the page and sort of moving on and thinking championship\nDidn't reignite the flames of the rivalry down there or are those days are long gone\nThere they're not here right now I Can't say are long gone because you know things can change I mean things can happen in DC for playing each other off every year or next four years if you can learn to hate ... let me just by moving the bat\nThan I think that the robbery can be re ignited but\nIt was this whole thing was kind of awkward I mean the Yankees won a plate and Red Sox fan we want to beat the red Sox and all of that but it was not in doubt it was nothing like two thousand four and I think that while it can happen again\nIt's just going to take time things just don't all of a sudden wake up in your rivals eat each other again so I think it can be reignite but at least this time around it was nothing like go through you know not not even like Ninety nine I\nYeah I totally with you on that Ninety nine is one that felt like it was that it's nasty and so then you had that blown call would not block and it got worse and Shaw hits home run and all of a sudden the next thing you know people are throwing stuff I\nI think those days I mean God that was almost Twenty years ago how scary is that in our lives number one and that that was almost Twenty years ago for crying out loud\nWant you to Yankees ever need to do to be able to win if they can make one two maybe three moves next year in the offseason what do you want to see them do that might get 'em over the home\nI think they need to get away from relying on the rumble I think they need guys who can put the ball in play I think a guy like Michel frankly I Know he's not Bryce Harper when he puts them all in play I got like ... near and dear to met fans parts\nHe puts the ball and play and both of them left handed hitters they were way too right handed so I think from a line of perspective to guys like that would help and then he started taking them out because outside when can I say there's nothing locked in on that rotation next year so Dallas tight go Patrick orbit move like that\nI think you're going to see it and the Yankees are going to be aggressive and frankly spend even waited to get under this luxury tax threshold to be aggressive\nSo I think one thing they got to do what they've got to get away from being overly reliant on the home run\nHaven't I don't know that a David prices going to opt out but if he does do you think the Yankees would be interested in his services\n[laughter] watch out for your call batting practice picture to swing going\nTo be talking to our essential slumped let him so BP Gary to get an odd about a guy you're talking about a guy that melts under the pressure even pricey the definition of it's All right sorry about that ... good luck with that even in the house yes and von Miller I really wasn't while\nHe was the Yankees signed Jacoby I was married when everybody up here knew he was soft through the puffy proof so there why a lot of hard because it happened to\nListen to Jacoby ... the fact the Yankees still page uh Kobe very twenty two million dollars a year it's sort of hysterical when you think about it I mean what a what a disastrous contract that turned out\nNo question and everybody up here how I got him in the Boston Globe for a calling him the key word and that's exactly what are you\nWhat their Chevy GMC ... Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine three on condition at what board and he's religion or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices log on to flood auto John job now\nBut good God Almighty a disastrous baseball moot hey I've been you know your baseball I got to get an opinion on ya ...
