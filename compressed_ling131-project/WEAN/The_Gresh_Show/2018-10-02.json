wheel all the\nTime right but he doesn't feel like in putting together Joe tests of Torre and uh and Jason Whitman straightforward to me you know central casting no\nBecause Jason wouldn't came out of nowhere like here's what it is rich okay here's what it is how he would rather he had been doing studios stuff and then they move up to the big chair as it were\nHere's the thing yes yes exactly there used to be a meritocracy not oh you're retired and you look good and you speak well let's throw you in the highest profile color job in television\nLike I'm not saying Jason wouldn't had to do the bees we reached game of the week but he didn't have to do a year but he doesn't have to do buffalo in San Francisco\nBut not just oh yeah I walked out of football and they're going to like it because CBS got lucky with Tony Romo\nAnd by the way why was why is part of the reason why Tony Romo success successful\nBecause Jim Nance has been a friend of his forever so I don't know Jim Nance has got some credibility to walk in the room at CBS and say hey listen I Know this guy I Will personally vouched for him\nWith written it was oh out of the blue is going to give up six million to go make five million to me bad at Monday Night football I see where you're coming from now\nBut that's what really bothers and again you know not for nothing and I've heard good things about Joe tests the tour of the person I think he's a terrible what about play guy but I dare you to tell me that it wasn't oh yeah he's just the next guy in line\nYou know what that guy go Monday Night football it's the same reason why I train window got a national morning show who would hardly done any radio whatsoever but you know when he was he was very rare\nAnd he's been there for a long time it's not that Seinfeld episode where Jerry wanted to move in on the married lady and save her laying on the husband oh army here and then you're there and then you're just there\nAnd you're there all the time that sort of kind of feels like is that all you have to do is go the SPN and I've been in and firemen but the level of\nUm\nThe level of ask kissing Vic goes on at that place is almost other worldly like his politics\nAnd then there is if you're not immersed in it kissing ass go into these corporate functions going all these places where people are going to notice you all the time\nOr then you're never going to get ahead there but it kinda feels like some of these people who get these jobs at the four letter network they just wait it out\nAnd that Jason wouldn't just happened to be the guy that they said oh we didn't get to be our Tony Romo because somebody in an upper level instead of working with some of the people who've been there\nOr I don't know maybe looking at somebody like hey how about like teddy Bruce ski who did studio for two years and has some shops\nAre just throw a cowboy and they're also got to work right sure John some of course it will and then we get a terrible broadcast\nThey're not going to shut people out all the time their their goal in my opinion is to hold people to twenty or less\nNormally in the NFL you can hold a team to twenty or less you're in pretty good shape defensively and I think what we saw defensively was a reinvigorated Dante high tower\nAh I also think we saw the secondary do a good job of you know being able to convert in those third downs situations but the biggest development was this often sublime finding a way to set their pads\nAnd then run the ball the way they did and the ... and the third quarter would lead and don't run the ball in the fourth quarter with the lead\nThat's where this all feds can't completely be transformed if they continue to run it\nAnd you know you've got to be willing to stick it out in the run game and that's where to me the patriots of all he's got lost in that they want to run the ball\nThey want to make it seem like they want to run the ball\nAnd then they turn around and as soon as they hit a couple of bumps in the road they decided to bail on the running game or it becomes oh let's run our shotgun draw series and all that stuff they mix them a lot of different looks\nYou know not for nothing\nBut the patriots have no zone read game whatsoever because he can't run it\nThat's where a quarter Patterson and that motion makes a difference\nBut it helps in the run game they brought back but why am play for those who don't remember what the ... when you wake them up before you go go oh well ... somewhere Andrew originally is still disease or maybe a lot of dead yeah who knows\nHow to fill out there and I know that uh George my yeah George Michael ... yeah I think Andrew originally might still be walking the earth reminding people that he was once in a ...\nWith a land play is where you bring the tightening in short motion\nThe center will go walk up on the line backer and the tight end will ear hold that down linemen and kick 'em out and the running back of pop right up underneath there and when you have a back like Sony Michel\nWho alone like carry on Johnson last week did a really good job and does a good job of running through trash in the middle and not trashy players but meaning of their bodies on the ground you got to run around somebody\nHe's pretty good at that I think\nI I just think people gave up on it too quick and it's also hard I think to get New England fans to think outside the well Tom Brady is just gonna sold fifty times and we're going to win every game kind of thought\nProcess yeah I mean I'm Still with people by the way I haven't changed my opinion of the fact that taken a running back and saw crap move in the first round in today's modern and found out\nAnd I when I disagree on that violently disagree one that's why I think\nA lot of people I think a lot of people think like I Do in terms of whether or not they agree about running back they didn't think it was a need for this team so that's why a lot of people were so eager to right Michelle off because and I'm with them and this aspect you draft a running back in the first round and I mean outside of the patriots\nIn the past decade were the first round running backs that oh let's use them into the system and then sprinkle them and you've got a first round running back and run them into the ground thirty carries a game five years later he's looking for money and you say sorry I I I wanted to help you but ah\nGo talk to levy on bell so I think that's why a lot of people were\nSo eager to right Michelle off because it's supposed to be an instant impact type position\nAnd people hadn't seen it yet but I Want to get your thoughts on crash in terms of do you think let alone Michelle forget Michelle necessarily just the running game in general do you think the patriots have been focusing so much on the running game not no not necessarily out of necessity but\nThey know that one settlements back and have Gordon is up to speed at all they're not going to really be running the ball at all for the next three months but they know they'll probably need a running game come playoff time\nYeah I I don't think they're going to bail on the running game the way some think I mean look at all look at yesterday right ... ... yesterday is a really good example of the balance that I think in a perfect world they would like forty carries\nNow three of them were Neal downs by Horner right so you take away those three for free your mind is three yards you're looking at it\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in East Village and there were against that have the best financed raise the prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log on to what goes on top of\nProblem is is well when I sit down to play with Chuck you'd do are you mad and all we do is throw it fifty five times a day and we won the sits portrays Fenway Park I only Rauner quarterback\nSneak and those are the only ruins the Brady like if you don't balance the our fence all you're going to do is set yourself up for what happened in Detroit\nSo I don't think they're going away from it and in fact fruits when I saw was a running game that added more layers to it for example the\nLead draw worked really well not for those you don't know what that means is it's normally a fallback leading up into the whole point if you watch the draw plays\nBut they ran yesterday you saw was James dabbling he stands up and shows is numbers and then boom they hid among the draw play where the middle opens up and then you at Sony Michel or really regimes white\nPick where they want to go I mean how they get king on foreigners some carries for crying out loud now there is a guy's not going to get many carries but\nIf it's ... ... here's the other part that people are going to have reconciling with Sony Michel and this might be a little bit to where it ties in your point root for okay\nRex ...\nJames White Sony Michel how do you balance the touches for those guys well Suzie Burke has always hurt won't because in theory roots most people look and say what was the first round pick on a running back\nHow in the world you know give that guy had a you know all of the carries or or the lion's share well number one James White you need to hand him to football to keep it relevant in the\nPast and gay correct\nOr and the the same thing really where what part cat and I know they like to do the same several white that they like to do with ... cat but we're no ... between the tackles\nSony Michel will probably be best used or\nSome of the successes Sony Michel may end up having might be Thanksgiving and beyond not because of necessarily in the ... shows doing other than\nThey're going to ration carries for him and ultimately when they know they need to do it like you said roots down the stretch in the playoffs he'll end up being that guy when he was the end of the year he only has\nSeven hundred fifty yards and ate touchdowns and ten catches or what not people are going to look at them and say well that Sony Michel he was a boss knowing is one of the few teams who are not afraid to draft a guy in the first round and then the incrementally bring\nThem along or use the guy more in the second half of the year\nYeah I just don't see that as a as a great use of capital and I and I know that might just be a disagreement and philosophy but I wouldn't call them a bust if he had those numbers and I saw how he was used but I Would again go back and be like yeah I mean good pick I guess great way to use that guy boat why didn't you just trade out of that spot where all the different player\nYou know should James White beginning ten targets as a running back when I I like it but again as Sony Michel gets those targets then it's oh well it's validated because he got all these target\nCorrect I wouldn't have anyone make I wouldn't have trouble with anyone making that argument because I looked at this team at running back and because of I don't have trouble with James getting ten targets and I don't have a problem with the guys that they had running the ball running the ball between the tackles\nThat's why I look at it like that and I think that's why a lot of the backlash is the way it is because a lot of people just don't like that picked didn't see it as an aid\nSo his performance can be whatever it is and people like me are going to look back and say gee I would've loved and all kinds of linemen and that's about here's what he is well they took the first round I Know I'm just talking generally find a guy everyone bought around back how 'bout that anyone veteran and here's the thing\nThey needed to replace\nThey needed to replace Lou Gehrig blunt with somebody that was white years better than the airport like Sony ... shows career\nWill be a much better career then like airborne at the end of the day and just because what worked out does it mean every seventh round or on drafted guy does and just like every first round or the turns into ... Gurley they all don't turn into that\nI just think it's the way they're being used and that's where I Know God Forbid people don't want to do this because now it's [noise] tell me stats ain't what I'm supposed to think you know that kinda stuff let me punch a bunch of numbers\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nTheir too worried about paying their bills and going to work and get their kids in and out of school\nCan block just texted me the police report only came out after the twenty fourteen election did not come out before November yeah but the heat was on the heat was uh\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln if there were against it unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nA but Brett Kavanaugh in second grade so someone's cupcakes so that can be national\nNews ... we have to cover would you would you stop\nBut I mean seriously stop oh gee he drank a lot in college is that a shock [noise]\nAre you away from that now no getting exasperated over the ... but the you know you just to oh I see is you know the ... memorize you just exactly yes yeah\nAnd I just sort of warm in with the oh you get your point I get to apply you get the point because you know what goes on friday going to be doing sitting around twiddling their thumbs you think that if the lord shall be made public yes or no\nUh yeah well they're not going to do that of course they're not they're going to are they really got to find anything that's going to railroad this no I don't think so I don't know the old jelly\nBeans in fifth grade let's throw him out you know the heat off of a balcony at third team my God what do we do the horror\nBut Fox Sports not [noise]\nSomebody a NFL and we have from the New England truck solution studio this is the station you count on for news traffic whether we can talk Ninety nine seven FM and am six thirty W.

we played earlier about the rivalry thing right so Ballard that clip we played earlier from a GM Chris Ballard which would be the rivalry is back on the fourth quarter laughing at him as a suggestion of the ... that was an adjustment Daniels flew the coup there\nAnd that made the rounds and so luck was asked before this game coming up on Thursday if he had heard that and he said and\nI I think we all heard about it [laughter] what are our our\nOur our our ... I've grown in the middle Chris very well you know from from day one I I I really appreciate him\nA ... he's been honest and communicative and end up like a great leader for this building a and so that was his authentic self comment and then that made me happy I Love when when you get to see authenticity or from people especially your leaders in this building\nThat's kind of a nice way of saying right great sin wasn't arrogant tank and it's good that this guy's human\nI ...

Anthony Scott Walker has that\nOld friend your boss she has that\nIs a picture of a pony Matthews sacking Alex Smith and it says this is not a sec cover story in the NFL goes to increasing likes to protect the quarterback defensive players are the ones left feeling helpless yeah cream on basically ... here to do last night\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east British and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log on to what goes on trial\nHe was he was protected himself but trying to knock somebody else out is when he was trying to do his shirt trucks right over a very much did well we can start with Kansas City because as we take a look at yes folks we waited for it all year\nBut we're now at the corner pole of the NFL season already teams that played for games and when you look in the AFC it's the whole what do we know and let's start with Kansas City\nKansas City for no are they in the best team in the AFC right now they are but I don't look at them and think that that is an unbeatable group and part of the reason is because\nI Do think the league will catch up to some of what ... homes is doing in the way Andy Reid is running there often but you know ... homes is um\nI think he really benefited from sitting last year by year and when I look at the\nGrowth of like Carson Palmer once he got in line up that's how I kind of you know homes is that him sitting all that time behind the Alex Smith and then eventually getting into the game and playing the those last couple of regular season games\nHowever long he played\nThat sort of gave him the jumpstart so what we're seeing right now and I think the chiefs of also done a good job of sort of re stocking the shelves a little bit you know did they overpay for Sammy walking you up and I know he pulled hamstring last night and that hurt they're all fence\nBut you the essence of phrases easy overpay guys so he had over pay him to get them there and they didn't send me walking came and you have Travis Kelsey and uh you have a what a Kareem Hunt and then\nThe uh what's his name he'll\nGet the first name screwed a Christian ... thank you ... I was thinking Barry Word ... oh yeah oh wow yeah very word but\nThey went and got quick twitch guys and guys with long speed or so they've done the appropriate job of giving him some young guys to play fast with\nKorea they got a ton of flame acres I'm with you though as much as I'm On the homes bandwagon\nThat team has two things are going against it when it comes to proceed\nAccess I Know you're still want to write well I'll give you the first one and then you can go ahead and take the second one the first one is that they don't have much of a defense um which isn't necessarily a the curse that it once was in today's NFL but needless to say I'd still would be nice if they had one in the second one of course would be\nThe walrus Sandy Reid\nYeah of course India.Arie last night hiding behind a couple a TGI Fridays menus while he was decided to call plays that seriously right that when I was making fun of Tom one and how it doesn't seem like he's doing anything on which is why I don't really respect him and his team now they're seeing with plate mistake free ball and there are guys shut up when they needed to shut up then I Would just be like hey\nIt would be like with Bill I don't know what he's doing but it's working so I'm going to go ahead and plead ignorance and just go about my business\nBut any rate is on the other end of the spectrum he goes way too much to the point where\nIt's become acceptable in this league\nFrom Andy Reid the hermit words all the way on down to Adam gay float right to I Need someone to ah keep an eye on the clock oh oh I'm Sorry we're from that but that's from the over management like wait a second you're so for us through the trees right now\nThat you've moved the clock off the table and that that's no longer born 'cause all these other things I piled on the table I have to hand the clock management to someone else\nAndy Reid has never been able to get out of his own way pun intended if you'd like\nAnd are going to say oh yeah it was a fat joke and he'll neither one he'll be the one eventually holding that team back I'm not so sure about teams necessarily a catching up to my home only because the defense of rules and the NFL now crashed\nLike you said they have so many weapons even if you go down to like Albert Wilson and they just have a lot of great complimentary players in that authentic could probably survive a couple of injuries\nAnd even if teams do sort of you know quote unquote get onto their scheme I think they have enough weapons to sort of work around that\nYeah I I just have a blank on there's a Keim hunt and Karim ... different guys that yeah I get I guess I got confused I happen uh by the way some numbers\nThrough the first quarter of the NFL season ... we've had three thousand in thirty points scored it's the most three weeks for an NFL history the old record was two thousand nine hundred and eighty six back in two thousand twelve so beat up by what Ninety eight and a a right around there now\nLess than that thirty and fourteen would be forty four points they beat that by ...\n... group once your car any make any model what pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had will vie yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\n... homes is that maybe it's just reflective of the defense as to why the numbers will still be big it and we'll see if anybody ends up finding a way to shut down that Kansas City all fence where you're writing roots in terms of defense\nThey are third from the bottom or she has me for ... from the bottom in the AFC ah the raiders have given up most points in the AFC the chargers are the next then believe it or not the Steelers and then come the Kansas City\nHas become the base stealing of the NFL where no during the regular season doesn't really matter but you know what you better have some of the during the playoffs or you're going to get your eye\nIn maybe yeah I think there are I think that works for the whole yeah if you don't have some in the playoffs or you're going to be screwed let's put it this way I argued this for years when a certain talk show host in Boston just went all Lewinsky on Tom Brady and said it was all about\nHim if the ... game didn't matter coaches wouldn't coach it and if defense didn't matter coaches wouldn't invest in it they know it does it may not show during\nThe regular season but it better show up like you said in the postseason up the Cincinnati Bengals are off to a three and one start and so are the Baltimore Ravens\nBut boy I view those two teams very differently and it's a little bit to the defense you mentioned their roots the Bengals have given up a hundred and Thirteen points in four games\nThe ravens have given up sixty five and four games they have it's not a lot of points there not back to Ray Lewis level but you're given a sixty five points nowadays held the jags who everybody loves that defense they've given up fifty six through for game\nWhose Baltimore play it exactly I Know they played Pittsburgh and sell them to fourteen I Know the skunk buffalo and weak one if memory serves\nGod they hammered the bills forty seven three and the opening week then they lost to the bangles thirty for twenty three they beat the Broncos twenty seven fourteen and the Steelers twenty six fourteen\nSee I kind of I I'm a high on Baltimore Baltimore winning that division and making it to the playoffs\nOver the Steelers but the fact that they give a thirty four points to Cincinnati\nPretty much rights off their defense at ... that sixty five is kind of garbage to meet with\nThe coming to Cincinnati because Cincinnati or the team as familiar with Baltimore all ... and that's what I was going to get much so that might give them a little bit of a a leg up but then you have to do that the other way Baltimore is also familiar with Cincinnati so the fact that they were able to play against uh divisional rival and hang thirty four on um\nUm that's good news for Cincinnati but when that represents half the points Baltimore has given up\nI immediately would start picking through the schedule I find that buffalo game right away and be like oh yeah when Jay Peter and was trying to sling coats and some bread rose they only give up a field goal but I'd like to see them you know maybe place more often says that are a little bit more on the level of Cincinnati before I go start getting Gaga over the Baltimore defense which I Want to do but I'm not there yet\nOn the one when teams the raiders the colds the Texans the Steelers the browns the jets and the bills ... there's probably only\nTwo of those teams that are worth a damn and I would say it's the Steelers and I guess by default the Texans but if you look at some like the ... in the culture the same team hills are bad I mean the jets are the jets are doing what they should be doing\nIt out with a rookie quarterback and letting him get a ton of experience\nYou know the browns or the browns the Steelers are eminently disappointing the Texans have been maybe the biggest flop and the NFL to start the year so far ... and the raiders kidding me\nI mean just watch Chuck E. cheese heads spin around and he'll ... some pea soup at some point like it's an extra says I'm Out there because that guy's trying to just change everything in one fell swoop we're going to go to Las Vegas so we're going to be completely different and\nThen Tommy Boy Davis is going to have money oh oh wait oh oh he sold the team oh I guess I'm fired I mean that's what's coming down like killing Nazi within a five year period once they go to Vegas but Tommy Boy Davis is going to sell that team\nNearly renovated Jordan flickers has all of your favorite beer wine
