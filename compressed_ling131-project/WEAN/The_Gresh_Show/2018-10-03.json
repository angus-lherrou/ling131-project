with the athletic that you didn't have with the Herald so that you can do some stories may be that have been in your back pocket\nFor a while I don't know I mean I I can I can certainly take more time to write stories because in in in the newspapers is banging up stuff\nAlmost every day so one advantage to this is that I can spend a couple of days or something and I can go they they they're not necessarily locked into game actions although we do cover all the games\nYou know my job is to sort of stray from the path once in a while\nAnd find something a little different what did you hear that they held too so um so yeah I mean I'm not going to use cuss words or anything because they cut corners of because it's a it's the same thing ... you go through there but it's the same thing with

magically\nStart you know voting like dad was a teamster for forty years and and I'm sure he could swear up a blue streak I don't want to do that because I can and then suddenly the get myself when I'm like on your show and getting a truck\nYou know what's interesting about that and it's like I worked in satellite land for a year for mad dog Russo now Chris who just come over from terrestrial him for you know he was big into\nThat but I get a base\nUp this has been our\nGuide out loud crazy the good ones but thank you but it may you know what makes you think about your presentation like I did a pod cast with a ... for a while and every once in awhile I Would let it fly and I let it fly when I'm off the air\nBut when it comes to on the air you know to turn it off my wife couldn't figure out for years box\nHow I could talk off the air one way and then talk on the air another way but to your point it just becomes a part of your overall presentation and who you are white people are still going to get the same sea Buckley they're just not getting it at the athletic\nYeah exactly and and by the way Chris Russo is actually in mentioned in the very first column I write if you go to it it was like my zenith moment I mentioned the speaker phone press conference in Nineteen Ninety seven where the jet I tried to do it ended around ...\nBringing parts self and as a consultant and they'll check with the nominal head coaches and parts cells was speaking through the\nDopey speaker phone and we you bad call an M stat and Long Island and parse those used to do this or who's talking I don't know what you're saying is that was his way of saying it out of order\nAnd Russo is asking the questions that Russo and parts of the host talk it always asking that question and Russo got get up walks up to the speaker phone leans into it goes it's quite as well from the ... [laughter] and that was pretty funny\nYeah I've seen in free job many a times and let me tell you another one of those guys you off the air different kind of language than on the air our friends the Buckley now of the athletic here on the grass show on WNPR wrote\nA book I I Do want to ask you a couple of questions not to break it down in depth but\nUm to tie breakers for two division titles here this year for game one sixty three\nFour we rarely see that happen and I guess I kind of asset in the old G I bet you have any money were no the last time that happened it would be the Buckley but in all seriousness it's kind of an interesting way for the season to end the two divisions had to be decided in game one sixty three\nYeah and also what really added to the weirdness\nIs that all four teams going to the playoffs anyway so it was a little less compelling I mean this wasn't the third game of the Dodgers giant series with the you know the Bobby constant home run with third Nineteen fifty one did this with a little different in the winter\nWe get a few days off to to to rest and in our 'em up the division series where the two losers as happened uh would go directly to the wild card game\nSo but but you we we were joking um the other day and Fenway when this was looked like he was going to happen like you could have a situation where all four teams like say say you got the cubs Bruins game to\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common there are all in for Steve free own condition and bought bought any religion or against the wind over two hundred three on cars all may all models at incredible prices are going to flood Otto John John now\nGame so it it it is a little different knowledge it's never happened in a season um\nIt it's it's entirely new and shiny and and and again if it was less than dramatic it's because obviously the first time you've got to play a game where you know obviously the winters are going to the winners and losers both go to the post season and it's not like the Bucky Dent game in Seventy eight\nOr the you know what they said the or the or the um the red Sox and Cleveland Indians played one game playoff in Nineteen forty eight and that to me was cataclysmic because that the red Sox\nWon that playoff game a date of one of the American league planet pennant and you would have had the first and only the Braves Boston Red Sox World Series was the Braves had won the pennant so so yeah there's a lot of stuff that but no I don't think it's happened twice a month to\nBlock as you look at the Yankees aids match up Yankees won a hundred games there at home we know they can re\nBAs are going to have an open or and then they're going to do this whole hey we're just kind of piecemeal through nine innings and hope we can get a win what's your read on this game for the wild card playing between a one hundred wind team and in Ninety seven when the\n... I Would echo the without the core of careful what you wish for if if people think they're going to have an easier time with the old days I mean it's a it's a bumpy team it to its eye goes back to what we set off the air to that led a team\nAnd uh as Kori said they they run they go for the third their their their you know almost like the Miami wild cat a few years ago they just do a lot of different things and they're a team to be reckoned with\nNow now the romantic gave me one such Yankees are the ... it's almost a cliche but be that as it may so I think he says there's more history and there's the border war and and um and you know pick your favorite Red Sox Yankees ... capability of our\nPersonnel are fists Billy Martin or you know ... point rich you are right field that game and is it is just ... I'm Sorry of air attack a riot\nOr a rotten Brunson royalty oh fourth it there's just so much they're eight hour in bowling Wakefield radio like Pedro it we can go on and on but you know having said that\nLet's not forget this did some decent history with the socks and the ... you you've got Nineteen Seventy five when the stocks went to the world series they swept the age that they knocked off a three time defending World Series champion the old days it won the world to Seventy two Seventy three Seventy four and the ... knock them off three straight but that's a big deal\nThe a sweat socks to ... you know fourth straight healthy as both an eighty eight Ninety then the Sox in two thousand three leading into their catastrophic loss of the Yankees nails yet\nThey went down too old to get the A's and came back and won three straight citizen decent history there we can have the final\nYeah no question about it and uh you know I I I think the yanks ended up winning the game just because I think they can re their tail off and then they can do is look buck and a Red Sox what is the one thing heading into the postseason about this Red Sox theme\nThat you're confident you know they're going to do and execute and then\nI get I mean is it the bullpen is it just fate accompli the bullpen is the thing that is the shade here's what's your read on the strength and the weakness of this Red Sox team heading into a post\nOr the shaky when it first 'cause like it's like you don't even want to answer your answer it for me I Know I I I didn't know you you you kinda pushing me around a little bit there [laughter] um but uh you know I write for the athletic now I'm not going to be bullied by okay I'm not you know that's not going to happen anymore [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI can always pushy around a barrel for crying out loud that is funny I redirect your honor the strengthen the weakness of the red Sox are\nWell I Would say that well you can say we as you say concern okay and that's all I Would I I Would say my concern is not so much the bullpen but the starting pitching because at the starting pitching go deep if you get seven plus innings from these guys which means that pitching in the eighth inning\nThen the flotsam and jets and that you're worried about coming in the fifth and sixth inning isn't relevant because they're sitting out in the bullpen eating ... seat\nThe issues they they knock them out of the playoffs a year ago is that they couldn't get a starting pitcher to go five minutes the reason they got knocked out of the playoffs in two thousand eleven when they had an awful month\nWasn't just the beer and the pizza it was go go go look at baseball reference go look at the entire month of October ... and count the number of times they got a picture go into the sixth and seventh than it was it was on\nWhat auto group once your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nI don't know if it's Bush or how do you pronounce it refers to ... we were sixteen [noise]\nAnd told her I watch will and such a sixteen year but again\nWatching Senator Whitehouse about [noise] flatulence\nWas an embarrassment for Rhode Island [noise] my select a problem solver\nGas bag above Flanders and I approve this message is that so that's where we're talking about that's a great had you know the Perry campaign adds a little bit better than that are a\nLot of damage it can really love it or not Senate I Know one way and I've got one for or whatever I Want to cause I'm like the guy who wrecked is both are true oh you know I I'm an independent or whitening thing\nWell let me tell you something bad would it cuts the gas don't want to know that that may each year once my my cubicle and it's like a cloud there\nIt's like I'm that guy friend got peanuts\nOoh that pig pig that'd be picked in oh just like we have governor way among dolls\nAnd down and there are ...\nOh my God Perry campaign that we have to write that come on down by way Bob pointers good job that is fantastic they will talk more about it tomorrow or a big night tonight who wins the game to go to see the Sox\nSeven five Yankees when they're going to get down or a the Yankees they're going to pull Severino early they're going to go to the bullpen and they're going to match share way to victory and you know who the and you know who your lips to God's your you know who else is with me on that to parry all\nYeah he said to me like what does that mean last time you saw your toes ...

Nash or then\nMaybe it wouldn't be so bad on the blue line at all by the way one of the guys are counting on his now forty three year olds a NATO Charo whose numbers just keep dwindling in ... in terms of playing time\nMaybe the gym at TV twelve met him and he's fine until he's probably like sixty three and then we'll have to recalculate to our expectation\nWell and he could just be a cyber war to root true is you know age listen I mean he really is a freak a ... char\nBut at the end of the day here I think the Bruins are going to it's going to be a bit of a struggle in this first month\nTo kind of figure out whether at the fence or you know golfing simply I think they now have speed they've interject you've been to the line up last year and I really like what the Bruins\nCould turn into often simply I just worry about the goal tending being affected by that defense and then the next thing you know it becomes an issue about uh two harassed\nVersus the defense and all the chatter starts and then it becomes a big mess\nSo by the way Bruins are playing tomorrow night as well\nBut so there in Washington and then they're in Buffalo tomorrow so back to back games out of the shoot that's that's always good wondering how to treat you wanted to be P R O four three nine seven seven six on the Twitter at the real grass G. R. E. S. H. coming up\nMeaning after I give you some headlines here and tell you what's going on in the world of sports you have a chance to win yourself a patriots logo\nWhat is your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common there are all in for Steve we own condition and what they need really Janeiro or against the wind over two hundred three on cars all make all models had incredible love onto what auto John John now\nI was out for the first four games because of a ... D policy in the NFL\nOr but beyond those guys get jak oil who's a favorite target of block tied in ... I don't want to say he's been extreme but he certainly is not in that upper echelon of\nPass catchers that position like Travis Kelsey\nA or a you know some of the other guys do you think about him in in that same kind of mold around the league and uh you look at the other guys it's largely a cast that has turned over almost to a man since the last time these teams played only about a half dozen guys are ...\nI'm from the two thousand Fifteen calls that take you know taking a look at both sides of the ball and I think defensively now they've they've had a lot of tackles the laws and they've gotten to the quarterback they've gotten to access your primarily with their defensive line zone coverage is\nGenerally Brady picks apart zone coverage is ah so I think the challenge of both sides of the ball I Will say I think a lot you know he's coming off a hundred yard performance\nOr a great game statistically against Houston is more of a can dunk often\nOr the lack of a better a cliche at the moment than we've been accustomed to the cold in the past\nUh they still have a quarterback though can run a you certainly showed that against the eagles and lucky they'll never ever want to overlook that a possibility but now even in his career when he was healthy\nAndrew Luck at problems against the patriots were I think that er personnel around him and and the colds I mentioned they're playing shorthanded and there really are a team that that in spilled outside of the quarterback position overall\nBob so see the wars in the New England patriots with us before every patriots game getting ready to hear his call with a ... tomorrow night right here on WPRI oh\nBob I asked this question or the still a real rival of the patriots or was that really just tied into Brady manning yeah\nThey I think more of the the latter I think you think about calls the patron was ... it was the best rivalry in the NFL I think you know for a long stretch of time because with those two quarterbacks in\nExcellent seems when you have the patriots fan the call waiting\nAlmost on an annual basis in postseason playing pivotal regular season games I mean some of the greatest moments from this dynasty for the patriots were created against the cold and and especially when you think about some of the deep end to highlight the patriots\nChampionship run high laws\nInterception game against in the capital as I Am AFC Championship stone pots borough of thinking about this stuff than the regular season Ted washing it and really big in is clamping down on that jury James to preserve the home field advantage for the playoffs and then often simply gave a patent reform it\nYeah with with uh with us going in and catching a touchdown pass and and rushing as well against the cold and you know all the great just fix the manning Brady a rebel to accumulate at the other defenses expense\nWith Andrew Luck they've had a couple of times the playoffs divisional rounded ... fourteen January or for a team that won the championship as we know about Fifteen and while there were a lot of bad feeling that resulted from that game\nWhile the owner is still there everybody else has gone really when you got all the principles\nOf from the lake it from the coast perspective Ryan grapes and no longer the general manager it's Chris Ballard who wanted to hire Josh McDaniel as at coach I you look at uh the head coach himself now it sprang quite\nA you know I don't think that anybody has any ill feelings toward Franklin hike or should they are like some you know might have with Chuck Hogan Hogan because of a\nKnow the history with this lake gate and what not in the cold to struggle the last ... years they've gone from\nAte and ate the foreign well Andrew Luck is quarterback of the old is on five against the patriots with nine touchdowns versus an interception\nBob so the the voice of the patriots with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh\nBob looking back to the Miami game\nHow important was not only the win but to have that kind of performance I Know getting ready for a Thursday game everything gets compressed\nWhat were you able to catch up by the boy that one really mattered and maybe this team needed a win like that against Miami said kind of feel good about themselves\n[noise] yeah and I think it mattered in in in a lot of different ways and we talked about it last week when I spoke to math ...\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln MTC Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of never against such funds parallel Marjorie impeccable\nBelieves that special teams is the heart and soul of a football team really can\nDevelop it seems toughness well that was really less of a factor of the game against the dolphin but certainly those first two\nAspects were very\nPrevalent and prominent in the patriots wet they ran the balls Sony Michel over a hundred yards James White with a choice yard touchdown brought they stopped the ... yards carrying the dolphins got a lot of their yards and garbage time I think Seventy five hundred Seventy two yards while their final drive a game with Frank or running at\nThe ... quarterback so the patriots came out and they set the tone they they gave up a big play on the first snap twenty two yards and\nAfter that no big place for the nonsense that had been able to get a lot of big place they confuse tannahill who really looked terrible frankly during the course of the game they didn't allow Miami to get any drives going bait or certainly put the pressure\nOn the dolphins or whether it was you know taking control a lot of scrimmage from an often standpoint or really pushing back a lot of scrimmage on the defensive standpoint I think that kind of a when it was important because it was all three phases it was a team of establishing an identity hope will continue\nOr beyond last Sunday in through tomorrow night and I think that's important going forward for the football team especially at city on the horizon in Green Bay and some of the other Markey match ups against us some high powered offices\nGoing to face in the near future\nBob ... I'm kind of a jagged fan this week\nA way they beat up the chiefs I mean you know you talk about catching a break\nBut major it's not only get two games at home but they get a Thursday night at home and then a Sunday night at home against the chiefs and the genes are going to play Jacksonville and we know Jacksonville one thing hey they may not win the game Bob [noise] but I think they're going to beat him up and uh you know maybe a page or its end up catching a break\nIn terms of uh in terms of Kansas City pitching you mentioned the chiefs 'cause I mentioned it to people beforehand here that hey root for the jags this week to beat the snot out of them physically so do you get a week in Kansas City teams on a rolling here are next Sunday\n[noise] yeah and I don't think he can be overlooked hello Kansas City it's a relatively short flight from Denver as opposed to say with obvious reasons if the patriots were going up Denver to plant a short weight right but that's a factor there you're coming off the Monday Night game a close\nTight game and as you mentioned they gotta go play a very good defense from Jacksonville team that plays with a lot of physicality\nOn you know I'm not sure what Jacksonville is going to have a sense of live with for that but are you talking about often but also can be very physical at times when he's out there so\nI think for that she's you know it is a tough predicament to being an and the patriots do catch a great having us Thursday came at home having gone to Tampa Bay last year\nAnd see the patriots grind through that game on Thursday night I I think the advantage campy overstated a and I think it's been you know I was surprised honestly the last couple of weeks Andy how well the ... team played for the most part you know the Thursday night games because history\nIt seems to me and the recent past is that\nThe home team generally hold serve\nBob last thing for him and this is a\nYou know listening to you and your partner have you seen Bambi Bob\nI'm Sorry have you seen Bambi if I've seen band they\nDidn't even role that he ruled that out last week there will be damaged it may be\nA long time it's only been a long time and you know it um it brings back a lot of bad memories that you know my kids haven't seen it either a six and eight year old um but ah I Love I Love Bambi as a kid but you know I mean you know um [noise] yeah\nIt's it's a it's an interesting description so used to try to tell\nThe radio audience\nYou know what happens when I was ... ... ... yes for girls Paterson looked like uh-huh catching a screen passes for the second time in a couple of weeks he toppling over backwards\nYou know Bobbie you and I are maybe the only two people on earth next to those winding through I called big mama who can relate to those kinds of moments\nFrom our boy just accept Bahraini if we off the top of his head my favorite too when he talks himself into or not and then he can't get himself out see it as it happened as much with you because it's not belong form\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the here for only one Ninety nine brought will say hello to forge twenty Eighteen Ford F. one fifty the best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at point forward and he joined Narragansett\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free own condition at what for Denise religion they're against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto John job now\nOh yeah they play tomorrow and he was like wait what I'm telling you a lot of people that this game it's sneaking up on I'm not bagging on M.

on the VCR oh seven twenty fours time\nHarry pictures coming your way in about twenty five minutes from now maybe a little less be on alert for that [noise]\nBrown you our eyes this weekend for the governor's top and the a brown bear it's got a good win over Georgetown last weekend overt brown stadium and the head football coach of the brown bears Phyllis is with me here on the ground showing WPRI road coach congratulations when number one on the year it's got to feel good [noise]\nOh absolutely\nYou know waiting for that to happen I think the big thing about this when there and it was you know we play well in all three faces I think often play this time we took that first drive down and read what seven points on the board we've been talking about that from the very beginning um\nAnd I just felt like you know we were in steak off in late ... we did a great job of keeping their quarterback receivers jak still gave up some yard at you and the second half\nA rushing so we've got to do a better job there but we made some place on special team were able to ah they fumble upon on back to it and ah you know we were able to capitalize on that so good when all three page\nAnd coach you don't get many of these how important was it for your football team to win at this point to validate all of that hard work that they were going to lose them or anything like that but what is it important from that standpoint as well some positive reinforcement on the scoreboard\nWell yeah absolutely I mean the biggest thing for us is you know how much do we improve beach gay men were certainly wouldn't want to take a step backwards we've really felt like we matched up while against Georgetown\nUh as far as what they did well and what we can do well and and so you always one of those plane that only want us to pick up put it all together and and going into the governors cup it's something we really need it because we're really going against a rodeo team that is as good as not seen that a long long time\nWell coached such jump right into it you know I I had their game on TV outing Yukon and I know you can't young an airplane you know freshmen and like I get that part of it but\nThey were scorn with them total total one point they got down and they came back in the game and you needed to get a a a a touchdown to win it there in the end we know what they've done in the CIA they just beat Harvard what is it about this Rhode Island team coached that is different and that jumps out to you when you watch them on film\nA really play well in all three phases\nPlay well together I think this is one of those teams when I listen to their comments after the are for game and they talk about you know this was a part of the game plan dirt they're buying into everything the gym for I mean to tell them\nAnd and they have that confidence the bottom that that can match up against the very best teams in the country are the biggest thing that stands out\nTo be it's a quarterback disguise the real deal he can run he can throw and he just got off and they have a lot a lot of weapons a lot of a very big on the office why but I think they're they're receiving corps is very very good but some side in great athletic ability\nYeah and ah I'm spacing on the name of their all conference defensive lineman Ninety nine I Want to say gee Nettie or something like that\nYou know they they got it yeah they got a kid in the middle who really makes a difference and you know you know this as well as anybody coach when you have an impact defensive lineman that's a guy you got to account for all the time what sort of challenges will the road he defends present your office on Saturday\nWell I think they're really ... they don't have just one guy and a and the effects of why I think they have four guys they play it out for down speed that can get after year and make way I think they're they're big their physical and and\nThey really like to get after ya they play a lot of man on the on the back side they feel like they can they can match up with you and your receiver so you know I I just feel like they're playing with great confidence and and they should they're they're very\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood born as over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com [noise]\nMinutes of the hottest fire you are going to hear from Brad Stevens it lets you know that he just does not like his team right now\nHow much can you take from this game in terms of the starters in Cleveland it was her first game and they look pretty Crispin if it just seemed like you guys fell behind ... what can you take away from it\nBut we are modest eleven first two games too\nSo um you know we have to play better um I don't I don't think the you know I certainly um I think overall in the first week it has not been effective\nAlong the along those same lines there was the first time you've got started against a bigger line up how much of an evaluation process do have to go through to see whether that's your best option against those big line of is that a thing where you're just confident that it will be watching anytime\nYou have that you have to you better score\nRight so you'd better you better be able to spread it out driving score it to do that obviously find right match ups get great shots um all those things and\nUm and at the same time I thought we we looked like a sieve defensively so um the difference with ... and Robert Williams in the game was noticeable entice at the ... and so we have to take that into consideration as we move forward\nOr do you guys have to do better with a smaller group got bans kind of covered up when he was with the start as I say\nWell I think anytime that you know it always starts and we'll go back and look at it and you will start and see you you always start with are you doing it well enough\nI'm Sorry executing techniques are you doing hard enough all that then you move to do we need to change it um and with very well could be um change either personnel or system and so we'll figure out where it where it is right now but you know\nI couldn't be more unimpressed after our first three exhibition\nGames is there anything any sense for going through training camping down three preseason games and coming off of the season where he had key injuries and you're trying to reintegrate people back into the roster\n[noise] ah I don't think it should be an excuse for you know doing things right\nOr just defensively Brad what are the biggest points of concern for you right now what now company or you you have the time now to kind of shape\nThat if a wide open lay ups wide open threes\nI'm wide open shots vowels um you know directing the ball um being able to get into the body of the ball handler without fouling being able to pull over and picking role and being the right spot pretty much everything I mean we got a lot of work to do it's pretty clear\nDo you have the confidence that you have tightened today before the regular season in terms of what's that smaller groups\nWell I mean it's you know I think obviously um we've done a lot of work up to this point\nUm it hasn't translated so needs to be taught better\nCoach follow up on that just with with the kind of the reverse preceding that you have you got immediately into the games and then you have essentially another space of training camp after play and\nHow can that potentially help with was working on these things um and also what are the difficulties of working on those things without game action [noise]\nYou know as long as it all applies men at the end of the day it's about you know you're willing to do all those little hard things that lead to winning\nIn in us far we haven't\nBrad do you think this bump in the road in the long run will be beneficial that the team can just come out there and dominated off of town alone and that everything you preach about is showing how no shot\nTo dominate off town alone\nNo team does that you have to plan together you have to play the right way do you have really good players and they all do that and then you can have a special you're bragging three points shooting throughout the preseason good looks and just not going in bad look\nA little bit a little bit of both I thought at the end of the game we missed a bunch of them that were pretty good looks like a wall lemons\nPenetration made a huge differences ability to kick and make plays\nUm and you know um we don't have a lot of high volume three point shooters in that group um or even in um you know some of our other groups that we've played but\nI'm Will go back and we'll look at whether or not those were good shots or not but it's just it's more of a ... it was more of a lack of\nLack of work to get a good look and I think that sometimes when you don't work like that at the ball doesn't go in so I you know we're not as good as advertised right now and so at least we know that at least we know that one weekend\nLike human rights\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood what born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason unbeatable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto job\nSeeing that there and veteran mode and\nI think we even addressed here on the Russia oh WPRI about veteran mode and when are these guys get a kick in in the gear and right now Brad Stevens was like what he sees and that is that proverbial wake up call okay I'm done jak and around with you jokers it's viewed actually started to play some basketball\nAnd there's one more preseason game left I Do believe are I think it may even be against Cleveland again let's see if I can jump on them to find the next yeah Saturday they play in Cleveland\nOr we'll see what the uh we'll see what the performance is like\nA by the way
