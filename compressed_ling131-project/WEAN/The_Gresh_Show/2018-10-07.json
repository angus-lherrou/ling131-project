[noise]\nFrom eye witness news this is newsmakers [noise]\nSure you probably know who's on the ballot for governor but are you ready for the ballot question this week what you need to know about the question to asking\nVoters to decide on Seventy million dollars and borrowing for infrastructure improvements at the University of Rhode Island in Rhode Island college this weekend newsmakers the president of you are I Dr David ... and the president of Rick Frank Sanchez [noise]\nWelcome to newsmakers armed Tim white Ted needs the is off this week Dr David duly Frank Sanchez thank you very much for joining us on the program this week we appreciate it and I want to dive right into question to Dr Daley we're going to start with you because I'm the largest chunk of money for question too would go to your eyes so\nJust help the people at home understand if approved what would question do\nFor your institution question too would do a number of things for the University of Rhode Island\nBut the most important thing that will do is dramatically I think\nImprove the facilities at our Narragansett Bay campus where the graduate school of oceanography has housed\nUm those facilities a need to be modernized and upgraded to maintain our status as more of the world's leading oceanographic uh and and coastal in marine science uh educational and research centers in the world\nAnd question too would provide forty five million dollars to go towards those facilities that will build a new ocean technology Center for research and teaching around all the technologies that go into the oceans ranging from wind farms do undersea vehicles\nIt will create um marine operation center to support a work at sea and uh and critically it'll provide a new doc for brand new research vessel at the University of Rhode Island will receive from the national Science Foundation and not twenty Twenty one\nAnd our current doc which ah is home to the endeavor is too small so we need a larger one more sophisticated one to house this new next generation research that\nI have a question specific to that um it as you point out you've got to build a new peer for this one hundred million dollar vessel that you or I was the was awarded it's very exciting\nBut what happens if and I I Know your your hands will be no we're going to get a question to pass what if it doesn't pass and um that you don't have the money to build appeared you'll lose the vessel\nThat's a question that I don't want to you guys are [laughter] I didn't really have an answer because um [noise] the national competition\nA selected the University of Rhode Island to to lead a consortium or on the Atlantic coast for a vessel to operate on the east coast primarily in the waters around uh the\nThe Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common there are all in for Steve freedom of religion or against us that's right over two hundred for your own cars all make all models and incredible Russia's move on to John John now\nTwo I think the future of Rhode Island what we would have to do and those kinds of cases is look for alternative places to port the ship\nOkay ... or the president Sanchez\nQuestion to a ... it's Seventy million dollars is the total amount on the table for voters to consider forty five million would go to your eyes the balance to Rhode Island college what would it do for your institution but it\nHad a huge impact that Ronan college but in particular are school of education the twenty five million dollars which is balance allow us to completely modernize Horace Mann which is houses are school of education if you think about it or the man was built nearly fifty\nYears ago and there has not been any major renovation sense and and it's a lot of folks know that training and preparation teachers has changed dramatically over the last ... years in fact\nUh what do we do for us would allow us to build a facility to compliment now an entirely re imagined curriculum in our school of education so we spent the last Eighteen months\nReimagining the future of teacher preparation in Rhode Island to our school of education we engage the national GOP leaders of the teacher preparation to the likes of Arizona State university the University of Virginia\nBaylor University some great schools in New York City where they're using new video coaching technology and in the digital technology simulation labs\nAs they prepare teachers for the future and so in the fall of Nineteen we'll be launching this brand new curriculum but we need a facility to help facilitate how we prepare teachers at the future and so this will have a huge impact again as you can imagine for nearly a half a century\nAnd this building has it been touch it needs to be modernized that needs to be upgraded\nSo that we can better prepared teachers in the state I\nTalked to any superintendent in the country and they will tell you there's a shortage particularly with math and science teachers um and we see that Rhode Island by the way my two favorite subjects when I was in school would there be a special focus on those areas as you retool reshape the program would question to money I think there's there's several\nAreas they're going to be a focus certainly math and science and math and national challenge of teacher education you know trying to find great math and science teachers as you know they're getting picked up do any variety of industries so the curriculum needs to be enhanced in that area but that is a national challenge uh for for schools all over the country is\nFinding those teachers were going to kind of provide extra effort to build pipelines in math and science but there are other areas as well that can improve the state certainly we've heard loud and clear from our\nSuperintendent principals and teachers that we need more teachers that are trained in English language learning\nProvince just good things of either the department of justice\nYeah that's a ... a key allow special education fact if you talk to the superintendent schools in in Providence they would say they need a thousand ... teachers today\nUnless we make that into the curriculum and read it as a ... and that our our redesigned is actually can respond to that any student who graduate from the Rhode Island college school of education program in bed and in their degree will be an endorsement\nAnd email out for an endorsement in special education ah for us to meet the needs of our school districts across the state we have to\nBuild a better pipeline and that's what we've been doing for the last Eighteen months again engaging some of the real top leaders nationally but also making sure we're engaging our teachers\nOur principles and our superintendents across the state and they have provided tremendous feedback to help shape a strategic plan and this is a curriculum\n... are you worried about sticker shock when it comes to question to and here's what I mean by that\nVoters are going to go into the polling locations Sylvia question one there and a lot of the words no what question was all about that's two hundred and fifty million dollars to repair or replace K. through twelve public schools in Rhode Island then question too will have Seventy million dollars on it are you worried that is a lot to ask voters\nWe're always a\nThoughtful about the magnitude of our request and and we are I'm mildly concerned about the possibility of what you might call sticker shock on the part of voters going into the end of the booze and being confronted by a two hundred and fifty million dollar question one\nAbsolutely necessary were were Broadway supportive about initiatives I say it's overdue which is one of the reasons it's it's such a magnitude of Rhode Island is not systematically invested in that for a long time\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood born in East Village and there were against it of the best financed region unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a Ford's also models interest free log on to a job\nAh institutions have had to\nFace the uh the costs of offering those that education to undergraduates by raising the cost to the students themselves and that's been another decades long trend has been the increase over time of tuition to attend public institutions and\nUnfortunately with the current economic climate that we see we don't see a lot of um new changes that Rhode Island has done an excellent job of re investing in public higher education as you may remember in the beginning of the the last great recession\nUm stay Rhode Island over about a twenty four month period to\nTwenty five million dollars out of the U. R. I. budget we still don't have all that back in twenty Nineteen so more than a decade later we have less money now\nFrom the state to support undergraduate education at the University of Rhode Island and all the other essential things that we do then we had in two thousand and seven and you have a decade worth of inflation and other kinds of costs built on top of that so that's ... what do you do\nSo I think I think a doctor to lease absolutely right we have to look at how we finance higher education in the state but also I think colleges are having to become much more innovative\nAnd much more thoughtful about how they use their existing resources and hadn't keep college expenses down a couple of examples that Rhode Island college you know this year were twelve hundred students will see open source tips textbooks\nCompletely free textbooks you know today in America I think textbooks costs Constance about nine hundred dollars a year\nOr we've started an open source textbook program where twelve hundred students this fall will\nFree textbooks and this is becoming a strategy that more college and universities are doing we're also looking at how we build differently and and be much more efficient use of our resources this past year we were one of nine schools in the country to become a green ribbon schools\nDesignated because of our sustainability effort and in saving on energy our energy costs and packed all of the next three years when the same about two million dollars a million dollars in energy savings\nWe converted every single life Bob and to Eli the across the campus and a number of efficiency measures and so I I agree with Dr duly we have\nTo look at how we're financing higher ed but ... universities have\nTo become more innovative as well and I know in in Rhode Island over many years college has had to use their resources fewer resources more picked effectively a but there are there is some innovative work we can do as well\nI'm Wondering if um you know a big part of all this is a conversation about endowments and how the universities are funded\nHas there been any impact I'm with President Trump's tax reform bill there's been a lot of talk about that affecting philanthropy have you seen it\nA good question it's it's sort of too early to tell but there's no question that the full answer would be an important part of our future the terrors of Rhode Island we have sort of\nGotten ourselves to to a position where we can claim and they're happy to share the data with you were the most efficient public\nResearch university actually the most efficient research university in terms of what it costs per credit hour taught the University of Rhode Island [noise] from Maryland to me if you ask how much does it costs to teach a credit hours University of Rhode Island\nFor credit out it's less than any other research university an average of ... shall we are we're at a level of efficiency which is hard to improve upon and that's been a another decade worth of work on the part of the institution as Frank was saying\nTo find efficiencies or to to innovate ways to to to be more effective and more efficient\nAnd still we have these these situations so clearly a major component for us going forward will be not only working more closely\nWith the private sector and doing for joining projects together which also creates opportunities for students and revenues for the university but philanthropies\nAnd we're in we're in the early stages of a two hundred and fifty million dollar plus fundraising campaign for the University of Rhode Island that's going very well we raised over sixty million in the in the first year we're confident that we'll we'll hit that goal and a lot of that\nThat will go to scholarship programs non loan based financial aid for students because we know right now that we do not need all the financial needs particularly of Rhode Island students coming to the University of Rhode Island\nAnd that's a major campaign priority for us going forward and it'll be a major focus\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine Vermont that's right one twenty nine Vermont flood of every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nOf free tuition for family members by claiming he was a on leave from Rhode Island college at the time now he's pledged to pay back that money after a port and um the college in the state has reviewed its policies [laughter] what did you learn from the the ... controversy\nSo one of the things I think uh all of higher ed frankly are learned was that there are in this case a policy that needed to be updated and and modernize need to be looked at and and commissioner Dan messy\nI certainly did that you know she brought the schools to gather looked at the policy and there were ways to strengthen that so that that doesn't happen again and again that happened and I I think that that's kind of the lesson learned here ... and certainly in the work we do\nThere are constant developments and evolution whether its policies are programs are curriculum in order to be a current current higher education system we have to constantly review\nThese processes and they may be fine or may have worked fine ten and Twenty years ago\nBut as time change and accountability changes we have to continue to look at these policies both at the system level and state level but certainly at the institutional\nJust one last question on it I should point out these decisions were made before you took that see I'm so when we started asking questions about it we were you surprised or we are already aware that it was going\nOh no I was I was surprised by that or you know I was surprised to some degree because we were already looking at a different institutional policies and practices again just a general assessment\nOf how an institution works you begin to see things yeah you know we probably should tighten that um we probably should or enhance the things that was already underway in fact it continues to be\nAt the institution weren't Hansing protocol and processes and policies to become more efficient to become or frankly accountable to the taxpayer I that's an ongoing process in today's\nA kind of a modern higher education institutions are\nA lot of schools are doing away with the SAT offered mission or either new considering that\nWe look at our criteria every year um we haven't done away with it yet right we find it ... the SAT ACT just to still be useful for us and in guiding admissions uh decisions burden mission staff looks at that we have a fairly holistic approach\nTo admissions which we need because ... every year for the last several years we've\nSet new records for applications were up\nOn twenty four thousand applications now at the University of Rhode Island for about thirty to fifty spots in the freshman class or as we take a holistic approach to that\nUh we look at a variety of things including their high school records a as well as those scores\nOur goal is always the same and that is we want to offer admissions to students that we are confident can be successful\nAnd if there's something in the record that leads to admissions counselors and others to conclude we're not sure that the University of Rhode Island would be a good fit for you right now or you might not be successful here is you need to be to achieve your goals and aspirations\nWere happy to direct them to another institution and another public institution Rhode Island or elsewhere\n[noise] All right we have one minute left in the program we started with question to end with it but specifically on this I I Know I'm kind of speaking out about it but this vessel that is going to be coming to the University of Rhode Island briefly what's your what's your summary of how it's going to be using I think in the first step you said you expect it to be\nOn our shores and twenty Twenty one twenty Twenty one okay so it has a it's a state of the art brand new vessel obviously we'll be begin construction and twenty Nineteen it'll have absolutely fantastic capabilities a range of over five thousand miles\nIt can go anywhere from the Arctic to the Antarctic to the Mediterranean to the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico or wherever research agendas drive drive it it has the capacity to do there and spend a lot of time it's see it's a fantastic asset\nI have an idea for revenue builder just converts half of it into a cruise ship and then start charging ticket you arrive over here it's just rolling in money that that's my idea\nOf listen to Dr Daley first of all congratulations on ten years when the University of Rhode Island is as here ten year anniversary so ah congratulations on that and we'll have you back ten years from now that President Frank Sanchez thank you very much for joining us on the program\nThat's all for us for now hey next week we have a U.S Senate debate in the studio that is October night a Tuesday it's seven o'clock incumbent

in the show we're going to hear from the head of the road island textile innovation network about what's happening in one of the rounds most storied industries that should be interesting but right now we have to continue the conversation with Bob Driscoll yes Lenox director Providence College since two thousand one we're talking about the business of collegiate sports Bob\nAre you talked earlier little you mentioned that that part of your mission right off the top is to have a program where the students succeed academically and where you know we have seen it you know it better than I Do some schools with not only lackluster records on that front but sometimes scandals whether it's cheating or or whatever it is\nUm do you think it's a hindrance that PC places an emphasis on you know getting your students through with a good education when some other places maybe aren't taking out a fiercely\nI think is a distinct advantage I mean the public most people are not happy with when you see what's happening at schools like Ohio State of Maryland where a young man died because they didn't treat him the right way\nI mean really person Forman says about education there are a better chance of being a neurosurgeon ... being a NBA or an NFL player so our focus has to be on\nGraduation in education I'm really happy to say we graduate Ninety two percent of our student athletes which is in the top one percent of the country are regular students graduate at eighty five percent right so are student athletes are actually graduating a higher rate we're not doing our job is education went out ensuring that so winning is important\nBut not at the cost of not graduate student athletes are treating them disrespect for that first and foremost and I think there's a niche for that I mean the due to the world are doing at Providence is doing or don't over everybody in the biggest is doing it\nAnd I think in our day and age we need that more than ever before\nWhat do you think makes the ... what seemed that she was an intervention or a way that you handle balancing 'cause it's I mean I can only imagine what life is life for a PC basketball player who's going to the March Madness or something trying to fill\nThe home and do your algebra or whatever the homework and that night how what do you try to do to make that work to get them to be able to get through will fill a performing at a high level\nWhat starts in the recruiting process most of the you know and then there comes a Providence and basketball they all have dreams of planning the NBA and I tell them all the time my coaches don't have to dreams have a dream of getting your education and if you're fortunate enough to play pro sports\nGood for you but the reality at some point your career is going to be over as an athlete and you're going to make a living off of your education so it starts slowly and the conversation but it's got to be part of the dialogue when you recruit a young man or woman\nThen you come to Providence and the culture is education for education per se so they buy into it we were surrounded with great academic support and that's a focus on it so\nWe're proud of that and then that's part of the ... so that's the expectation we won't recruit young man that doesn't want to get their degree got like Chris ...\nHow would you like motor treads twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one night I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eighty four to one fifty self destruct for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for not only a plug for it and he joined gyms it\nWhen when you have when you get into the national ... tournament has been has been happening for Providence College does that do you see a bump in overall admissions in Korean kid them lying ... very much including non athletes because they just you know the amount of attention in school gets by getting into one of those tournaments that spillover factor\nYeah there's a complete correlation are admission numbers that are at an all time high and you can look all the way back to Boston College with what they used to call the flu effect\nWhen they won that Orange Bowl it went off the charts have you been doing over if they were getting Fifteen thousand applications a year there were up over forty thousand now because of two national championship every single one of our games on national television and when you make of the NCAA tournament\nGets a big deal there are a lot of eyeballs on and so there's no question the correlation between having success in sport and your national profile and general student population changes\nWhat do you think about the debate over paying college players comes up a lot you cared a lot you hear arguments on all sides what what what are your thoughts today on that that discussion\nI think if you did that you'd have to cut\nMost of your programs there's only one sport that province scholars that makes money and that's basketball at other schools it might be basketball football that's it so you had to start paying those you'd get down to the minimum so it would take away opportunities for a lot of young men and women's programs\nYou know we give them what's called the cost of attendance so every every year we're allowed to give our student athletes an additional thirty five\nHundred dollars but if you think about the student athlete Providence College\nJust the tuition admissions along plus travel well over a hundred thousand dollars that they're traveling on charter planes are reading good meals so you know in the general population a family of four is average incomes what forty thousand dollars a year so the student athletes getting a hundred thousand dollars worth of by\nPretty good that's pretty good payday so should we give them more probably but I think you you you put the college sports as we know it out of business if you started paying everybody\nSo you've been at the things we talked to two thousand and one when you look ahead now you've made all these new facilities or do you have coaches are a long ten years who who've been getting to build the romance themselves when you look outward from we're sitting here and fall twenty Eighteen what are you enthusiastic about what do you think the next challenge on the horizon\nOther things you asked that I have great leadership from the trustees to my president to my coaches so we've got a culture of success right now\nThe threats for us obviously we we get a lot of money from Fox to televise are games\nThe next generation or that contract negotiation because young people are ... they're not watching games as much the numbers are going down whether you can make that kind of money\nAnd also the issues um relative to what's going to happen with um the national profiling sports they're looking at what's happening with basketball right now they've got an investigation and and it turns out there's more negativity around that does that mean more or less people would watch the games\nAnd then the stock market right it's an all time high\nOur donors used to be able to write off their tickets if they've got great tickets they can't do that anymore we haven't seen a drop off but in the stock market goes down we're going to be able to raise the kind of money because people are going to have the same kind of resources but I just stay focused on the day do the best I can today and I think the future will take care of itself\nI think that's much better than I guarantee at six in a row I made it a little nervous but trust me we were all this again next next thing we see what happens if there's a bank so much for joining me when we come back we're going to talk to the head of the riling textile innovation network

all yes of course okay\nNow I'm the old rule did have an e stringer same problems\nNot really now is your home shady uh yeah that's some shade or in front of the house yeah you get more strict on the front of that I\nJust noticed that in the front of a little bit right right like above the entrance of the door you know ... but I got a a by shape how a ... type of show\nOne in thinking here is that typically the area where the roof rafter touches the roof sheeting right where the would basically isn't solid contact\nThat's a cooler spots in the area to the right and left of it so sometimes when we get these stripes on the roof it's a condition called ghost thing\nAnd it's because you get more condensation are in those areas that are cold in the areas that are warms the left and right and then now also on the shady side of the house or wherever you have shade you're also much more likely to pick up a little algae or like in March and that can also cause standing on the roof\nSo before we jump to conclusions what I Would suggest you do is use to take a very simple approach\nIs a roof clear out there that's called spray and forget\nIt's available and ready to use bottled you basically just snap a hose and a garden hose onto and then you can spray the roof down\nAnd just kind of walk away and see what happens I actually haven't had an extremely dirty shed roof that has so much moss on it and it was crazy 'cause it just hadn't done anything wrong time so so last summer when I was\nPainting the fence and doing the repairs outside of decided that we take care of that and I got the springs forget and I put it on once and then I walked away for about a month knows that homes all it was going to put it on one more time and it's like perfectly clean then put it down doesn't happen instantly because basically what it doesn't stop the growth performing\nThink of it in a sort of a weed killer for the moss\nAnd it brightens the roof and then there's a residual and stays on it and kind of protection of long also I Would try or products like that it's very simple fairly inexpensive and see if that doesn't pay and then if it does and you kind of know what you're dealing with\nUm one natural thing that you can do to ... though that group down to teach me try to get a little more sunlight on that area sometimes I've told folks a traumatic trees and and that's

plus they're specifically trained on where to put the insecticide how much deployed\nAnd also the insecticides that they are very specific and they remove only insects that they're supposed to remove and they don't remove the beneficial insects that you want to leave behind so if you're having that much of an infestation\nI Would stop shopping round pesticide and call a pro and have them treat the
