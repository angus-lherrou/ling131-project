because he did exercise those demons shown was just a matter of time with David Price or was everyone legitimate in who's on this guy because he didn't pick like a number one sort or in the postseason

a little heavy handed to me you know it wasn't as if people were making up the fact that your pitch poorly in in the play offs\nUm it wasn't as if this was you know a big water to starts in didn't get a with that this was over a number of years with a number of different ... and the result was always say that while there were a couple of instances where pitch well enough to where they got those decisions\nCould have any are re as a starter well over five so this was hardly some fluke um but he\nChose to you know now I have all you have the cards and you play them well but now I have them seemed a little town of much to me but you know everyone response to that sort of situation a little differently\nSteve Pearce was amazing in the world series\nWere you surprised he was the world

you know are a normal spots in terms of this show airing I regret to inform you that Perry's picks will be on friday this week\nAnd all I can say about that is a\nAnd let me tell you something to

personal war chests ladies and gentlemen but I'm gonna I'm gonna call a spade a spade should be able to satisfy our friend orbits Russell bird shouldn't be able to slide this back\nOne day a and we had to consult bags among men because that's normally his picks day on this and\nI mean all back home and does this get winners and not nearly as entertaining as Mr football\nNow that is true and I I mean I Can't deny that you're right you mean you send people to pay when the almighty God by the way our message from Perry and he gave me the whole after the\nPatriots game and the way they're playing a stabbing to me it's disturbing\nAh I'm like come on man really a millionaire point with one arm tied behind their back map and disturbing\nMade money ah well you may with Perry who went in for a couple ... [laughter] something he went three and three last week yeah All right so I think I got that all out of the way tomorrow night six to seven in\nThe ... cruelly coaches show that's going to be out in Warwick there will be catered it will be food from seven to eight the Gruber new tore old debate\nAh through our friends and NBC ten and then me and roots in our normal whatnot uh eight to nine tomorrow with our friend Albert breeder and Perry's picks will be pushed to friday\nTo make sure that they're prominently featured as they should be by the way\nHey it's the demands of the people we listen to the people and I'm going to make sure that everybody can consume their Perry's picks so now we got that out of away on Sunday night hearing WPRI oh we've got patriots football coming your way\nAnd you know as a sports guy\nI can get aggravated at the narrative that ESPN and others are already pushing out there you know it's all Brady all Rogers there's nobody else employees and those two guys it's just\nThose two battling against each other and\nToday is uh ability herds worth as rich as coined him his name one of the many funny rich names that he has come up with a mile or so

com\nOr get if all of a sudden GDP walked in one day that'd be a good segue Roberts is moving out going to have a room open in the basement he listened Josh Jordan borrowed one of his old outfits from Saturday Night main event to buffalo certainly did a\nSo of course ballot check was asked the question about playing against Tom Brady and it was all mixed into some question with Aaron Rodgers and well here's what ensued\nSo I've never played against operating so I'm Glad it's our quarter back he's a great quarterback\nWe stopped that for a second I've never played against him how great is that by the way nothing that is the nicest way right max ... yeah and that is the nicest way he can tell someone that is a dumb question not shut up more on [laughter]\nQuarterback I mean he's no map Patricia who will get to a little bit later on but nevertheless\nPatricia you can train and they didn't get it all but yeah we'll get to that it took to the training but yeah here's a here's here's the Yoda of that situation\nSo I've never played against operating so I'm Glad he's our quarter back he's a great quarterback um [noise] this is one a lot of games for ... on a lot more than ...\nOther play against hungry so such a different context outside playing against their Rogers is very very difficult you know he's he's as good as anybody that us as\nWe faced a lot of good ones for years and that's about to take anything away from anybody else on the Senate does a great player he can he can do everything that a quarterback needs to do\nConsistently doesn't well first of all the touchdowns ... like a ton of yards after he gets on the ball on the part of the others and given the ball in space on their own so they can continue to the game positive yard that for the cat she doesn't make them work for the ball\nIt gets out of some plays a\nVery few guys can get out of its got tremendous person down the field so maybe once again he leads a league in touchdowns interceptions it leads the league and big plays\nStone I don't know however many long passes the how many different receivers and saw one guy so [noise]\nYou know he's he's great butter\nAnd don't be fooled by the Green Bay Packers record sitting there three three and one\nThis is not a bad football team they dealt with some injuries they've had some tough losses mean when you look at them and the regular season this year you know they beat the bears by one may tied the Vikings\nThey had what I thought was kind of split couple last at the red skins but you know don't want now the Redskins are five and two for what it's worth I think they saw\nNot to mention revisit that bears game now I mean I Know we all said the same thing with the bears are actually a decent team that up that world leaders but when we looked at that game originally was what what's wrong with Green Bay and now it's sort of like okay and the game we talked about this Sunday aggression so\nGreen Bay could easily be for two and one with the best road when in the NFL this year was apartheid Montgomery I Do in him as very said so yeah I mean\nI'm not saying that I expect Green Bay necessarily to come in here and pop the patriots but you're right there are three three and one record is deceiving they still can't defend to save their lives and they they are still more or less the Aaron Rodgers show but that being said there still are going to be a formidable opponent in that three three and one yeah it's not entirely representative\nIf you make mistakes against Green Bay or they will come back to bite you in a big way and you know I I Know it's very tried to say well don't turn on the ball over well against Green Bay or you're making it much easier for them to hang around because as rich mentioned and I I Do subscribe to this theory\nThat the patriots are the better team\nA and I do think across the board they do have more talent but I think the way Green Bay is built\nCan be problematic for New England in that they've got a really good young quarter inch year Alexander\nThey've got some people that can cover they've got the big past Russia and claimed Matthews may do find ways to get to the quarterback they're not afraid the blitz employment coverage you know one on the other side I mean look how many times have we sat here and been like well ... he gets the ball last\nThat's not the

Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free on condition at what board and he's written a generic ends it that's right over two hundred\nThree on cars all makes all models and incredible prices log on to flood auto John job now\nI've been Ninety I Know you've only got a couple of these last ah who do you have a coming over from the from the boys are I'm sure you got to uh you know get as many seniors in as you can hear over the next couple of weeks\nYeah we do a little of both we try to strike then we're going to get the low but it you it'll be are starting to look back on the blind side Dr a chat room what stories do we stop or but he's done an outstanding job are left back\nAnd we'll go with the Russian linebacker uh Jason arrows to play a lot of football or in his freshman year\nI don't have a lot of heat with them but clearly I piss someone out there a long time ago they've since left and now they're just doing a lot of things differently and I can't go on their shows to them doing this [noise]\nUm but what they did up there right they've got three channels actually for under their umbrella it's the sports network NBC Sports Boston it's the Boston NBC channel ten different\nThan our channel ten down here and then they have neck in any CNN\nAnd then they have that don't want to know most of them so they consolidated resources and they put all of these people along the parade route okay\nPlease if you're a news director and you're listening to the show and I know a couple in this city\nDo please God Almighty ... start with this right fine the people\nWho work in your news operation that knows whether a bowl is puff or stuff or wild like let's start there right when you put ... me who is normally on in the a block\nGoing out and doing the hard hitting news and you put them with someone at the parade who has no idea of what's going on right like a total and cat\n... had arrived lanes try that guy had some working knowledge fair but as soon as I flipped it on and I heard\nOne of these people from the Boston NBC channel ten say while steep\nPrices had a great I wanted to put my foot to my television like this is a total media rant on going on right now\nAh and then I heard another person do the same thing and like some of those people are my friends I you know what Susan trainer works up there I the Susan trends are really nice person you can't put her on a parade route\nYou can't put people like that on there and some of the sports people getting mixed in there as well Jesus died\nI saw one guy who I think might have done stuff for any CNN who was like jumping up and down the drop kick Murphy's were playing on a float behind them that's not anti drop kick Murphy which you are it's the perfect meal I don't like\nOne of their song [laughter] gets bastard die that you have all those other album though you're you're ...\nBut this guy was literally like he's all I'm standing up and sees almost like [laughter] they draw the line with us like jumping up and down and I'm thinking to myself oh my God these people have never covered this before\nAnd I'm Sorry\nNews directors like I'm I I'm Sorry but when you're doing like the post game stuff and you're doing 'em and you're doing with the sports coverage like that\nThere's nothing worse than man or woman on the street there's nothing worse it it it it doesn't even compare\nOn that NBC Sports Boston coverage one of the people one of the girls there I don't know Jessica Quebec blow I've no idea what her name was she looked like she was probably twenty eight years old\nEven any twenty eight to thirty range covering the first parade and it's the perverse and this happens everywhere so don't act like it doesn't happen to your news station\nHow would you like motorists twenty gene trucks with the here for only one I mean I Will say hello to port boards twenty eighty four was the best for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars from us only at fought for it and he went into a narrative it\nThey'd come to me and I said the word da you cheer like crazy\nOh\nEven the non\nDie hard sports fans hate that stuff\nThey they can't stand it oh here I'm going to go to a bunch of millennial jak why games standing near a a barrier who are going to throw stuff in the air and yellow Yankees suck\nReady I'm coming to you in three two one they snap your fingers behind them and the people go crazy and it looks like oh they're really partying oh Gees Scott that's another one to artwork partying twenty five thousand times everywhere I mean on almost every channel I at least once\nHeard the word party there partying\nNo no no they spent three hundred thousand dollars on booze in LA that's partying really moved up yeah they were really little up not riding around on the duck boats with all I don't know their wives and kids and like they're not out there\nAnd I don't want to sound anti parade but golly became the coverage of bowl at some level like again I Know sports especially down here I Know sports departments don't have a bunch of people how you're listening\nTo the sports apartment here present mayor goes All right so we did parade coverage I Would just say you know what\nI'll help coordinated and where you're like let route should I be the anchors of it and let us do a lot of the talking and then just let us throw to certain people and they do their thing but see the problem is and here we go we're really pull back the curtain now the problem is\nAll these places want to do with his cheapest possible and they have to placate Mr and Mrs anchor\nBecause by the author on the anchor and oh I should be a third part roads because armor it's like Ron Burgundy Amazon and ...\nAnd you can be there and they don't know nothing and good lord\nDid that stand out today\nLike it's great to cover these events and I understand it but I don't understand why\nLike people who put this coverage put these coverages together don't approach it like a football coach\nThere are certain things people can and can't do don't put them in a position to look stupid or do to them with something very specific but you know is going to be a part of the coverage\nThat doesn't make your people get in front of a camera and sound like they're ... they're tripping all over their words or those heart surgery right yeah you're exactly right bell jak you're exactly right\nI'm surprised that they the people didn't get David Price and Steve Pearce completely wrong all day\nAnd I heard a Pete per drawl yeah that was one today he ... he ... ... and um [noise] ah\nThere was one guy and I'll leave the channel out of it there was one guy is a part of the Boston coverage\nRoom when who mentioned while there's much I'll fond of eat what\nMy downfall is like one of the two percent owners of the red Sox from the I'll find family up in Maine and those people get on get in a in a duck boat like this okay and let me just mention this right\n'cause I defend my boys oh who he he liked calls the games like him and so she should be on the boat\nAnd if you're an embedded part of the media where you're working on a story\nAnd your on a boat with certain people and you're talking to say David Price the whole time and you're doing a story on it that's\nFine that's journalism when you're out there grandstanding because you work for a website where you worked for an entity that either paid or bullied your way\nOn to one of the duck boats and your celebrating it like you pitched the final out of the world series I got a problem with that\nThat just screams ass hat and jak wagon\nIt's awful\nWhat auto group once your car any make any model what pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nRight like if you got Tom Karen on there and you get Jerry Remy who's sick and they've got a\nA microphone and now one of these backpacks that that everybody carries around now\n\nLike that's okay there the red Sox station what gets weird but I write it's fine\nBut when you see people from websites or a hey I worked at the station and are strong on my way on a one of these boats or something like that I mean come on man\nChrist I spent ten years on the patriots radio network for crying out loud and even though I didn't get on one of those\nIt just it just follows me how suppose the experience to", "show_name": "The Gresh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "31"}
