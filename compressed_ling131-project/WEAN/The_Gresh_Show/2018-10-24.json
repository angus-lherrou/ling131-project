line and ... was nowhere to be found David David ... was out there at first base trying to corral it and they had no idea\nThat was the old uh let me see if we didn't get over there enough for us to play the ... and it would've been good if they collided into each\nOther and then we would have been solved it certainly looks like that that was incompetence on the part of the Dodgers are they actually are dealing with some pretty decent weather up there in Boston I'm probably little can call them a little from Columbia yeah and down that right field line that looked like there was some standing water kind of in the in the corner there\nSo it's not like it is the driest the places that water actually had to pay ... five hundred dollars to be in the park tonight\nYeah I can only uh uh what was the going average I mean I I'll be the first one to admit I Am because there's no way it goes to the show\nAnd I know this morning that standing room only tickets were going for close to five hundred bucks [noise] well\nIt's not terrible\nOr you'd have to pay me close to that amount to stand for four hours and whether like this World Series or not yeah but you know what do you if\nYou're if you're coy about it I mean you can move around it some concessions on around them that's not my problem is the you know you look at the last time I went to a Red Sox game I got like four rose from the field third base dug out from a friend of my father in law so uh it's not like I\nDon't see each other whether like yeah I that's the problem then maybe we could talk about something but rain for hours and living where I live and to get into Boston that's always a huge\nHassle yeah that is true and it's never just as easy as I can get on one train now get there never I've got to like transferred different places and monkey rip torn up the middle right over the head of quake Kirsch law for bass said that was a a battle for her shower right there\nAnd a Milky ribs say lead off single and now the game begins to stolen bases don't matter allegedly until you get into a spotlight this where Clinton curse jaws get a pat hell of a lot of attention to murky beds and make sure that the old ... man\nAnd he stole second in the fall when the center he didn't have a chance to advance and Andrew better than tend to eat shopped at that high pitch like it was would\nHe really didn't need to protect ... try to raise on or something well I Know they did I and I don't know if that was bending tend to just trying to protect him to sort of get in the way the catcher 'cause that was a hot fast ball\n... he was looking in so it makes me think that it was a a legit hit and run with the pitch was nowhere in the neighborhood\nHere's the thing they'll crash about stolen bases I Know you're half joking but mostly you're not joking about hating on his dad nerds us stealing bases is a risk reward play yeah strictly\n... it's almost worthless to make those risks during the regular season that's why standards like myself say that because the sample size during the regular season is huge and so you can tell whether or not something that's worth doing but when is a great time to take a risk\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln and Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nAnd we don't have a problem with that uh we Staten nerds it oh okay yeah it's just we don't like the teams to run wild during the regular season or really at all because again the risk world ward isn't usually there for a game and may against the Tampa Bay rays\nWell Andrew intend to rip sworn to right field Mickey bets a score from second betting\nWith some a smart base running he ends up making it to second and right now the red Sox have one up\nAnd lead guy the series is all of a start spreading the news in warm up the\nAnd uh after the game Brad Stevens obviously disappointed in his crew his chat with Abby chin\nUm we we were little rushed in our executions to get to it but I thought that obviously you get to look at the number two really good church that was the best often so we we play men that's encouraging our defensively [noise] we've got to get better was that a lot of room to work [noise]\nUm [noise] I've said from day one we're not as good as everybody thinks we are so [noise] um that's that's just another reminder how much work\nHow might again I knew I knew it I Know we're not gonna\nWork work work work work work work work\nI Love it look\nWe mentioned this the other day how many teams in\nThe NFL or major league baseball or hockey where you see a pretty often how many times do you see a team swooping win a championship and then the next year not be able to maintain a commensurate level of play\nThere would signify the euro world champion from the year before eagles Philadelphia is going through right now you're exactly right rich\nI mean look at the same they won a world championship than what we've seen this time and time again the true great coaches\nAre the ones who have the ability to continue to get their team to grow after\nUnbelievable success is Bill Bill and check a legend forgetting the patriots to eight Super Bowls\nOr is he a legend because they won five of them and he finds a way\nTo get guys like Tom Brady and ... you know women and Rob Gronkowski and Dante high tower he has the ability to get these guys to continue to push to a championship level every year and that's a Brad Stevens is trying to do with the Celtics and by the way\nThis is just the beginning I really think this is the beginning of Brad Stevens two point oh because this team for this team is supposed to be elite in the NBA\nFor the next four to five years then how hard is Brad Stevens gonna have to work to keep them working hard on the ball and making sure that they're doing everything they need to do to be successful come playoff time I give Steve ... a lot of credit and\nI Do think he coaches a team was great leadership\nAnd there are together which normally doesn't happen in the NBA but\nThat guy is a fantastic coach because he finds ways to get people who have achieved a very high level of success to continue to push themselves\nNow speaking of that\nAnd I didn't get to hear this last night but I tweeted out\nThe monkey bats had on the Bugs Bunny ... last night\nWhile at the Celtics game\nAbby ... got a chance to catch up with ... I'm sure there'll be some World Series references and they're not knowing that after an ending they'd be up to nothing\nAnd joined by the time all of that movie that\nYou've\nNever lacked\nThe average home you're doing anything\nI enjoyed it I Would have\nTo be here that are out\nThere they're not here yet we know what's a\nGood thing though there will be ah [noise]\nHow would you like motor trench twenty gene trucks with the here for only one I mean I Will say hello to port boards twenty eighty four to one fifty ... for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars from us only a plug for it and he went into a new Oregon but\n\nI mean what are you hearing I'm hanging in there\nAnd really all [noise]\nThey're they have every way\nEvery forty degrees\nLike the way\nYou know it's guy guy\nVery broad power there by a three and a half hour they\nJump up to nothing right now it's a top of the second book Chris sales back out there just to twenty six pitch\nAnd uh we would keep you updated and of course tomorrow I Will be on the morning show with gene at eight ten I Do believe it is run around their mouth are breaking down a World Series game number one Fenway Park\nThat's right proud Fenway awkward it's hard to just facts\nAs we a pivot\nTo Patrick Peter's on the phone bill you could probably well that's a lot of it right there bill talking about baseball we're going from one thing to the you know maybe [laughter]\n\nSo a bright McFadden is making the media rounds speaking on behalf of his cousin yeah yeah I'd rather cousins Patrick Peterson a he still maintains that the three teams who are all grist\nSimply uh-huh going after Patrick Peterson or the saints the eagles and the patriots now I Would say that the saints\nAre out there no longer aggressively pursuing they they got you why apple from the giants I Wonder if his mom gets to go to reveal SPN will continue to shovel her on a house yeah probably\nSure um\nW W ELL down there in New Orleans will be all over that I think that's where they are\nAnyway\nPatrick Peterson as we chronicled is signed through the rest of this season and two more seasons\nThere after getting their GM said to be stupid of them to you know get rid of Patrick Peterson which means is is treated eminent ... yeah I I agree with you there trying to drive up the price\nAnd if it's between the patriots in the eagles who is going to blink because I Am firmly convinced\nThat if the New England patriots made them move for Patrick Peterson they would turn the contract into one that they essentially would've given a first round pick if they give up the first round pick so again Peterson the sign for two more years after this\nIf you're the patriots you'd love to get his cap numbers to under ten million dollars now the salary for Patrick Peterson would be the pro rated remaining of eleven million this year than it's eleven million next season and then twelve million\nSo let's say the patriots trade high level currency for this player which by the way they should do\nThis is among the handful of players were the patriots should blink and give up a first round pick and a sweetener if necessary\nNow that said if they get Patrick Peterson\nHe signed into each Thirty years old and you could see it now\nPatron trade for Patrick Peterson redo the contract at two more years to it give him a signing bonus and lower those cap numbers down and make it work for the patriots even if it's just one more year\nThat'd be three and a half years of Patrick Peterson until he turns thirty two and with hidden in the free agency I Would that now or is that worth sacrificing a first round pick you bet your house it is the way the game is going unique corners you not only can cover but can play the run\nAnd that is Patrick Pearson think about it it would be Peterson and Gilmore\nOn opposite sides of a formation you know you can do both\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition it was more than ... religion there were against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood all those on job now\nIs now to one Red Sox as Mac camps first home run this postseason well that's a guy's made like a hundred and forty million dollars and it's just had garbage numbers for about five years now that's all right good good work if you can get it he is the anti Patrick Peterson\nLet me ask you about Patrick Peterson so reading ... last name Ben San Miguel beds and they go and he works for the Boston sports journal core ascribe guards are legendary outfit they're hiring a cap experience guys so he thinks he knows what's going on well and the gal wrote a very nice article you head over to Boston for the journal dot com you could see it\nWhen he mentioned graduate that it would probably be the easiest for the patriots forget about you know working signing bonus situation and getting Peterson to take less would be that if they traded Devon ... in order to make room\nFor Patrick Peterson because ... is one of the higher salary members of the secondary and deemed expendable two questions one would you be in favor of train record he if that's what it would take to get Peterson into is there any way in hell that bill bell jak trades Devon McCord\nYeah their condition but it does but but you're also trying to satisfy Fox's well yeah I mean they're bump in the way more conditions on come on you wait a minute you know this as well

been his fifth job if you uh catch my yeah [noise] uh\nCurrent source added any consideration is how Peterson my fit on the patriots events would be quote a waste of time I'm disappointed ... very because\n[noise] there's a couple of things here right so I think this is multi layered number one any use of draft capital for a player like Patrick Peterson\nWould not be viewed as ridiculous however where you can read into it is all Bill Bill check not partying with the first round pick because it wouldn't be a first round pick and probably more Steve Wilkes\nI think is the guy's name but okay I think so ... and our time right Wilton time ... Wilson time they will give away Peterson for a dime hope for the Smothers Brothers it totally does\n[laughter] how do I know who those people are ah because ah The Simpsons there yeah yeah well I was going to say that there might have been I wanted to say there was another Comedy Central show the made fun of them are but anyway [noise]\nUm the habit show any [laughter] sorry [laughter] that's on right after Dave your ma ma right movie what a program um I Wonder if that Dick Kevin shows running on ... you can do I wonder if it's\nRunning on the ... channel I think one of the alternative channels that uh channel ten has is a with like a old TV or\nWhatever they call it now anyway let's get to try to get back to that yeah yeah 'cause I have more did Cabot stuff and I don't want to use it so if if Bill Bill checked did trade that currency no one's going to hold it against and people aren't going to be screaming about a cause for great player\nBut do we didn't read into well you know who's worth might be up the doors soon and\nMaybe that's part of the reason they're not going for it because Bill Bill with checked the GM doesn't want to leave Josh make Daniels or whomever with a whole pile of nothing whenever bell checked decides to walk away from the organization [noise]\nYou know there could be that part of it uh there was a tweak to Stefan Gilmore contract that made you think okay they just free in a cap space or are they freeing up cabs face for move\nSadly my gut feeling tells me they're going to go get some sort of help on defense mhm but\nIt's gonna be the ah find leans basement variety like for example as opposed to\nCensor that right and this is\nSaks Fifth Avenue all the way ... this is Saks Fifth Avenue on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan where are you know you're going to get the highest prices but you're also going to buy the most luxurious\nEmployers in someone like Patrick Peterson hammock are slimmer I Love that cat guy I'm all I Want to get I Want to get a Perry ... me but I don't want him to know yeah that was my idea was it when I don't know a couple of months ago I don't remember these things\nWell so grass if you want to go to filings basement and you're really really keen on getting an Arizona cardinal mhm and uh you know the big lead to pass it is a big lead on to yours truly so here we go apparently\nThose in the know think that the patriots maybe in another card on that would be linebacker Hassan Reddick\nFormer first round pick who's and not really opening a ton of eyes in Arizona but you know the patriots only have whatever it is nine sex or ten sex on the season and you know the new ... there'll be as well it's funny you mentioned that there'll be worth a ...\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition it was more than ... religion there were against it that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood Otto John job now\nMcClellan ... Danny Sheldon et cetera et cetera and read it would be another name on that are on that list of projects if you will he plays a lot in Arizona but again he hasn't exactly\nBeen doing a time and uh the big leads big lead suggests a the patrons could probably sniping for a third round pick which is a pick they got from the Detroit line so food for thought\nYeah and I think that sort of the road that we're going down here you know it sounds like filings basement or or job ... if you will I'm absolutely abba so Lew way cause some good deals with those places I can see them doing that uh and it would make sense at linebacker\n\nI think there might be another guy out\nThere that not on the cardinal I Can't remember if you had mentioned this to me yesterday but I saw being reported\nToday uh-huh it was a good idea was it was probably me\nUh I don't think it is that it's definitely not be generous Django that one's a John no that wasn't me I'm\nHere's what's nuts right so the giants are trying to move on from generation to shake and joins of trying to move on from ... from everyone pretty much except law if they trade\nSquat marketing and branding I Know the story for another time but should treat him for a young quarterback\nOr next year the guy that called jak rabbit generous Jenkins will be Thirty years old with a salary of ten point one five million\nWhich would only be\nEight hundred and fifty thousand dollars less than what Patrick Peterson would make next year yeah and they use that as as some food for thought because when you think someone like ... Jenkins is shopping at filings basement ... it's really the\nBargain bin at Saks Fifth Avenue streets the whole we we had to mark this ground and oh yeah absolutely yeah and it just doesn't\nYou know like that name didn't make a lot of sense now Miguel ... than a Boston sports a journal dot com right but that that that he is a ...\nAt patch cap is Miguel and if you're a path train you don't follow him on the courage you to do so that's very good where he's a and they're really nice guy too and\nHe reminded everyone via Twitter today that second round pick Duke Dawson was eligible\nTo return so once so now's the clock starts ticking and they're Twenty one days now the duped Austin can practice before he would have to be activated now if I've got this right the patriots have three more weeks before the pie week\nAnd normally the by week is one bill\nTo move things around a little bit\nAnd you know like do Dawson I loved him in pre season I liked him coming out of Florida I thought that was a real solid pick\nAnd he's one of those dogs like Jaycee Jackson so there may be in New England they're looking at it and saying you know we're going to go get something to help the defense which do it in the front seven\nKnowing the Duke Dawson might be the guy to be able to come in and not to force us to have to play a lot of air grow now maybe maybe not maybe they'll like roe sizes low longer little lanky you can match up against some different people\nI guess all I'm ... I'm starting to think that as much as we all would have been like a puppy with two Peters when it came to ah getting Patrick Peterson pun intended\nThere maybe they're going to look at it and say man you know what we can do Dawson and let's improve ourselves in another way here and maybe get someone like Lyndon Roberts off the field\nAnd put someone on like a song rhetoric by the way at the bills Monday Night they play the Packers on Sunday night and then it's at the titans\nSome you're thinking about do Dawson being re inserted and maximizing all Twenty one of those days he would be a part of a new fan dangled look on defense maybe\nAfter the by week and if we're to follow the way the bill bill and check normally does business that's probably going to be the likely scenario not all of us having Patrick Peterson land in our laps\nAlthough we'd be walking around hoping the air like quagmire free one that a hundred million after taxes last night I guess bill Koch didn't win a million

adversity and all the injuries that were experience right now and is that\nThere are always great some opportunity and through that opportunity starting to find out a lot about maybe some of the younger guys on your genes ... freshmen and right now at this point in our system we're creating a lot of opportunity\nA freshman to get on the field and show us what they can do so each week it's a it's a new challenge and we just find a way to keep on coaching and to keep these guys motivated when\nA and coach I Know your freshman safety Clayton Peron was the ivy league rookie of the week tell me a little bit about him taken advantage of opportunity\nWell at at Clinton has done a good job we knew that right from the minute he walked in the fall you know a ... just been one of those outstanding get that that really like to watch film like to learn about uh the\nThe the fence that we're trying to run and the different offices these gonna have to defend\nA he's just been outstanding he's a a good size kid that is very physical and he's very intelligent and there's been an outstanding job as a freshman to be able to handle a brand new deep and so I had a great game on Saturday and we expect more of the same as time goes on\nCoaches the eighty seventh meeting brown against Penn Quakers are four\nAnd chew over all but one and two in the ivy what do you see on film when it comes to the Quakers\nWell there there are good football team I think there are struggling often simply\nA defense way very solid very good at a ball we spend that's one of them are always been the thing about the Quakers they've always been outstanding defensively they have a new quarterback this year it's a very good athlete\nI'm you know they lost a great receiver last year and Watson was playing I think right now for a ... a but he's on a roster and\nUm and so the struggle a little bit the kind of find their identity or they can run the football they got two outstanding

trying to keep them getting better\nAnd to not look at the record but to look at the work they're putting in what are some of the ways you have gone about doing that and I know that you told us at the beginning of the year you know you looked at you and said hey I was a part of the problems have you changed up anything in terms of trying to keep these guys focus\nFor what is always a very long college football season\nWell I think we're always trying to look at the positive\nOr in each game sometimes there's not a lot of ... but you try to find them and I think the biggest thing that we found is that this team is really stuck together last year we fell apart and this year they know they're going to depend on each other\nWe know that if we can put together you know a a great game defensively often with special teams that we have an opportunity to win and and so we have a ... one of the things that's happened Andy is that we have a brand new facility we have brand new off the\nBrand new baby and space we have an outstanding steam room you know with surround sound and and do all a screen\nAnd and you know we can go in there and we can teach better we can show or some of the highlights of the game and kind of showing what we're doing well and then work on ... of the things that you know ... we don't want to repeat the same mistakes over and over again\nI told you got your coaches show tomorrow and hope St Pete says seven to eight pm on our sister station am seven Ninety who is joining you this week\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln and Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nAnd our right guard Nicole so we got too often Wyman writers that are going to come in\nThere we go a high pollutant discussion because that's what often some wind men do and I have a funny feeling that uh there may be a discussion or two about the food there it a hoax repeats considering you're bringing big beef or is there is no way they are not walking out of there were some sort of child\nOh it already did they do the show is that dinner and\nBut I think he could be as serviceable somewhere in between wide receiver to and wide receiver three because the cowboys just don't have many other options in that passing off ...\n... talk and fantasy football as he does each and every Wednesday here on the ground show on WNPR oh I I you know a couple of situations and look I Can't lie I've got ... Barclay I've got\nA shady McCauley up in Buffalo and\nOften civil you they're hot messes right now and ... and there's rumblings that the giants could be tearing it all down and maybe you are men and could be going somewhere grandma and those two situations like\nWhat do I do my stock am I going to have to hold on to these running backs and realize that this might be a year that I get sort of the old fantasy Scrooge ...\nThere's just so such a lack of deaths among the running back if you have Barclay you're already head of the game there really aren't that many fantasy running backs I Would rather have over Barclay at this point it it just feels like this question marks with just about everybody\nOr you know Todd girly and cream hunt I think for a couple of guys were put on a another level ... maybe a slight notch below only because mark Ingram his back and started cutting to some of his production but it really it drops off quickly I mean we're talking about with the by week starting\nA there's weeks like this one where Philip Lindsay and to recall when Marlene Mac\nOur guys given their match up and given their opportunities that\nCan be considered are being ones back end or be ones but still are be ones that just isn't that much depth at the running back position\nAnd I think you know sometimes you just gotta sit back and kind of look around your league in and see who else is on other rosters because\nI was kind of having the same feeling like I'm my lined up and I'm like oh my gosh like you know I'm rolling out here with a\nYou know fill up Lindsay and carry on Johnson as my running backs or I'm going to get crushed and then you look at the scoreboard you look at who your opponent has you'll get a preview and all of a sudden it's like whoa I'm ahead of the game here I've got a I've got these guy and he's rolling out a you know maybe a T. J. yelled in or\nYou know somebody like Alex Collins who's really been disappointing to see her I mean even somebody like a monster is a deserves the roster didn't leagues and I think is by we start there could be opportunities for him to play a role in fantasy\nIs this really are I I said let me back it up our bees couple of weeks here in the middle of the season the roughest for fantasy players to have to get through because of all the buys\nYeah it's really going to end up being the next couple of weeks it's a you know this week and we nine and a lot of buys again and week nine or ... it is getting through this couple of weeks there are good office of teams on buys\nI think if you can emerge from week nine to five and four record at worst a then you make a run over the last a portion of the fancy season I mean\nThe real NFL season goes fast enough the fantasy season I mean we're we're well past the uh\nThe midway point in terms of what a regular season it right most regular seasons laughing Thirteen weeks and you play your playoffs and fourteen Fifteen and sixteen so ah\nYeah now's the time to if you're looking at trade you're looking opportunities I'm always looking at acquiring somebody who has a by weaken the river and maybe trading somebody who's got there by week coming up because now you're talking about such a small sample size with time left in the regular season if you have a player that hasn't had his by yet\nYou got to figure that twenty percent of his production right one out of five weeks he's not going to get a chance\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne as over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine per month blood as every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nWhen your fantasy football draft guide here on the ground show on WNPR oh sponsor virus DeVos heating and air conditioning call three five one R. E. S. the rest DeVos\nIs it took a point to where if you have guys on your fantasy team that are playing against the New England patriots that they're an automatic start because the patriots are allowing a lot of yards\nYeah I I wouldn't go so far as the automatic start because uh the patriots are coming up to a point in the schedule here where the facing the bills are they're going to be facing the jets soon uh in November\nI and I get right games are on the way they always seem to be to get right games or the divisional game right now when\nI'm you know I think the thing with the patriots it's twofold right it's the fact that the defense is giving up a lot of pointing yards but at the office can move the ball and put up ... points so you have opposing teams that are in need to stay with the patriots and the patriots are\nI I wouldn't go so far as the label him as quick strike but they certainly are one of faster paced off fences in terms of the number of places that they end up getting off so yeah I think that there's a situation here where\nOr when you're going up your players going up against the patriots ah it it's definitely a plus match up a as it can be considered and\nFantasy are there a couple of teams rambling that you think are going to be sending over the next couple of weeks that if you have players on certain teams\nThat you may feel differently about them say a month from now sort of what we talked about what the patriots does get right games are there ... teams that are ascending where you're like OK that guy that guy that guy they're going to start to perform better in fantasy\nYeah great question grass and I'm looking at cults and I'm looking at browns in that scenario I think when we saw the colds up and Fox or the beginning of this month the roster was so depleted that there was just no continuity there\nUm you know see what you will about the fact that he had to ... an opponent this past week the bills have not been atrocious defensively they they've certainly had some good defensive efforts\nI feel like the Colts now a jak oil back at practice today the tight end that they love so much if you have the oil and ... as the two headed tight and monster TY Hilton who came back this past week scored a couple of touchdowns Marlene Mac\nWasn't healthy to start the season he looks healthy now and was solid against buffalo all of a sudden this coach team you know the patriots got them at the right time when everybody was banged up I feel like this is a team that can be putting up points in the high twenties and low thirties\nAnd all of the aforementioned names are guys you want to be considering rolling out in the fantasy I think with the browns it's a situation where as Mayfield starts to get experience uh everybody's going to benefit I also think there's a little bit of edition by subtraction\nI Know Carlos Hyde had his moments in Cleveland early in the season\nBut I think ... is just the more explosive or Nick Chubb the rookie running back\nSo I think when you put sharp in there and you get experience from a field and you look the team has been putting up points and they haven't been stopping opponents which really is a recipe for fantasy success\nBut I think that maybe owners that we're a little disappointed in what Jarvis Landry has been returning to this point in the season I feel like the arrows pointing up on somebody like that and I especially feel that way about David and joke who the tight end\nWho was ... what are those a flavor of the month of August sleepers yeah a lot of fantasy draft\nAnd disappointed for those of us who might have reached in taking him you know ninth or tenth among fantasy tight end I think he has a legitimate shot because of what I mentioned combined with how many injuries have been to the titan position that joke who is going to be a tough fi fantasy tied in from this\nPoint forward conversely is there a team or Syria where you think they're going to be deemed sending and you may want to look to liquidate some assets\nYeah another great question and the bangles or a team that I've been looking at I just think the over performed that have had a favorable schedule early in the year I mean you're not going to dump a degree but I think it's kind of a\nSo high time with Tyler boy maybe after this week being that they have the buccaneers uh you could certainly see the split up points against the box but then the schedule gets more difficult after that um\nLooking for work our credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood what born in east burn a generic ended up the best financed region unbeatable prices in cars with zero percent eighty Arbor Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto job\nThe ball offensively I think John Brown\nHas certainly a return to value in dense from where he was drafted I she ended up with John Brown on all three of my fantasy rosters and he is somebody I'm trying to shop so I Hope but not many people in my legal listening right now on the [laughter] but uh you\nKnow those are a couple of guys I think on teams have but it may be over with a little bit to this point that the the Arabs could be pointing down a little bit from this point to the end of the season\nGot grand on your fantasy football draft guy dropping the fantasy knowledge
