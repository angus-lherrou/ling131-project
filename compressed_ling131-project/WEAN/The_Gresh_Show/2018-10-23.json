Celtics are on right now in our sister station I Am seven Ninety and uh [noise] well it's a hot point game right now although there's about twenty seconds left and of course the magic and some guy missile lay up\nAnd now with about eleven seconds ago so but you know why this thing down and clear out for a one on one with Jason Tatum there comes the screen to step back Jay he nails and so this thing is probably going to have time let's see here\nHalf court shot ... now but the soap is your only down three ah but intelligence I'm receiving from our ground source is on the other side of the glass yeah it shouldn't be that\nYeah the next person to box out will be the first person to box out and I hear it's Russia we will be a warning that player with a fifty dollar gift certificate to wherever the heck they want to go because nobody boxes out in the NBA which is why on Nick ... Cheech is getting every single\nRebounded well now huh yeah right a very\nFrustrating though I mean [noise] Dennis Rodman might've been the last player to regularly box out in the NBA because he was like ... I weigh a hundred and Fifteen pounds I'm six eight so if I Want to get any of these rebounds or maybe I put my bony button to some people and a\nPush them out the way it's really remarkable crush I mean I I get it I I'm an old purist or whatever I'm really not actual you know you're not allowed at all but your old school I Am a little bit but in terms like\nI'm not asking everybody to be done is Robyn but nobody again not hyperbole no lawyers in the NBA regularly box out right to get rebounds which means and again a lot of people listening maybe some millennials are like what does this boxing out of which you speak\nWhen you walk out the other player usually using your backside and your arms to prevent them from getting the ... I Know it probably looks very strange a lot of millennials crashed probably what\nThat is the phone right there but you write booming writer I don't know what was he put his bombing to them it's an invasion of privacy well but no that's that's a box out camping is very disturbing Perry and uh you know more players and the NBA would do it it wouldn't be so disturbing how 'bout that uh I I Am familiar with\nThe eye and you know what this is something that is playing the Celtics even last year or two it feels like well nobody does your although\nIt doesn't really matter to the Celtics aren't doing it but yet they would be nice if they did they probably get more\nGod no question about it and I mean Orlando just [laughter] there's nobody roster that you're looking at me and why oh yeah I Want that guy you know one of those\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what for Denise religion there were against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices log on to flood Otto John job now\nBoy right now although he doesn't have high upside although Jonathan Isaac\nWho was a big favorite of the ... show a pre draft when it was thought that the Celtics before they traded with the Philadelphia Seventy ... out I was a lot of talk and yeah I wanted that stretch for Jonathan Isaac's three in the Florida State I was one of those people are saying that Marco folks with\nGarbage Oh yes yes ah their leader that parade yeah uh you can't drive to guide number one can't shoot that's correct and that's what the Seventy Sixers did oh and by the way they gave them to pick to take arguably the best player in the draft which is Jason Tatum\nYeah and they would they own up to it you know they know they covered Ruth's trade and all of the uh all of the fall out there afterwards and uh Dave it's been an amazing postseason run for the red Sox they beat the Yankees then they go on to just when three straight against the ash Rosen free in their ballpark\nI Know that I mean it's gotta be tough for you write your call 'em all year long and then all of a sudden boom and it's like wait a minute where's Dave O'Brien I Want to hear his thoughts on this postseason run so Dave you've seen it all what are your takeaways from what you've seen from the old town team and they're run to the world series\nWell it's been a tremendous accomplish what to do what they did you know to that beat the Yankees that's one thing it's a one hundred went team\nBut I thought the Astros were in a different class as far as the red Sox opponents to go in there and frankly whip them three in a row of their own building with a very very comfortable and I think a lot of people thought that was with series might turn in your favor I I think there's ... reaffirmed idi how good this ball club was all season long because\nThere was so much crying about the bullpen and so much crying about kimbrell and clearly he hasn't been the same guy get the postseason\nAnd still they won those games and they wanted them the way that they've done 'em all season long break it up front of the other guy quickly and the starting pitching is pretty darn good and the bullpen spin better than anticipated so\nI you know I'm looking at this Dodgers series the Dodgers were third team in September at one point and I think it's another opponent it on paper right now the red Sox absolutely out class going into the series\nAs you look at the twists and turns up the bullpen has there been anything day that has surprised you either in a player performance that you didn't expect or in the way our score has gone about managing the pieces that he has out of the bullpen\nYeah that that's the one thing in the I'm not surprised at the fact that he has used or cello he's EU's sailors used guys who starters in relief appearances you know I I thought it would do that I anticipated what but the guy who surprised me\nI think from jump street going back to the regular season was Frasier\nI mean we really didn't see that coming that was sort of out of nowhere\nAlex coral will tell you that he liked him in spring training we all know that story by now we called it a lot during the season ... but the fact that you know he did it and now he's asked to do it on the biggest state there is\nThat as surprised me a little bit uh probably more than a little bit I think the fact that he's become a go to guy is it's been a big story for this club\nYeah I'm with you on that that it's the old come out of nowhere and you know I don't know if our core and his sort of\nGiven raise your enough opportunities to where he naturally trusted him or if it was kinda like necessity is the mother of invention hey this guy's pitched well I Need someone I got a plug in any given the opportunity first\nThat's what I think happened I think it was a case of\nOther guys like Matt Barnes or temporary or other guys Scott ... in that role over the course of the season is the season is so damn long I mean so it's bound to happen guys are going to have those peaks and valleys so you should this guy and\nYou remember it through Ninety eight miles an hour in Fort Myers on Saturday afternoon Dylan was watching and all of a sudden you know he's he's a go to guy but he he's a great story because he he wasn't even pitching in the in the major leagues in Japan he was in the the freaking minor leagues\nAnd you talk about pulling one right out of that that a stack that that's an amazing story but you know I think the starting pitching and obviously what price did if he continues to throw like that\nI don't think there's another club on on the planet right now they can hang with the red Sox because if\nIf sale pitching long rest like this is going to be as effective as they think and prices found Ninety four Ninety five along with that change up made right out of the gate the Dodgers are going to be in deep trouble\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... that's how\nTwo miles an hour and I still have that ... all of that incredibly funky delivery I think the red Sox will pick up on that but it might take an ending or two in game one before the gates that deliver\nMessage Dave O'Brien with me here breaking out in the world series on the ground show on WNPR oh uh Dave in terms of the bullpen now ... what is your read on Craig kimbrell at this point is he just is is just what he is he's going to\nAll of us freaked out maybe have heart attacks every once in a while do you think there's just a lotta years there and not that these may be coming to the end but he's coming to the end of being one of those the lead lights out just kind of shutdown guys which I read on kimbrell because I Know a lot of fans are very split on him\nYeah and I'm I'm with you because I'm On the edge of my seat I'm having a heart attack like everybody else because\nI'll tell you this it's easier to do the games it's easier to broadcast the games than than to sit like everyone has to do and watch because look at somebody said it was you know several of his teammates or maybe he was chipping in and thought he was tipping is pitchers in the Astros serious but\nHe was walking people and his is you know propensity to walk people really started in the second half started after the all star break so that continues to be troublesome to me you might be right\nThat that's a position that here's a guy who has thrown a lot of ... at his age he's thrown a ton of innings he's doing a lot of Ninety nine mile an hour fast balls in his career maybe he is starting on the downside of that but\nI still think he has great performances left in him and I don't know if I Would have felt that way and not just the way he did in game five I thought he looked really good and game thought that was a long flight all of the one who tracked it then it said he ran down I Know but at the end of the day he locked it up\nAnd the guy does have five saves in the postseason they have all been right on the CD your pants pretty much but I mean at the same time you feel like\nYou feel like he's going to get it back 'cause he's still throwing a hundred miles an hour east bouncing too many Kurt alls I still believe he's going to get back to do something closer to what we were used to maybe he's never going to be a like a guy anymore but I still think he's got some bullets in that chamber\nDave as I look at Chris Sale right and you know Boston if you if your blood and guts you play her\nYou play well while you're hurt you get a ton of love\nAnd then there's the whole but if you're not performing and we don't trust Shia\nThen there's no way we can lobby and I think that might be the David Price category but relative to Chris Sale he I think he joked around about the whole infection from the belly button rang he was in the hospital there is a photo today where he's got ... giant red thing on his elbow\nWaters off with Chris Sale at this point like Dave I really wonder what this guy is going through just to get out on the mound in these situations\nYeah he's got a little goofy has an immune to it at a time that maybe you wouldn't expect Griselda ... now the one thing I Will say is maybe this is a great thought\nThat he uses Lucy Lucy is you've ever seen him because he is as intense as all get out certainly every fifth day but you know he does have this other side of of him he does have a playful side of him and I think maybe\nHe just wanted to bring that out a little bit now I'm with you you know I grew up here I was raised here I just want them to go out and throw a hundred miles an hour strike everybody out and laugh about it later you know then then let's go for around a little bit\nI get it it is the world series but at the same time you know this part of me that thinks Chris Sale is just really enjoying the ... being in the world series for the first time and he's having a lot of fun with it and enjoying it now we'll see what he's got tomorrow night I mean Chris Sale at Ninety five would that slider is probably going to be good enough\nTo compete and beat the Dodgers but I'd like to see Ninety seven Ninety eight again I Want to see the ... version of him\nAnd he's going to have nine days now a nine day great that's a whether he was in the hospital or not for a stomach him and he still should be really fresh and really short so I'm dying to see what he hits the gun at right away because\nTo me unlike a lot of other guys like with poor cello and even Christ it's not that big a deal although price was the one Ninety five and Houston that was wonderful to see that was a throwback\nBut with this guy where he is on the la city where he is on the radar gun is a huge huge predictor of what he's going to be like the rest of the night\nDave O'Brien messing with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh it just full disclosure I'm not a David Price guy he drives me nuts I wanted him to pitch low enough to be able to leave it wasn't happening he was great in Houston\nI don't know if there's any carry over day we know what the history was we know what he did most recently where are you add on David Price\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nYou know a guy is Allen a guy visibility should have done it many times I'm I'm In complete agreement there\nBut he did it in a in a situation you did it in the clothes that game so you have to tip your cap I think you also have to give him credit because sale wasn't able to help and the red Sox basically one that series without Kris sale I didn't think they could do that a big reason they did it was David Price\nSo I think he earned a lot of respect that he was he seemed to be a different guy in that series in terms of how he dealt with the press you know holding is\nIs is ... and all of that I thought that was that was pretty wonderful but you know what what he's done so far in a Red Sox uniform\nAnd and the things that have gone south for him I don't think you make up for all of that would want to start with one starting to play offs but I Would love to see that continue because if he can put a great run together he can wash all of it away\nPretty much I think I think it would depending on what he does now in the world series but look at the post season so every star\nNext start is the biggest start of your career gain too that's the case for him as well\nThey just want to get a they just want a chance for your business so give them a chance you don't have to move everything over just open up an account or take out an auto loan or mortgage lines something along that line I think you'll get wood I've gotten for so many years this wonderful feeling that were my money is at navigating credit union opposes jerk by the end she you weigh All right we'll be\nFollowing up on this ...

is you get ready to embark on your last year of college basketball here and you're able to you know get back into a routine you're able to you know get back into school you're able to enjoy life again I Know that's got to be real happy for you\nOh yeah absolutely I'm just being back on them or are being around my God\nRhode Island's number one born dealer is setting the standard again and again the blood borne has over one hundred brand new borders gates were just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com [noise]\nI'm looking at the crowd chair and uh get an a standing ovation um is a great feeling I'm just glad to be back\nWell let's talk about there for a moment because when you were away from the game a year ago and you were going through all of your issues and I know that there was a time where you probably didn't think that this past friday night was going to ever happen again for you but now that it did when you rent on the floor did did you have a chance to kind of\nThink about that reflect back on it and and and maybe consider some of the the good fortune maybe that you had bestowed upon you know getting back out here\nYeah absolutely um last year when I had my energy um he really killed me to just sit on the side and just have to look out and look for a walk my guys play is no way I could really help besides being another coach um but I take that year and uh\nI use it as development to see a game from a different perspective um and I think that really helped me out and I think it's going to help you know my game this year\nThat's that's really a great point because you know when you have a chance to step back from the game you see the game differently don't you and you almost like you said the only thing I can do is contribute to my guys on the floor to show them or maybe tell them what I see in over them suggestions you learn the game really more as a coach would learn it didn't you\nYeah absolutely um there was the one time a one point in time where they actually start considering me a ... because I was ... so much and whatnot like that yelling at the young guys um but I took it all in and then took it as a learning experience what did you learn about coaching that you didn't already know um it can get frustrating because the guy that when I was listening to [laughter]\nAnd it ... the biggest saucers right now\n[laughter] welcome to our world image welcome to our world and you're one of the guys who don't always listen [laughter]\nMaybe now you you tend to give him a little bit more credit oh yeah absolutely has coach maybe you got to spend that around what what kind of an advantage now ... after him and has a year of of kind of growing that way at least mentally and the game what kind of an advantage that can that give you now especially since you have so many young guys out on the floor\nOr the one thing I think it always brought to the table is is a doozy as them his ability to communicate on the floor and say the right things I think many people we talked about communication being so important but it's having a direct order on what to say and and I think editors that are really good job he knows what to say when you say it\nBut for all of us and everyone who's listening his energy his enthusiasm his smile is something that we missed but more importantly his toughness and his ability to finish games and hopefully as he continues to get healthy ah he's had his best two weeks or practice the last two weeks\nAre able to get him back to a hundred percent I Would say Emmett is\nSixty sixty five percent of where he was a couple of years ago but the fact that he's here with us now and if you guys would've saw him as a year ago today you wouldn't recognize him so the fact that he is sitting here he's on the floor on these in the classroom he's in our community\nA is divine Providence that he's here with us today and it it really is a blessing um that he's at Providence College because he's been a gift to us and can't say how much we appreciate and being on our team\nAnd thought that it is [noise] and [noise] All right so what's been the biggest challenge for you to come back and do this all over again\nUm we kind of grown together and it's been a great marriage has been a great relationship we'll continue we'll have that relationship moving forward\nBut I think at a time and I'll stop talking about college basketball you know they're in the swing with football and Alabama's dominating once again going dominating once again Michigan is making a push that school in the mid west that wants to be Rob and it's called northern Maine you know I'm you know they're doing well but\nIt's about that time to stop talking college and uh when I have an opportunity to more morning to do so with the congressional died an exciting time for Robin college to have that national exposure um to promote our school organization and appropriate\nIf you're wondering on that first one it's eight o'clock tomorrow morning right yeah but have you got to be in the studio\nA\nPretty early but you know you all of sleep and I'll have a couple a couple of uh you know\nRoll the DVR so you know roll the DVR you'll be all set but I'm not a good shot out the yeah that's awesome\nIt's awesome it's it's it's good for Providence College is great for a pro Roman is another opportunity\nBlood Lincoln is southern Rhode Island's bring me a luxury dealer during Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln M. K. C. Lincoln Lincoln MDC and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of never against such fun parallel Marjorie him service\nEyes to find out the Villanova will be the preseason favorite as they are the defending national champs of course a couple of big time starters back I saw in the era exhibition under those quote unquote ... secrets you know scrimmage is that they're playing they played North Carolina they looked North Carolina\nAnd it was I Believe filled booth\nRight forty one points for nova\nShow I Know I mean you know let's face it you know Villanova was a blue blood school you know they want to or the last three national championships it's great for the Big East it's it's great for the conference it's great for Fox Sports\nI'm but I'm not surprised by that Jay right is a hall of fame coach he's done an incredible job if you remember J first three years way back when\nHe was on the chopping block year for he's not good enough on or what are we are doing\nIf you're a patient and you really believe in people great things could happen but I think there's going to be a lot of surprise teams and the Big East I think more cat has the most that's I think they have the most talent I think St john's is second to that um I think they're extremely talented a an improved appalled team\nLet me let me mentioned about St john's biggest for those maybe an where they just picked up a late transfer\nA much tougher here and who was second team all SEC last year at Auburn or received a waiver\nFrom the NC double a in order to transfer and be eligible immediately because his mother is ill and he's originally from Connecticut so they allowed him to move closer to home or he could be with his mother and he's eligible right away with two years village really for the Johnny\nYeah I mean he's going to be a problem I remember him when he was in high school or we took a long look at 'em in a very very good player we're glad to have them in the league and I'm pretty sure St john's is happy to have him a butler will be a tough out ankle is one of the hardest places\nIn the country to come our Baldwin is undoubtedly going to be a candidate for first him all the eastern shore so uh we're going to have our hands full was going to be interesting to see you know what the coaches think of the friars on on where we will be picked um where do\nYou think you will be the coaches vote by the media doesn't do this coaches vote and they can't vote for themselves is that right that's correct okay so where do you think of friends go\nI think I'm Will be picked anywhere between eight and seven really yeah seven or eight seven or eight that low or you know we lose three ... we lose three key seniors we lose Ninety percent about three points shooting\nWe lose Seventy percent of our rebounding\nEighty six percent of our minutes played\nI mean we lose a lot we lose a lot now I think we have a talented group where young um were inexperienced in the back or right now we have an unproven point guard I'm excited about what can I ask them language development\nThere's a lot of hype around with David can do but as you know I mean you got to go out there and prove in this league through um\nYou know I mean if you ask me honestly that's where I Would pick us based on what we lost a good part is the Big East has lost a lot of good players as well Villanova law for pros um Butler's last employers Xavier lost to coach a lot of good players\nUm mhm but villain on that has it all back is Marquette\nMarta is they have for starters back Marquette\nArguably is one of the top ten schools in the country does not getting a lot of love for them not to be pre season ranked\nAs an absolute joke you know for what would they have I mean they have the leader returning score on the uh you know the Big East\nIn markets Harwood who scored Seventeen thousand points on us here at the Dunkin' Donuts center yeah you guys remember that right yeah yeah um\nYou know a lot of people are not talking about Georgetown Georgetown I think a was a team nobody spoke of and if you think about it the last five games in a stretch of six games were was thrilled less points right you know so I bought coach you and did a great job with his team and then when you're talking about the big issues you're talking about to me\nOne of the best conferences in the country from top to bottom with the balance we play in great media markets um\nYou know but I still think the toughest place to play in our league is about\nSeven hundred yards down the street [laughter] and I think the ... it's a credit to our fans it's a credit to our marketing are ticketing people that do a great job of getting people in that people have come into the Dunkin' Donuts center and I love when I hear that so let's continue to make this place has always\nBeen I salute your fish tank to coach [noise] tell us how you vote for\nHow would you like motor drenched twenty or gene truck to be here for only one I mean I Will say hello to port boards Tony again for the best drug for the best rice anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a blood forward and he joined Narragansett\nPreseason pre she's starting now right now that's what we're doing preachy or do you want to pick it where you think bill in the year\nNo no I'm not knocking on the on the number that I don't I'm we pick I think and and I don't have Kevin gr but because we do it together yeah I think we've been going over one yep\nMarket to find St john's three yeah butler for it's a little hot\nUm butler for Xavier five that's also a little ... six that's very high Georgetown seven that's low and you put yourself aids the friars they\nMight was great you\nKnow you already said great Seton hall is seen hall and untenable you know what though no one's ever finish where everybody predicted them in in in that are well you\nKnow this is you you know let me say this this is your age you know you're starting as early road I dropped it ... years but in the previous seven years the friars have finished higher than where they were predicted\n[laughter] I ... a ... round for him around [laughter] ...\nI didn't know that yeah I just never yeah I'm I'm more concerned with uh where we are at the end of the season and I know because of the players that we will be one of the best teams in the way\nI'm going to go on a limb I don't think you're going to be\nPick they don't know about that I don't think you're going to be picked days where do you think will be good for you think what you think Bert wow okay well you're\nBrave three maybe a little high but I Would take for and I think that'd be a great spot because that tells me you're in the money for where you want to be in that post season play\nAnd you know I mean he's preseason polls really don't mean Raj yeah I I'm more concerned with can we be better when we place a Seattle and then go play Wichita the next sure a couple of days and that's going to be a lot of fun or\nWell we're going to talk about the one game that the friars have already played is they've gotten out onto the floor\nAnd exhibition play and they knocked off university Bridgeport last friday will kind of review that a little bit and tell you what else is coming up in the next exhibition games coming up as we continue live with the cruelly

historical black\nOr college or university a out of the central\nUh inter collegiate athletic association see I always have to remember that and a police state comes in on Saturday what are you learn from playing these games against\nThese schools division two or division three as you've done in the basket you played division three school you play Rhode Island college in the bed there's ... what do you learn is as opposed to learning a control or recall scrimmage against the wanting\nWell there's a lot of thought that goes into these exhibition games and and this year in particular we want it to play\n'em teams won nearly okay that would tournament teams that trust because up run the underground abrupt Wichita state's gonna press that gonna press so we have to be prepared for that have some real go off of\nA sort of thirty one turnovers I'm pretty short you know taking the long walk up and say okay we can press the scene for something that we can do in the past we've got exhibition means your local local teams and it could help their school a style of play I'm great great coaching we want to go west\nType styles it's a lot of different things are going to watch just we just don't look at the board and say okay let's wait you know a team right it's it's a rhyme or reason for a game but what what\nWould you stay with the team that was good to see a last year they actually won the least\nRhode Island's number one born dealer is setting the standard again and again the blood borne has over one hundred brand new borders gates were just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com [noise]\nIt was good for us to have that there I'm I'm I'm looking forward to Saturday a another opportunity to get on the floor get our guys and their uniforms go to a practice go through a shoot around go through a pre game Neal go through some scouting go through some film\nUm guys learning how to come on and off the floor how do you come off the floor how do you stand for national anthem how do you go through jump ball how to use it and the time out all these things\nAre talked about prior to a game so by the time all of you all see the game that's all been practiced you don't just come out of\nYou know high school and you know walks into Dunkin donut center and know what you're doing is it it it is that's what we do with what we talk about um how you come off you know how do you have in your teammate your your shirt or in the huddle the point guard since in the middle of the two guys on the left the three men on the on\nThe right the five minutes I'm On the right the format is on the left so anytime I'll say in the fall of ... we want he ... he has to be sitting to my left\nWow didn't realize it was so interesting just to turn to you know and the shirt to somebody\nYou better do it the right way\n[laughter] I kinda believe I can tell you if you have young guys on the team they haven't been you know in this kind of a situation before they even normally had twelve or Thirteen thousand screaming people around them so sometimes that can be a little bit of a different environment to get used to\nWell during the recruiting process we talk to them about the passionate energy has that the Dunkin' Donuts center\nWe talk to them about playing in the moment they have to block that out there is going to be a lot of people who don't like them there's going to be people that I'm going to be upset because you didn't play as well as you want it to their your fans you know and they have a right to be upset but it's how we respond and how we get better as what makes it great at the end\nAll right so you know we know that to you know you got these two exhibitions you try to learn something about your teams we just had a gentleman asked is a great question I thought that was kind of appropriate as well because you're really the big picture view is geared toward November the six\nUh in Sienna are coming in for the first game that that counts altogether how do you go about uh not only stacking teams up in your non conference schedule\nBut now the college basketball is going to be affected by it different measuring stick this year people are familiar with the term RPI the ratings percentage index from the last few years where are the relative strength of a team was measured based on your RPI reading this year it's brand new in college basketball you guys been around for thirty one years\nThis is the first time in thirty one years it's something other than the RPI is going to be the main measuring stick for potential postseason and relative strength of teams is called the net any team the net rating system RPI is a component but it's not the only component so how did that change your process and putting the schedule together this year\nI think it's going to affect us because then that came out after the schedule is already done really yes so I think it's going to be a learning process for us you know I'm we're going to have to learn as it goes I mean we've been very fortunate the way we scheduled and we look at RPI of strength of schedule it teams other than the multi a tournament events mhm\nSo I Can't answer that holy because I don't know you will find out\n[noise] but you you base your schedule do based on you know obviously previous knowledge of the RPI and what you thought then that might in also entail yes yes you know so you look for teams again that you feel will be what top one hundred top one fifty top two hundred schools largely\nYes so when we when we look the schedule we look at we look at like okay so when we play a team I'll give you for a Belmont yeah I'm pretty sure most of our fan base don't understand Belmont you know they're in the south\nOr you know they're in Tennessee and like who's Belmont right when I saw that we're going to play them because they were part of a tournament I said that will be one of the toughest games we play number one on players don't know about a number to our fan base don't know about him the coach has been there for\nThirty years and over seven hundred and some odd wins he's one of the smartest guys in our businesses on every border the NC double A.\nAnd when I saw that game I said God help us God help us that's going to be one of the toughest games so we look at who can win their league\nWho's going to be twenty to thirty wins in their late\nUm where will they be RPI wise so when we're scheduling games that is so so important take writer for example like we play Boston College last year at home they did an unbelievable job right it was Seventy four RPI Boston College I Believe was one Seventy six\nWhat auto group wants your car

I I'd like to have that problem\nRight if I screwed up then I'll go down in history but let me have that problem\nI mean you know that history on his side most large lottery winners I mean discovery I DNA and he had hours and hours of programming dedicated to the people that have one large lottery prizes and I am not necessarily done\nSo ... ... ... it's the equivalent of your GM rule [laughter] that's the majority of them when that kinda money will screw it up I however will be the ... that of that group and the ... yeah well hey listen primary open up the phone [laughter] being Ernie Adams\nA in a bad way to go get the especially if I'm the bill bell checked with six hundred million dollars\nWe would have a hell of a weekend in Vegas I'll tell you that much but I said you know when I'm a I'm a new saved the conversations that I have a mat 'cause I mentioned that to him as ... would you do that fine I guess all sit around and like we'll go we'll spend a hundred million on the original constitution to sit on your deck with a show\nAnd read it for crying out while it's like the other scene from office space where uh what's his regime for a while I cannot remember not here anymore uh and and he talks about what he's going to do it the money I Would get it to my friend put it in\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit letter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nA live large but we will get to that in the eight o'clock hour Alex core talking about the atmosphere look it's gonna be rock and\nA and I think too\nThere's a bit of good will on the other side because David Roberts is the manager and look you know Kevin Morris jokingly saying earlier on him it'll be network in order for me nobody would know Dave Roberts is okay I guess you can kind of say that but you can make the case\nAbout a dinner the team had during the pre season in spring training I have not heard this yet uh but it's\nOne I guess our core sort of knew him yeah we may have something here\n[noise] [noise] yeah um we got to think a lot of Rodriguez for picking up the tab that was huge I mean um [noise]\nThe it was a great moment and then there's been some powerful moment a throughout the season and that was the first one to have the whole travel traveling party I'm In one place and you know you guys talking about their experiences uh\nYou know Jason very sick and then talk about what it means for him to be a Red Sox are David prize how hungry he well he is to win a World Series of Jay Moran is we asked him how he feels a trade for Homer Homer Oncken one game all that stuff and then at the end\nYou everybody knows about the situation with Craig and and he was the last guy that that talk and uh he was very powerful you know he he really takes pride I'm finishing games you really takes pride of a\nYou know you guys for for ... and then in nine states my job to [noise] to secure when an MP guys up in the way he taught you know\nThere were there were it was emotional it was emotional and it was a great moment for us we'll take a lesson from\nCounty I think the most surprising part of that is there any Rodriguez picked up the tab would have been the guy who I thought it would have been David ... oh yeah of course in them large point in the long run all around taking a risk he's got to get suits and stuff and they seem a number one so\nI don't really cook the meal that oh I and and and shop for young in Greenland Brood II fresh produce Halen picked that produce and farm fresh chicken and things of that nature of our little more fun to take oh there you go yeah I can see David Price being a big farm to table kind of got her yup yup yup\nWell he's been chicken on the mound enough this year at times so what they're saying very nice ...\nUh Alex Cora also talked about Steve Pearce and his team hitting against left handed pitching this season\n[laughter] it's been ... um [noise] from day one when he's facing the Yankee Stadium I think it was the first version of double then the next ... first Fisher call you know double we knew that he was gonna help us out um [noise] one thing is uh [noise]\nI don't know as the team we don't do too much damage you know we could go and play and we get our heads ... but we're we're going to hit the ball at a ballpark and when he got to hear\nA help us out to do that um I don't know how many home runs stadium has again so I left he's not too many I guess under the same way but they can put in quality about as much as soon as a Pearson got here we started doing that in a personal basis are going to love to you then [noise] um [noise]\nYou know he's been great one thing about let's see if I may sort of half way through even now we don't get a\nA Mulligan or a patch but we probably the best left he and the big leagues now three or four times now he\nYou know take him out of the equation I'm probably the numbers are a little bit better I Know you cannot do that but ah [noise] the outer number he was great but uh we've been going to get lessons lately I have PC and Tyco so uh I Know he's a big challenge a went down with all the left who we prefer to be\nSure to be\nMade by a Boston general manager bill check guinea Trent Brown for a mid round pick your word Dumbo getting Steve here's\nStrength brown [laughter]\nNot that I Am reluctant to give dump browse get credit which I totally yeah but Trent Brown that's basically like training a third round pick for\nRhode Island's number one for dealer is setting the standard again and again for the board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like flood autos\nPiers has become a guy that\nYou know we thought it was just going to be a bench peace\nBut the red Sox are now counting on him we're going to give you the lineups and matchups coming up in just under Fifteen minutes here on the ground show on WNPR oh and I'm Steve Pearce is a guy who now you know they need him to come through I mean Mitch he too much more on this clearly found is level or they can we all agree on that or\nHe is what he is I mean other than going into the game getting beamed\nA he just you know he has a really hit where the dam and the second half very Roger ... oh I like that yeah well he got hit right was not what I did and that's true well flu brown comes out and was on that contract then we that's like the fans jobs like our job\nTo do a one of my favorites forget about the ... more Ricky\n[laughter] that's a great line man well they're going to go up against the red Sox me to go up against Clinton her shop tonight and a curse shines last start only went three innings and came in through Fifteen pitches in relief\nThey were going to give them some extra time and he was like no I'm good I'm ready to go\nAnd uh the one thing that scares me I'm not scared of this Dodgers all fence ... their bullpen last year with Kennedy Jansen ran out of gas you know I'm not saying that that's necessarily going to happen this year but their bullpen doesn't scare me\n[noise] the one thing that scares me is that Clinton curse Shaw says give me the F ... ball three times in this series yeah ...\nHe's got to be salivating for that World Series rang especially after last year and while you know the narrative and I'm Still hearing it and it's not like I blame people I understand the logic the Dodgers play on the west coast and all their games started two AM and this that and the other thing\nBut the narrative still seems to be for most baseball fans surrounding Clinton ... that he's a postseason choke artist and while that was\nThe case at the beginning of his career he's not a sub for E R I Want to say his last doesn't post season started and while he was and you're right he hasn't necessarily been lights out Sandy Koufax et cetera in the playoffs I'm\nA lot of people I think are expecting him to spin the bit in terms of showing up and gave them on and just\nYou know going first inning Tom gladman for those who may remember that a guy who couldn't get out of the first inning but otherwise was you know one of the best pitchers of the last quarter century or so but Clinton has really been able to find himself lately in his post season starts so if you're expecting them to come out and collapse hey that'd be great for the red Sox fan perspective but\nThis isn't exactly David Price we're talking about in terms of Clinton Kurt shot in the postseason track record it was in the beginning but he's definitely strung together enough a postseason success of late that I expect him to come with it here in the beginning it's ...\nIt's interesting as you are running that down roots and I agree with a with a lot of what you said I looked up Madison Bumgarner because I wanted to see\nIf it if there was some sort of growth curve for him in the postseason uh yeah there was an unknown or ... years old I was a which he peed he beat the ab Texas in the world series like spinning a free hit shutout\nOver eight innings the first time he was on the big stage or so there wasn't that that proverbial growth curve but I'm with you on that I mean the the only thing missing really\nFrom Clinton curse Charles resume is a World Series and let's face it why did I run to baseball reference look Madison Bumgarner\nBecause he is one of the rare guys who has said give me the bleeping ball the same way Curt Schilling did and Randy Johnson did in Arizona or not so much here with showing but\nYou know there are guys who have the ability\nTo walk into their managers office and say I know I'm not supposed to pitch today but I'm your best guy and you need to give me the ball and will it come to that for the Dodgers will they be in a game for or will they be in a game for a situation where they might need\nA ... to where they they might need ... to do that I don't know but it's definitely the one thing that could tip the scales because if he's nasty for he didn't even have to give them twenty seven innings if he goes three starts all you've got to do is give them\nReally Twenty one the innings of great baseball if he does that seven innings just start he's got a chance to carry them two World Series I Can't wait to see a CEO pleading right field I mean you're a route ... am I wrong\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month blood as every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nAnd get a drink\nBottled up\nBut there's definitely that element of him running around in circles I'm anyone's going to get hit by a piece of pizza adjust the\nAbout ... and I also have been a yes yep we might be the guy who would do it like\nFor the net it backstop behind home plate for him right field in Fenway Park that guy's got a garden foreign he's got a rocket Fernando bally's doing yeah there you go the rocket for an arm we'll see how that works out I don't know what's worse\nPutting your I feel we get right field to deal with Fenway\nOr if you throw him and left to try to play the ball off the wall\nI like to see that I mean it's never going to happen but I'd like to I'd like to see that\nOne of the other three to one to be P R O four three nine seven seven six on the Twitter at the Rio Grande ... stage ruins in Ottawa underway five minutes
