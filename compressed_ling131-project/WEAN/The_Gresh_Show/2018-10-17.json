OU\nSo Danny ... card a Boston Metro has the story\nFrom game on the American league championship series that for those you're just joining us in a nutshell here\nIn Houston Astros had a guy in the media credential area next to the red Sox dugdale creeping around and in the third inning of game one security removed said gentleman\nAnd the man had a small camera like a spy camera and was texting frequently but did not have a media credentials first of all hold on hold okay go ahead because I Know he's got a camera\nIt says a small camera and in this they have a link\nTo something on the verge dot com yeah talking about how a H. U. A. W. E. Y. who ways may twenty pro yeah that's the cameras that is a suspect and camera monster like I don't know if this is it but it looks like a phone okay\nWell that's I was just about as that that was my point yeah it's like All right\nYou're doing this a undercover operation that involves you taking pictures yeah now I don't know about you crash but my phone happens to have a camera on it yes and I can be taking pictures with my phone and no one would be the wiser unless they were standing behind me or over me because I turn off the sounds\nAnd there we go I started taking pictures I start recording video and no one would be the wiser I wouldn't even necessarily need to look at it I thought I could pretend like I was looking somewhere else I could pretend I was talking on my phone the whole time I could be recording these signals or whatever he was doing\nI think it's a big time unnecessary red flag I mean what did he have a black trench coat do with the\nWith the caller is right versus spies now [laughter] the trench coat on these lurking around it's like what are you doing backer well obviously secret stuff that I got the trench coat in the sun glasses I mean we've been talking to his risk that he got on there that was a\nFast ... air PC games touching his ear mites auditory oh he was\nReally prepared\nFor a spy operation and say like Nineteen thirty five I probably had cyanide capsule in his pocket to just in case somebody came upon them and found is a secret spy camera\nAnd this is so like Boston Metro right this is what drives you nuts about that website\nSo there's a thing there by the Cleveland Indians and I clicked on it and it said forty eight hours to vote for Cleveland is best sinful desserts finalist ... ripping good yarn right there he wishes um\nApparently no one has said this story as bunk no one stone cold water on it or the Astros the Indians the red Sox and major league baseball\nOr there's been no denial by any of those entities regarding the incident or the ad for mentioning details apparently the red Sox had been warned about this that apparently suddenly just went down in Cleveland when he got his\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition it was more than ... religion they're against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood all those on jobs now\nHey there's something going on here like this\nGuy isn't doing with the rest of us are downright are doing right which is maybe constantly you know for for those who don't know when you cover baseball and not that I've done it very often in fact I've never done it\nReally for a newspaper but you're kind of writing the story is the game goes along it's almost like a chronological detail of everything that happens in the game and then normally writers will sort of an inverted and then flip it around\nSo that the juicy details of how it ended get to the top of the column and then you sort of filling the rest from there at\nFor instance right now they are beginning their stories because that Jackie Bradley junior high and slammed likely ended the game so they've already picked out their pivotal moments and they're moving on with it is\nYes and the red Sox have just gotten through the eighth inning so we're headed to the top of the night and you're exactly right and then it's going to their article stores did it begin with the Jackie Bradley junior grand slam and then they go from there\nI mean first of all this is a terrible job by major league baseball a terrible job the one thing major league baseball can't have right now as they're struggling for space and notoriety\nIs for them to have allow someone in a prior series\nTo do the exact same thing in another visiting ballpark I mean if it were the NFL if God Forbid this through the New England patriots jeeze God Almighty what would happen cheetah\nYou'd have that dope max Kellerman and screaming hey going crazy over this\nHere's the thing they'll gradually specifically in baseball\nA giant open secret is that they all like to cheat and don't want the other teams to get caught your name what's been the topic of conversation all week are all playoffs is G seemed like a lot of pictures are using a whole lot of pine tar on their hands more than normal lot of people go to their bill a lotta people touching their belts\nEverybody notices this yet none of the team seem to care because they all know that it's in the best interests of their players\nAnd part of the gamesmanship of baseball and I'm not saying there's rightly or wrongly is the stealing up signals like I said as a ten year old man and everyone else on my team and everyone else on the other team we were trying to steal signals from the third base coach or the first base coach or wherever the signals were coming from\nSo that's part of baseball from little league on up so yeah maybe I'll get a little more sophisticated as the higher levels and make no mistake about it this guy from the Astros as an absolute moron yeah if that's what he was doing yeah and major league baseball is dumb\nFor not us stepping in and warning people and making sure this guy didn't have access but again that all goes to the root of what I'm saying the teams don't care and major league baseball doesn't care when it comes to this type of cheating you know you want to do steroids HGH do get all over here when it comes to using pine tar and stealing signals from the other team\nThey're only going to deal with that if it ... past the surface and something tells me that this isn't going\nTo end it's not the end of the world they're just dumb and the way they did it correct roots the you know we have there there's so many high powered cameras now honestly if I were going to do it here's what I Would do\nI Would find a way to get someone who I'm friendly with in the sand in the stands try to get them\nFront row you know what I Do I get them a mobile ... you know why because the circle on the on the oh in mobile inside that had\nTo have a little camera on there and all that guy would do is just stare at our core of the whole time I get all those signals I'd match 'em up in the hotel the next night know what's going on and you move on from there yeah it's one game\nFilm 'em up break it down there you go the red Sox did this before with center field cameras the Yankees have done this allegedly with the centerfield cameras\nTo roast show was five years later somebody on the side there was a reality he basically did exactly\nWhat you were talking about the way back when put someone in centerfield until eventually people are like a they have someone in center field see that guy out there where their house seats right guy standing there with that real time really that eight million and I\nKnow this is nothing new this is as big a part of baseball is chewing sunflower seeds that way you go about doing it and this guy again\nMore on just dumb I mean really stupid and again you know is it a huge advantage probably not I don't think it is a lot of these guys they're normal there is normally a coach on\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit letter of Lincoln I'm Casey Lincoln him getting ...

Brad Stevens now a ... you had to listen close\nBut a Brad Stevens about seven and a half minutes post game last night and about two minutes and he said something that's very interesting you're going to hear it at the end of this here's the question in which Brad\nStevens ends with what I think will be his narrative for this year to take a listen\nThe last couple of weeks you guys have talked a lot of effort and translating that some practice the game so how would you suggest we saw out of the guys notable both teams play hard um but I thought we you know if I'll be competed I felt that are in our ... was a big factor in the game whenever things started go ride 'em and we put new fresh guys and they all may plays and [noise]\nUm you know that's what it's gotta be for us and um for a long way from being really good um [noise]\nBut if we play hard and we have a chance to get there\nThat and we're a long way from being really good but if we play hard we have a chance to get there\nGet ready to hear that to the point to where you're going to get sick of hearing it pits Brad Stevens has been aware of that out and he asked to he asked to and I saw one scene that Reggie Miller set on last night's broadcast it was interesting is\nThe competition from the the second unit\nOr what is going to push those guys they continue to play hard because retiree things oh it's a Sunday afternoon Detroit game I Want to go watch the NFL or he can do that and you can get thrown out or he can play like crap and she was a send them down because you've got other people to go to\nYou know it's funny ... is what Stevens just said well we just played right there\nIt took me awhile to register that is odd because I hear that hundreds of times every year from college basketball yeah it's a great point that they say and that's what they say they're ... like you know everyone knows I'm a big time Syracuse hawk so obviously I watch a lot of Jim ... press conferences and stuff\nSyracuse is garbage in his eyes four eighty five percent of the season until he knows he needs to start building them their confidence up for the tournament that's what a lot of good college coaches do when's the last time you're ... Bari say we are awesome and we are going to\nBlow a matter of act like they would say but they just played Missouri that's the best three three football team in the country right now the\nBill has wearing handbook Eugene isn't any good at least not publicly can build them up behind the scenes in ways if you'd like to\nBut your team's not good until you say there are good and that's not going to be until a ways off for the Celtics so while I think what Brad doing right now is making sure publicly to get those links and because if he does it all season\nYeah I mean the details are still a little sketchy um we do not have any\nWord on what shorter stomach ill than it was whether it was a gastrointestinal thing or a book or heart or whatever but it was clear that uh the the pretty seriously upset\nStomach they read a bunch of tests held them overnight observation released them that morning so it's not anything terribly serious but it was enough to the rail I'm a little bit you know not eating solid food and um you know for a guy that how\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in East Berlin engineer against that have the best

he he can't maintain that so I'm not surprisingly\nHe is not a hundred percent physically\nI'm alec tourists that he felt a little weak and so they don't to see the sense of pushing him to make that start tomorrow so by having him throw was bullpen tomorrow and then get a couple of extra days they'll have a little bit of time to rebuild some of that strength and be available\nFor game sects or if it's necessary on Saturday\nIs this an optimistic sauce that he'll be available for game six or from the people you talked to Sean they feel pretty certain that he'll be able to get it out and go 'cause it sounds like just a couple of days might not exactly fix this\nYeah I I don't think there's a guarantee I did ask our score that you said you know people as in plural we talk to 'em unfortunately on game days in the postseason we don't have access to pop so beyond the manager\nAnd whoever else has brought him to the interview Rome or whoever you might run into on the field during batting practice or not a lot of let's gives me availability for\nTo get information um I did ask Alex how confident he was that sale would rebound and and be available Saturday and he said he was confident but there are no guarantees at this point you know he was supposed to pitch tomorrow it he's not\nAnd you're right for a guy who is not yet a ingesting solid food to say with a hundred percent certainty that that'll be cleared up you'll be strong enough and be ready ... on Saturday a is a bit of an article of faith so we'll just have to see how it goes\nSean macadam of Boston sports journal dot com here on the ground show on WNPR oh buddy advance of game for the American league championship series and\nOr rich or poor cello or as you wrote Sean and it's a great piece rich poor so has had his own October transformation a it started in the bullpen ditch carried over to the storage you know I'm optimistic tonight about this guy but\nA Sean to your point you wrote about it a very well I mean it's almost like we're in the world did this come from ... more so\n[noise] yeah I mean I as I noted in the peace or anti you know David prices the guy that gets a lot of grief for ah not having a a postseason start in eleven career postseason uh\nExcuse me not having a wind that a postseason start over eleventh starts um and yet until he won game for the clincher against the Yankees last week uh neither did or fellow now he didn't have as many start\nI think he had four or five prior to that I'm at a total of about a nine available mhm ah so\nUm you know you you do wonder about whether that um something that is temporary or whether it's a you know that he's really turned a corner here but he certainly has patrol not only in the start giving up one run the country and New York but\nThen giving them a two thirds of an ending and relief uh before that start and then over the weekend giving them a one two three eight betting getting\nThem to the night or in in game two so I think his confidence has been\nBolstered by that but he's kind of flown under the radar as another Red Sox starter that doesn't have a history of postseason success the difference being is that he's now have some over the last week going to happen I think that's probably meant the huge amount to him\nJohn what'd you make of AJ Hinch leaving OSU name in not only after you hit one guy to hit a second guy yeah\nLittle strange I mean you know this was the guy that they went out and got to break controversy\nUm later in the season a given soon as personal issues off the field where he was accused of domestic salt\nUm you know there there was all sorts of the negative reaction understandably when he was acquired a couple of the Astros veterans weren't crazy about it I think since been accepted\nIn there but yeah that that's kind of a long leash\nWhen you're in a series one one in a close game late when a guy obviously doesn't have it I was surprised that\nHinch didn't move quicker but the red Sox have been the beneficiary of you\nHow would you like motor joins twenty anti trust that the only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to forge twenty a gene for that one of the

boom with starters a ... a in a game for an ... knocking game treat you probably let them go longer than he showed up to a I think in retrospect than with the benefit of hindsight we can say the same thing about\nUm ... no sooner last night\nSean began with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh\nYour thoughts on the latest cheating scandal in baseball the baseball said wasn't a big deal\nAnd interesting to Justin ... said a hey I got an idea that could save twenty minutes a game and basically he advocated for communication device or the ability to communicate\nBetween the catcher in the pitcher the way say an office of coordinator and a quarter back would in the NFL your thoughts on all that\nYeah I Am not to take anything away from Berlin or not the first to bring that up that's been kicked around a little bit the technology would seem to be just a look at you know the operative word that you hear from most people in the game over the last two or three days\nI think it's spinning and also a sad commentary is paranoia now everybody is walking around with her head on his Web will convince but there's some body\nWho is a you know using video or doing something to get an unfair advantage during game\nAnd as Alex score a noted in his the media availability not long ago it's kind of taking away from what's going on on the field than you know he noted that these are two teams who combined when two hundred and eleven game during the regular season and here we are talking about cameras and dark out sign that\nComplain and appeals and major league baseball investigating a\nI I think most fans their eyes glaze over when they start reading about this and and you know I'm not saying that it should be the wild wild west that they could get away with whatever you want the rules should be enforced\nI'm just kind of them just speaking for myself here I'm just kind of tired of hearing about it uh I I think you know\nA certain amount of gamesmanship has always gone on in the game you know we'll go back to the famous Nineteen fifty one pennant race between the Dodgers in giant\nAddict came out decades later that there were signs feeling you know a sixty something years ago they didn't have the technology they do today and obviously today's technology makes it a little easier\nBut it you know there's always someone trying to build a better mouse trap and there's always someone trying to guard against it and come up with their own bit of information\nUm I understand that there has to be rules whether major league baseball is looking the other way too often are just trying to sweep this under the rug I couldn't tell you I just couldn't say that it it it it doesn't exactly wrapped me and I wish the focus to go back to the game\nDoes baseball needs are very quietly try to come up with some sort of way to not have this be a big story again is there a way they can sort of nip this in the bud for next year but not turn it into a national referendum that there is an issue with the game\n[noise] yeah I mean I think you know that technology issue is certainly something that could be explored further uh so that you know you have communication that way\nYou don't have signed a ...

still in the learning process uh understand the you know the speed the athleticism a beach guy throws do and the kind of place that they can make money should go down\nSo you know and I think for us but we have to do a better job with it that we need to be able to run the football and kind of take the pressure off you know Michael so we don't have to do with his arm on every way and if we can get the run going it's going to open up a more opportunities in the play I\nCoach he got the big red of Cornell coming in on Saturday at one o'clock it brown stadium a game that folks can you hear on sister station am seven Ninety or tell us a little bit about the big red they're two or three one and one in the I mean what jumps out on film when you look at him\nWell they're really good often simply they got some great skill they're good size in the offing why their quarterback banks is a very consistent distributing the football don't use a little bit of a wild cat quarterback as well and they're run gain\nA but they've been very good they they like to run the football and and for a while but\nAnd defensively they're very good against Iran\nAre therefore guys up front or what you know so it's no easy task force they beat Harvard a couple of weeks ago and and just you know they were behind they never gave up and they created some turnovers on special teams and ran up a block on back for cuts down on the football game so\nHow would you like motor trench twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one Ninety nine brought will say hello to what boards twenty eight teams for that one

watch on building there's nothing last year about them except for the fact that every time you end up all he does something special uh you know we used to run the ball but maybe sometimes thirty thirty five times the gate\nAnd there was a big story GI cash that always happens in politics\nBut all you think of is that guy know starring here no sorry uh yeah there is a major league baseball even though major league baseball has come out and tried to say case closed as we talked about last our with our friend Sean macadam [noise]\nUh yeah they've got to do something here and I thought Sean made a good point when he basically said look it's becoming story when it should be about the baseball\nHe's right it should be about the baseball but it isn't\nBecause now we're sitting here talking about whether an advantage was gained by some guy who apparently is a friend of the owner of the Houston Astros who was sitting in an authorized area that crane\nI ain't right that's the owner

relations I don't think so I think they clarified a earlier this year when he meets Sesame Street came out last year the public here who want to go out and said hey I Want to hear that well yeah I
