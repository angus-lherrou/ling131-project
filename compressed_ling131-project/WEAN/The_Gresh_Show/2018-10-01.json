get the second and seven and a cue Gore gets hit with a holding call second in Seventeen leads to Thirteen twelve you're out of the series\nDolphins get the ball second time on certain tend they end

game that that guy was a part of in like three years something like that plane that tie week one\nYou know the one thing about New England football players right is that one of the things we talked about is do they know how to win\nAnd what does that mean ... what does that mean\nThat means that you're going to put in\nThe appropriate amount of effort during the week to make sure that when your number is called\nYou can execute what Tom Brady his throne what fifty sixty thousand football's whatever it is like some stupid right not every throws perfect\nBut if you took his hit percentage versus the missus they're overwhelming but on the other end of that if somebody else who has to do their job\nAnd that's another question that I have about jobs scored and cause folks out to be honest with you a one eight hundred three two one WPRI oh and I want to hear your initial impressions of Josh court\n\nThere's something that I really like that in especially watching that post game press conference\nJosh Gordon looks like he's afraid to make a mistake now normally with any other athlete I Would say that's too much pressure on them it's getting to him Josh Gordon needs this Josh corn needs to be in an environment where\nThey're not going to deal with whatever it is then he was put in Cleveland Browns through and Josh corn yesterday\nCredit card ten balls for two hundred and fifty yards and for touchdowns\nIf he would have shown up late to a meeting today we know that would have been ramifications whereas in Cleveland I think he was the guy was kind of getting away with some of that stuff you know we've talked to our friends in Cleveland we thought that Dusten Fox who's a afternoon host out there does college football games played at Ohio State\nI'm sure is around some immature pet you guys at Ohio State right I mean just look at the air he was there\nYou'd think there'd be some hell even if a new album and there's a saying my source Albert ... says there are known to various characters in or around Ohio State at that time so you're you're you know so so he he would have no rights ... only knows choir boys yeah to hang out with ... you know and and the guys that we talked to in Cleveland they talk\nAbout how immature Josh coordinate is and in the press conference afterwards like rich we have what he said right like you you can't see the facial expression of Josh Gordon but\nEven standing in front of a microphone I think he was really worried about saying something wrong and he didn't say anything wrong but it was Gordon after yesterday's game\nOn the news is awesome just hated can test will pass from home you know for me\nBut um you know he's he's been ruined for me and [noise] it's it's been awesome to have his supporters love as as well as the rest of the team made from fast food you know in terms of passion in God and I love them I Love the game football and I think we're going to mess with just full\nOf ... you know taking this opportunity I'm more than blossom shaming grateful for the new scenario um and I think the only thing for me to do is take full advantage of it I'm loving it I'm enjoying the guy's hand ray [noise] most of your home environment who\nWas comfortable as over so well\nYou know Josh Orton says he loves football the only way he is going to prove that is by showing up working hard getting better giving his nose in the play book and stay off the yellow or ... walk or whatever in the world that he was on\nWhatever his drug of choice\nGet away from that ... the new one look it up mhm but did\nYou see the look on Josh Gordon's face for those who was able who were able to watch that press conference\nIf you're a parent\nYou know\nThe look on your kid's face when they know they screwed up\nAm I wrong\nAnd how many times as a kid if you had strict parents\nWhen you screwed up\nHow would you like motor trench twenty eight gene trucks with the here for only one I mean I Will say hello to port boards twenty four to one fifty ... for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars from us only a flood forward and he joined Narragansett\nFind something but I Will humble you\nAnd that's what Josh Gordon looks like he looks scared to the point to that he's been humbled\nLet's be perfectly clear on this at no point in Josh Gordon's wife has he been in an environment that is as accountable as the one he is in right now professionally with the New England patriots\nAnd we do with Bill bell a check if there's an action there's a ramification\nIf you go out and you you know and Josh Gordon misses a meeting he knows there's going to be held to pay or he knows there's going to be\nSome sort of ramifications for him and I thought that post game press conference yesterday you could kind of see that I I I hate to use the phrase scared straight 'cause I still don't trust him\nTo stay off the you know whatever it is a ...\nBut when you look at him you can tell that this guy does not want to screw up here because he knows it would be the end now let's talk about Josh corn on the field a little bit here on the ground shown WPRI grab that one one eight hundred three two one WPRI what did you make a Josh board\nI think we think he is a complete football player and he isn't and that's probably a mistake then we\nAll have gotten sucked into it at one point because hey there's a sense of urgency for the team to find a a wide receiver that can do something on the outside and be is that we're all waiting for this office to fix itself\nSo for some of us it's the whole you know delusions of Granger in thinking the Josh corn walks in the door and he's a complete player he is still a work in progress\nIs the guy's not played a ton of football the course of his wife\nOr you give them a five yard slant route war I T o can go run that right now\nI'm not denigrate Josh warden I'm just saying that there are a lot of guys out there and you can put them in on those five yard slant routes I'll be honest with you and watching the game I made a mistake I thought that it was Gordon\nWho essentially set the pick for Paterson and then the defense of actually got confused writing foot Patterson Patterson to the restaurant for the touchdown at first I thought that was Gordon and it was it was James White I don't think Gordon was even on the field for that point\nSo even in the play time they gave Josh toward the ... just a really good job of making sure that they rationed it out they didn't overused the guy but what they have to do\nAnd the good will come out of yesterday\nIs that he was in the game in a winning environment and he got to feel what it was like to play on this football team when all all the cylinders are operating in a very high level\nAnd that's going to go a long way to that guy growing as a person and growing as a player because the more confident she gets in a professional environment the more confident she's going to get personally because the level of investment\nProfessionally will grow up they don't fully the personal stuff he'll least pause and think and say do I really want to do this\n\nI'll tell you the other thing that I really liked about one of those Josh Gordon catches on the first one\nYou see you gave them the old big I think he went uncomfortable double high five or went over to reacted to him or lord and football savior Thomas Edward Brady was hoping it was there any well I Would be great if older and rang\nDown high great catch ... I was\nOnly sixty five more to build the soup bowl can you do\nA lot of things happen some good some\nBut I thought Tom Brady going over and reacting to Josh during the way he did on the first catch you know when it rang too you know what it looked it felt like to me watching that\nGame it felt like to me that\nWas Tom Brady putting the stamp of approval on the kid and that is the okay you've now registered is that you've been on the field with us your now one of us that's what that felt like to me Tom Brady going over and given that guy the positive affirmation unless we\nHow would you like motor trends twenty gene truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to what boards twenty eighty four to one fifty the best drug for the best rice anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at what board and he went into and there were against it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Gresh Show", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "01"}
