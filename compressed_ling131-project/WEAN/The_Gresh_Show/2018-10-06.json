S. C. and joining us to talk about it right now longtime friend of the show longtime friend of mine great guy Johnny ... voice of us see Johnny ... brother\n... jumping out of my chair just here and you talk about this fight we've talked about a lot of big ones ought to be said for years but I don't think we have chopped it up about any flight of this magnitude us\nAnd and I know you and I can get into the fights but for the brand us see how big is Saturday Night with Conor McGregor re inserting himself back in fight fans' minds\nWell I'd probably answered the question will Conor McGregor comes back to a mixed martial arts a hundred times and I was so convicted and my response that's absolutely he would because of his love of the game and his\nDetermination to improve his residency right this is the guy who cares a lot about fighting and courts martial arts so when he was\nCutting his teeth as a professional fighters so he is a student of the game you ups the games are a lot of these guys on our roster that don't watch fights when they're not competing and Conor McGregor is not cut from that ... loves the game and that is sort of been at the root of his message and I think\nDuring fight we care that forget the media everything else you know I Want to prove myself as a martial artist and the best ground on which to do that or is the ... so we're happy to have him back and\nOf course the backdrop of him fighting the guy who's twenty six and oh and in my opinion the most dominant force in the game right now at present just makes for an amazing story and that has global appeal so we're starting to man you know I'm getting packing today and I'm getting anxious to get access one I Am so I'm excited\nWell and and rightfully so and I've been working on this could be more modern made often I get that writing her mother made off\nYeah that that will certainly ...\nOkay thank you brother because I Know you have to nail it I just I just got to be in the ballpark but right is that I think if you weren't just a fringe fight fan John if you are one of those people\nWho jumps in when a block lead singer or Daniel ... or Conor McGregor are headlining a car and\nYou know I Wonder how much the the fringe fight fans really understand how good to be remark I made off really is can you give people the background on this guy and why he is such a legitimate contender to someone is highly thought of as Conor McGregor\nWell I wouldn't call them a specialist right because that would be to denigrate his striking but his international background in combat salvo his wrestling his grappling really is on bashed\nEspecially in the modern day for him to secure Twenty one land to take down and Fifteen minutes you as the flight that is a record even for a twenty five minutes so this is a guy that has just been able to impose his will on some of the best light weights in the world\nHis ground in town that I think when he gets you on the ballot for ground his ability to strike accurately and effectively\nAnd position his body control you on the ground\nThere is just not much margin for error and I think that's why a lot of people who are falling on the side of the favorite here ... feel like there's a clear path to victory in sort of a classic striker versus graft or a question here that he's going to take ... down\nAnd because of his ability to control on the ground a counter is not gonna be able to get back up but that's why they play the games and obviously exporters unpredictable there a lot of different elements in layers to it and are\nYou ... sometimes you come out flat on flight night I can assure you ...\nHas never made a walk even close to death in terms of the magnitude of the moment Conor McGregor standing already in the ... on waiting for him ah this is something called the has an experience I think he's well equipped to handle it but uh this is a big ask I Would think for him to have his best performance to date on the stage\nThe voice of UFC John antique here on the ground show on WNPR oh you mentioned the walk that can be was gonna have to make can you know I watched that initial press conference and he was so he wasn't getting sucked in by Conor McGregor and McGregor theatrics and antics\nHe maintain that kind of composure or is that am just maintaining his his composure John while he's in the same way with Conor McGregor until we get some in the octagon\nGood question this is a special special human being and\nI think if I had to bet on about or political gotta Conor McGregor right now with respect to Tony Curtis and some others that would probably be ... and\nA big reason why it's not just the skills and the technique and everything else it's the mental composure and cause that this guy brings to the table so your take away from that press conference I think it is accurate and I agree that not until the end was the reason a slight rattle out of\nThe yeah I think he's well equipped to handle it but\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than any dealer around because we're a circle by buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers\nUm is a little bit of\nJohn any worry that the layoff hurts McGregor he's had a lot go on and his wife has he found a way to stay sharp you worry at all about any skills deteriorating are not being up to where they were even just a couple of years ago when the octagon\nNo I think it'll be better than nothing could be better with his hands but I think he'll eat better overall I think he is conditioned to sort of what it takes to to win a five round fight having now done that against snake Diaz right in their ... so\nI don't worry about common McGregor at all I mean he left the game as a simultaneous ... on\n... with us to be regarded as one of the hardest workers who get the right training smart training I mean look at the frame on this guy right now as he's getting ready for flight out of shape and I have no issues about Connor McGregor and they'll go to a lot of pro fighters are split on the whole idea of ring Ross\nDominic cruise former Vanna White champion says it's just a mentality he's\nCome back from layoffs and had some of his better performances so others feel like it's a real thing and you call me a feels like request is a very real thing but I think when you have an athlete as special is McGregor is\nAt a guy who really is under rated in terms of what he can do as a skillful martial artist or I Am not worried about con or at least in terms of what the work he's done to put himself in a position to execute on Saturday\nJohn obviously it's for the lightweight titled between a to B McGregor and right under them\nThere's another lightweight bout between Tony ... and Anthony pet is is it too easy to draw a straight line that the winner of that under card gets the winner of the main event or is it a little more complicated than that especially if McGregor when the fight\nWell ... this week has talked about fighting Anderson Silva which would be up to divisions that middle ... and I'm not even sure if the ... civil wants to make a hundred and eighty six pounds right now I don't know if\nIf that is realistic at all I think some of the hard core fans would sort of be disappointed to hear that because they think Conor even if it's going to be able have unfinished business in defending this one hundred and fifty five pounds title but yeah the ... flight is absolutely monstrous to those of us that\nKnow how good these two fighters are and Tony Curtis and return to hear from a very invasive knee surgery in April coming back sooner than any medical professional thought you would and he's the first guy to hundred and fifty five pounds in us history\nTo win ten flights in a row right and that gets lost on people he's still taking out winning streak into the Arctic on Saturday he's a guy who's one of us the interim lightweight title that was stripped from him he's angry I spoke with him yesterday like he's legitimate pissed off and of course he's fighting the form of USC lightweight king Showtime pet issues in the ... good current form as well so\nPoor ... Diaz coming up next month that could sort of play a factor as well but\nI think at least when it comes to Tony ... and if you can send us Anthony Pettis this weekend he would certainly be hard to deny\nJohn there's one other point I Want to mention here on the on this you want to see two twenty nine card and that's the heavyweight Derek Lewis in Alexander ... cough\nThis whole cough I mean six seven two hundred and fifty pounds his background is in karate which is a little odd for someone that size you'd think he'd just stand there and you know whip somebody's ass odds right give me a little preview of this heavy I Love it when the big boys fight and this was like a pretty good fight on the older under card here\nYeah no doubt about it in bulk of the guy who\nDeserves the distinction as the betting favorite there about a two two to one favorite here in the middle of the fight we and ...\nOn successfully defended his belt against ... July they had one heavy weight on standby if either of those guys was unable to compete who was that guy\nAlexander ... a lot of pro experience thirty insects undefeated foreign Ellen the U. S. C. and a nice mix of knockouts and different finishing skills that he breaks at the table Derek Lewis is obviously more U.S she tested and I think the black pieces probably more familiar name to a lot of fans out there but you know I'm surprised to see that Lewis has won\nEight of his last night so he's right there as well and I think this is a title eliminate or of sorts I mean ...\nHopes his next businesses with rock lesson or bus boycott is definitely on that short list and Derek Lewis was able to get something done and find a home for one of those lunch boxes are then maybe we'll be talking about the black feast on Monday morning\nYou know I'm Glad you mentioned a laser and ... when do you think that piece of business may end up happening and it does a John Jones return factor in when the lead singer in ... kind of good to get after and how the whole situation shakes out\nAbsolutely I mean they're two names for Daniel ... and I can tell you this as his friend and broadcast partner he'll fight John Jones that light heavyweight but that's the only guy that interest in the two hundred and five pounds and you can understand why it's a big plus for him is going to be forty in

Francisco so broadcasting from a local studio here very excited to be in the bay area I'm here for a variety of meanings and conferences the ... summit\nIs on Monday and so I'll be speaking at that and attending uh with uh some of the a C suite\nExecutives and the financial services industry from around the country an imitation only event I'm really glad to be out here for that and to spend time in the bay area which I Love to do um we've got some really good news coming out of the financial sector and uh I'm not sure if you're a fully\nAware of what's going on because I'm not sure that you've been participating in it\nLose you could argue is actually a little bit mixed with the uh the yields on ten year treasuries is now at the highest level in seven years yeah we've exceeded the interest rate on ten year treasuries since two thousand eleven\nNow people would say ordinarily well gee golly isn't an ... you know higher yield better because that means I'm earning a higher rate of return on my bonds no because if the yield goes up that means the interest rate is up\nThat means the value of the bond is down so we're the highest interest rate since two thousand eleven and means we're at the lowest price since two thousand eleven uh and that is not good news if you own long term bonds and that is why you've got to be really careful about your investment strategy\nA but I you know there's another statistic that's that's really fascinating at the same time the Dow Jones industrial average hit an all time high earlier this week\nIt gave some of that back later on in the week but the fact that it in the stock market is continuing to hit new highs while the bond market is struggling to avoid losses due to interest rate increases\nDemonstrates that is as is usually the case in the world of investing it the tale of two cities and it's really important that you recognize this\nAnd maintain a highly diversified investment portfolio\nLast week I talked about the fact that\nHighly diversified portfolio doesn't guarantee against losses it doesn't mean you're going to always have above average\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one night I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at point for it and he went into the Narragansett\nDollars nine out of ten parents say they're surprised at how much money they spent by becoming a parent\nAnd nearly two thirds say they encounter financial difficulties associated with parenting\nEven children who are living independently are receiving financial support from their parents parents are contributing to school costs health insurance rent car expenses parents or even paying for food and for cell phone service for their adult children\nThe numbers are rather astonishing thirty one percent of Americans who are age of Eighteen to thirty four thirty one percent we're talking basically one out of three of\nPeople in their twenties and thirties or living with their parents we actually have more people who in their twenties and thirties living with their parents than living with a spouse\nThat there's something new and different for the society parents are\nSaying they're not going to be off the hook anytime soon fifty nine percent say they expect to help pay for their children's weddings okay nothing new about that mom and dad have been paying for their daughters weddings for pretty much forever but twenty six percent say they're expecting to contribute to their children's first homes\nThirty three percent expect to contribute to their grandchildren's college costs so it's not just you're paying for the wedding for the kid you're paying for the house you're paying for their kids' education as well\nAnd here's what's really shocking an amazing about this the reason the parents are providing so much financial support to their kids is because the kids are unable to handle this on their own independently maybe it's because kids didn't grow up with any financial education they are financially illiterate\nAnd yet about sixty percent of parents say that they taught their children the benefits of investing or really\nOnly half of teenagers agree with that statement so mom and dad you might think\nThat you have given your kids the information that they need to begin investing but chances are you're wrong about that changes are your kids don't agree that you have given them the information and education and device in counseling that in fact that they need is it any wonder\nThat three fourths of parents wish that they had help teaching their children about investing hello here I Am and so I'm really excited to remind you that we have a new book for children\nOn money the squirrels manifesto is being published by Simon and Schuster it's being released in November it's our first children's book Jean and I wrote it together\nWe collaborated with Dave ... who is a fabulous artist he's a former animator for Disney he did such movies of Lion King and beauty and the beast and others and\nIt's lavishly illustrated I'm not sure the contents great but they are is fabulous and we're really excited that this is our first children's book aimed at kids three to six years old\nSo that it's designed to help you teach your children and grandchildren the basic fundamentals of what's most important about money in your children's lives we need to make sure that our kids are growing up correctly and parents you need to recognize\nThe old school notion that when you know the kids are out of college they're out of my life and actually that is not likely to be true you need to recognize your financial support of your children is likely to continue for another decade or two\nAnd you need to factor that in your financial planning and it's rather amazing I'm going to ask you this question do you know the meaning of the phrase savings accounts you know what that is\nI'm sure you do eighty eight percent in a recent survey knew the answer to savings account Seventy six percent could explain what a credit union is\nSeventy two percent know what a net worth is by the way net worth of you're not sure since thirty percent or not you take everything you own and you subtract everything you oh so you take for example your house my miss the mortgage\nBalance so you take your investments your savings and you subtract what you owe to credit cards and loans that your net worth sixty\nSeven percent are able to explain what a recession is are you able to do that you know what a recession is a recession is when the U.S economy has gone backwards\nRhode Island's number one for dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nHalf of Americans know that is it any wonder then only sixteen percent of Americans say they have a high level of financial literacy these kinds of issues and questions faces every single day taxes insurance\nMortgages employee benefits at work buying versus leasing automobiles signing up for credit cards understanding how to establish a bank account and how to balance that bank account estate planning\nAll of these issues regarding retirement planning in college planning affect us on a daily basis and yet most Americans are not able to answer a lot of these basic questions\nAnd we find now as a result of this the kids are growing up in sufficiently prepared for their personal finances forcing mom and dad to help them pay for the wedding pay for their houses pay for their kids' educations\nSeverely impacting the parent's ability to save for their own retirement according to the age way survey\nFive hundred billion dollars a year that parents are spending on their kids who are in their twenties and thirties even paying seriously for their cell phone\nOn top of this who were prices just come out with this annual parents kids and money survey twenty seven percent of parents say they're losing sleep over college costs by the way I think about that\nOnly twenty seven percent you know why I say only twenty seven percent two years ago it was forty two percent two years ago nearly half of parents were losing sleep over college costs now about half\nThat number why is that because parents are far less willing to take on massive student loan debt on behalf of their children\nSo hey parents I ... I'm sleeping just fine 'cause I'm not borrowing the money to get you into college parents are now more willing to send their kids\nTo less expensive schools in order to avoid student loans and all of that is fabulous parents have been around the country are saying this student loan debt is ridiculous one point four trillion dollars in student loan debt in this country more than we owe the credit cards collectively\nAnd it's just damaging the child's ability to get a good start in life it's damaging the parents personal finance is if they co signed those loans or outright paying for them\nAnd so it's a real crisis and yet\nMany parents are still not saving and the best way\nMeaning in a college savings account one third of parents mistakenly believed that they'll lose any money they don't spend in a five twenty non account if the kid doesn't use that money for college that's not true the money isn't lost half a parents think they're contributing to a five twenty nine account will hurt their ability to get financial aid and that's not true either\nAnd here's the worst part you tell me if you had to choose one or the other which would you choose saving for your own retirement or saving for your kid's college\nSeventy four percent say that they would choose to save for their kids college instead of their own retirement that's a huge mistake why\nBecause your kid can pay for college while they're working for the rest of their career but you can't pay for retirement while you were in retirement you must refund your retirement account you must save for retirement first even if it means that child has to find an alternative way to get to college degree\nIf you need help with all of these issues how do you adjust your personal finances to consider the fact that you're going to be spending money on your children for a decade or two longer than you thought if you are struggling to both pay for college and your own retirement\nGive us a call call us a triple eight plan wreck that's triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty two we can help you structure your income and expenses to take best advantage of the resources available to you\nLet us help you like we've helped thousands of folks just like you Tripoli plan wreck poor visit us online at ... dot com that's price Selma\nTop [noise] say we're [noise]\nWe articles on personal finances sign up for re female uptake that Rick Edelman dot com [noise]\nYou're thinking about retirement Social Security pension investments will you have enough income to enjoy yourself and your income last for the rest of your life\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again what board has over one hundred brand new border states we're just one twenty nine per month that's right one twenty nine per month blood as every color every option and everything you're looking for like what auto dot com\nKnow when it comes to principals like financial responsibility a diversification et cetera location dollar cost averaging or or in my case ... and my question is about one of those general principles budgeting\nIf I'm not mistaken you said here as the shows that budgeting is not a very good use of some of the time but the wealth take a look at my case for instance I have two daughters one is eight or so they're all they're on these two years old the youngest one would go to a profit school next year just like they do this\nSo far I've been able to save a little more literal both twenty percent of my income but was this extra expense you don't make kind of just ... I Want to be able to save as much and I'm going to be saving about ... much of a lot on saving health\nAnd a lot I'd like to avoid it without being lied on starting to walk on my budget for just south of Nineteen so I can see where it can cut the expense of my income is pretty much in study I Can't do much about it\nI Know there's not enough just to promise to myself how much I'm going to spend every month but it isn't a place to start some listeners may be facing a similar situation and it suggested for us make a budget turnout\nThanks first time\nWas that was cast her with a really good question about budgets Kim had the very same question let's listen to him\nHi Rick this is Tim from Santa Barbara California\nI Know you don't like budgets I've been listening to you for a long time to blanket statement that I don't agree with and been budgeting myself for Thirty years and it's worked very very well for me I understand your position is that most people just can't stick to budgets okay fair enough but most people can stick to one thing to tell you the truth\nTo me a budget as essential especially for retirement plan you have to do pro forma budget and maybe you could explain Yorkers issued a little bit more than that I Would really appreciate it\nWell I'm happy to reply to both ah both of you to amend the Castro thanks so much for your espresso submission and yeah it's it's a big deal because we all are raised on the importance of a budget and frankly it's a waste of time I know that is what you just degree of hearing me say but here's why I say\nA budget is a promise on how you're going to spend money\nAnd we all know that life gets in the way I'm sure you're not budgeting for the fact that your car\nMight break down in six months you're not budgeting for a medical issue that you don't know you're going to incur you haven't budgeted\nFor a job loss you haven't budgeted\nFor your sister announcing she's getting married and you not only have to buy address but you've got to buy an airline ticket to go to the wedding and you're going to have to buy a president and you're going to have to have to have to have to life gets in the way unexpectedly and that's why budgets rarely work out\nSo there are two things I Want you to do instead of budgeting that are far more effective\nFirst\nOf telling me how you're going to spend your money which is what a budget is you're telling me what you're going to do I want you to go backwards in your checkbook for the past six months or even better one year\nAnd show me how you did spend your money because I'm willing to bet that how you did spend your money over the past year is how you're pretty much going to spend your money over the next year it'll be a far more accurate analysis of what you can reasonably expect your expenses to look like\nSecond decide first and foremost up front how much money you're going to save for the future\nHow much you're going to save for retirement I'm going to say for college how much you're going to save for say home buying or buying a boat or whatever it is you want to save for you tell me how much money you're going to save and in fact more importantly you go ahead and do that once you're saving them enough money to achieve your goals\nI don't really care how you spend the rest of your money it doesn't matter anymore because you've already saved in other words pay yourself first ... once you save money\nYou can spend all the rest of your money and don't worry if you run out of it did you ever noticed that you run out of money the end of the month\nThe problem is you run out of money before you've saved for your future so if you treat yourself as a bill if you treat yourself as a creditor you must pay by participating in your retirement plan at work or sitting in a mutual fund or who knows what\nThen the rest of it goes away and the need for budgeting\nHow would you like ... twenty gene truck of the year for only one

struggling to compete in the marketplace and the reason he says the blame\nHe cast was due to the company's own retirees\nWow Sears has paid over the past five years two billion dollars into its pension plans since it merged with Kmart or no five Sears has paid for and a half billion dollars into pension plans\nFears says according to Lambert if the company had been able to put that money into operations instead of engines\nQuote we would have been in a better position to compete with other large retail companies many of which don't have large pension plans unquote\nAnd here's the crazy thing Sears ended its pension plan back in two thousand six twelve years ago but long time employees and retirees are still entitled to the benefits that they've been promised Sears was once the nation's largest employer\nIt's got eighty nine thousand employees right now what a hundred thousand retirees eligible for benefits under the pension plans and fear says we just can't handle this you

us talk about all this and more importantly what's going on in the retirement security marketplace and what is the field of behavioral finance got to do with all this\nI'm happy to bring on to the

of the ... award for scholarly research on lifelong financial security\n... you're one of those experts that people like me love to quote love to talk about all the time so let me start with a little quiz you're you're going to know the answer to this but I Want to see how well our listeners do in this cute little quiz you're ready for this\nI'm ready so if I were to give you a penny or one in ten chance to win ten cents which would you choose the penny or the one in ten chance to win a dime\nMe I Would pick the one in ten chance that when it died\nYeah I I think most of our listeners will agree with you on that now let me change the question will hear a little bit let's say I were to give you ten million dollars for a one in ten chance to get a hundred million now which would you pick\nNow I'd pick the ten million for sure\nAnd I think most folks would agree with you on that but here's the fascinating thing and of course you realize this in both cases the chances of success or one in ten they haven't changed and since the one in ten hasn't changed your answer shouldn't have changed either\nClassic economics says the both should result in the same attitude but you've demonstrated a very different attitude between the penny versus the ten million dollars and that's the core of behavioral economics isn't it\nYeah that's exactly the court can out next that uh the psychology with which we approached financial decision making often result in different answers that if we were to be purely rational logical and consistent with all of the financial choices we make\nAnd the crazy thing is it Richard Thaler won the Nobel Prize last year for his work and behavioral finance and also there was a Nobel one and two thousand two on the same subject but what took so long for the field of economics to figure this out\nThe fact that humans don't act rationally the markets aren't rational because humans are emotional creatures what took so long for everybody to figure that out why is it only just now finally becoming part of public policy\nThe interesting thing is if you go back and read Adam Smith\nIs often cited as the father of modern economics you as a you know writing back in the Seventeen hundreds or he very much a behavioral economist in the Nineteen thirties and an attempt to to be taken more seriously\nA as a as a science kind of started using mathematical model with people being rational\nSo it's only been I you know more recently that has caused economists to to rethink their model of how people do make decisions as opposed to as opposed to how maybe they should make decisions\nGive me one example of how that's translated into the marketplace affecting ordinary folks\nAh companies are now moving towards automatic enrollment you're

for their retirement savings for every employee in the country and so their savings compared to other nations is huge companies theories of personal finance improve how we think about Social Security and the challenges it's facing\nI think they can so ah one interesting feature of Social Security is that you can start claiming it as early as age sixty two ah but if you wait and start claiming the benefits later your monthly check will be higher\nUm and that creates an incentive a financial incentive to delay claiming but if you can get people to start thinking about reasons why it might be beneficial for them to delay claiming Social Security and to a later age you can get people to uh\nYou know move away from the mindset of oh it's available I ought to take it right away\nThis is a bit of a challenge I remember reading studies where they put a five year old and a room with a candy bar\nAnd they say that the child if you don't eat the candy bar now leader will give you two almost every kid takes the candy bar immediately they don't wait the notion of delayed gratification is really difficult to overcome compared to our desire for immediate gratification\nSo when you say to a retiree how you can have eighty percent of your benefit right now sixty two but if you wait to age Seventy you'll get a hundred and ten percent of the benefit it's really hard for that person to say okay I'll Wait eight more years we overcome that challenge\nI'll say one way you can overcome committed to reframe that decision making and you frame it as if the normal thing to do the regular thing I think that most people do is to wait and we're very cute in to social norms\nSo you know the five year old if they were in a room where all of the other kids were waiting for the second candy bar it'd be much easier for them a two way as well\nYeah and also if we were to say that\nIf you take the money in sixty two you'll be paralyzed in some form of losing some of the money would otherwise be entitled to receive yes\nIt's so exciting to see the science of behavioral finance being applied in very fundamental material practical ways that can have a huge impact on people's lives and by extension the entire Social Security situation are there other changes the policymakers can look out to help us close the retirement savings shortfall\nYes that only about half of the workforce is participating in a four O. one K. plan so\nWe have a number of states that are a setting up um state aid programs\nThat will facilitate savings by workers at these companies that don't offer a four one K. plan in the U.S it's really easy to tap into your money well before retirement and in some countries it's impossible or it's extremely costly to do so\nI'm about forty cents of every dollar that goes into the system is pulled out of their retirement system before people even get to age fifty five so before they're anywhere close to retirement so\nThat the word that gets used to describe this in the industry is leakage we have a lot of leakage and we need to find ways to reduce the amount of leakage and that's going to leave a lot more money in the system uh for the long term which would be a good thing\nSo I'm really glad we've got this kind of thinking going on with the public policy arena\nAnd how can help people despite our own natural tendencies improve or likelihood for achieving the financial security that we've been looking for within talking with Richard Matt ... who's a professor of public policy corporate management at Harvard University and deal with the Brigham Young university is Mary a school of business Bridget thank you so much for joining us on the program today\nMy pleasure\nI'm Rick Edelman you're listening to the gentleman show if you want to

and you can learn more about what we're doing and how you can help [noise] and I were a gentleman this is the truth about money triple a plan read\nThis one is online at rice gentleman on [noise]\n\nOn the one about coming up on direct Edelman\nYou're thinking about retiring\nLooking for work our credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in each bring a generic as that of the best financed region unbeatable prices in cars with zero percent if your for somebody to much you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log on to what auto job\nGenerate the retirement income you need the income you expect\nYou spoke recently of the many advantages of waiting until late Seventy to start collecting Social Security benefits right but you didn't mention two of the biggest reasons that I uh favorite and a\n... way to eight Seventy to get your benefits or is it is ... is a bad advantageous in the meantime uh after full retirement age at least your\nBenefits go eight percent tax free uh where where else can I get ... percent tax free virtually guaranteed unless the government failed that's a good a good thing and even if you do not live long enough what seems to be a concern of many people\nAre tourists have as much a crude benefit as if you had taken Social Security at sixty two uh if you do wait until toward Seventy or at a Seventy you're surviving spouse will get a much larger monthly benefit after you're no longer able to collect them\nI think you're raising really too too very important points Donald I'm really glad you did you get it and that's great are a lot of folks really don't the one thing I Would stress is not merely that you are in this extra eight percent for every year delay starting at your full retirement age of sixty six that begins starting way back at age sixty two\nIn other words if you begin to collect benefits at age sixty two you get eighty percent of what your benefit otherwise would be and if you wait\nA year it'll be eight percent higher you wait another year early another eight percent higher every year all the way the eight Seventy so you're absolutely right\nThere's tremendous value I'll call it delayed gratification many Americans are taking the money at sixty to simply because they don't realize that they don't know that there's a huge economic value to delaying\nAnd so uh it is really interesting now there are some ... that we have to recognize\nThat could impact the decision for folks\nAre not least of which of course some people just frankly need the money they don't have the luxury of waiting eight more years to get their Social Security benefits but assuming it's optional for you\nYou got to take into consideration several things number one are you still working or are you still earning an income because if you earn too much then you could lose some of those Social Security benefits either by claw backs from as I say\nWar the Social Security administration or uh some of the benefits could be taxable so that's one factor another factor is that the benefit you receive could have an impact on what you pay for Medicare\nUh so we have to offset a the benefit you're getting versus the cost you might be otherwise incurring so there are complications that's a shame that the Social Security system is so crazily complicated\nBut fundamentally all of the factors being equal you're absolutely right downloading written any Americans would be better off for so many years by delaying their Social Security benefits\nThis is like a double whammy it's a double benefits and I think you really can't match anywhere else so I'm really glad that you brought this up because uh you you you've been thinking about it a lot you you're right on the money\nAnd I wish everybody else is doing a good his job as you are and we'll pay close attention to what you're saying messages real simple\nBe really careful about when you begin your Social Security benefits do not assume you should take them as soon as you're eligible the longer you wait in many cases the better off you're going to be Donald thanks so much for that phone
