you got about thirty six hours of hope that's going to be right after the parade crash I mean what are the odds now again\nWell there's no city hall plaza says normally he could stand up there and pay everybody the finger\nAt me like I'm not I do if I had said all the things that he had said and then a has a performance and that's what I Would do but I say it though\nLet's say that that was his decision and I was planning to do that sure emotionally pretty impossible after the parade you would think know what I'm saying are starting to be like wow this is the most emotional celebration of life minus maybe a wedding or a birth or something and it's been real about out well no I don't think that's I'm\nSure the David Price even at the parade is still gonna be finger wagging the media and they're you know who now on them in the whole nine and all that stuff funny I put a little something out on Twitter at the real grass everybody's like oh you murder case ... and I'm like no he\nHe's allowed to fire back but what David Price has to realize is you would have been done and over with\nHeavy just said and stuck to the narrative in Houston and just happy to perform I'm happy for my

wait one finger single minute shows up what do you think's gonna happen\nI just really well brash as as a manipulator myself I can appreciate when uh people change and are able to manipulate the narrative with David Price and he's been he's been pretty successful in doing so I Know our president Denison would be very proud that David Price [laughter]\nTurn statistical facts whether people like me would say well he hasn't done it before that's why I don't believe that he can do it up to him on drugs he can't do it\n... I was sitting here waiting for him to not prove me wrong it would have simultaneously proven me wrong right but just prove that he could do it and you're right in terms of holding all the cards now\nCongratulations on the world series congratulations on your great performance and your ... nature that you played in the world series and I say that completely honestly not come back with a bought or anything like that\nThe patriots are going forward 'cause they gotta scored a touchdown you have to pay you to come down and kicked a field goal they would have covered both the touchdown made it pretty easy to take a victory lap\nRight and develop graduate let's play this realistically if New England does come down and kick a field goal I'd be willing to bet dollars to Jonah the buffalo is that allowed in you I'm Manny like late game fashion tomorrow that is true nor meaningless touchdown to crush the hearts of all the better ... I mean it happened in the the Green Bay game this week\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raise the prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what are those are tough\nAh John Fogelman came walking on through or something to that effect\nYeah well this was a this was an interesting one and I encourage you to go to a pro Joe dot com six zero to re PR oh dot com and the pro Joe tomorrow to regrets his grades\nBecause this was a tough game to to break down from this respect it was never in doubt right than any of us watching that game I think\nUh yeah uh the page it's going to lose I didn't like when they when they call that a touchdown there wasn't a touchdown you're not for a second and maybe something might be going on I was going to use them but yeah and\nThey weren't going to pay the bills were just a nap offensively they didn't even get into the red zone I mean that just goes to show how three hundred and Thirteen passing yards can be very Harlow\nA and the bills didn't run it at all ... ... shady McCord ran a twelve times for Thirteen Years\nAnd they ran that hocus pocus Harry\nHighschool bull crap or let's go to the to the wild cat ooh and we'll have a running back handle the ball and a running back coming in that motion all my air really reinventing the wheel there that Brian ... buffalo and ah I mean Joe test or couldn't buy\nOr view why try\nJesus we saw first in a way a test\nJob Lizzie\nAre going to say he spent the whole night trying to sell the hell out of that game and make those bosses happy\nWell which Eighteen to six but a third download stimulus pours no okay so they're allowed is people are leaving in the fourth quarter great so Cornell Patterson gets ten Russia's thirty eight yards and it really didn't work\nThat type of Russia's thirty yards which means if I mess right grass outside of that twenty two yard run right there that would be nine carries for ah sixteen yards or something\nYeah I mean and look I gave the offensive line a really good grading aggressions grades because you you got to think of a couple of things here right\nThere twenty five total carries and two of them went to a whore here from minus two yards\nSo they ran the ball on the road without a starting running back like Sony Michel for twenty three carries for Seventy eight yards that's awful considering it's Cornell Patterson the guy who's very much leading the way but think of this\nThe patriots are so good and the bills are so terrible they willingly went on the road and decided we were going to be almost two to one passed to run\nSo in every third down situation the office of line had to deal with noise\nThey had to deal with communicating Brady had to get him in the rye play\nThey had to make sure that they were protecting Brady enough for him to be able to get the ball off\nIt's tough enough to do at home it's even harder to do on the road so I came away feeling pretty good about this all fence of wind and remember in the second half shack Mason got hurt\nSo Ted terrorists came in and was plenty of budget right guard really in that fourth quarter so you were down into a backup you were already on doing backup right tackle with later in wattle\nBut so your death was already cut down they willingly decided they were just going to pass the ball to be able to beat the bills and\nYeah I think it kinda bogged down in the red zone a little bit so they didn't have the ability to run but at the end of the day was never in doubt the bills are just\nAre JV team they really are and we're Derek Anderson is their quarterback I mean how many times they knock that guy and the shops there was a one hit late midway through fourth quarter I guess I'd say where he got croak and he just lay there for a while\nAnd he must have been thinking themself I'm only getting a million dollars to do that I should I listen to Ross ... stayed at home he was getting ready to play in some regional qualifiers for the U.S openings Tony Romo ended up hanging out of the country club I mean he made some money over the course\nOf his career they play some decent football I mean for a Cleveland brownish type player and he was the panther for awhile and remind him made I'm sure two million living in Charlotte your cost of living a bad there I'm sure this guy doesn't have to turn around and go play\nLike Ross Tucker said it was one of those situations where when the bills came calling it's not as if Derek Anderson and vision himself you know going out and starting a game anytime\nRhode Island's number one for dealer is setting the standard again and again for the board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nPeter meant about God Knows what but instead\nBring it on Derek ... or send your the lucky contestant on what the heck is it yeah\nOn what am I doing with my life oh yeah there are cameras that has made like thirty three point two million dollar house very often encroach area of him geez I forgot this\nHe uh in twenty ten he had a two point five million signing bonus to go to Arizona ... and they kept him around on four million dollar salary the next year to play football yeah wow yeah pretty good yeah oh wow\nHe had a signing bonus in a way to seven million oh yeah this guy's got plenty of do sort of stay at home he should've stayed home and you know what he was he made the majority of his money before two thousand twelve\nSo it's been sitting in the bank and they have money for him I lost it in the bubble now or wait no already had a lot of money in mortgage backed securities instead well it was ... and see him GI ... I'm from Iran member seem GI\nField before it became George said now I looked at Fifteen that's um\nThree sacks last night the patriots defense got again it it you know I hate to say\nThey went in with a limited game plan because they knew that can be buffalo but to me that's exactly what they did they went in with a limited game plan\nThey didn't pounded with James White they didn't expose him to injury they handed it to them in a couple of times I mean it was alright Cornell where if you get hurt your expendable so\nI was just gonna say they have no trouble exposing them to and I know and say I blame them no I mean yeah I'm I'm with you and look I think that would\nBe in the locker room and I know this didn't happen but how great would've just be if bill got up there was like oh we don't want to gyms get hurt so ah ah Cordell got put you in there because you know you get hurt you know [laughter]\nYou're going on or and you still get your money yeah and we don't want it for me because we're going to anyway at the end of the year ... James and want to give it hurt but according to go ahead\n[noise] [noise] ... he turns around he walks out I'm really act like a\nPlay from according was fantastic and it's one of the few plays the Jason wouldn't actually broke down really well\nTalking about how they went to outside leverage and then ... basically they ... percent into that throw ... cuts across and then he ends up taking it to the house I mean this was this was I think from an injury standpoint uh get through game however there are some things that concern me number one\nBronco told\nMe last night was the first night where I watch drunk and I said you know he looked old and maybe a cold night in Buffalo back injury might be something there\nMaybe it was circumstantial the bills also made sure that they were not going to allow grown to beat them\nThey should let grumpy and let them have some sort of homecoming somebody was going to beat them grass at least let somebody made them that's going to create a a a nice atmosphere for all the fans there that are probably a little doubt\nThat sells a Josh corn with a couple of catches ... and by the way ... um oh\nI don't know where all wrap sheet was getting that from\nBut that was a I mean for his words even come out on a carpetbagger radio today and say uh yeah you'd have to go check with a report on that one well that's one of those where it came pretty clearly came from someone on the outside of the organization and I know during the broadcast last night\nSo did mention that he had heard that maybe are Gordon was late for a couple of things I\nI again maybe bell checks to stone soft I have a hard time by that I Do because bell check has always been a stickler about that kind of stuff and there's no way in my opinion there's no way ballot check\nAllows him to be who served in front of the team by Josh Josh Gordon showing up late\nYeah who was it a Dell assignments that he ... with the the Jetsons comments who was that in the\nOcean or you know what a way yes it was a deal is Thomas I think Randy Moss was late at night one night a Dale is Thomas and there was one other defensive player who really meant nothing and I think that's the guy who ended up getting cut\nI forgot my pin daddy and others Sharma Getty coming up next one of the things I'm going to ask him the world series MBP the media didn't job him he'll explain it next grass show\nWhen I was born on W.

C. S. and the fact that it was a against the ... or ...\nIt it of itself you know gives it its own special quickly but then you factor it but it was for the chip in eighty six year old to me nothing will ever\nHow would you like motor joins twenty Eighteen trunk of the year for only one Ninety nine brought well say hello to forge twenty Eighteen Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for only a blood forward and he joined Narragansett\n... the signature Red Sox championship or at least of the modern era I'm that separate itself or the you know the two thousand Thirteen will always\nOr for a guy in his thirties to be looking for probably a four year deal is not a five year deal that you know close to a hundred million dollars for closer um I think that money could probably spend elsewhere now having said that they don't have a closer on their roster they don't have that he would have done it\nAnd they're either going to have to put their faith in somebody rolling into the job but maybe that's Ryan Frasier it baby if Matt Barnes um or they're going to have to go out and find somebody else either either be a trade or free agency I just think you can do it at a cheaper\nA figure than you would to try to resign chemical um above the I think it's got to be someone that they were very much like the heat but his value is now wait greater ... that it was at the start of the post season uh he's got to make a lot of money and\nGood for him now who's kicked around with five different organizations that had his setbacks with John surgery and all that um but when you look at you know the red Sox minor league system they still don't have a ton of pitching ... near the big league level reading your view\nOn sale sign for only one more year imports cello coming up for free agency after next year\nOr to me you know\n... to keep somebody like of all the uh is important so I I think they're pretty hard after him depending on where the market takes it won't you know\nTo a lesser extent you have Kelly in Pearce a couple of guys I think that it's fair to say they like to have back but they're not going to break the back for you either of them\nAnd then finally Sean I Know that they're they're getting deep into the arbitration years with guys like Zander Bogart ten ... bats and of course this off season teams have been loading up\nTo have their opportunity at many Machado a or Bryce Harper out of Washington we know that there could be I don't know if somebody get Bryce Harper three hundred three hundred and fifty million dollars if you're Mickey bats\nDo you just play out one more year of arbitration or I don't know from the other end if you're the red Sox [laughter]\nDo you have to try to get a deal done to keep the numbers down before the end it breaks floating with those two guys in free agency seems like the red Sox are in a bad spot relative to Milky it's just a really a matter of I I guess how much does make you really want to stick it to him and get every dollar you can\nYeah I mean uh just to be cleared he's got two more years of controlled okay let's all until after twenty twenty so it's not quite as in the moment [noise] um but look this is the guy who was arguably a not arguably he is\nIn arguably one of the three or four best players in the game you could say arguably the best\nUh along with my ... a couple of other guys um and he is going to be paying attention to what happens to guys like a um a shot I Would bet this winter and and that's going to help set up to the bar for him a couple of years so\nUh they have made overtures before to try to get him locked up by out some arbitration seasons he has rejected that both sides say that there are you know there's no animosity it's not like ... feels\nLike they're low ball again but it's not like the red Sox believe these representatives are being unreasonable they just haven't gotten to that number and maybe from a philosophical standpoint on his side they\nDon't want to get to that number maybe they want to go year to year maximize his verdict potential uh I I think I saw a little bit about betrayed rivers does arbitration projections and I think Moody's number was somewhere up or a fourteen billion dollars\nFor for next year and get a little will be go up for twenty twenty so\nHe's probably going to be close to thirty five billion dollars that arbitration or the next two seasons before it has to worry about free agency\nOn a it's a little different with guys like a folk arts and Bradley and not that I'm putting Bradley in that same category all clearly Bogart some bats are more valued players but they're both left presented bus stop\nHow would you like motor trench twenty gene truck of the year

who Harkin someone's backyard it's nuts well let's get to what we saw last night which honestly mark really wasn't much um I kind of felt that the patriots went in sort of tying part of one arm behind their back\nNot really setting themselves up to run the football very consistently almost two to one ratio passionate run\nTo me it kind of felt like they went in saying okay we know when we need to do what we need to do to score we can do it let's just try to get outta here as healthy as we can I Know the bills that a good job in the red area and the first half\nBut I don't know market didn't feel like the patriots really went all out to try to hang our number last night on the bills\nHow I felt when I when I started down to a high tower was an active travel on the sidelines when when he wasn't playing I was like a proper crude confident they can beat the bills and they just don't want to risk\nDante having you know any further injury to his knee and then yeah you could tell Paterson started fell back behind or hanging up on that one of my all right interesting\nI I didn't expect that and yeah it was it was bizarre because I feel like the past when they're thinking they're obviously going to win but they probably didn't expect the struggle as much in the red zone\nAt it perhaps they just underestimate the bill defense in a sense because they struggle with a lot more than I thought they would now can't run the ball economic difficult require gate and that's what happened but yeah it was just it was really honestly ... one of the ...\nUm it was it was bizarre ... man buffalo\nBuffalo yeah weird things happen up there mark Daniels or the problem of journals with me here on the ground show on WNPR our read all marched great work\nIn the pro Joe and at Providence Journal dot com or defensively though I thought they acquitted themselves pretty well now again it's against maybe a historically bad all fence\nAnd it just goes to show that you can have three hundred yards passing as a team and they did that between two quarterbacks before they were pretty hollow yards for the most part I was shocked when I looked at the game but mark\nAnd saw that the bills didn't even get into the red zone last night\n[laughter] yeah I think that's probably the biggest like positive with your ... your since we're good again about opponent right go up against the owners want the funk there are more for flowers and Calvin in order to stand out I think they did that\nAnd hopefully they can carry that positive moment of the ... the ... agreement of ... you go to the plate with football but I I caught a couple of guys definitely put very well and I think for flowers is definitely coming on how the staff members the Concorde but one of the that's where we'll all take with them\nAnd really um the current Gilmore continues to play like uh I Would say of a pro bowl quarterback and you don't give it against I don't go away you know batteries for problems on a little girl\nI think you know positive moment ... ... with a good thing going kind of cat will pop back 'cause this is ... ... who could quite a while or you could do it because\nYou can play well against the team or the patriots won't make it to the next Super Bowl ... how ... they might not make\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln MTC Lincoln Lincoln MTC and the all new twenty gene Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of never against such funds here alone luxury impeccable surfers\nIn and let's see if they can actually do they um [noise] uh I'm not you know really terrible opponent this weekend because they're under syndrome yeah surprising to see the box or the right almost a hundred yards that that's kind of thing\nOr what is the truth is you know wage relative to ...\nThey don't it's funny um I I don't know for the discipline stuff but from I don't really know what you do with um in in weight on Saturday and for those who don't know who to who were on the one they also they fly them out of ... they don't like the airport like normal cold actually ... on a bus\nAfter like they both are good so they go through kind of thirty and they get on a bus that goes to the gate looking on their private charter a plane\nAnd from my understanding on Saturday or a boss when you're cleaning golf sporting with weight that's that's my understanding and I do that to be the truth\nI'm Kevin Duffy the Herald reported that he was also with the meeting ... from that but it's it's it's really really interesting and it's sort of bizarre kind of in Buffalo but\nIt seems to me like there wasn't an issue within the way I don't know why he wasn't disciplined because almost anyone who's later this one's on last year or say not brown\nI sat at a quarter after ... and being led to a team meeting drove there was this lake I sent home wasn't allowed to practice during his grade was late got sent home was an active\nI'm Alan grand sort of ACT UP they flew somewhere without 'em ... shoot a few years active they flew to San Francisco without um so it's not unheard of for a team to discipline the player that upper lake and from what I understood what I understand just corn was late so\nI don't know why he played them and maybe it was not the news leaked right maybe pulled out like you didn't want it out there and like I don't play them I don't know it's it's bizarre it's just really really strange that whole thing but it's something a month or because I was on certainly has a I'm a history of this type of thing\nAs you are looked around the league today there was a lot of rumblings about the patriots being in it for different of wide receivers where it was ... whether it was dumb areas Thomas or golden paid\nTo the best year knowledge mark and they didn't get really serious in terms of the page you're bringing in another patch cancer or maybe a defensive player\n[noise] it it certainly sounds like they're having conversations with the Broncos yard he reported they're offering a fourth round pick what they want Broncos some of the money that's interesting to me I'm On the fact that they were looking at the marriage Thomas ... tells you they have some concerns Josh Gordon Gould they both\nAre or an extra Steve or the threats are both big do you need to marry is Thomas ... no no I mean having them on the sale at the same time with interesting but the whole thing\nAll these rumors with them in golden Tate and different receivers that\nIt's it's I don't know I'm going to go back and say it's bizarre does get Edelman back trade for Josh sport and you know drunk is playing after injury and was back you have guys there a lot like\nOffering you know a third fourth round pick for these guys some something else going on I Would I Would think but you know did anything close you know who knows then nothing happens that fortunately I I really thought that what though it seemed like they were doing a lot of prep work for this week so you know it always takes too though Bill Belichick always that takes two teams which are\nMore dangerous for the Providence Journal with me for a few more minutes here on the ground show on WNPR oh you can read march we're covering the patriots Providence Journal dot com or and in the journal so sad as choose me Sunday they get the Green Bay Packers coming into huge alleged stadium and\nI maybe you have a better answer than I Do\nYou know what version of the Green Bay Packers are we going to get and I know the Packers having a league quarterback to do you still view them mark is any lead football team\n[noise] a such a good question because every year my um corporate ... said that we like\nAfter me and I I Want to\nDo about ... never it never happened you know I mean I\nListen to the attackers played the clip well last was it when they lost that ran for the last twenty nine twenty seven pregnant no you lose by the rams solid but they've just been so up and down I mean obviously they lost the line\nSo to it or that are really that law when the red in\n... we didn't set up a bill really twenty to this this is a weird weird what ... do we get I don't know I imagine with Aaron Rodgers that it's going to the game regardless of their you know three three and one record you know are they in a league team it doesn't look like it though\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nAwesome Arab to begin\nI think so I think he has one more week will go practice and the next ... be active it it certainly seems like that's a it's a tough ... growing up it gets a lot of flak down here\nBut it worked really hard and soft and they look good in the summer it's been training and I mean you know the recording for the burden upon but you've got to be occurring grown in the last for a while you play games and now are an injury and on the hour but stuff\nGoing on right eye on her got stuck around the globe that around and like oh about ... ... ... what it could actually go into the deaf block quarterback\nIn college football or are are going to be at ... ... ...
