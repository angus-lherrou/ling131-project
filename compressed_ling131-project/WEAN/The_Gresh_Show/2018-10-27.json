R. E. S. H. there through the top of the first\nRed Sox and LA scoreless in game three of the world series\nI got Walker below to throw like thirty pitchers so does that\nWell there is that so I mentioned that if Tom Brady throws four touchdown passes this week he will tie Brett Farr on the all time touchdowns list Peyton Manning in at five thirty nine so you know how far\nA Brady has to go Roach did you know ... with five points on Sunday at Oakland [noise] Adam even a Terry would surpass pro Football Hall of famer Morton Anderson as the leagues of all time leading scorer\nI did not know that but uh I as a youth grass I very much enjoyed when both Martin and Gary Anderson would take against each other in those ... falcons Viking games back in the day so a big fan of both Morton in Gary Anderson so that's a record I Will be watching closely over the week of course I like Adam ... as well\nYeah Martin Andersen two thousand five hundred and forty four points Adam ... two thousand five hundred and forty I Do believe both more and Gary with the single bar\nAs well\nAt least one of them no no they both did for a while you're you're a million percent right on that in fact Gary ... and have the single bar when he missed that field goal in what was it eighty\nOr excuse me Ninety Ninety eight Ninety eight yeah what I\nHad one last the idol Cunningham biking or no in fact it transmits I was against yeah yes and and I think that neither of them had missed or something like that going into that yeah\nAnd then they ah up an eight and basically kept him out of the super bowl yeah ah and that's one of Dan ... did they tried to dance the dirty\nBirds courage them all innocent made a the dirty bird famous it's no if\nYou shovel that's for sure uh for some stuff to look for here in the NFL this week including Arizona wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald\nDid you know that in terms of receiving yards Larry Fitzgerald is third all time in NFL history I did not know that he is one hundred and thirty five yards behind Terrell\nOwens I knew he was second or excuse me he's one thirty four if he gets one thirty five he goes into second\nAnd then he's got a ways to go to get to the twenty two thousand eight Ninety five of Jerry right yeah but this year Larry Fitzgerald will ah take his rightful place as he will soon be a hall of famer once he retires getting the second on these yards list\nNow I did not get updated numbers but I Know Frank Gore did touch the football last night but I don't think it was enough for him\nTo pass are you ready for this Barry Sanders\nIn terms of career scrimmage yards in his fourteen NFL seasons heading in the last night Frank Gore was it Eighteen thousand eighty seven yards from scrimmage Barry Sanders is an Eighteen\nThousand one hundred and Ninety Gore got fifty yards from scrimmage last nine fifty three rushing and five or six\nOkay so he is still behind Barry Sanders All right so he's going to pass Barry Sanders this year he will probably pass la Damien Tomlin send this year who is Eighteen thousand for fifty six so right now Frank Gore\nIs sevens in NFL history in terms of yards from scrimmage ... here's who's in front of him okay can I say a couple of cats as well I gave you bury Sanders in la Damien Tomlin said give me the next four wow the next four I Would have to think one of them's Marshall fall he is fourth\nIs another one of them Roger Craig know now that I'm done [laughter] ah\nOne's pretty easy it's not Curtis Martin isn't no we mention number one\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nWalter ... nerd Ben Marshall folk with Damian Tom Watson Barry Sanders\nAll those guys hall of famers yep well Frank or be a hall of fame yeah see well interesting I kind of agree with you\nIt's because and this is what I dislike about another Frank or isn't deserving grass yeah but if everyone that was voting followed along closely to Frank Gore's career throughout his career no he would not make it into the hall of fame\nBecause he was never an important enough player or to be worthy of a hall of fame all a very good absolutely but what's gonna happen gradually it's at the end of his career\nWas born he was actually born uh in Nineteen Seventeen believe it or not um [noise]\nAnd uh you know Auburn once was a thriving factory town and then over the course of many decades time kind of forgot it uh it was known as the prison city and the ... the uh first\nA in a use of the electric chair or was that was done in Auburn New York and uh\nAuburn has a maximum security potential penitentiary and now the course of a recent years down the finger like beautiful it's a really if you're part of the country a lot like western mass in the ... and um and I often misunderstood because of the old cities that are you know and so much from back offering his place that uh\nYou know I I didn't really want to be a one once I got to college age I wanted to get as far away from there as possible and I did go run and realize you know what a it was a good place to grow up in ... you know a lot of areas and that part of the statement that part of the country it's not really just similar to a lot of the towns in our area as well\nAs we continue Bob so see this is your life can you tell us what it was like to be a part of the Nineteen eighty five New York state champion Jamaica the from Auburn ice [laughter]\nDid you did you call up the uh with the ... I ...\nI did have a job that yours is vandalized about fat jokes learning Mandarin to order ethnic how you got nothing on me that brine\nWell they've got they've got to be a few short jokes in there as well I'm sure\nYou know what I wanted to put those in personally [laughter] I'm gonna\nI'm going to backtrack a year and go back to the Nineteen eighty four New York state classic baseball's championship in\n... in New York state when I was in high school or the classes were not won a five to eight three eight et cetera they were bc be\nAn a and so we were a large school with a nationally ranked bought that's worth I don't know how they determine in collegiate baseball magazine and USA Today with the top twenty five high school baseball team twice the country but we're actually actually nationally ranked in my junior and senior years\nAnd has a junior we played orchard park high school or to park of course the home of the bills\nAnd Ralph Wilson stadium and the stunt player for orchard park was a guy by the name of Dave Holland and you may remember Dave Holland's as the third baseman and part of macho row\nWith the un actually championed the Philadelphia Phillies and later played for a couple of other teams and and a lot of going at a Scottish but scouts for many years in baseball you may have one point or work for the red Sox even I I Know I've seen him\nOn a lot in my minor league baseball travels but that was as a junior and senior after losing the state championship an extra ... ... the year before and we end up winning and a a another extreme game I think over [noise]\nWife injures falls New York or catch them high school way up north and the uh in nearly a maniac in the Canadian reaches of New York state or we were just a\nA you know we're able to pull that one out as opposed to the year before and play with a really a great team we had a a catcher who was going to AAA got as far as ... lay with rose my best friend that time and\nA shortstop for the team marked ... uh became a a very good baseball scouts man is the former record player development for the Florida Marlins vice president ... Florida Marlins\nWon the world series right with them and then in two thousand and seven got World Series rank as a special ... Red Sox and now works for the evil empire in New York so I was a great time I I wasn't exactly the best baseball player I was one of those all glove had guys even as a high school kid but\nAnd it was a great experience and uh you know lo and behold many years later I got a jet hell about it with your listeners\nWhile this is pretty amazing yeah Bob ... the best pitcher and offer in high school\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than any dealer around because we're a survive buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours more gone too far high car buyers on\nThe sand and their future and often the\nWell I'll tell you what do we had we had some pretty good pictures we had a staff is pretty deep I mean I'm sure you're listening is telling you rate uh\nWe can't even Bob worried are talking about the patriots hanging I think the on the buildings or Bob so see this is your life for crying out loud I mean how\nLong I think our number one left do you want to playing when if you briefly and then eventually I with the University of Arkansas you he could run he wasn't he was he was a pretty good pitcher but he was a better outfielder off but he could probably around the triple auction or at least one some of the army oh right and and and do very well with those uh but uh\nYou know I look at the let's say look look at the bills they got a good defense despite what happened last week of Indianapolis they gave up with over two hundred yards rushing to the Colts but this is a team that had to defend short fields as regularity all season long the bills have a you had more turnovers\nTouchdowns offensively they've scored offensively ... by October early yet the aren't does she has a team of eighty want to take away that you take away the in over in Minnesota\nAnd in the first half of games and they've been a shutout now four times in the first house of ... within the last two weeks they scored a hundred and ten to Thirteen and all that being said they've used three different quarterbacks of course Peter ... uh once again to getting a chance to start a little bit this year and and really struggling\nA Josh Alan ... a big rocket guy with a big army and certainly he ran well against the Viking their best game by far to date and as you meant Derek Madison signed off the street a couple of weeks ago and pressed into starting duty for the first time\nTwo thousand six team in the last game and I ... I think the only hope for the bills\nAll in all fake missed on Monday Night is is some help from the patriots and when you look at the paths over the last few weeks even though they won for in a row and they've been on an ice wall when Kahler they've committed some careless turnovers and they've made some uncharacteristic mistakes be it by giving the ball away or having breakdowns\nIn different facets of the game or or with penalties\nSo you know it's going to be an active crowd of the bills are are you know playing a ... at two and five on trying to answer a lot of critics don't shopping centers to me already up in western New York's by making the playoffs last year or they've been heavily criticized this week with their lack of effort perceived\nAnd the media in by fans of life from what I've seen\nAnd uh you know I think that it it it's a game where the bills are in a lot of ways they're going to play the Superbowl or at least for the first half of the season I'm not against the patriots the first time they've poster Monday Night football game two thousand ...\nBob so see with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh Bob from the patriots and\nAh what are you expecting do they try to pound they do they spread 'em out and throw it I mean it's almost like whatever they choose against the bills they go out and they executed and they and they had had an unprecedented run on six cents against this team you know I almost really wonder if it matters\nBecause the bills that just had an amazing inability to stop the patriots over the years regardless of what they do\nYeah it's it's it's really true you know we were without Tom Brady they've they've done it a few times most notably in that game of years ago and you know uber set hours quarterback a couple of seasons now\nA but you're you're buying the bills the record for the patriots against the built a during the course of the ... ready to run\nA is kind of parallel to what Notre Dame is to do the navy and Oklahoma Kansas and the college drink 'cause it's like a dominant\nCollege series where you know state you beat up on you know the smaller branch campus year after year and that's met with no disrespect to the built and this is just unprecedented really in modern times in the NFL you have a series so lopsided a and\nThe patriots you know have been able to do it and a lot of different ways one of the things to your your first question that concerned me about this game is no Sony Michel in all likelihood of course you have James White Kenyan barter him in Kansas for those who have been a practice player of the week up on the practice squad\nUp but the questions as well with Rob ... situation and going into buffalo you know are they gonna be able to run the ball on that event because I I think the bills obviously gonna look to shore things up they got paid a lot on the edges last week running with multiple tied ends in in in Indianapolis in a really nice job ah with their their one game\nA outside against the bills I eat you know I think patriots in this contest or are more apt to try to spread it out in the Brady do his thing uh in particular with the way Chris Hogan and Josh Gordon uh have have really come along the compliment what Julian Edelman is done and again a lot of it depends on on on the the situation with\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed

also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nAnd now that I've learned the why you'd say well this is so close to your heart I guess you can ignore and so lack has told me the eighty year old women Mooney you in the part of it because you're not hearing\nThat a little bit of an exaggeration and almost got in all the years but I was from New York and I all the bills fans eat a lot of what we see in in the in the satellite parking lot especially I think the builders organization of really tried to crack down on\nI'm On the antics and and the loot behavior that builds mafia has become infamous four and a lot of social media circles\nOr their their fans are devoted and their support his unwavering there are a lot like the fans in Cleveland and some other rust belt cities\nWhich haven't had a lot of success in recent years would have been great football cities for a long long time and you know I as a as a broadcaster you go into the stadium old rich stadium will they feel\nAnd it's a it's a great place to call it ... it's like a college environment first of all it it it's an old or shoot type stadium so it's got great acoustics and great sight lines as a broadcaster\nAnd the fans are fervent and obviously it's by the patron figure because the the success with that the average you've talked about but it's a great place to watch a game and all the game I guess I Would say that if somebody is in the in the shelter but broadcast yelling or dealing with some of those bands when they get at their most obnoxious especially the ones who really moved up but\nUh we really need you to get out of the race\nAnd I question him a little bit it was a total shut up I got to call the week before from a woman from in the number was from Washington saying to me

with us we're going to start with the most important the most impactful conversation of all those subjects\nThe lottery oh please did you buy a lottery ticket seriously\nMean I guess I mean how could you not so much fun right I mean people who don't normally buy lottery tickets\nBought lottery tickets this past week because it was one point six\nBillion dollars and it's you know I I it's just kind of crazy the odds of winning where one in three hundred million which is roughly you know the one person out of America because there's about three hundred million of us\nThat was roughly the odds of winning and let's not get carried away okay was one point six billion actually but the actual number was one point five three seven\nTo be you know technical about it but you know roughly one point six billion dollars but no no no no no no it wasn't that's if you took it as an annuity if you took the money in equal installments over twenty nine years\nYou would end up receiving a total at one point six billion dollar so but no you wouldn't be taking that you'll take the lump sum you'll give me\nThat's eight hundred and Seventy eight million not one point six billion it's only eight hundred and Seventy million average it's taxable\nSo if you incur the tax which you will thirty seven percent federal income tax and the winner was in South Carolina there's a seven percent state income tax\nPro scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\nI was never that good at football gave up by the time I got to college\nBut he also learn how to cook it saved them a lot of money

excited to welcome forty new affiliate radio stations to the recovery and show we're now broadcasting this program to eighty five\nRadio stations across the country or this program is the longest running national personal finance radio show in the nation are talkers magazine has ranks\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit ladder of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nAirs weekends only ah so we're very excited to be welcoming all of you who are listening to the Rick Edelman show for the first time\nAnd uh we're gonna be talking about the stock market right now and and the reason that this is such a a big deal conversation\nA is because you've got money invested and that's what we do for a living or at our organization uh we manage a lot of money for a lot of folks all across the country a bearings his ranch our from the number one independent investment advisory firm in the nation\nAre and we're very honored by the barons ranking and we um want to share with you the advice and information that we provide to our own clients and I'm sure you've been acutely aware of what's been going on in the stock market this past week\nVolatility has returned but regardless of that we do have to acknowledge the facts and the fact is that as a result of the volatility this week year today\nThe Dow Jones industrial average is down one percent the S. and P. five hundred stock index is down one percent the easy index which is the index of foreign stocks that the Europe Australia and far eastern index is down twelve percent for the year\nIt's not just that the down yes in pay and the ISI are down one percent one percent twelve percent it's actually even worse than that\nThere are thirty stocks and the Dow Jones industrial average sixty percent of them are down ten percent or more from their hives civil though the overall Dow is only down one sixty percent of those thirty socks\nEighteen of them are down ten percent or more in the U.S and the five hundred the absentee itself is down one percent for the year but eighty percent of the S. and P. five hundred\nWe're talking four hundred of the five hundred stocks\nAre down ten percent or more from their hides\nIn the ISI Ninety percent are down ten percent or more from their hives and the NASDAQ\nEighty seven percent of the stocks and the NASDAQ are down ten percent or more from their eyes so if you look at your market performance recently you see some pretty substantial declines year to date\nIt means that we have had all the profits\nAccumulated so far this year from January one for the end of September those\nGains have been largely wiped out the Dow down one the U.S and the down one iffy down twelve and it's not just limited to that\nGold is down six percent year to date the real estate market\nAs measured by the ... real estate index down four percent for the year the bond market as measured by the Barclays aggregate bond index\nDown four percent for the year pretty much everything everywhere is down oh not everything oil is up all of them ... percent\nDemonstrating the critical importance of diversification not everything always goes down simultaneously some stuff goes up while other stuff is going down the problem is you can't predict what that will be we don't know what's going to go up next we don't know what's going to go down next so instead of making a\nBig bet we diversify\nWe diversifying two ways we diversify among asset classes yes you on stocks but yes you should also I'm bonds and you should also own foreign securities and you should also alone commodities and oil and gas and natural resources and precious metals\nAn exponential technologies we should have a highly diversified portfolio because their safety in numbers instead of having twelve eggs in one basket have one egg in each of twelve baskets this way if you break that is the first point of diversification the second point\nIs that when you do decide you're going to invest some of your money into stocks that you buy as many stocks as you can notice I said that in the S. and P. five hundred\nThe index itself is down one percent for the year but eighty\nOf the stocks have lost ten percent or more in the recent weeks eighty percent of them are down ten percent and just a few weeks even though the index itself is only done one person for the year and that's the point instead of trying to pick individual stocks and hoping that they do better than the index you're better off\nOwning a market instead of trying to beat the market because the academic data is very clear\nActively managed mutual funds\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator fought Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nThey've been dismal track record the overwhelming majority of active managers fail to beat their index they failed to beat the benchmark\nAnd it doesn't matter what stock sector we're talking about big stocks midsize stocks are small stocks growth stocks are value stocks us stocks versus foreign stocks doesn't matter it also doesn't matter what time period you look at you could look at your date you could look at the past year three year five years seven year ten year it doesn't matter what time period you look at\nThis data is consistent\nFund managers are notoriously unable to beat the market and here's what makes it even worse even when you find a manager there does succeed at feeding the market that manager is unable to duplicate their success so while there will be some managers who do beat the market they aren't the same managers year after year after year so if you pick\nThis year the manager that did best last year\nThey're not going to be able to repeat their success it's a different manager that does it and that's why instead of trying to beat the market it's better to be the market\nThird\nMaintain a long-term perspective focusing on not the market not politics not policy not the fed but focusing instead on your goals why are you investing in the first place what are you trying to accomplish is it to get a kid in the\nColleges that to prepare for your own retirement is to take care of aging parents why are you investing that determines for us\nHow much money you're going to need how much money do need to achieve those goals how much will college cost how much will your retirement costs how much will cost of care for mom\nOnce we know how much those things will cost and when we're going to encourage those bills now we could work backwards do some calculations to say\nHere so much money you need to be saving and here's the rate of return you need to be earning and in order to get that return at a reasonable expectation here's the investment strategy here's the mix up investments the asset allocation necessary that makes sense\nIf you're not approaching your investment strategy in that way you might be doing it wrong and that's why we encourage you to focus on it and that way if we can help call us a triple eight plan wreck\nThat's triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty

seven five to sixty seven forty two and online at ... dot com that's rice gentleman dot com but said right after the questions okay we're talking to Mike He sent in the question to ask wreck\nAt ... dot com Hi Rick ... Mike from Evanston, Illinois [noise]\nI've learned to things from listening to you over the last Twenty years number one I can retire and the custom I'm used to when approximately three percent of my savings will cover my annual expenses\nNumber two thanks to exponential technology middle live longer than ever and probably should plan on having my retirement money last until I'm at least a hundred and Twenty years old\nSo my question is how do I count for inflation in my annual expenses and the calculation of retirement cost I found a a inflation calculator on the Internet she told me if my current monthly expenses in three thousand fifty years from now when I'm only a hundred and ten\nMy monthly cost will be ten thousand dollars\nAnd this is after I've been withdrawing from my savings for fifty years [noise] so do I need three percent of my savings to cover ten thousand dollars given the high likelihood of inflation when it's costing me three thousand dollars now\nOr how do I have very this over time do I need to work longer save more keep my investments in a more aggressive mode to cover the cost of inflation is is how we're going to compensate for potentially up to six years of inflation\nMike your right to all three in other words your ear over complicating this a little bit ah\nInflation will take it's toll overtime but there is nothing new about that inflation is taking them taking toll overtime for as long as there's been times we all know that everything is more expensive today than it was fifty years ago and everything will be more expensive than it is today fifty years from now so there's nothing new there so\nDon't worry about it in other words history tells us that a diversified investment portfolio\nEarns more over long periods of time than the inflation rate now there's no assurance that that'll be true in the future but that's the basis on which all investment strategies are built there is no reason to believe it won't be true in the future although we can't promise that are guaranteed hit so on that assumption which is what it is\nYou can assume that your investments will grow overtime at a rate faster than the rate of inflation which is how your nest egg in the future will be big enough that when you withdraw three percent or four percent a year from the portfolio it'll produce the income you need even if your income as a whopping ten grand imam\nWhich by the way is the amount of income some people need even today so don't worry about it you were ever complicating but let's shift over to the second half of your question how do you make sure you have enough money so that you can withdraw three percent a year to pay your bills no matter how how those bills how might happen to be\nYou asked do you work longer
