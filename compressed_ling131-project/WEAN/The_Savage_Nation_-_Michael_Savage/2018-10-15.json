just looking at that a diary killed touchdown again it wasn't as if he beat everybody defensively it was a big long pro buddy caught at somewhere around the thirty five and finish the plane itself man him and Kareem Hunt [laughter] are nasty yeah in Travis Kelsey I say this the patriots defense in a better job keeping image jak like\nYes absolutely as early on he was sort of having an impact yeah\nAnd uh it wasn't really that great of a night for anyone from Rutgers uh in the second there um but again\nYou know you're going to give credit where it's due to some of these guys like hill and like ... because they're just they're so fast they're almost unstoppable yeah a lot of speed on that team patriots events\nYou know you can't afford it points it's hard to say you had a good night but I don't feel like they had a terrible night no does that make sense I'm with you because it getting high tower made a bunch of impact yeah he's a upfront salt like wise was kind of impact will same for a for trade flowers at times like it wasn't there wasn't any glaring\nI wanted to throw my remote through the television type of plays defensively you know look again you've got to give credit to the speed of that Kansas City ... it wasn't all that great for anyone from Rutgers weather was harming a pick up a corny\nBut still that's on Kansas City too you know that's a damn good team offensively\nSix one Seventy seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five the phone number if you want to jump on board we get to your calls on just a moment patriots gotta win forty three forty on the last second field goal by Stephen ...\nAh after driving the football and Rob Gronkowski came up big\nLate in his game uh there was a moment on the field with the game was ending when the game was wrapping up after the fuel goes good Rob Rob Gronkowski bill ... met for a minute and he was getting on the old Atta Boy you know for him also post game bill ballot jak Andy Reid I think there's a lot of respect between those two guys\nAre sort of had a genuine meeting you know out on the field where I wasn't just a quick by or do they seem to talk for for a couple of seconds they're\nWell that makes sense didn't they always have that for a stretch there especially when he was the head coach Philadelphia they have those token trades that they would do with ... round picks you remember that yeah so there was a there was a moment there and then a Tom Brady and patch for homes on the field\nWell I've been a quarterback meeting so you know again for nurses young right there for anyone that do that I Know it's a small sample size just five games coming in the kid is his looks you know like you know the new seen 'em in the league but\nHow do you not do that after seeing what he did tonight but the real deal yeah the arm is everything about him is ridiculous and look he ... it looked like the moment might have been too big early in this game he missed a lot of throws they could have gone up early ... no you mentioned you mentioned high\nTower when he missed starting to my mom's now when he missed Kareem on oh gosh I mean that was high tower who is three yards behind them yeah and that was that was a touchdown points on the board yeah\nSo yes maybe they would agree you had to pick early I'm drawing harm it with the picking the end zone so you did have some place that\nThey looked at it and thought yeah maybe maybe he's not you know going to be able to handle the situation second half was really in a lot of ways that tell them to have yeah because the patriots come up kicking feel goals in the second half you know they scored points late here but it was all feel goals were the patriots outside of that one touched down that they did have\nA which made it when they took the least thirty seven thirty three they were the team kick in the field goals and the second half of the role sort of reverse flipped\nSix one seven seven seven zero Ninety eight five we'll be hearing for Bill bell jak Tom Brady and others coming out when we go to the phones with uh John as in Maine tonight John go ahead\nA darn good enough to say I was just like going back to the old AFL days you know the laid off in the quarterback days or will they let players go like bargain salad I end up in the city because\nI have no idea where that calls going yeah we're just going to hit the eject button on that one and go to a Steve who's in Medford Hi Steve\n... guys what's up not much I I just heard you guys talking about I mean positives on the defense that I just\nI don't know where you saw any positives I got up that yes he did\nBut he's like the slowest guy in the field the secondary is terrible I mean ... ... I Love him he's contributed over the years but I mean to tonight you was awful his brother is terrible\nCan't patch they I I just I Do not understand how bill expects to go anywhere with the defense they are going nowhere nowhere with his teeth but famously but yet they make it to the Superbowl they\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nOh for a chance to win the game what what is it like being in the huddle with Tom in one of the situations that we've seen time and time again where he converts\nHis uh his paws you know I'm ... years certainly columnist on you know in a high pressure situation that everybody has that I think um any displays that are the guys feel better about what they're supposed to do 'em\nKnowing that we're in good hands and he can he's consistent and he does is just you just at the front\nUm you you called five buses today which is obviously promising but at times it looks sometimes even tell them when it's on the same page you are going straight it it looked like he was maybe looking for a girl or something like that [noise] how familiar with the play but right now and how comfortable are you getting\nI'm pretty familiar with the fiber um you know there's some growing pains and stuff like that you got to work out a practice in them through the course of just being here just under month you know what I'm trying to make it work as far as I can so we'll we'll get it all figured out here pretty soon [noise]\nHey Josh I'm you play an Eighteen snaps a piece in the two games prior to this tonight was much more significant workload or what is your reaction to just getting not much more work [noise]\nUm it was fine honestly you know I think we were preparing for that we can practice I was expecting a little heavier workload I'm so I was just glad to have the opportunity to go out there and play a phone I enjoy you know I appreciate because given the opportunity [noise]\nOkay that is Josh Gordon he does three questions after games that's it again I'm Still waiting for someone they dress where do you live\n[laughter] sneak it in there but you know what do you do any free time jobs where did you the last time there [laughter] or something like that but no we haven't gotten those questions yeah we'll see a coming out there for the\nPatriots after a when a very exciting when his workload went up tonight it looks like he was on the field a lot more looks like he might have avoided a bit of a big injury to even get medical temp for a while hit the deck in the end zone and was grabbing would appear to be the shoulder around ... area and then he went into the blue sat for a bed and then he was back on the sideline I don't know maybe ten minutes later\nSo you came out of the cat that appear to be okay but his workload went up\nI don't think that he embraced here on the same page on those back shoulder throws now sidelined yet there are a couple of missed opportunities there early yeah\nAnd so hopefully that will come with time I'm In you know the one thing if there is a positive they're obviously Tom wants wants to go to them you know and there was talk early in the game to or at least on the TV side of the broadcast to cook or you know Chris calling worth an al Michaels obviously do their you know their pre production meetings with the players not gonna Brady saying\nHe was talking about how good is hands are even on a first cats it's like it sucked right into his hands the kids got phenomenal talent so maybe British forces are a little bit because he wants to go to one but I think that'll come with time as he learns the playbook a little bit better and needs to get out you know there is something to him no to that is a little worrisome which is after he has possessed\nHe's not exactly the most careful guy with the football have you noticed this in terms of how we ship in it around\nYeah in terms of where the football is when he's handling the football I haven't noticed and watch you leave them self exposed a little bit with the football that someone could watch it out yup okay and got it back off the air during one of the time outs tonight\nDuring the game Bob so see and I were talking about this ... it's just it's become you know as you watch a player every time he touches the ball and you watch them so much more intently analogy to a member of the patriots\nYou start to notice a little tendencies and one of these tendencies is his ability to sort of leave that ball away from the bottom yeah\nAnd I'm like oh no no no it makes me nervous now I'm aware of it oh let's go inside Tom Brady sock\nSays how you doing [noise]\nTom over your style [laughter]\n\nTom over here on Patrick moms who did you think overall and his ability to throw the ball down the field and make big plays like he did in this football game\nOr make some big ones made a lot of big ones want it to end to wreak was a great throw you had some other great gross so tough to slow those guys down there weren't a lot of points all year they're gonna be pretty tough to stop so glad I'm Glad we had our last shot and ready to graduate [noise]\nTom a couple of passes late in the game one to Chris down the right side there um and then the other big long do you take us through your thought process what did you see the lead you to go to Chris in
