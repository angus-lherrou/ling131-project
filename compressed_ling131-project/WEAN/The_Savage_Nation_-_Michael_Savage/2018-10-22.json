manager did a great job for a year and a half talking about the immigration crisis and more so than your college has got to drive us in Connecticut Travis in Connecticut Welcome to the bill Cunningham show Travis go ahead\nI owe them during what oh so so I'm In\nConnecticut and it's it's a state tax crazy high I'm and I'm looking at what Trump is doing and he's doing a fantastic job like honestly\nThere's a certain group that happens here especially among college campuses and I'm I'm an actor as unfair and I'm doing the math on and he's on a fantastic job in the middle east what good show I mean to target them why don't turkey handling\nWhen one liners Travis ... if a Saudi Arabia news brutally killed in Turkey why does that dominate American media for days upon end because they want to use that as a weapon against Trump\nWhen when we had a pastor in I'm In the Turkish heart than we went into it and we had we didn't act Saudi Arabia to take care of it but we went under we handled it 'cause he was a U.S citizen and ... ... migrants herb and that's another issue that you\nParticularly you can't have both and open borders policy and also welfare state it than there is just ridiculous I came here from Nigeria I came here legally I'm looking at all like I might as well do you really might have been faster to do it that way but no\nHow would you like motor joins twenty gene truck of the only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to what boards twenty four to one fifty this run for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only add one board and he went into a new Oregon\nCoach western civilization that really built something here and if you bring the idea that socialism if you know the math on its social does not work\nThey point to the Scandinavian countries but the whole that's working because we subsidize their military we all know that America's military it's wants is what's keeping that quote we will do their taxes or strolling I and I can feel it here in Connecticut\nNow no question there the reasons given him a country where\nIt's a capitalistic parts works in the social part doesn't and then the other reason is they have no military we've spent about eight hundred billion dollars a year in the military to protect them and they spend nothing\nAnd that's why they can have ramping socialism socialism doesn't work in Venezuela or Cuba it doesn't work in the Scandinavian countries owe them a leg you run out of the ability to spend other people's money\nIn Milton Friedman one of the great signals of all the time about Thirty years ago that you cannot have\nA first world country and open borders next to a grinding third world poverty eventually it'll blend together in old take down the first one of the country America will be taken down if millions of Central Americans more poorly educated with no skills that we need come airing collapses social welfare state\nAnd overrun the hospitals in the schools in the prison America cannot long succeed it's the failure of our country\nAnd it's amazing because when I come here and I see the fact that America wants some some some sovereignty I I can respect that there is something that goes back you know I come from Niger and the idea of some of them could never work there because it's across the we have an end to everyone in the socialist\nSociety believe this utopian you can you can work out no I'm Sorry human nature\nCap was more on human nature to drive the free market if you look at um the fact that capitalism has brought half has cut global poverty in half and twelve years and sort of tit for years by the un standards and I told him thirty\nBecause a fabulous it's it's it's really a permanent can fire it's really probably the ... and it does appear in Connecticut I'm trying to\nGet I I think education is the key 'cause if if I'm able to tell people hey listen you don't like 'em but it didn't look at the results I mean ... ... it's the lowest in history I'm like\nHow he got to look at Bill Clinton was in the ad for high end President Obama's record high welfare recipients and now Trump is black businesses small businesses up for a hundred percent um I'm\nI'm just looking at the numbers here and I'm like okay he wasn't called racist until he started running I'm like I'm looking at the GOP I'm looking at what they're offering and they're offering actual things that can help whereas socialism has this idea that just never just never panned out\nAnd it's true I'm ready to call it makes me a libertarian\nHuh I'm ready to call him where the Trump stir in New York City\nFor twenty Thirty years received every award then Al Sharpton and could give him at every award Jesse Jackson could give him he he was a humanitarian he was a civil rights act and all of a son who's running to the presidency certainly at the age of seven eight becomes a racist\nOr brain I'm like well this is an ... little tire life he was caught everybody here we go next to Hamad hourly and Rosa Parks with the um when the parents\nReally frankly he was a good friend he knows where he was a great friend I'm older and he gave money to Chuck Schumer he gave money to Hillary Clinton suddenly becomes obese he becomes it's ridiculous\nKnobs absolutely and it's it's good to know that if we can bridge the divide and like honestly the Democrats right now\nThey have such a stranglehold on the black community for no reason I it's it's if we can if we will get over that if if we can move on because like for example to do is they had a horrible historic event they watch to that the struggle to Japanese internment camps they walk through the U.S some reason\nI think it's 'cause I'm immigrants so it's not exactly something that\nIt was in court trade and it's I mean if you go through the public schools I went to a public school they always told by Hitler but they never talk about the hundred million died under communism so that history just vantage is and\nAnd and I think education is the key I definitely do\n... we got to go but I Want you to stay alert stay alive keep preaching the faith in Connecticut it's one of the parts of the country that badly needs the shot of capitalism and conservatism the worst run states in America are controlled by the Democratic party\nAnd the best run states in America are controlled by the Republican Party but thanks for your call\nLooking for work our credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood what born in east burn a generic ended up the best financed region unbeatable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto job\nJay Trump for like a year and a half and I'm going to ask him about the immigration crisis when I look at the Drudge Report tonight much stimuli all hell breaks loose and ABC and NBC and not CNN thinks this is the vehicle they're going to drive for the next two weeks in two days to bring down the Republicans in Congress\nAnd I say oh contrary mon prayer I Believe\nThe three rations Trump got elected was number one the economy number two immigration number three federal judges has performed magnificently and all three areas\nWas stripping nude in the oval office performing sex acts in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of lot\nOf his songs and records not can you imagine three years ago if a country artist had depicted Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what was the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\n... it would be front page news for a week on and that wrap that the uh the country artist\nWould have had his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to each other again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her\nI mean do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was no it was appropriate because she was an adult he was president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's\nBehavior can you imagine for one second that was the the converse if Donald Trump had done that with during the media would be saying oh\nYeah they would give them an excuse right away and I'm sure the media was saying well she's an adult no big deal I mean the double standards amazing\nIt has always been that way but the American people have seen through it and as you've referenced as it relates to Brett bows out Ninety two percent\nOf the media coverage of this president is negative now I Would accept that if we were in the middle of twenty five percent unemployment a national crisis all over the place nobody working and the country moving in the wrong direction growing at point zero zero percent I Would expect that\nBut we're not we are we are now back up on top where the most competitive country in the world again for the first time in ten years\nAnd there is no credit for what the president's done let alone the twenty Americans who've been held hostage in other countries that he got return not one plane loads of cash don't palette loads of money\nBut on his own share when we do to get these people back you know you saw the pastor come back just a week or so ago and\nYou know that would make it was a blip on the radar screen the president as getting twenty Americans either in North Korea or an Egypt or wherever they had then home that's part of his job and he gets no credit for that but in the mainstream media Brock Obama would have been in line for another Nobel Peace prize\nWell let's talk a little bit about what's happening in Honduras in Guatemala there's at least three thousand the numbers are growing coming from a Honduras through Guatemala into Mexico\nAnd the mainstream media hate\nThis kind of an issue percolating a little over two weeks ... from the election because it reminds the American people one of the main reasons Trump was elected was to curtail illegal migration from Central America and Mexico into our country there's a I like Google disinformation there was a hundred and fifty million\nMexicans model mall and Hondurans in El Salvador and hundred and fifty million not like to come to America if you throw in Venezuela and Colombia maybe Peru\nA Europe wide Paraguay I were talking two hundred and fifty million or central and south Americans would love to come to America at what point is enough is enough and the mainstream media does not want to call it illegal immigration and they talk about refugee status and they're talking about the factors moms and dads and children there in strollers\nHowever uh four or five months ago I fell off the couch one night I'm watching sixty minutes in sixty minutes did a report on the reality of our southern border\nHundreds of dead bodies are found and the deserts of northern Mexico because men are killed because they will become drug meals and that when these individuals paying MS Thirteen literally millions of dollars\nWhat auto group once your car any make any model what pay more than any dealer around because we're a circle by buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours more gone too far I car buyers on time\nDealing MS Thirteen dries to make literally hundreds of millions of dollars\nEvery county so to speak they pass through in Mexico has the drug war and order and somebody in charge of that county and that men have got to pay with money and women have to pay their body and sixty minutes made the point that the majority of young girls and women are raped on the way from Central America\nTo to the United states and when it's reported which is not done by the mainstream media that does is extremely dangerous route\nThat men are murdered and that women are raped and brutalized all the way up Fifteen hundred mile\nThen when they get a new American ... they're they're not released many times you go work in a brothel an on an Austin you go to Baton Rouge and working abroad or if you're a man you said you stand on street corners to sell drugs which is paying back your transit seat there there was one report on sixty minutes about the reality\nOf what the Democratic Party's encouraging and it was disgusting why don't we have more media coverage Corey Lewandowski campaign manager for ...\nOf the reality of what happened to the men and women incentivized to come to this country because what happened to them and so just sick of all the Democratic party should be held accountable for some of this one is in the media cover it objectively\nThe media doesn't want to tell the real story they want to pretend that the only people who are coming to this country the poor and impoverished\nThat are seeking asylum and and look we're the greatest\nCountry in the world and not only did they two hundred and fifty million people from South and Central America want to come here people from all over the world want to come here but we're not a country if we can't control our borders or Reagan said it you know Thirty years ago we are the greatest country in the world than the greatest privilege we can give somebody is to make them a citizen\nAnd there is a way to do that\nBut just coming in and storming the borders doesn't work but your point is much more important\nWhat takes place with these people as they make this track from Honduras through Mexico and ultimately up to the U.S border is a disgusting\nDisplay of gangs that take advantage of these people they raped women they kill them and and you're exactly right even if they have the opportunity to make it into our country illegally and those people aren't free and we have to do something about human trafficking we have to make\nSure that that doesn't continue the best way to do that is you're building a wall on the southern border\nAnd you say if you make it to the United states you will not make it into our country and they were they process to come here and you follow the process we're a nation of laws and what we will do\nAs a Republican Party has to make sure that the immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have all the tools necessary to apprehend people coming across the border illegally\nUnlike the Democrats who want to defund and de legitimize the men and women who serve an ice every day that protect us from the animals of MS Thirteen and those gangs\nCurrent moving down to you why do the Democrats want this because there can be no change in the law until ten or so United States senators who are Democrats agree to the change was build the wall brings insanity I think we need temporary workers to come and go when you come you or do we know who you are\n... we have a big wall with lots of doors in it and every legitimate person wants to come here to to work whatever ought to be able to do it but the the the byproduct of that what did we do a lemonade drug a heroin and mess in Cincinnati in Austin in Tampa in Milwaukee\nBy by doing it makes it more difficult for drugs to come in more difficult for him is Thirteen what is the real reason the Democratic party does not want controlling southern border\nBecause they love the political issue and they don't want to resolve the issue and look\nThis president went out and say you give me the money for the wall and all the people that are here through no fault of their own which arguably called the dream where they came in through no fault of their own I Will give them the president said a pathway to\nCitizenship and that was a long way to go for conservatives to be very honest with you there was a lot of consternation when he made that statement but he gave the Democrats exactly what they've argued they've wanted for a long time and they said no we're not going to give that to they want to have the political football they want to continue to make sure that the people coming across the border\nIllegally and going to sanctuary cities and centuries states have the opportunity to vote we now see this in Texas and we've seen in other places that they are targeting individuals who are not us citizens and asking them to go and vote and they they are bought and sold\nBy the Democratic party those illegal immigrants coming here and they want to keep that flow to continue\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln MTC Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the whole new twenty eight ... Lincoln Navigator was leaking of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nAnd we absolutely need immigration there are jobs that we need them to come and fill on a temporary basis but you're exactly right it come through the system your check you are authorized to come in you pay whatever fair share it is there is either vacation and then when your job is done you go back to your country and that's\nHow it works that that was always work and we just need to know better job and forcing that\nCorey Lewandowski Leslie there's been some speculation that a Hillary Clinton\nIs making a run and twenty twenty you know I think Hillary Clinton did a great job as first lady she was a wonderful United States senator she was a fabulous secretary's day and she was a wonderful candidate for the Democratic party in twenty sixteen I Would encourage her to run\nI Would help her get signatures maybe raise the money for would you encourage Hillary Clinton to become the Democratic party's standard bearer standard bearer and twenty twenty when you do a great job\nWe were in love is located in thirty two electoral votes two years ago that number is only going down she wouldn't be up for the greatest loss of an election since Ronald Reagan's reelection effort when he destroyed his opponent and I think Donald Trump would end up with north of four hundred", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "22"}
