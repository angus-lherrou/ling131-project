and will never take place it is they melt down on the southern border with diseases in what skills we don't need with individuals who are illegal\nAnd the Democratic party is shift completely in

about six minutes a NYPD retired officer\nWaiting for a trigger moment that social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings\nBecause those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people\nOr other like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against uh against Jews and against African Americans every several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump\nHe he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump nor have I ever owned Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\nBut the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so when you went and then why Peter you'll go back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nWhat did he do when did he do it who didn't send these messages to and investigate them as to why something wasn't done and about the guns right now according to media accounts three fifty seven magnificent some blocks that were legally purchased and they are Fifteen they're still tracking down and see what it is\nA ... if someone is posting anti Semitic slurs and saying I'm going in and they have guns that isn't that another tempted something's about to happen\nThat's what you would hope you would hope and who's Pittsburgh Police departments standpoint you would have gotten a call or the FBI would have gotten a call and then if you drop the oil is a law enforcement agency [laughter] and it's on you but in this case nothing I have seen about ... hours\nShowed any\nTo indicate that he was becoming radicalized and he was becoming what we call lone wolf\nAnd they was going to do something other than his rants [noise] All right before you went in yesterday when he said I'm going and at least that that'll come to light if they didn't why didn't someone else who saw this alert police\n... can you have some doubt how many other Robert Bowers are running around this country and I would assume there are several thousand just like him in a nation of three hundred and forty million people ... and let's face in America is the most pro Jewish pro Israel Israel especially with with Trump in the White House nation on the face of the earth\nAnd this is the place or were were were were Jews do well and there's about three million or so three and a half million Jews in America disproportionately successful you know it's a faith and family because of connections to go some hard work because of academics disproportionate success\nAnd so those who are jealous or whatever they got to have a scapegoat for the failures in their life and they look at someone successful so many Jews disproportionately succeed in business and entertainment and finance and the law in Madison and I found it so electorate said that\nThis afternoon on CNN there was an interview of a doctor who treated Bowers who unfortunately lived\nAnd that Dr is Jewish\nAt the Pittsburgh hospital and a couple of the nurses who treated him and saved his life or Jewish isn't that unbelievable that that that somehow powers were saved by by Jews in the hospital unbelievable\nCould have been a Jewish cop who responded to the Senate or to to save other people in their\nProfession doctors lawyers the emergency areas being doctors police officers firemen don't look at the same thing or what\nWhat is your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition and what board and he's really Janeiro or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars homemade models had incredible prices on to flood Otto John John now\nEleven Jewish people in a synagogue who ... their prey saved his life and that's what they do and that's what cops too and that's what firemen do and that's what these doctors and God Bless them for that\nWas talking about these are ... who was the\nMentally ill deranged individual they ran around on the white van I guess his\nBand was he was an attempt to bomb making factory some have said when someone in a white man has those kinds of ah a Heidi Asians on the side CNN sucks also had scopes on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama that says something should have been done in your years in New York City as a cop Thomas ...\nHow many unusual situations like that did you observe\nMore than I can count\nBut I Will tell you this you know there are laws and there are reasons for stopping someone and questioning them and maybe he didn't violate the law the fact that he's expressing his First Amendment right to express speech on the outside of his car doesn't necessarily give you a right\nTo pull him over and or question unless he violates some other kind of law that we don't even know if the police had any interaction with him relative to his van as of yet down there but you know at the point in time I'm sure where it went down to about ... aka\nA Florida with the bombs had been sent proved that distribution center and then in the area plantation where he was taken into custody I wouldn't be surprised to certain people start to make calls on him prior to the police\nCome into contact with him or learning his identity through his finger print and that was tying in simultaneously with them identifying ... is the potential bomber\nAnd you know these acts of terror are taking place sadly quite frequently just on Wednesday\nHey criminal who sent a rise in light materials\nTo the home of US Senator Susan Collins was arraigned\nOn the Trump children the adult children have received numerous numerous rise in on a attempted to and look like rising and blows who powder in the mail including us defense secretary James Madison practically every high ranking Trump official has been threatened with death\nBecause Ted Cruz and others changed completely out of restaurants you Senator Mitch McConnell in Louisville, Kentucky chased out of a restaurant you have a ... a United States are congressmen and Republican\nIn ah in California had a switch played pulled on attempted to stab him running for the Congress the candidate clobbered that would be assassin before the man could get the blade out of a malfunctioning\nThere are numerous examples in the last several months where powder scent where are the candidates are sent with their heads decapitated ... and I I Can't recall a time other than the late Nineteen sixty sixty eight when the country paired almost to be to be coming apart the Drudge Report\nSays that the usa on the edge\nDo have a sense that something is different about the political climate now than it's been years ago Thomas rescued\nThe rhetoric on both sides of the world have become this rural and have become terrible and we have to dial it back I mean I've said in numerous appearances recently that if this continues on a leash or going to be busier than they've ever been before it's not\nJust Donald Trump and not just the right is for\nEveryone has to understand toward the McCain way of thinking\nThat we have to work together we can have our political views and we can look at things from different lenses that are different experiences and how we were brought up [noise] but we're all Americans and if we're not able to work with each other or help each other or save each other the way that they do after a hurricane\nAnd the way the police officers around this country do every single day they don't look at the color or the religion or the\nPerson that they're saving they respond because that's what they wanted to do and they risk their lives to save anyone that they potentially could save because that's what they're calling\nI I don't know I like the president I loved the guy spent time with him we speak now and then he's a great political character I look at his results more than look in his words\nBut I I don't recall words being used by him along the lines of the word and they used this president then I hear on the left but the media covers\nThe Trump words differently and then they covered get democratic words and a ...\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east British and they were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent NPR for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto job\nAt at this point it would behoove all of us to lower down to ... rhetoric a little bit because there's hundreds of thousands on the left and on the right now they're waiting it'd be triggered by some event in many are mentally ill and many have guns now that doesn't mean any of us Tom rescued needs to stop exercising are free speech rights under the constitution\nBut it does mean that that that the media also plays a role in this one I've been watching CNN the past two days all I hear about is Trump and the Republicans responsible\nFor almost a mass murder of two former presidents plus the killing of twelve or fourteen others along with the attempts to the tide Donald Trump to what happened in Pittsburgh even though he's the only president in American history there Jewish grandchildren the only one and today CNN tried to tee up the U.S\nIsraeli ambassador the as the Israeli ambassador to the u._s. I'm Sorry\nAnd he said that the best friend Israel's ever had\nHas been Donald J Trump and that he's been wonderful for Israel and Trump is not responsible for what happened there the president's going to go to Pittsburgh and the next couple of days to meet with those that have been wounded summer mortally wounded not likely to survive the number eleven is likely to go up and the president has said", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "year": "2018", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "29"}
