... edition and what board and he's really Janeiro or against us that's right over two hundred dollars all make all model at incredible prices on to swallow John job now\nNineteen sixty four year a Supreme Court decision and said that if you're a public figure like a bread Kevin all\nBasically people can lie about those characters as long as the person speaking does not have actual malice which means they know what they're saying is false when they say Julie sweating they\nCommitted a defamatory slander against Brett Kavanaugh when she said he was involved in group rates and drugging him and that was that was a lie Deborah Ramirez who said that he shook his private parts in my face\nAnd after a week of working with my attorney I kind of figuring out who did it thirty four years later that was a lie\nAnd then also professor Ford for scene forward every factual statements she made\nWho's proven to be false now for him to sue he would have to be in a federal court for like the next five to ten years was Michael Evan daddy and snakes like that so I don't think a Supreme Court justice is gonna personally to anybody in federal court\nBecause it would take five to ten years\nThere'd be repeated depositions in fact the process would be such a gauntlet I don't see bread going through it even though he would have probably win because when you when you're when\nIf you're Brett Kavanaugh if you're married to him than I argue saying honey just doing your job be a good judge and let's move on with life and I had the\nSomething though that can be done about all these people coming out of

up for him\nSo I don't know what\nI wanted to bring up one other thing um I like to listen to 'em real liberal TV and radio like KPFK coming out of ... or\nWe have a Grand Rapids back here we have a black I Am radio talk show and sometimes I Can't listen to that because they just they're very respectful of the president I mean I didn't vote for Obama that I Would never talk about no I wouldn't be respectful of the office of the president [laughter]\nTend Taylor and really good things come down like I was listening to this black talk show host and he was talking about our Supreme Court cheering Michigan and he was telling us all the liberal Democrats that were running for judges\nIn Michigan where I usually don't forget is because I don't know them that well\nBut when he named the liberal judges that they wanted on the Supreme Court here and and I okay those are the ones I Will not vote for\nThose are the ones that said I'm not going that way since you're in Michigan the seven now is there a chance you might lose she she's such a clown is there I Know Debbie Stabenow is there a chance you might lose\n[noise] I don't think so she just I don't know she's telling that we're in you know you're going to see if I had to kind of half West Michigan is\nConcerned that in these Michigan is very you know we got a life lesson population we got a large black population we got a large democratic population over there\nAnd that's where she's out of the chances are for and you know and I called up her office and said you know have you ever read the Koran and they don't have an answer and you and you ask for a letter back from her\nI Can't imagine a worst representative and Debbie Stabenow and she's running against a black Republican is going to get a lot of African American vote or not\nFly I hotel although I did not vote for him because that right side of things about him getting money to certain people that I don't kind of agree with that because he was backed by Trump he got elected so um [noise]\nYou know we have a Muslim lady hit that kid is running on a plus for Senate because she's from Detroit and it's a largely Muslim now [noise]\nSo um there's areas that Michigan like in Minnesota where [noise] um we don't have any choice people are not even Renee against or\nIt's unbelievable isn't it\n[noise] and you know we've got a proposal on our ballot which is really interesting um [noise] because you know they're they're trying to get away get away with redistricting thing because they think they are so they've Republicans at that moment\nOr we go next to the proposal on the ballot now where they want to go to just Thirteen people that were\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again what board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine per month that's right one twenty nine per month blood as every dollar every option and everything you're looking for like what auto jobs\nWhat do you have no idea that you just look at John James I think John James has a shot at winning that seat it would be wonderful if this was an upset how anybody in Michigan to vote for Debbie Stabenow is\nVery sad third ... sad day for America when they when they get to that and ... it's a shame and there were public than we ever tried to get straight to anybody whether they're Republican or Democrat and where to take this man on this lady last couple of weeks it makes me sick to my stomach\nNo you can you take similar times when the Republicans in restaurants airports elevators acted the way the Democrats acting Brian kill made a friend of mine with Fox and friends is harassed on a regular basis with megaphones on the streets in order to\nThink about that scares them\nI mean what that is they they are what they are the fascist and that's what they are actually\nOne hundred percent they only had two Democrats they interact in return trip um around what what's finger or conservative than ... parts per year than people actually Paul predicts\nNow they do and well it's because the mainstream media falls forum that's why let's continue now with the Joe in North Carolina than I've been in Florida Joe in North Carolina Welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joe go ahead\nYes sir thank you and your calls down here in North Carolina Thank you Tom yeah if I could say this I think it's worth thinking about with respect to the Kavanaugh a issue I I I won't say all but I Would guess that the vast majority of Democrats would be very happy to know\nConclusively that Brett Kavanaugh at salt that this war and that they would be very very disappointed\nOr if it could be conclusively proven that he did not\nA U.S all her other words they were very happy they they would be very happy to serve up a\nA doctor for as an offspring so to speak sure to their narrative sure and and and shame on them if I could draw this parallel to the Duke lacrosse case and truth out here\nAnd this was big news down here in North Carolina or when it was absolutely conclusively proven that that woman at docked in rate you did not hear any expression of joy or leave or why after that she had not been raped\n... on the contrary the liberals really obviously had been hoping that she had been raped night and they were disappointed that do that she has not been\nOne of the boys at a time of the rape had a picture taken them him had an ATM two miles away\nAnd and so you know Michael ... Fong lost his law law license the prosecutor and went to jail\nBut there was an remembered Jesse Jackson Al Sharpton raising money making sure the so called rape victim and free college tuition and now she's having prison time for like murder above but nonetheless there was no level of apologies\nFor maybe see NBC CBS the New York times CNN MSNBC and they simply moved on to the next ... next carnival never offering sufficient apologies\nTo the three boys who was so brutally wrongfully accused somebody it was a joke what happened to them and the Hofstra boys what would happen to UBA in Rolling Stone all of these hoaxes take place\nIn the media just moves on to the next circus\nIt exactly people were actually disappointed that uh that woman had not been raped and now I'm sure\nProbably most Democrats are very disappointed when it really occurred to them if they're honest with themselves that really Brett Kavanaugh had not assaulted\nHer not ... not ... it was proven widely falls based upon the research done\nA professor for to answer she testified every factual statement she made was uncorroborated or refuted not one thing whether it was the door whether it was the air travel was it the timing was it the event itself whether her age none of it's none of it fit facts\nBut that didn't keep the media for me to continue into slime in\nThe ... and the point I Would make is a shame on anybody who was disappointed that this one was not sexually assault\nMaybe one in her want to be sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh they wanted to be true did and they\nThat's right they were hoping hoping against hope that she had\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto John John now\nDo most further Steven Kobe or Late Show on CBS today she tweeted quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote that's the mentality\nExactly that's where they're coming from and and shame on anybody and everybody who feels that way I Would ever my narrative it is it is I I Do I Will never be happy that someone else suckered in order for me to advance my narrative\nWell the letter was happy that Brett Kavanaugh as his wife and children his mom and dad they're happy that he went through so much pain they had joy from the sorrow he's feeling on these false charges that makes a Stephen Colbert types to be quite happy\nExactly and shame on all of them and we've got to teach them a lesson in about three or four well we got a sweet these people out of office I don't care what we got\nAbout ... ... vote you got to vote normal people go to vote Joe you're way\nOur marriage thank you\nThank you thank you Joe we got her on thank you by the way the Houston Texans are about to kick the game winning feel go to beat up on the Dallas Cowboys Nineteen sixteen of short feel go we'll see what happens let's continue with more forty six minutes after they are built Cunningham the great American live with you every Sunday night\n[noise]\nSomebody we hang out at ...
