show is amazing it is all about Social Security what do you need to retire how do you figure out what Social Security is the time for you when is it the time\nThis is the show for you so grab your you know pets turn this radio show up let's talk about Social Security and when we talk about Social Security we're not just going to leave anything out we're talking about the whole Social Security system\nAnd how does it fit into your pensions how does it fit into your Irish how does it fit into everything when we left for the break\nWe were talking about taxation we're talking about how the tax brackets all work and now we gotta figure out how to lure them how to change him there's really really specific was doing it doesn't have to be confusing it doesn't have to be complicated but it is honest and this is where it comes to fruition fruition\nWords right right there we go to Joshua stocks are young loving this let's talk threats north or he's so at the end of the last segment we were talking about you know how do I maximize\nAs much income coming in without having to spend as much money going out\nAnd we kind of danced around a little bit but what's actually get read into it we're talking about cash flow we're talking about how you organize your accounts in your income streams and your supplemental money so that this way when you need more you can pull from it and still control the ... we're talking about the three worlds uh money\nAnd we're talking about do I have my bank account set up so that they make sense for me my daily money\nDo I have my market accounts from or my uh my growth accounts so this way I Know that I've got a cost of living and inflation taking care\nAnd where my income streams coming from with my insurance accounts my guarantees my Social Security might pensions and my annuities do I have them all organized so that if life gets in the way kicked me out of my comfort zone I can get back to it and if\nThis is this is my favorite section ... let me jump off on that they say well heck a Arlene just retired she's a client of ours because we yeah we uh we met her we met her through the radio here\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the here for only one I mean I Will say hello to port boards twenty eighty four to one fifty the best for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a flood forward and he went into the Narragansett\nCenter storage ... there's also this savings account checking account money her daily money and that's what she was concerned with if it fell below a certain number she was going to feel broke she was going to find a desperate she was going to feel like she really couldn't retire and she was going to\nSo we had to work that day and the only way to do that is to understand that three was money there's three piles of money or three buckets of money that you need money and\nAnd it's daily money liquid cash where I go to you need that if that one right there and makes you feel wealthy and then the next one is your stock market your brokerage these type accounts we like to go to money market account right but these are these type of cast\nIn those accounts right there or you go to those you sleep at night oh my God nothing even it goes wrong I'm here I got that\nAnd then there's the storage or the insurance and that's where the incomes actually paid for Social Security isn't that pile and so when it kicks out it's an income stream and I think that's really important to get my honor our lean actually got a retirement income report and that report told her\nThat she should take her retirement or Social Security retirement sixty six years of age I Know everybody's out there saying well they didn't you I'm telling you she told me she would not wait that long she made it very very clear argument I made a very very clear to Josh was she was taking your Social Security with or without my permission\nAnd so well it's her money not mine so I listen to what Arlene set Arlene said this is what's happening Mr wells and you're going to make it work for me and said oh no problem let's do this and so what we did is we had to actually think through the world's money a little differently for early because she was triggered Social Security sixty two years old\nAnd she was going to live off this money but she also needed if she needed other mice and she didn't want to raise her tax brackets case was saying where she was gonna get hit with fifty percent loss or reduction of Social Security monies or eighty five percent depending on what bracket she's in\nAnd so she made us go through the world's money and come up with a new plant so we wrote a new plan for and after some discussion about how it works\nShe's retired she's thrilled she's doing all kinds of ah I talked to her just the other day and she said oh my God I'm busier now than I've ever been in my life I'm having a very tough so she's at that stage rate because there's three stages of retirement she's actually in her go go years\nWhere it's sometimes it's a concern if she's going to hit these mild points because if you treat your Social Security early now you have to be aware of a tax bracket hyper aware of it to make sure that you don't reduce your benefit even more than when you did when you took a lesser benefits\nNow I Know that's not the English but the way this works is if\nYou have to go to our website there's all kinds of white papers on it there's actually places to go find other seminars or workshops\nThat we talk about this stuff that is you see L. I. D. Evans the financial S's in services dot com ticket take a minute go to our calculators make sure that you understand what's going on it really helped out Arlene in a really help you out to\nYou know just uh I remember Arlene coming in and you know when we were talking about it on a Monday morning meetings when we talk about a new strategies to\nYou know one of the keys for her to be able to do that at sixty two was having it was it came down to cash flow that money market account or where she could go in and get some money that wasn't taxable so she didn't create a lot of taxes for herself\nI mean this is one of those keys or you know and I think we kinda glance over today when we were talking about earlier you know when you're talking about cash flow you have your banking you have a life gets in the way or a money market we might need the money market or and you have storage Josh was able to line the other storage pieces up and her Social Security up\nTo provider that income but if she needed some emergency money she had it set up that she could actually get money out of out in that create more taxes are so\nYeah and well the key with Arlene was is she had a specific goal and objective in mind that she wanted\nEven though the report showed one thing she knew what she wanted so our job as an advisor is to figure out how can we make her goals happened and that's exactly what we did\nBut the first step in any of those processes is making sure that you have any information to make the right decision\nSo giving away five retirement income reports that are actually going to focus on when the right age is to take Social Security this reform is going to lay out all of your incomes while your taxes should be and more importantly what's the most efficient age for you to take so scary\nRemember we're only getting five these waste you've got to call us now for one Seventy seven to seven to seven call up and asked for my retirement income report that's for one Seventy seven to seven to seven now guys\nUp permanent income stream coming in Odessa entered a higher now hard at you know turning that sets the minimum income level now are out there should be listening to this and the thing was is his goal his mind was I'm going to never take the IRA money until I have\nTo thinking he's never gonna have to touch it but even realize his arms ... age Seventy one if he had that anti Social Security on and had spent any money yet he would've jumped up easily to tax ... oh yeah\nAnd never been able to get out of it and it would have severely impacted his life he would have had more money coming in but had less to actually spend because\nOut of and in fact that his entire family and I do not entire family income that's right he his neck would have been yeah the last one could have been would have been crushed to oh yeah you know as talking with Bob here you know I think we're talking about pitfalls they don't think about the actual income itself\nThey're talking about missing the pitfall of actually maximizing and when people say that they believe that it's\nOh well just wait to turn Social Security on each Seventy so it's really not it's it's really how can you minimize the taxes on your own you know we're sweet spot on your tax ... and that\nAnd yeah the taxes change but they don't change but every ten years so we know what it's gonna be next year the year after year after year after so or they're going to be very close [laughter] that's what I'm saying even if Trump the changes that right if a President Trump changes the taxes\nIt's not going to change the calculation in which we're talking about the threat that's absolutely it's absolutely mind blowing to me that people say oh I got I got to figure this out yeah when you do have figured out but not for the reason you're saying\nAnd and you have to just understand what is actually taxable to your you've got three things that trigger taxes it's your income its capital gains and if that require minimum distribution\nAnd the reality is you just have to understand what's coming in for income because that's the one you can truly control if you understand where all your income taxes are coming in now the best way to figure out what your income is or how it works you've got to call you could financial services here for one\nSeventy seven to seven to seven and get one of the last\nTwo retirement income reports that is going to focus on your Social Security and what your best ages for\nIt will lay out all the gory details what's what is your guaranteed income what's your predictable Lincoln what's your variable income you need to know all three of those to know when your Social Security is actually going to be triggered in this report will do it so call and get one of the last two at four O. one\nSeven to seven to seven to seven\nTalking about planning we're talking about financial advisors were talking about retirement income advisors I think these are a lot of jargon that people really get confused on\nAnd it gets turned around when you talk about it visors there are several impacted visors so there's these growth advisors the one that gets you to retirement they they got your four one K. money they got ya uh Iraqi money they got just saving income money but they actually are never going to distribute it\nThey're not the guy you talk to they're not the gal you talk to when you turn sixty six or sixty five when you actually retire so those are the people that are on the other side of history for their retirement income planners that you could financial services of the world and when you're talking about this kind of thing that's where it gets different\nEuclid financial services and firms like ours that it's only seven percent of the entire financial planning world\nOnly seven percent of the advisors in\nThe United states actually no tax money\nActually know distribution planning actually understand legacy planting growth planning is one thing and it's you have to have that they work in tandem with us so this is kind of where it goes when we're talking about planners you really have to get a good handle on who you're talking to and what you're talking about\nWhere I just you know I Love your brought this up because it reminds me of a gene here you know gene called me earlier today and uh she hurt us on the radio and she said that she needed to talk to someone about Social Security and if she was eligible to receive benefits school you know gene worked for the school system in Rhode Island and she's getting a lot of bad information from her co workers\nAbout being eligible for the Social Security you know she worked outside the school system for about Fifteen Years making are eligible for Social Security benefits\nKnow she does fall into that windfall limitation provision or Web\nWhich is receiving a pension provided by a federal or state in Social Security which is actually a pension distributed by the federal government so I did the calculations for her whip and at the same time we aligned her other assets as well as for school pension you know gene was so relieved you know by the time we were finished\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the here for only one I mean I Will say hello to port boards twenty eighty four to one fifty up front for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at point forward and he went into and there were again but\nWe hear this a lot of here you could you know this is why we do that you could GPS system\nGene would agree with that if you know it's better to get to and through your entire retirement and then I guess at it you know ... you could financial services for one seven to seven to seven to seven again that's for all one Seventy seven to seven to seven\n... brought up a um a point there it's so when you talk about the windfall provisions these are confusing to a lot of people I work a forty quarters prior I worked Fifteen quarters prior is my entire benefit under the supervision or is it only a portion of my benefit\nOr by the school district says that\nThe forty quarters I put in prior to working at the school district now it's all this continued and it's All right ... yeah don't exist there's a lot of why is still out about this it's not confusing if you can get to clean pure information that's right and I think that's where certified\nI Will so security planners like Jason ... angry Republican right only because you went on Iran or Republican because you have that an ss a certification many you do to you know and these are important things these differentiate you from other financial advisors\nThat makes you above the seven percent you guys are in a one percent or two percent bracket of advisors\nThere's no need to discount that so that's what saved gene it wasn't the fact that you were doing financial planning it was that you were doing financial planning with clean concise knowledgeable and certified information that's huge that's huge\nNow if you want more information you have to call you could find services at four O. one\nSeven to seven to seven to seven\nWe are giving away retirement in come reports we have two more we're getting off the table I'm going to push 'em out there\nNow they are customer reports they are made only
