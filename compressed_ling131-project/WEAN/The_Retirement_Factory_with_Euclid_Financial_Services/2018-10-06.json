fit into your overall\nMedical and retirement plan as we were talking about you got to turn on part a in part B now we're going to dive into the next step which is now that you're fully retired you've left your employer you have your original Medicare on place now comes the second part you've got to pick out your supplemental because your original\nMedicare only covers Seventy percent of your total medical need so you've got a feeling that little bit\nYeah and it's I think it's more of a term because there's a lot of them out there there's a gap there supplemental there's a go to the Web site go to Euclid fs dot com that's easy C. L. I. D. S. as in financial as as an services dot com\nIt lays this stuff out there's there's actually a video there click on it it's absolutely amazing uh there's some funny videos too but if you're actually a stressed out about this go to the videos go to the white pages and then give us a call and you actually understand a great deal\nWhen we're talking about supplemental um I Want to talk about Barbara she had a a massive\nConcern I mean it was one of those concerns that kept her awake at night and she was sixty four she's getting ready to retire she she didn't have a full understanding of part a and part B she works for a CBS and she is in the field right everybody thinks\nThat because you were serious she works in the IT department CBS so it's not like she she she's every day at the pharmacy she has a great Blue Cross Blue Shield plan over at CBS\nShe was looking to figure out do I take part hey at sixty five that's where she was hyper focused and all I had to do is explain to her in very very clean English when she turned sixty five\nShe is going to have part a the CBS planned Blue Cross Blue Shield is going to turn into a Blue Cross Blue Shield sixty five anyways so her coverage will be now to she'll have a primary and she'll have a secondary her primary\nIs going to be her employer because she's still employ her secondary is the federal government under Medicare part a once this happened\nA light bulb went off you could just see you're kind of relaxing sit back in a chair and say is it that easy I said yeah they've been doing it for decades I it really is that easy once you turn sixty five\nIt automatically happens you would have to go and do a lot of work legwork to get it to stop happening so just let it happen it's free you still pay CBS is premium and it goes to the plan once you actually retire then we have to pick up once you retire retire then you have to pick up medic gap or supplemental the same thing and we only have\nSix plants to choose from it's not a huge deal\nYeah and I I Love that you walked her through the process was going to be so she knew what a time lines were and it was going to be a direct correlation to win or old coverage would stop and winter news coverage would stop now\nLook I Am glad that we're all here with us today at the retirement factory\nMyself and Josh Wells we're part of the retirement team here you can financial services and it's our number one goal to make sure that we protect\nAnd preserve your freedom to choose what will work best for you and retirement we've been doing this exactly for thousands of folks just like you so in honor of this we're giving away seven of our financial stress tests to help you find out whether or not you're making the right choices for your retirement and your medical so be one of the next seven callers here at four zero one\nSeven to seven to seven to seven again that seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven and be one of the next seven calls for you or free financial stress test\nYeah this financial stress tests I when Barbara got hers it was easy because he was actually where is all your money she has a lot of stock she has a lot of companies ... she has a lot of four one K. so she had two different for one case and she was concerned that she had to tap into those and use some of those to pay for medical it really turned out that her income\nThat she was going to set up would cover the supplemental\nBecause when you say go to the exchange and pick up supplemental ... well there's a real fear there yeah\nWell I don't want to do that and then there's all these wives tales about what it is so the supplemental when you go to the a C a or you go to the health exchange however you want to say at once against just a marketing term once you go purchase it from the federal pool however you want to say it what'd you go ... percent from the fed a pool that cool determines your cost\nAnd it doesn't remember a as always free be as a premium and then supplemental is going to be your is going to be your\nAd on plan your gap and that comes from a carrier at a United Blue Cross Blue Shield Harvard pilgrim name accompany it goes there right that's that's where it is\nAnd I and I actually want to touch them at wives' tales that you were talking about before because there's still some misconceptions or at least some information out there that's no longer accurate I think the biggest key takeaway is health care is changing ... an age of ... and it's changing\nOne Seventy seven to seven to seven that his four oh one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven to figure out how to get through retirement healthy wealthy ad wise\nSo let's get back to being healthy 'cause wealthy unwise well it doesn't do much good if you don't have your health\nBut that's all they say you have so there's only a couple of things that you can bank I dunno it's taxes in death those are two bad time to\nGet it wrong at prime number going to say wrong show we're talking about taxes will come back to that will come back ... when it comes back to medical you brought up the health exchange right or the A. C. A. or the health source or whatever state you live in or whatever they call it\nIt's just a tour of you to go and buy health insurance if you're not part of a group and you're not eligible for Medicare right away\nSo it doesn't have to be scary\nThe problem with the health exchanges is is this new area for us to buy health insurance but some of the old wives' tales of the old miss are still floating out there so the conflicting with each other\nYeah it's it brings up a assuming sidey because I have to I've always been with my employer my employer's plan is good it's United it's at nights it's well part of the oil graduates whatever it is it's Blue Cross Blue Shield so now I actually have to understand what it gives me it would benefit there is so I have to kind of face that that maybe it doesn't cover everything I thought it did\nA good thing I never got sick but when I get tired how do I keep myself from being sick and I think that's the bucket list I think that's actually understanding your goals in life I think that's actually understanding what I'm trying to achieve and then set well I have family ailments that I have to cover later in life\nYeah you figure out where's my income coming from how am I going to pay for things and then you do in him in tore of yourself not just your assets\nHow healthy am I what am I trying to do what's my medication all that fun stuff now myself and Josh Wells it is our pleasure to be a part of the teen here you could financial services\nWe are both certified Social Security advisors with NFL say as well as chase and wells and myself I'm an IT are with you 'cause wealth management as well as an R.
