Arlene actually got a retirement income report in that report told her\nThat she should take her retirement or Social Security retirement sixty six years of age I Know everybody's out there saying well they didn't you I'm telling you she told me she would not wait that long she made it very very clear and made a very very clear to Josh was she was taking your Social Security with or without my permission\nAnd so well as her money not mine so I listen to what Arlene set Arlene said this is what's happening Mr wells and you're going to make it work for me and said oh no problem let's do this and so what we did is we had to actually think through the world's money a little differently for early because she was pregnant so security sixty two years old\nAnd she was going to live off this money but she also needed if she knew another moneys and she didn't want to raise her tax brackets case was saying where she was going to get hit with fifty percent loss or reduction of Social Security monies or eighty five percent depending on what bracket she's in\nAnd so she made us go through the rules and money and come up with a new plan so we wrote a new plan for and after some discussion about how it works\nShe's retired she's thrilled she's doing all kinds of ah I talked to her just the other day and she said oh my God I'm busier now that I've ever been in my life I'm having a tough so she's at that stage right 'cause there's three stages retirement she's actually in her go go years\nWhere it's sometimes it's a concern if she's going to hit these mild points because if you treat your Social Security early now you have to be aware of a tax bracket hyper aware of it to make sure that you don't reduce your benefits even more than when you did when you took a lesser benefits\nNow I Know that's not a English but the way this works of this\nYou have to go to our website there's all kinds of white papers on it there's actually places to go find other seminars or workshops\nThat we talk about this stuff that is you see L. I. D. Evans the financial S's in services dot com ticket take a minute go do our calculators make sure that you understand what's going on it really helped out Arlene in really help you out to\nKnow just uh I remember Arlene coming in and you know when we were talking about it on a Monday morning meetings when we talk about a new strategies to\nYou know one of the keys for her to be able to do that at sixty two was having it was it came down to cash flow that money market account or where she could go in and get some money that wasn't taxable so she didn't create a lot of taxes for herself\nI mean this is one of those keys or you know and I think we kinda glance over today when we were talking about earlier you know when you're talking about cash flow you have your banking you have a life gets in the way or a money market we liked the money market or and you have storage Josh was able to line the other storage pieces up in her Social Security up\nTo provider that income but if she needed some emergency money she had it set up that she could actually get money out of it not create more taxes are so\nYeah and well the key with Arlene was is she had a specific goal and objective in mind that she wanted\nEven though the report showed one thing she knew what she wanted so our job as an advisor is to figure out how can we make her goals happen and that's exactly what we did but the first step in any of those processes is making sure that you have any information to make the right decision so\nGiving away five retirement income reports that are actually going to focus on when the right age is to take Social Security this report is going to lay out\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again fought board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\n... and asked for my retirement income report that's for one Seventy seven\nDone deal and it was absolutely definitely this All right well he had his he had a permanent income stream coming in and get a higher now hard at you know turning that sets the minimum income level now are out there should be listening to this and the thing was is his goal his mind was I'm going to never take the IRA money until I have\nTo thinking he's never gonna have to touch it but even realize his arm decent age Seventy one if he had that anti Social Security on it hadn't spend any money yet he would have jumped up easily to tax ... oh yeah\nAnd never been able to get out of it and it would have severely impacted his life he would have had more money coming in the had left to actually spend because I Would have been\nFact that his entire family like do not entire family income\nThat's right he his neck would have been yeah the last one that have been would have been crushed to oh yeah you know as talking with Bob here you know I think we're talking about pitfalls they don't think about the actual income itself\nThey're talking about missing the pitfall of actually maximizing it and when people say that they believe that it's oh we'll just wait to turn Social Security on age Seventy it's really not it's it's really how can you minimize the taxes on your own you know\nWe're sweet spot on your tax relied on that and yeah the taxes change but they don't change but every ten years so we know what it's going to be next year the year after year after year after so more than ever to be very close [laughter] that's what I'm saying even if Trump the changes that right if a President Trump changes the taxes\nIt's not going to change the calculation and which we are talking about the threat as well that's absolutely it's absolute mind blowing to me that people say oh I got I got to figure this out yeah we do have to figure it out but not for the reason you're saying\nNow and then you have to just understand what is actually taxable to your you've got three things that trigger taxes it's your income its capital gains and if that require minimum distribution\nAnd the reality is you just have to understand what's coming in for income because that's the one you can truly control if you understand where all your income taxes are coming in\nNow the best way to figure out what your income is or how it works\nYou've got a call you could financial services here for one seven to seven to seven to seven and get one of the last two retirement income reports that is going to focus on your Social Security and what your best ages for\nIt will lay out all the gory details what's what is your guaranteed income what's your predictable income what's your variable income you need to know all three of those to know when your Social Security is actually going to be triggered and this report will do it so call and get one of the last two at four O. one\nSeven to seven to seven to seven talking about planning we're talking about financial advisors were talking about retirement income advisors I think these are a lot of jargon that people really get confused on\nAnd it gets turned around when you talk about it visors there are several impacted visors so there's these growth advisors the ones that get you to retirement they they got you four one K. money they got ya uh Iraqi money they got just saving income money but they actually are never going to distribute it\nThey're not the guy you talk to they're not the gal you talk to when you turn sixty six or sixty five when you ask to retire so those are the people that are on the other side of this ... their retirement income planners that you could financial services of the world and when you're talking about this kind of thing that's where it gets different\nYou could financial services and firms like ours that it's only seven percent of the entire financial planning world\nOnly seven percent of the advisors in\nThe United states actually no tax money\nActually know distribution planning actually understand legacy planting growth planning is one thing and it's you have to have that they work in tandem with us so this is kind of where it goes when we're talking about planners you really have to get a good handle on who you're talking to and what you're talking about that's\nRight just ... you know I Love your brought this up because it reminds me of of gene here you know and you can call me the other day and uh she hurt us on the radio and she said that she needed to talk to someone about Social Security and if she was eligible to receive benefits school you know gene worked for the school system in Rhode Island and she's getting a lot of bad information from her co workers\nAbout being eligible for the Social Security you know she worked outside the school system for about Fifteen Years making are eligible for Social Security benefits\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood what born in east furniture Narragansett have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nWe aligned her other assets as well as her school pension\nYou know gene was so relieved you know by the time we were finished putting together for income plan gene now had a better understanding of how our Social Security fit into an overall retirement plan she told me she was glad that we admit because the information she was receiving from her co workers was not answering her concerns\nWe hear this a lot of here you could you know this is why we do to you quit GPS system gene would agree with that if you know it's better to get to and through your entire retirement and then I guess at it you know ... you could financial services for one seven to seven to seven to seven again that's for all one Seventy seven to seven to seven\n... brought up a um a point there it's so when you talk about the windfall provisions these are confusing to a lot of people I work a forty quarters prior I worked Fifteen quarters prior is my entire benefit under the supervision or is it only a portion of my benefit\nOr might the school district says that the forty quarters I put in prior to working at the school district\nNow it's all discontinued and it's All right oh there was anything to exit there's a lot of why is still out about this it's not confusing if you can get to clean pure information that's right and I think that's where certified\nOr wealth Social Security planners like Jason ... angry Republican right only because you want on Iran or Republican because you have that an ss a certification Manny you do to you know and these are important things these differentiate you from other financial advisors\nThat makes you above the seven percent you guys are in a one percent are two percent\nBracket of advisors\nThere's no need to discount that so that's what saved gene it wasn't the fact that you were doing financial planning it was that you were doing financial planning with clean concise knowledgeable and certified information that's huge huge now\nIf you want more information you have to call you could find services at four O. one\nSeven to seven to seven to seven we\nAre giving away retirement in come reports we have two more
