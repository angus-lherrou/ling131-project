said the insurance Ninety five points patriots radio network\nYeah we talked about that just getting out to a good start especially on the road like we want to play like that you know each week and we've done that at home you know we have a huge challenge this week of just playing well and trying to get a one on the road just haven't done it\nAnd I think when you're on the road and you fall behind that was just the energy picks up it's like everything is against you and you're just fighting a hill so that's something we thought about getting out to a fast start across the board often defense kicking gain we feel I guess Keith for us if we want to go out there and play well as Chicago\nThat ... talking about the team as they had to Chicago to take the bears we're now joined\nBy any harder patriots football weekly used ... by Franklin Pierce University in New England or used to winning it with a degree from Franklin Pierce university you can win your dream job does it frankly beers\nDot edu Chris Gasper in Chicago at soldier field I'm it's what's bill patriot place box borough also in ... in the yard inside your white stadium Andy what's up\nMore than guys are you are doing well getting ready for a yet another patriots game this one on the road and union just started ... say a road has not been so friendly to the patriots students point but do we feel like they're in a different place now than were they were a month ago\nI Do um I think the Gronkowski absence sort of slows that train a little bit um but I Do think in general they're better football team heading in the right direction now this is the challenge you know that's part of it part of the reason they've struggled on the road\nIs I think they faced a good defense in Jacksonville that was playing well at the time or they played the map Patricia defense that you know the the inter knowledge probably was a factor\nIn that game and now you say a top ten type defense with\nUm the ability to get after the quarterback and disrupt Tom Brady here again on the road but yes I think the weapons are better certainly Julian Edelman return you know I said this at the time in Detroit when I think they went uh three ... three three times for the first time ever was Brady that doesn't happen in my\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again the blood borne as over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com [noise]\nCan kind of fill in or pick up where we're Bronx slack is left off to draw some coverage in open things up for others because as I said this bears defense even with Mac limited\nThey have some athletes up front and certainly Smith can chase James White I think I'm Out of the backfield as well as as almost anyone of miles jak type role um so I think there are some concerns with with how you match up against this bears defense but I think Tom Brady with Edelman on the field is just a whole different ballgame for the bears to deal with\nAndy you mentioned Josh Gordon there we stop obviously last week a huge spike\nIn his playing time and it snaps and obviously resolve it you know that sort of had ... or sat as the odd man out do you think that's a situation where that was just how they felt about matching up with the chiefs or is this what we're going to see going forward where you're going to see ... and you know playing the majority of the saps here\n... yeah I think so um you know if you listen to Tom Brady the words this past week and and since that game and and really since dropped scored and got here but\nYou know the the positive vi V. has for where this often can get to what Josh Gordon has done in terms of work what he has the opportunity to do in terms of production on the field I think they really like Josh Gordon and I think he changes the the ... not just in his production obviously because there hasn't been a ton of that yet\nBut in the way they space the field and Brady has said this openly that that football is now a game spacing and when you can space the field properly a little bit like you know the NBA a lotta people call it basketball and grass you know he he's like that big man that shoots the three it changes the spacing\nThe game and I think Gordon is going in the right direction I Will say the spike in snaps last week also led to a bit of a spike in\nWell this is a receiver who's not quite on the same page of Tom Brady all the time we saw that the throw down the left side line even the one in the end zone you know where it was a kind of write down where the the seem area would be and he broke the outside and Brady through to the break and Gordon kept drifting to the outside you know I think there's still work there and and Tom set on friday that's just\nThat's just wraps that's just you know working together rep after rep practice field rep after rep gain field\nUm but I Love the hopeful tone in Tom Brady his voice when it comes to jobs Gordon and when it really comes\nTo this off into the whole the one thing I Will say\nWhen you're going to see it today they do not have a single back up on this team in my opinion there is no there is no key role on our fence that has a backup whether it's slut receiver drunk as a past catching tight and outside receiver\nWorkhorse running back Michele past catching running back in white you know there there's just no backups there so you're playing without a net and you have to piece it together when one of those guys are out and and you're going to see them do that today and and you hope maybe Gordon is a reason that he can do that and maybe he's spikes a little bit not just in wraps but maybe today the production can spike a little\nAny harder patriots football weeklies with us Andy we were having a discussion earlier I Want to ask you the same question and that is who is this a bigger game for the patriots fans or patriots defense\nUm [noise] I think\nIt's always a bigger game for the off into I don't mean to be negative\nBut to me the defenses in it is what it is land\nAnd I don't think it's all that good and I don't think there's a lot of room for hope that it's ever going to be good for example today feels like one of those games to me where if the often does what it wants to do which radius talked about all week starting faster playing better early and get to lead\nIt may be a better day for the defense because you're playing for him in front you're going to have Michel ... who's a young quarterback and there's still some\nIssues they're playing from behind he'll probably make a mistake\nAnd this was one of those you know characteristic games where the often goes up ten fourteen points early controls the game and that leads to the defense looking better I thought there was a lot of that and that stretch last year where you know after they struck shook off the early season Ross they sort of fell in line with a low scoring games this feels like one of those to me were because the often controls the game\nThe defense will look better I\nI just don't have a lot of hope that this defense is going to get to the point where you can rely on it to really step up and when you anything or\nOr really make massive contributions to a win and I think that's fine I think we're seeing that in the national football league defense doesn't matter they're not allowed to play they're not allowed to do anything and\nI don't even know who has a good defense anymore although Markey teams are teams that can score points you know the rams yeah keep talking about the rams Vikings a couple of weeks ago on Thursday Night Football two teams that are supposed to be well rounded\nIt was a shootout patriots cheese shoot out you see the jaguars giving up a ton of points I just don't know who the good defenses are now the bears by the way today if they want to I'm not shut down Tom Brady in company but if they put a\nHow would you like motor joins twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one Ninety nine brought will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty best run for the best rice anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars from us only a flood forward and he went into and there were again it\nReally is I Know everybody saying it as cliche is the big twelve but that's the reality\nThis one I'd say was a swing and miss\n... thank you at least you have at least you got that going out and I'd be happy I Am happy it makes me happy yes\nI've never been there before I've never been to Chicago before so I don't know I don't have anything to compare to I think it's nice inside but\nShoot I don't know what it looked like outside\nI Can't believe you've never been to Chicago telling me about it right great place rate is I like access to raise the place to visit\nIf you've never been hit it out okay let's talk about the football team Jeff what do you know about Rob Gronkowski injury status I Know that he's not going to play that he's been ruled out are dealing with not only the\nAnkle which I guess and I said I don't know that it's really the ankle I don't know that I buy it's just an ankle and now there's the back what are you know\nTell me they ... yeah it's most certainly the back or I saw him I talk to them on friday and yeah I saw walk out of the training room and somebody just wasn't right\nNow I never really put that stuff out there because you never know like what a guy is going through maybe he just or whatever but then an hour later they Adam so the injury report and you're like okay well that makes a lot more sense he looked really stiff\nAnd uncomfortable as he walked out and went over to his locker\nAnd you know we're talking for a couple of minutes and and like\nHe uh again I mean he seemed to be in a decent mood or at least with the conversation was going because I'm such an apple will personality but it was a waste of Oregon you add up all these factors and it's like okay now it it really is starting to click the back is an issue\nI'm not sure if it was something that directly happened in their practice or if it's just something that has happened or occurred and mounted over time because he's got the three back surgeries but\nUh if it's a legit issue and it's something that has clearly been on the radar since Friday morning\nSo Jeff where where did the patriots go from here obviously you know no ... in this game and no Jacob Hollister either Hollister can't they can't stay healthy at that position where do they go from here in terms of his game in terms of trying to attack would just right now and it's a tight and\nYeah I don't think they're going to use a whole lot of joy and Allen of the passing a so it's got to be frustrating for all of us are just starting with him I mean this is the second time he also admits that week one game with a hamstring injury\nSo this is a reoccurring thing he had the two uh absences a couple of weeks back with the chest issue that he had so now the fourth time that he's going to miss a game and seven weeks so from there I mean this is it's a good time to have your wide receivers rolling because they're going to need to really rely on them\nJosh Gordon I mean this could be a huge Josh Gordon game just\nBecause of what we've seen in the way that his reps have increased over the last three weeks or especially last week he's looking more comfortable in the ... there are still the issues that you're going to see and I would expect those to linger throughout the season\nBut again when you got guys like Julian Edelman and Josh Gordon taking over those top two spots and and you get a chance for Chris Hogan and feel of door set to match up against the fourth or fifth\nOr ... you know as the defenses fourth or fifth priority on any given play you know that's conducive to being able to spill worth of all down the field I mean you're not going to have the luxury of Gronkowski taking double and triple teams in the red zone but you know that ... that the coverage is will probably role more toward Edelman and James White like we've seen throughout the season but\nThis was a game that I think they were going to have to pass the ball out anyway because of the bears run defense and you know based off what we've seen from bronco over the previous five games basically every game since the opener\nA it was you know he was probably going to get a lot of those double coverages and Brady was probably thinking about relied on other guys anyway\nJeff it feels to me now like we're at a point where we didn't you get more and more about Josh Gordon and the relationship with Tom Brady you know they really work together and raise taking them under his wing that sort of storyline continues to be porch do we have any reason to believe that the communication issues that\nWere happening a week ago between the two was nationally on some of those comeback routes on the sideline have been resolved as they go into this game today in Chicago\nNow I mean it's also partly I think in a possible request I mean you can't ask a guy whether it's I mean we talked about this a million times\nRhode Island's number one born dealer is setting the standard again and again the blood borne as over one hundred brand new borders gates were just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nAll the roads ... exact away the Tom Brady want you to do what you got to be able to see the defense of the same way and you know the the sideline hate Jews are a little bizarre because this is not just last week or or the week before I mean these are\nThe depth of those routes in particular has been off I probably eight to ten times so far in his three games so that's something that they've really got to work through I'm not sure if it's you know you have to see the coverage the same way as Brady or whatever I mean I don't\nThe the officer so complex that there's there's a million different things that could be\nI also think I don't I mean I I just want to cut you off quick I don't think it's been exclusive Gordon there about other guys women in the same spot in his office in previous years on ... routes\nAbsolutely and you know what the thing is the the encouraging thing I Would say is the depths of Gordon's routes over the middle has been really good I mean there's really only been two instances when I've\nI've seen him kind of cut it off a little too earlier right into the shoulder of a linebacker a shading quarterback or whatever so it's not like ... like you said it's basically just been those sideline wrote the comebacks that have he's just been off on so\nI don't know is that a quick fix in theory maybe but I don't I I mean it's just it's a complicated often again Jeff what do you make of the defense\nAt this point you know coming off the performance against Kansas City and allowing forty points and the three the last four games they've allowed more than four hundred yards of our fence and I I Know yards are not big and I know bills not big on yards but I just thought that at this point it's actually for the last five games really with\n... yards I just started this point the defense would be a little further along\nYeah yeah it's a good question I mean it's hard to like you said it's it's not just the Kansas City thing but the uh ... and the yards I mean they always give up a ton of yards it's\nYou know you've got to get rid of those big place you know in one week it's it's the third downs the next week is the big plays and and you know it's always they're always seeming or they have been trying to catch up to something on any given week and\nYou know part of it might be the system that they face it's weird I mean the the Andy Reid type of off and they've now seen this will be their third consecutive weeks seeing that\nType of office and you know the bears have some some play makers they have a good play color so I think they're going to get creative and and you're going to have to stop a lot of the same stuff that you've seen over the last couple of weeks and\nEven going back to the super bowl in February so you know this is a good chance for them to try to continue to work that stuff out of their system in case they see you know the chiefs again in the\nPlayoffs what have you thought Jeff just quickly the play of of Devon recording so far this year a lot of people feeling that you know Bill Belichick sort of called him out when it came to the you know Twenty one points you know three play now one of those obviously was on special teams in the longer term but\nWhen you sort of called them out this week is is that is that warranted\nIt was shocking but I think if there is a short list the guys who can take that the right way Devin recording is absolutely there so I thought it was interesting I mean I talked to majority last week after the uh\nJews as yeah the Colts game and he said you know if you have a game when you have like for bad place even if it's out of Seventy five or eighty that you're on the field that's a bad game so this is now back to back weeks in the court has given up a couple of touchdowns which is\nShocking because I think I had to go back about three years to the last time recorded given up two touchdowns so\nOr if it's something that they have to talk about working it out of their system I mean are there some communication issues we've seen that in the past we notably with Gilmore last year when you work in a new defensive back I mean it's funny you talk about the chemistry\nThat he's got with with a new guy it happens to be his twin brother but you know maybe they're just not seeing things the same way because Jason ... you know the some of the other issues I mean the colds he got beaten man coverage couple of times or I guess one was just a sagging zone on that salty\nBut the last week against the chiefs the issues we're really when he was on the same side of the field is Jason recording so again that tells me that you know maybe\nHe was seeing an assignment on wages and saw the other and then boom you have a huge break down and when you've got a team with the athleticism or the chiefs they're able to really take advantage of it\nAre Jeffrey she had the time it's hard to actually ask Jeff out from the athletic [noise] excuse me we don't zeroed

told me a story of us remember the whole like Jerry Rice thing with you know you catch the ball you take it all the way to the end zone and every play and practice like and so\nWhat ... told me was that that's going on and bears practice and only the river so if someone catches the ball down feeling the defense of practice you know the first couple of weeks he was there you see Mac running to the ball and then you know a week later maybe it's four or five guys running to the ball and now everyone's rain but the ball and so\nI they view this guy is the type of\n... type of player who could take them for being a very good defense to one that may be can be excellent for an extended period of time like the Pittsburgh's like the Baltimore like Caroline has been more recently um I think they
