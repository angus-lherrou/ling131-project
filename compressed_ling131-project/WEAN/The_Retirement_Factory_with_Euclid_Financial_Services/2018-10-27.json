knew what they want us to live and how they want to spend that they just didn't know how did the in between the lifestyle work together to give them the answers they want it and that's where the rainy income report was really a big tool for them was because they can see on paper what the him joy in their lifestyle combined would actually turn into for their entire life\nMany I mean we're talking about lifestyle we're talking about like Cathy and and what really Kathy was the one because she was she was starting to dream Big Jim was was so hyper focused and can we afford it can we afford it\nThen he wasn't actually thinking through what a budget was\nIt's scary for some people but you have to allow yourself to start dreaming and say I at forty years of purpose I was doing amazing

going to look like they go with it only costs you know two thousand dollars to in my house and that's a great place to start\nRight that's one of the inventory yeah right that's where the image or a but it doesn't hit your lifestyle that doesn't at your budget that doesn't have to spend that yours yeah or they have to figure that out before you get the layered income\nBecause at that 'cause I don't have a hard part because it doesn't answer what are you gonna do agree when you stop working right 'cause if you ask yourself the question what am I going to do if I had to retire tomorrow and you kind of panic a little bit and you go well I got some hobbies and I got some honey do list and these little things that's a good place to start\nYeah if we don't want to say about what the long toilets the ones that say I'll figure it out when I get there yeah that's the ones I worry about those are the ones that keep me up at night because when clients come in and they go well I'm going to retire and then I'm going to do honey do stuff I I have so many chores to do list to do something to start there and then\nI'm going to magically figure out what I Want yeah those are the ones that I physically sit down locked eyes with and say I need you to write down ten things that you have put off\nFor your entire life the things that you just didn't have time for or didn't make time for or they were just silly because they were two out of your ego or out of your realm to do I need you to sit down and do that because that that gets dangerous\nIt's I I like to call for ten things I Want

seven to seven to seven that's four oh one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven don't let your retirement become mediocre\nYeah when you're talking about budgeting and these ... people get anxious I heck I get anxious so when we're when we're talking about you have to start figuring out purpose the number one thing people say when they're in a group because they feel pressure is oh I don't need that or I already have\nThat and then you'll ask as an advisor us very politely so what are you going to do in retirement and it's you're not looking for I'm going to cure cancer or I'm going to house orphans we're not looking for that kind of thing but we are looking\nFor what's your next big adventure and if it's falling back in love with your spouse that is amazing if it's making sure that your children never feel that you didn't love them or that you work through some relationship issues that is also gorgeous if it's something simple like I'm going to take a vacation or I'm going to\nPraise myself for I don't know three for eight months a year we didn't do that it's it's one of those things that we definitely that's the purpose you have to think through that Russia are gonna be stuck in this depression and I think that's part of this ready to be reading 'cause you have to mentally be ready to get into the game\nYeah if the idea of what am I going to do for the next ten Fifteen twenty Thirty years in my life don't get us wrong the financial side is extremely important 'cause you're gonna be able to pay for the next component is how am I going to stay mentally and emotionally healthy in driven so that I actually have that\nPurpose of and it could just be something as simple as you were saying as I'm going to spend time with myself and do the things that you can get the new before I'm going to reconnect with\nFamily or friends or wherever it is that\nYou happy right I'm going to I'm going to read all these books that I haven't read but you need that budget too so that if you have the idea of I'm going to take a cruise well that's a different budget then I'm going to read the works of Shakespeare and they're not the first edition right [laughter]\nSo it's a it's one of the things that two different budget that brings us to layered income off so you have an inventory you wrote down one of the first thing is everybody likes to do is go okay I have all this money this is\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eighty four to one fifty the best for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at point forward and he went into and there were ...\nOf the lifestyle that way you you really need to do with the other way\nAnd so give us a call here you could add four oh one seven to seven to seven to seven once again that numbers for all one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven and will help you understand that if you take if you go through inventory what do I have\nStocks bonds mutual funds cash how much where am I Am out near the tax more non taxable and then step to lifestyle before you think about income lifestyles expenditures because when you get into income middleman and you'll tell him just like everybody else you need to understand guaranteed income is for your entire life so but that's not everything\nDisregard the number that's easier said than done right yeah disregard the number and now what am I going to do with my life what's my life purpose and I know it's really big just say that because when you thought while I was going to be the I don't know\nThe accountant for X Y Z company you didn't think that was my life purpose when you were going to become the accountant but that's what you did for fifty years\nYeah it's the the idea of what do I want to be when I grow up well what do I want to do when I'm retired it's the same question\nYeah and so you just give it starts saying what are you going to do when you grow up and then when everybody ... retire Sergio and congratulations you're finally grown\nAt us exactly so now that you you understand okay I can pick and choose what I Want to be and how I Want to be it you can dive right into it but the one thing that you have to remember is the beginning point of any retirement plan is that you've got to create a stable foundation to maximize your retirement income especially in a predictable\nFashion so the starting point is understand how to optimize your Social Security benefits because at face value you can lead tens of\nThousands of dollars on the table by employing a few little known strategies it's actually possible to generate as much as a hundred thousand dollars or more an additional lifetime income so let myself and the teen years you could financial services\nGive you a complementary customize your income report so this way you can see how much maximizing your retirement income can actually\nImpact your overall retirement now to get your customized plan the one of the first five callers right now it for one Seventy seven to seven to seven that's for one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven don't let your retirement become mediocre\nNow Manny one of the things that are a great about this a written income report is that it really does straighten out your retirement it's it's awesome I actually we had a car call and Kathy oh Jesus had to be six months ago maybe five\nI in Kathy called up and said hey I Want a written income report that's fine with so come on and Kathy came in and I got lucky enough\nI got to sit with her when she was going through the discovery meeting we were talking about how the process works we are going through the GPS system and going through all\nFive stages and she kept on saying well well I just want to know how much money I can spend or how much money I have I Need this amount of money I Need to know how I'm going to replace and she was trying to replace eighty thousand dollars which eighty thousand dollars is what is aggressive\nBut it it's very very easy to do especially if you have the asset level to balance it and so she was really really concerned about her layered income\nAnd so she was hyper focused on it she said well if I turn on my Social Security and this isn't the discovery made and when I can say well first you got to tell me what we're trying to do and she said what's real obvious I'm trying to understand my income she was hyper focused\nOn it which is great mine is the fact that she didn't have a clear inventory and she didn't have a clear direction of what she was going to do once she stopped working\nAnd she's a sales rep so once you stop being a sales rep what was she going to do after that she had built up all these skills of communication with other people and and what is she going to be in and what are you going to do when you grow up like you were saying and she was really not having that conversation with me she refused\nTo have that conversation she didn't know she was refusing she wasn't being malicious and refusing it\nShe just didn't know that's\nWhat I was asking shoes hyper focused on how am I going to be paid if I stopped working today how I make my money tomorrow and I was and I was literally telling her I said well first we have to do it written income report and that written income report will that will do is we'll give you an inventory so we have to have all of your statements we have to know where your bank accounts are we have to know this stuff\nAnd she had no problem giving that to me but she I don't think she had the gravity of understanding how important it is to understand where all your money is that we can start breaking it out\nInto different piles and different organizations so they have our daily money are mid muddy and then our storage accounts she didn't understand those because she didn't understand guaranteed predictable inflexible\nAnd so if you're trying to figure this out to go to our website and that is\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what board any religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all may fall models and incredible prices are going to flood Otto John job now\nKathy went out there and she started filling out the sheet because I literally gave her an image or she said here now I had our statement so I was going to do an image or a anyways but I needed her to walk through the exercise too yeah\nAnd she did and she came back for strategy and we started talking and it was absolutely amazing because she was so hyper focused on still where's my layered income going to come from but then I laid out the written income report and I said this that we're going to get to eighty thousand and there's a thousand ways of skin this cat\nWhich ruined her bus because she was expecting one answer one way black and white\nAnd it is if you understand what you're trying to do if you understand what you're purposes so we started talking about writing a cookbook\nI Want to talk about somebody and I wasn't doing it on purpose but I said you are a foodie you love to do this yeah start writing a cookbook and she said well why would I Do that I said because you're trying to support a legacy you're trying to make a name for yourself you're you're born sales woman you know exactly\nWhat you're trying to do write a cookbook build a business do these things in sequence you order you'll have\nPurpose you'll have legacy you'll be able to promote something and it's all self promotion of yourself so you feel that you have a purpose and it generates your budget so to hit your eighty thousand piece of cake this how you do it we turn on Social Security we turn on your four one K.\nAnd we have we set up a small pension those you're guaranteed money that's going to travel from go go to death what about inflation was that's predictable money we'll we have to worry about that in five years this pull the money the IRA that you have set aside is going to be a rough so it does take care of inflation without taxation so you don't change your tax\nBracket she's like a really that's ... yeah so predictable many were in turn those on five or seven years whenever you need it or when you hit a threshold so don't panic this money set aside All right so it's going to grow until that and then she was like well what if I was something that happens what if life gets in the way what if I cook book stinks I said we were not actually we're not actually budgeting that you're going to make money off that\nCookbook the cookbook is for you to promote brag to your friends have a good time and then if you pass away your grandchildren will brag about you and say this is my grandmother and this is the picture of my grandmother you want to talk about something awesome it's amazing so you have to have that all in one place\nYeah well what I loved him on it was she was so focused on trying to understand how much she could actually spin and actually be able to spend every weekend retirement that some of the other things were kind of lost until it was laid out but that was definitely the starting point for her so if you're asking\nThe same questions do you know how much you can and actually be able to spend every week and retirement or know without a shadow of a doubt that you actually have enough money to last about how long you live these are important questions and you have\nTo get the answers before you retire while there's still time to prepare and make sure you money last as long as yours doesn't retirement now the team here at you could financial services we're
