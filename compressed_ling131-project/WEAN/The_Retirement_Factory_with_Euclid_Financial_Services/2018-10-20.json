I tell you I should've been lawyer my past like well let me uh well let's go let's go back to to the rover\n'cause the easiest way to think of it is when you leave an employer anytime you leave you should be doing a rover because once you leave you no longer have any use for it\nNow rolling over four one K. it can be an emotional decision especially if you've been contributing to have over the last Thirty years this is a conversation that I was having with my Maria last week mice works for Honeywell for over Thirty years ... has been with lifespan for the last twenty\nAnd they came in because they both want to retire this year but they're not sure how rolling over their four one K. actually fits into their retirement plan\nSo as I sat down there was definitely some nervousness in the air they weren't sure what to actually expect\nAnd so it turns to them and they said thanks for coming in today this is a discovery meeting so our goal today's to learn about what's important to you and what you're trying to accomplish so tell me a little bit about why you're here today and they both eased back and that's what Mike said to me we both want to retire this year\nBetween Maria's pension and our Social Security I feel like we have plenty of income we're just not sure what to do with our foreign case once we've actually retired enroll them over\nAnd so as we talk some more it became clear what Mike I'm Maria needed\nThey had done the first steps to get ready for retirement they had an image or a of all their accounts they knew what they had for income streams that we're guaranteed and they knew what they want to do once they retired ... was missing was a distribution plant showing them out all the pieces fit together so I said to them I can definitely help you\nWhat we need is a written income report it'll tell us how much you need to withdraw from your IRAs and went to turn on your Social Security so they line up to Maria's pension\nThis way we can make sure that all your accounts of working together so that there are any tax surprises later as we finished up the meeting I can see the way he had been lifted\nThey were getting guides and direction of what to do as they transition from working to retirement so they said to me as they were scheduled for next meeting we're so glad we came in to a big relief knowing that there's a process we can follow\nHere you could financial services we believe the beginning point of any retirement plan is to create a stable foundation to maximize your retirement income in a predictable fashion\nSo the starting point is to optimize your Social Security benefits because at face value you can leave tens of thousands of dollars on the table but by and playing a few little known strategies it's possible to generate as much as a hundred thousand dollars a more an additional lifetime income\nSo let me give you a free customize raining come report to see how maximizing your retirement income can impact overall retirement be one of the next seven callers right now at four zero one Seventy seven to seven to send them to get your free written income report again that's four zero one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven\nMany of those reports actually are amazing when it comes down to understanding where your incomes going to come from because it's one of the biggest things how do I transitioned my four one K. into an income stream because I've been saving this money my entire working adult life right from thirty five to Seventy thirty five to sixty five\nAnd I have to then turn it into an income stream so do I do take it like I was taking\nLoans or do I just would dry that report late\nFlood Lincoln is southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable service\nOr a little deeper the control of your money because people believe that for one case are owned by the recipient the participant the person putting the money in their own by the employer you just have rights to some of the money not all of the money\nOnce you wrote to your personal IRA individual retirement account it's in the name right Wall Street and Wall Street\nIndividual retirement account once you roll it over\nThen it's your money and it's only your money at that point so we really do have to talk about that that's where the distribution comes from four on caves are not designed to distribute it's kind of like taking water from a five gallon bucket it's really really hard to pour it it's really really hard to get it out\nSeventy seven to seven to seven or four oh one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven let's get talking about retirement Josh just dive into this topic\nOn for one case you know being an advisor here or you could we come across several large companies that the foreign Kate is probably one of the best benefits companies like since ... and every source and Eighteen tea and ... they have really good four one K. plans because well they want their employees to save for retirement besides being having a good\nWell for one case are definitely a benefit they're there to help people say if they're there to help people get in front of retirements so not just the bosses are retiring but everybody's\nRetiring fuss exactly we have to get on the table the basic savings plan because that's what ... are so the basic savings plan is how much should we be saving twenty percent eighty percent four hundred percent of our gross no maybe not\nThat high but I I wouldn't mind saving four hundred percent I Know that you're going to pay for a hundred percent of what this physics\nMajors that they're going that's impossible USA so the idea right so when you're talking about your four one K. exactly what should a baby boomer be targeting ten to Fifteen Percent savings does it ought to be in the ... no but it has to be total gross income\nYeah and I think we also have to address what happens when you actually hit your goal when you're four one K. what's that next step is it possible to hit your goal and you're four one K. is there actually is if you're now if you don't set one you'll never hit it if you're ever ever uh the last thing you know that the gods stopper Atlanta but\nThere is a finish line too and it's called retirement you do have a goal I Know in the eighties everybody had to have a million dollars right it doesn't take a million dollars for everybody to retire but you have to think through where is your finish line in savings\nReally ties into that we're talking about four one K. rollovers we have to talk about our MDs distribution\nThese are all mechanics at work off of something as easy as an employer savings plan it is absolutely amazing if the conversation is just tuning in or if you're just doing into the conversation give us a call at four O. one\nSeventy seven to Seventy seven that again is for one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven\nIt is absolutely something that will save your retirement talking ... understanding the life cycle and not forgetting that a four one K. does not live in your retirement and IRA lives in your retirement and it more as a butterfly\nFrom your home and K uh yes metamorphosis ... know chrysalis that just that's the cocoon welcome to the science so yes service that's right\nIt's very this is good stuff you really are critical if that's the stage between working and retirements called pre retirement yeah we've we may be on track so four one K. is that we're talking about today\nSo when you're sitting in a four O. one K. or you're saving any in any employer plan you really have to get your mind around a couple of really quick things how much you might actually trying to save and if the answer is as much as I possibly can you're not going to make your goal you have to have a goal\nI'm going to hit ten percent of my total gross I'm going to hit Fifteen Percent of my total gross I'm only going to save six percent of my total gross by the way all of those are great numbers and if you can think about\nThat then you can lower your tax bracket you can actually get to a retirement number you can get to an income number you can get to where you're you're actually trying to get when it comes to distribution of your retirement assets\nGesture of fire today when it comes to uh using four one K. ...\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for free on condition at what board and he's written a generic as if that's right over two hundred three on cars all may fall models and incredible prices love onto flood auto John job now\nYou're taking advantage of that so if their employer match is three percent you want to make sure you're you're contributing as much to get that match\n... uh Jason I couldn't agree more with that\nI Love this topic today now it's a reminder I'm Manny ... and it's my pleasure\nTo be part of the team here you could financial services we're all certified Social Security advisors with our NSA designation as well as myself and Jason ... ... a ours with ... management division so we can help you maximize your Social Security and your IRA benefits to set up a retirement income tax\nStrategy it's all under one roof here you could financial services now be one of the next six calls here at four zero one seven to seven to seven to seven and we will customize a written income report just for you now again the numbers for zero one\nSeven to seven twenty seven twenty seven\nWhen you're talking about a income report you really have to get your mind around how much money in my putting into this report is it coming from I raise is coming from savings counts as it coming from brokerage accounts is it coming from overland cases coming from active for one case\nThere's a lot of jargon and if you get in one place so that you can read it as a whole I like to call it a global look right if you can read that that's what an income report does it says this is how you distribute your money from these types of vehicles\nAnd you can actually ride off into the sunset and have a great retirement it is a need to have report\nOh absolutely and what it does is it gives you the tools to be able to take over your four one K. and if you start to give it some direction because when you're using your four one K. at work you actually have to have three things under control to actually ...\nYou've got to be diversified so you've got to have more than one investment choice right 'cause if you went to one thing as might not be diversified the other is you actually have to manage it which means you have to actually know how much are you putting in and for how long are you going to do that for and then last\nWhich is your most important one is you've got to have a goal they sleep I Want to retire and I want to have this much money at retirement\nAnd it could be a percentage or a dollar amount it's just like putting together a recipe you have more than one component\nBut if you need a couple of flour and half a cup of sugar but you're having half the people you can cut in half that's what you're saying when it's ten percent of your spouse's income and ten percent of yours together they don't make twenty percent but they do make one whole retirement\nTogether that's right that's right and that's how you make cupcakes as well that's for a for no profit yes right so if you're trying to figure this equation out just go to the Web site go to Euclid F. S. dot com that's easy C. L. I. D. as\nIn financial s isn't services dot com there's a ton of calculators there there's a ton of white pages or you can see many of the ... you can see Jason the Republican and you'll see a video of Josh was waving at ya so click on that and you'll get a ton of information it's a wonderful time we love that you visited it's great\nOh well thank you I'm Glad I did this all the time now [laughter]\nAt all I really carry out its so but the savings right so we're talking about how do we added our match how do we not what if what if our employer doesn't match is a former case still good deal yeah because there's a ton of reasons to use a four\nOne K. it's an automatic withdraw from your checking account automatic withdrawal from your a payroll so it goes right in it reduces your total pay I mean there's a ton of reasons to use the four one K. or for three be four fifty seven whatever you want employer plans are great great great tool\nYeah enemy actually one of the options that I like in some of the employer plans like horizon you have the ability to do traditional or pre tax money or you can actually put after tax a rough money in there as well so when you go into retirement you know I actually have to retirement accounts one that's tax on one that's not and that can be a\nVery powerful tool just by systematically saving throughout your entire working ...\nLet's dive into that 'cause that's not a bad topic that so if you so\nIn a four one K. you could ever raw four one K. or you could have a traditional four one K. traditional for all and K is tax\nDeductible and a raw four one K. is not the six ... and so if I'm max out say I have eight hundred thousand in my traditional i._r._a.\nAnd I'm concerned about tax free money in retirement I can stop contributing to my traditional and start contributing to my Roth even though I never have\nLess exactly it so you can start that at any time because there's no there's no rule that says you can't have one and then go to the other when there's no rule that says you can't contribute to the bowl you just have to pick is it right for me at that time\nWhat you have to stand your capital of it's just so everybody doesn't think it's unlimited I Can't put away eighty thousand dollars into these two accounts because I make it you you have to you have to stay under a cap limit and I think that's your only um well heck up the only thing to really be worried about\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for free on condition at what board and he's written a generic as if that's right over two hundred three on cars all all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto John job now\nThe things to look for or do I have a match or\nDo I have a profit sharing because if I if I get too close to my cap and then they go to pay my profit sharing I might not get the same amount because my campus to my mom too close to my cap so you do want to have that calculated and some of the reports\nThat we give out will do that for you a quick conversation in a cup of coffee will definitely lay that out really easily Oh absolutely\nI mean because remember the beginning point of any retirement plan is to create a stable foundation that maximize your retirement income in a predictable fashion\nSo that starting point is to optimize your Social Security benefits because at face value you can leave tens of thousands of dollars on the table by employing a few little known strategies it's possible to generate as much as a hundred thousand dollars or more in additional lifetime income\nSo let me give you a free complimentary written income report so this way you can see how maximizing your retirement income could impact your overall retirement now to get your customize written income report you must be at least fifty five years old and be ready to be ready for retirement she'll be one of the first\nFive callers right now at four zero one Seventy seven to seven to seven that's four zero one\nSeventy seven twenty seven twenty seven", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Retirement Factory with Euclid Financial Services", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "20"}
