your original\nMedicare only covers Seventy percent of your total medical need so you gotta feeling\nLooking for a car credit not very well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east

white pages and then give us a call and you'll actually understand a great deal when we're talking about supplemental um I Want to talk about Barbara she had a a massive\nConcern I mean it was one of those concerns that kept her awake at night here she was sixty four she's getting ready to retire she she didn't have a full\nUnderstanding of part a and part B she works for a CBS and she is in the field right everybody thinks\nThat because you were serious she works in the IT department of CBS so it's not like she she she's every day at the pharmacy she has a great Blue Cross Blue Shield plan over at CBS she was looking to figure out\nDo I take part hey at sixty five that's where she was hyper focused and all I had to do is explain to her in very very clean English when she turned sixty five\nShe is going to have part a the CBS planned Blue Cross Blue Shield is going to turn into a Blue Cross Blue Shield sixty five anyways so her coverage will be now to she'll have a primary and she'll have a secondary her primary\nIs going to be her employer because she's still employ her secondary is the federal government under Medicare part a once this happened\nA light bulb went off you could just see are kind of relaxing sit back in the chair and say is it that easy I said yeah they've been doing it for decades I it really is that easy once you turn sixty five\nIt automatically happens you would have\nTo go and do a lot of work legwork to get it to stop happening so just let it happen it's free you still pay CBS has premium and it goes to the plan once you actually retire then we have to pick up once you retire retire then you have to pick up medic gap or supplemental the same thing and we only have\nSix plants to choose from it's not a huge deal\nYeah and I I Love that you walked her through the process was going to be so she knew what a time lines were and it was going to be a direct\nCorrelation to win or old coverage would stop and winter news coverage would stop now\nLook I Am glad that we're all here with us today after a time in factory myself and Josh Wells we're part of the retirement team here you could financial services and it's our number one goal to make sure that we protect and preserve your freedom to choose what will work best for you and retirement we've been doing this exactly for thousands of folks just like you so in honor of this we're giving away seven of our financial\nStress tests to help you find out whether or not you're making the right choices for your retirement and your medical so be one of the next seven callers here at four zero one\nSeven to seven to seven to seven again that seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven and be one of the next seven calls for your free financial stress test\nYeah this financial stress tests I when Barbara got hers it was easy because he was actually where is all your money she has a lot of stock she has a lot of company ... she has a lot of four one K. so she had two different for one case and she was concerned that she had to tap into those\nAnd use some of those to pay for medical it really turned out that her income that she was going to set up would cover the supplemental because\nWhen you say go to the exchange pickups supplemental ... well there's a real fear there yeah\nWell I don't want to do that that's and then there's all these wives tales about what it is so the supplemental when you go to the a C a or you go to the health exchange however you want to say at once against just a marketing term once you go purchase it from the federal pool however you want to say it when you go ... percent from the federal pool that cool determines your cost\nAnd it doesn't remember a as always free be has a premium and then supplemental is going to be your it's going to be your\nAdam plan your gap and that comes from a carrier at a United Blue Cross Blue Shield Harvard pilgrim name accompany it goes there right that's that's where it is\nYeah and I and I actually want to touch them at wives' tales that you were talking about before because there's still some misconceptions or at least some information out there that's no longer accurate I think the biggest key takeaway is health care is changing ... an age of ... and it's changing for the good now with\nAnything when there's change there's going to be some bumps in the road but the biggest key takeaway is they can't take your medical away from you once you have\nCoverage you have coverage and you don't have to worry about preexisting conditions any\nThese are good points man I I was I'm I'm kind of assuming and I should stop doing that when when you're thinking about medical insurance if not the eighties anymore it's not the nineties anymore it's not even to thousands anymore\nIt is a new world and they called health or what is it health care three point O. and so this is the idea\nThat we've actually started to improve the United states health in Sharon's in health care system it's a big deal so when a consumer goes to buy health insurance you're buying health insurance that covers the air\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was

I've always been with my employer my employer's plan is good it's United it's at nights it's well Harvard oiled robots whatever it is it's Blue Cross Blue Shield so now I actually have to understand what it gives me it would benefit there is so I have to kind of face that that maybe it doesn't cover everything I thought it did\nA good thing I never got sick but when I get tired how do I keep
