committed already done their image touring and where they were struggling was\nHow do they connect the image or to their lifestyle because they knew what they want us to live and how they want to spend that they just didn't know how to the image toward the lifestyle work together to give them the answers they want it and that's where the reigning come report was really a big tool for them was because they can see on paper what the image tore in their lifestyle combined would actually\nTurned into for their entire life\nMany when we're talking about lifestyle we are talking about like Cathy and and but really Kathy was the one 'cause she was she was starting to dream Big Jim was was so hyper focused and can we afford it can we afford it\nAnd he wasn't actually thinking through what a budget was it's scary for some people but you have to allow yourself to start dreaming and say I at forty years of purpose I was doing amazing things I was the best in my field at XYZ while I was working that day you retire you start a new life so you do\nRhode Island's number one Ford dealer is setting the standard again and again flood born I was over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for

it'll give you all kinds of ideas\nThat why I'm Glad that you brought up purpose because that's that's that usually the missing piece in the lifestyle conversation because the first thing that most people gravitate towards when we say well what's your lifestyle going to look like they're going to live and only cost you know two thousand dollars to in my house and that's a great place to start\nRight that's probably the inventory yeah right that's probably a majority but it doesn't hit your lifestyle that doesn't that your budget that doesn't have to spend that yours yeah or they have to figure that out before you get the layered income\nBecause at that 'cause I don't have a hard part because he doesn't answer what are you gonna do agree when you stop working right 'cause if you ask yourself the question what am I going to do if I have to retire tomorrow and you kind of panic a little bit and you go well I got some hobbies and I got some honey do list in these little things that's a good place to start\nYeah if we want it on their outlets long toilets the ones that say I'll figure it out when I get there yeah that's the ones I worry about those are the ones that keep me up at night because when clients come in and they go well I'm going to retire and then I'm going to do honey do stuff I I have so\nMany chores to do list to do so I'm gonna start there and then I'm going to magically figure out what I Want yeah those are the ones that I physically sit down\nLot guys with and say I need you to write down ten things that you have put off for your entire life the things that you just didn't have time for or didn't make time for or they were just silly because they were two out of your ego or out of your realm to do I need you to sit down and do that because that say gets dangerous\nIt's I I like to call the ten things I Want to do list because you just you write it down and then you put it away for a couple of days and you look back at it again and he's okay do I really actually want to do this right and that gives you that direction of okay I can do is I like it you know and the other thing that will do is it'll tell you what am I actually\nSpent what do I want to spend 'cause this way you can actually know how much you can or will be able to spend\nEvery single week and retirement you actually know without a shadow without that you actually have enough money to laugh no matter how long you live these are the questions that you're\nAsking yourself and these are the questions you have to get answers to before you retire while there's still time to prepare and make sure that your money last as long as your retirement does the tea near you could financial services is giving away customize complimentary ran income reports just for you so

you're talking about budgeting and these ... people get anxious I heck I get anxious so when we're when we're talking about you have to start figuring out purpose the number one thing people say when they're in a group because they feel pressure is oh I don't need that or I already have\nThat and then you'll ask as an advisor us very politely so what are you going to do in retirement and if you're not looking for I'm going to cure cancer or I'm going to house orphans we're not looking for that kind of thing but we are looking\nFor what's your next big adventure and if it's falling back in love with your spouse that is amazing if it's making sure that your children never feel that you didn't love them or that you work through some relationship issues\nThat is also gorgeous if it's something simple like I'm going to take a vacation or I'm going to praise myself\nFor I don't know three for eight months a year when they do that it's it's one of those things that we definitely that's a purpose you have to think too that course you're gonna be stuck in this depression\nAnd I think that's part of this ready to read it because you have to mentally be ready to get into the game\nYeah it's the idea of what am I going to do for the next ten Fifteen twenty Thirty years in my life don't get us wrong the financial side is extremely important 'cause you're gonna be able to pay for the next component is how am I going to stay mentally and emotionally healthy in driven so that I actually have that\nPurpose of and it could just be something as simple as you were saying as I'm going to spend time with myself and do the things that he can get to do before I'm going to reconnect with family or friends or wherever it is that makes you happy\nRight I'm going to I'm going to read all these books that I haven't read but you need that budget too so that if you have the idea of I'm going to take a cruise well that's a different budget then I'm going to read the works of Shakespeare and they're not the first edition right [laughter]\nSo it's a it's one of the things that two different budget that brings us to layered income off so you have an inventory you wrote down\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east furniture Narragansett have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nThey go right into well what am I going to do with the money and then they build a lifestyle that way\nYou you really need to do with the other way and so give us a call here you could at four O. one seven to seven to seven to seven once again that numbers for one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven it will help you understand\nThat if you take if you go through inventory what do I have stocks bonds mutual funds cash how much where am I Am out near the tax more non taxable and then step to lifestyle before\nYou think about income think lifestyles expenditures because when you get into income middleman and you'll tell them just like everybody else\nYou need to understand guaranteed income is for your entire life so but that's not everything that's room and board\nDisregard the number that's easier said than done right yeah disregard the number and now what am I going to do with my life what's my life purpose and I know it's really big just say that because when you thought while I was going to be the I don't know\nThe accounting for X Y Z company you didn't think that was my life purpose when you were going to become the accountant but that's what you did for fifty years\nYeah it's the the idea of what do I want to be when I grow up well what do I want to do when I'm retired at the same question\nYeah and so this gives me it starts saying and what are you going to do when you grow up and then when everybody ... retired stereo and congratulations you're finally grown\nAnd yeah that's exactly it so now that you you understand okay I can pick and choose what I Want to be and how I Want to be it you can dive right into it but the one thing that you have to remember is the beginning point of any retirement plan is that you've got to create a stable foundation to maximize\nYour retirement income especially in a predictable fashion so\nThe starting point is understand how to optimize your Social Security benefits because at face value you can lead tens of thousands of dollars on the table by employing a few little known strategies it's actually possible to generate as much as a hundred thousand dollars or more an additional lifetime income so let myself in the teen years you could financial services\nGive you a complementary customize ... income report so this way you can see how much maximizing your retirement income can actually\nImpact your overall retirement now to get your customized plan the one of the first five callers right now it for one Seventy seven to seven to seven that's for one seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven don't let your retirement become mediocre\nManny one of the things that are a great about this a written income report is that it really does straighten out to retirement it's it's awesome I actually we had a car call and Kathy\nOh jeez this had to be six months ago maybe five I in Kathy called up and said hey I Want to written income report that's fine with so come on and Kathy came in and I got lucky enough I got to sit with her when she was going through the discovery meeting we were talking about how the process works we're going through the GPS system and going through all\nFive stages and she kept on saying well well I just want to know how much money I can spend or how much money I have\nI Need this amount of money I Need to know how I'm going to replace and she was trying to replace eighty thousand dollars which eighty thousand dollars is will is aggressive but it it's very very easy to do especially if you have the asset level to balance it and so she was really really concerned about her layered income and so she was hyper focused\nOn it she said well if I turn on my Social Security and this isn't the discovery\nMade him when I can say well first you got to tell me what we're trying to do and she said what's real obvious I'm trying to understand my income she was hyper focused on it\nWhich is great minus the fact that she didn't have a clear inventory and she didn't have a clear direction of what she was going to do once she stopped working\nAnd she's a sales rep so once you stop being a sales rep what was she going to do after that she had built up all these skills of communication with other people and and what is she going to be in and what are you going to do when you grow up like you were saying and she was really not having\nThat conversation when they she refused to have that conversation she didn't know she was refusing she wasn't being malicious and refusing it\nShe just didn't know that's what I was asking 'cause she was hyper focused on how am I going to be paid if I stop working today how I make my money tomorrow and I would and I was literally telling her I said well first we have to do it written income report\nAnd that written income report will that will do is we'll give you an inventory so we have to have all of your statements we have to know where your bank accounts are we have\nTo know this stuff and she had no problem giving that to me but she I don't think she had the gravity of understanding how important it is to understand\nWhere all your money is that we can start breaking it out into different piles and different organizations so they have our daily money are mid muddy and then our storage accounts she didn't understand those because she didn't understand guaranteed predictable in ...\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nL. I. D. S. as in financial S's in services dot com and I'm telling you win Kathy went out there and she started filling out the sheet 'cause I literally gave her an image or she said here now I had all her statement so I was going to do an image or anyways but I needed her to walk through the exercise too yeah\nAnd she did and she came back for strategy and we started talking and it was absolutely amazing because she was so hyper focused on still where's my layered income going to come from but then I laid out the written income report and I said this that we're going to get to eighty thousand and there's a thousand ways the skin this cat\nWhich ruined her bus 'cause she was expecting one answer one way black and white\nAnd it is if you understand what you're trying to do if you understand what you're purposes so we started talking about writing a cookbook\nI Want to talking about somebody\nAnd I wasn't doing it on purpose but I said you are a foodie you love to do this yeah start writing a cookbook and she said well why would I Do that I said because you're trying to support a legacy you're trying to make a name for yourself you're you're born sales woman you know exactly\nWhat you're trying to do write a cookbook build a business do these things in sequence you order you'll have\nPurpose you'll have legacy you'll be able to promote something and it's all self promotion of yourself so you feel that you have a purpose and it generates your budget so to hit your eighty thousand piece of cake this how you do it we turn on Social Security we turn on your four one K.\nAnd we have we set up a small pension those you're guaranteed monies that's what's going to travel from go go to Jeff what about inflation was that's predictable money we'll we have to worry about that in five years this pull the money the IRA that you have set aside it's going to be a rough so to take care of inflation without taxation so you don't change your tax bracket\nShe's like a really that's like yeah so predictable buddy we're going to turn this on and five or seven years whenever you need it or when you hit a threshold so don't panic this money set aside All right so it's gonna grow until that and then she was like well what if I was something that happens what if life gets in the way what if my cookbook stinks I said we were not actually we're not actually budgeting that you're going to make money off that\nCookbook the cookbook is for you to promote brag to your friends have a good time and then if you pass away your grandchildren will brag about you and say this is my grandmother this is the picture of my grandmother you want to talk about something awesome it's amazing so you have to have that all in one place\nYeah well what I loved him on it wasn't as she was so focused on trying to understand how much she could actually spin and actually be able to spend every weekend retirement that some of the other things were kind of lost until I was laid out was that was definitely the starting point for her so if you're asking\nThe same questions you know how much you can and actually be able to spend every week and retirement\nOr know without a shadow of a doubt that you actually have enough money to last no matter how long you live these are important questions and you have to get the answers before you retire while there's still time to prepare
