must have information\nThat goes deeper than the memo or the email that he obtained which does not specify the particular allegations\nYou know my own my own conversations about this of led me to to hear that and that's the story goes it's it's it it seems like it's public behavior\nFor the most part that that the um complaining representative Catherine cause area and has been concerned about\nIs is that there's a thing here though and that is when she testified in front of the house judiciary earlier this year she felt uncomfortable that was the basis of her memo\nShe wanted the she she just didn't feel comfortable in front of this particular chairman she didn't think she would be handled correctly so the speaker removed him from that part of the hearing to someone take a walk

have it both ways and that's what the speakers teamed up with right now here's a statement by Kathleen haggard he uh had actually tweeted this out a momentarily ago a few moments ago a Kathleen haggard the Esquire attorney for represent appeal cable\nOn behalf of represent have cable and it's difficult to respond in any meaningful way to the allegation of quote sexual harassment and cold those contained within the email of representatives Erian dated march eleventh twenty Eighteen\nMy attempts to gather any specifics are details about this claim have not been successful I've confirmed

representative cable have not communicate in any substantial way since sometime in the first quarter of twenty Fifteen when what was once they closed will turn like for friendship ended so it would seem that any conduct complained that would have had to have been prior to this time\nAs there are no legal proceedings of any kind pending involving represented ... relating to this allegation it seems that it will be left to the public to decide if a statement of this kind without any proof or evidence of truth can be sufficient to achieve it's obvious political objective\nAt this time I Do not intend to make any further public comment on this matter\nSo you know that's a fairly deft Don ... a a public defense by a lawyer who's saying I don't know what I'm doing this I'm I'm working on behalf of my client I'm not going to be my wheelhouse because there's no civil or criminal action here\nSo I'm going to spokes for him\nAnd I'm not going to say anything about it except I'm going to say all these things\nPretty uh pretty well done I mean just in my ring her work I I probably would have done the same thing I Would take the tack that the court of public opinion\nIs the place where

for me well you max and ... and I'll identify who the candidates are in that race but he I think he's got a I think he's got a tight race\nAnd uh\nThe speaker of the house has an excruciatingly tight race\nYou know Steve fry as who came with an eighty seven votes last time and twenty sixteen is is on the Nick ... and\nUh you know some some some dynamics of the political organizations have changed a little bit um mostly and fries his favor I don't think that the speaker has exactly the same mail ballot I'm a operation that he did last time around which may or may not impact the outcome of this race I mean he's\nA trying to sell the idea that he was doing the people's business with the ... stadium finance a mess I'm I don't buy that personally a speaker for the most part has is running much more fiscally conservative ship 'em then it spread of the ... president predecessors\nUm you know I've never considered the speaker a bad guy\nBut the decision smart and\nThere's just so much insular relationship based gobbledygook\nThat goes on in our legislature because it's all of that head counting who's with who won the crucial moment of whatever you need to push through is necessary to have the entire weight of your legislative\nArmy with you I'm that's why the legislative grants the ... I like to call them are so powerful as a tool to keep\nEverybody in line and this particular case represent a cable clearly had some turbulence with another rep and and and I guess the speakers disposition on this was I'll do what I can to massage this thing but I'm not going to make a federal case out of it um because she's not\nAgain I'm making an assumption here\nUm yeah he used he is\nNot a subtle thing I Know the chairman go to the bathroom all the time you know cheer people go potty to cheer people get hungry\nChair people step out of their seats when people are witnessing on a bill offering testimony it's not as if they're there for everybody all the time so the speakers thinking you know it will just have him leave when she testifies because there's a tension between the two of them\nNow I don't know whether the speakers admitting to having received this email something did you see on Twitter that that Tim or that Ted rather is joining us what's his story on that now it's\nA yeah he he was supposed to join us who's going to be pushing off he's trying to hit his deadline so he'll be available as working for a living\nOkay so um what did you tell me that Ted

was but it was a ... again it was the um the essence of the presentation last night was really a beautiful community message and that was one of the things that I I I thought was\nThe right touch and people don't always come to this this understanding about\nYou do what's right at the moment the elected officials the entire federal delegation is there a senators Reid and White House congressman

was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member of them and you don't need a\nNumber one number one you don't need that number two lessened humid yeah there are very much into well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas it's ridiculous and it has to end um have you talked about that with ... yeah I have to wear in the process in the process it will happen\nWith an executive order that's what you're talking about it but I was thinking about I didn't think anybody but knew that but me I thought I was the only one Janice how about a good guess could ever\nSo [laughter] this is this is an uncanny\nFor for a couple of reasons first of all nobody was more critical of Brock Obama about using executive orders then Donald Trump\nBefore he was even a candidate which is just true just\nDon't know I think he's broken ... something like fifty executive orders or something\nLike that that he's issued so so much for that kind of criticism that's not unique by the way you know presidential candidates are observers of the presidency of offering a criticized the sitting president for things that they then do on a much uh\nRhode Island's number one foreign dealer is setting the standard again and again flood born as over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us

spent playing golf are reportedly supersedes that Iraq Obama so I mean these things are these things happen from one presidency to the next but again Donald Trump is kind of um\nYou know I ... the entire environment this notion though that Donald Trump is going to target birthright citizenship with an executive order is it is just\nUnbelievable unbelievable uh you will find because they are there\nYou'll find constitutional scholars who will try to find some legal wiggle room on this but there's no doubt that this is the kind of thing that will be zapped right through the courts and to the United States Supreme court and I don't know whether it would be rendered on a court decision or not but I'm the this this will\nBe without a doubt in other divide a discussion there's no\nCohesive immigration plan despite immigration being his apparent number one priority for this mid term there just isn't there isn't any\nAmerica I think is probably so fit to be tied into tally whether you should left or or writer on these issues we have been I think as citizens begging for a compromise comprehensive immigration reform\nProgram that would put much of this consternation finally to bed [noise] and we don't have it we don't have close to it but we have this kind of cherry picking antagonism\nThat is now at the ultimate level an executive order that would eliminate birthright citizenship or I don't know what you think about this this is going to be you know if if he moves on this\nAnd he seems like he's pretty excited to do so this is going to be a you know what hit the fan type of thing all over the place\nI mean it's just going to be crazy never mind that he more or less has you know the movement of the military to the U.S Mexican Mexican border over a caravan that is still weeks out\nAnd depleted by half\nIs incredible as if this is and he writes and attacked on America it just it just it it's just\nMind boggling the double triple quadruple down he's doing on this particular matter I Know it creates quite the rise out of a lot of the ... base in this country\nBut if you look at the beginning of Trump's campaign and maybe the presidency but certainly the campaign when you ask people in polls where immigration sat in terms of their worry you know their priorities and worry it's deep down the list\nDeep I mean way deep\nSo this has been a\nThis has been something that he is he is on this\nAnd this particular conversation about the fourteenth amendment and being able to impact it via executive order a ... to just ... out the idea that born here creates immediate citizenship\nIs going to be something that will you know ... right to the courts now has he set up to court in in such a way that this thing will be viewed differently perhaps\nBut nobody can write an executive order to undo a constitutional amendment\n[laughter] it just take it you can't do that\nNow are you stunned on your side of the radio about this if you hadn't heard about it already or you're just shaking your head\nOr you so exhausted by the immigration question that you know you just don't know what's next\nI mean it's fascinating but it's\nRhode
