now\nGone cold front the latest in a series of friends that have come through a over the past several days is bearing down on the area and is that we just did not voiced her while it's not been muggy by any means there's just an unfortunate combined with that left the spin up showers and storms and actually ah some rotation with this one particular cell and that has led to a tornado not uncommon but it's certainly not unheard of\nYeah I guess what I'm asking just for a layman's point of view is is you know that doesn't seem like the the twister in Providence that it's been witnessed is the kind of thing you saw it coming from three miles away just kinda materialize right\nRight I mean all the alternatives had to have a starting ... tornadoes or visible for for ... at a time even the storms out in the mid west they have to have a point of origin where you go for nothing to suddenly a tornado touching down it just so happened to be this one touched down and started over north Providence\nAnd then in the storm has moved north eastern for their uh one other difference in Port note is that those tornadoes that we often find in the mid west often grow to become much larger and more ferocious\nOf the three four five variety too early to determine the magnitude and strength of this particular tornado but I Would survive that it's probably smaller and somewhat less intense little ones we typically see in Oklahoma and Kansas\nOkay so I've got I've just less questions I'm looking at the map and she that the Brockton taunting area has this pretty pretty significant of red mark over in Fall River number ... ... ... it just seems storm and I also see in western mass moving through central mess now having moved from Springfield into into\nA Stanford springs up through Worcester and builds your town Amherst to me is that is that moving toward us through the break up\nThat's another line of showers but none of that has been severe fact there's been very little thunder lightning just rained briefly heavy mind you with a burst of wind but absolutely no spin or a tornado or traumatic activity and um basically just a line of showers most of that is going to go north of Providence southern payload that\nClip the area with a brief period right here over the next hour or so but it would be a relatively temporary and probably just a quick ... shower\nWell I'll tell you this just broke up fast though didn't it I mean just this whole adult barrel ... area looked like he was on fire ... minutes ago and now it's just I'm Talking about the map and now it's all busted up\nIt is it really is um it it developed quickly wasn't too long ago where we just saw innocent looking showers and suddenly a a severe thunder storms spawn up\nA lot of hail too by the way reports that\nToo that would make sense because the air aloft a club I was very cold as we typically find in the fall and in the spring it doesn't take much for there to be hail oftentimes that shows up his enhanced enhancement brighter colors the oranges and the rides on the radar which in the middle of summer is indication of a downpour but this time of year is a\nGood indicator of hail because

was a there was a movement of firefighters from Coventry to east Greenwich over the last few years\nYes or these memorandums of agreement tied to that migration yes in what way\nSo several of them are directly tied or so in terms of what you're paying a once a migration happens\nOn firefighters came from Coventry five okay okay\nSo um and remember it say it's a department of thirty six so five is ah it's over ten percent and a significant number a so\nI see him away here this is effective July first twenty fourteen through June ... thirty twenty sixteen both parties mutually agree not to feel to vacant firefighter positions for these ... years both parties agree to leave these positions speaking for two years\nAnd the agreement could be extended those between ... manager of the union president so significant to this migration absolutely for what reason\nBecause at the time where when I Am OU was agreed upon by the town manager and the union there existed a hiring list\nSo there are people in the hiring list that were ready to go ready to be firefighters but obviously if you hire them then they face to face that wouldn't be any vacancies to be able to hire a the Coventry Niagara Falls\nFor two would have had a five people from Coventry end up a migrating these ...\nShe was at the time I started with too but then there were additional vacancies so the migration happened actually into waves there was a wave of four and then a wave of two\nAnd the counsel was on aware that the memorandum agreement or understanding didn't exist that that it existed\nThey were unaware and actually even worse or by the charter all fire and police have to be appointed by the town council town council didn't was not even aware and was not made aware and and did not even a point this migration these firefighters from\nCoventry so every higher and police and fire has got to go through a blessing of the town council individually\nYes and none of that happening here for these for the other ...\nSmall town how the how has a Coventry firefighter ended up on the east granted should engine and government people are unwilling to it I don't understand that\nWise people in the legal business in municipal government know what you have said is true that is that if you have a memory in agreement that by charter a needs to be ratified by a city councilor town council and it's not it doesn't exist\nUh however you've had these remembering agreements that have existed have actually affected the bottom line of taxpayers and modus operandi now that you've identified them and as soon as you identify them they're really non existent they still have caused protocols and spending habits\nThat need to be addressed correct that's a fair way to summarize what's happening it's right there we also think are based on some expertise that's been offered here in the BP arrow in the last week that there could be many towns that have the same situation\nUh I don't know if it's a culture of disease or bad habits I don't know uh the taxpayers ought to be wary of it\nBefore we get to more of the moral of the story here and you've been very concise and I appreciate that you right now have an ethics violation that you are dealing with which creates drama around your yourself you've got a lot of headlines and you've been having to answer the ethics commission\nOr explain what what your understanding is of the of the current dilemma that you face\nI said that the one I have is actually not an ethics violation have probable cause\nThank you deserve it and that is very important to me that's my bed\nWhen somebody makes a complaint against somebody on an ethics basis the ethics commission will decide whether or not the case as any merit to investigate and if they do they say yes probable cause exist that we should investigate this then they determine whether or not there's been a violation so\nIt's been a complaint against you that has reached probable cause status at state ethics commission meaning they're going to vet it wrecked\nThat next step is a hearing to determine whether it was willful intentional that kind of thing and that's when I get my my ability to put on my case\nKick in but give me the mini version of the cage 'cause you seen very confident that there's no that intent or you're you're smart person you've you've been involved diminished will send in for a while you were very engaged above Flanders when he was turning around Central Falls under that the in fact I have this vision I don't know why I have this vision of ...\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in East Village and there were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving all the boards also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nFor a long time in various spots and you have a company correct yes and the company is under employed by carbon tree\nCurrently yes Coventry Centre county fire\nDistrict so you so you are on a on a consulting basis with your own employees\nThat are working the finances of that district correct to finance isn't a minister I should correct while you are now the town manager of east Greenwich ... obviously they busy entrepreneur absolutely um is that the basis of the of the problem what is the actual problem so that the\nConcept is disclosure did not disclose it properly and whom uh two ethics\nCommission or we there's an ethics filing\nSo that I listen I've been a district manager of central country fire district since two thousand and sixteen uh never withheld it from anybody I'm a job on prior to the town of east Greenwich yes it's a job and I obviously a it was known widely it's public\nUm it was all that kind of you can't really can't hide that kind of thing and not only that when I went to the to the when the council want it to appoint me\nOr we talked about my company and I said okay look ah I'm not going to take on any new clients here's my client and I'm going to finish out the contract the contract ends on not twelve thirty one on this year\nAnd um and that's not and they I disclosed it so again it's all about ah what what was known as it did I intentionally try to hide hide my my involvement with central concentrate absolutely not\nSuper Bowl the basis of the complaint who ... who who who issued the complaints\nUm so there are democratic ah people running for town council just two Democrats or one is a bill ... oh actually he's independent so I'm Still Higgins who's an independent and then we're new angle heart a who's a democratic\nCandidates for council issued a complaint against you the town mantra All right let me see if I can do a little bit of math here financial whiz bang comes into town starts taking a look at what's going on in town pretty well reputed for being able to ...\nAnd count pretty familiar with this will finance inlaws doing pretty good job in Coventry\nStarts the same kind of giggle Bernice granted by the way we are you employed as a consultant before you were the manager there yes okay so that morphed yes and\nThe Republican town council liked what you were doing and then fired you I remember reading some turbulence over the process of you being fired that there was some problem about that there was not light of day type of stuff commentary from you\nOr again I don't think they um they were just following the practice that had happened with the the former town town manager has it been resolved yes in fact uh I Believe that I was if I count myself I'd been appointed four times [laughter] so if a set of hiring\nProcess has been resolved really the only thing that lingers over you right now is the ethics complaint that has now going to get a hearing soon at the board\nI don't know when the hearing they haven't signed a caring date\nInteresting we have a November election coming up\nYou've got to people who are running for office who brought the complaints it may be enough gristle in the political meal to create some turbulence to perhaps unseat some Republicans on the town council does\nMaybe getting to a position to blow you out though is perhaps some of the documentation that you've surfaced may go by the wayside I don't know so you've been in a rush of you not to be able to get some of this documentation out\nSoon I mean listen time is of the essence always when you know financial things aren't going right but it seems to me the faster you get this information out publicly about what's been going on costs in the taxpayers money in your mind\nThe better their constituent nice Greenwich is to make a decision as to whether politics or play or protection of taxpayer money is a play\nSo the one thing that ... yes makes sense and one thing I Would add is a there has been mailings 'em by at least two Democratic candidates I'm like down again and Renee angle heart and uh the first thing on their mailing is get rid of the town manager\nShe knew the wicked witch of the west indies friends raff you've come in your the hot shot money making a person who's upset the apple cart but let me tell you something these memorandums agreement um if they don't have it\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood born in East Berlin a generic as that of the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nI don't care if you brought the information I broke the information or rubble still ... brought the information it's still information the taxpayers need to have and that's something that's really important let me ask you this did you did you\nWhen when um\nSo that's your that's your that's your ethics commission situation that will that will meet out over the course of time with the ethics commission puts it scheduled correct when they have the hearings you don't seem incredibly worried about that no not at all because there's a lot more drama headline and then you're smiling confidence\nReflects\nTheir its technical technical violation and it wasn't done willfully or intentionally and I'm looking forward to working with a look to to lawyers edited and they both missed it too\nMuch sort of show you're not you're not thinking you're going to jail and no time soon so now with the Memphis commission so um\nWhen when we're the ... when the town's lawyers advised\nUm\nThat these him always existed did you do it as soon as you knew they existed so to though that's something you would have responsibility to do I think\nSo um what I've done as my tenure or if I Do find things I bring them to the tension on the council so to the I'm always I found like a ... a year ago um these others and we were ... report it out on it and there have been many reports um and these others actually frankly\nWhen I found out about work I knew that we were finding other ones and I said oh I'm they've been busy doing other things obviously there's been a budget there's there are you running a child no money in town so can't be all about trying to root out every um side agreement that was ever made in this town [noise]\nSo what happened was I said okay I'm after the work incident I said I should I should really look at these and make sure uh and we were doing and I'm away last night with the laborers\nUh we ... we didn't andme away we we corrected some a historical problems with the laborers to make it a ... square absolutely and it's it's the right way to do and I'm a law\nBut my point is just the stuff that you were brought bothered by the ... report this stuff out yes\nOkay I'm here's a question then might throw you why are you here\nI Am here to shed light on what has happened in the town of east Greenwich\nLook you know I'm I'm town manager I'm not an elected official I'm I'm not running for office um I really don't have a political you know you're an agnostic kinda agnostic when it comes to a live and work", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dan Yorke",
