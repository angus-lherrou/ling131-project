I Know a guy can get you a favor and the I Know a guy can hurt and for his well our center was involved in to regulatory issues one should be so easy we're trying to\nSave natural hair breeders I you know natural hair all he does twist here no tools do scissors nothing sharp no chemicals or does twist here it's a nice little pack patterns\nIn order to do that and make a living at it you have to go through thousands of hours of training\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if you are for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log on to what Tom\nIs an art form that that largely comes from Cape Verde there's a lot of people in Rhode Island who do that and they're not allowed to earn a living doing that unless they go through these ridiculous and unnecessary mandates house somehow that these these laws go put it in every state but systematically state by state\nUh people are seeing the the silliness of such laws for this very simple safe uh it's really an art for more than anything else and and their repealing them and you think when you think we could get them repealed in Rhode Island but no\nBecause there's a local group I won't mention names with as a local group of hairdressers who don't want any competition in their market\nEven though they don't do natural hair braiding themselves they don't want anybody else in their mental wanting noses under their tent and they hired a lobbyist and they donate to the Senate president I won't mention his name but they donate to the Senate president\nAnd the Senate president says that's good enough for me no matter what the arguments are for this no matter how many people want it my I Know a guy constituent doesn't want it so it's not going to happen\nAnd for three years in a row or this legislation has been blocked by one person because uh one special interest I Know a guy person they have we end this and this is a list is legislation that would help low income and minority families more than any one of these these are women who can\nWho can do this and make a little money on the side a legally [laughter] you know as they raise their children if the if you know part time fulltime whatever it is a lot of them do it\nDo it for their family but they're not allowed to make money or or be illegal you know so they just do it as a favor you know twist your my daughter's here my sisters here or something like that but do you think we can get a law passed to make it legal to do something simple like that no because the I Know a guy attitude in Rhode Island another reason people may leave our state\nThere's another issue out there and it's called civil asset forfeiture low walking but but think about this\nIf if if you are thought to have committed some kind of crime or even some kind of technical regulatory violation\nThe government can seize your property\nAnd even if you're innocent and cleared of wrongdoing you often can't get it back\nI think about that property rights or the foundation of any democracy\nAnd this is a direct assault on property rights so similar to the hair breeder\nRidiculous licensing laws many states are starting to get a little smarter with their civilized and they're trying to restrict and and have governments are the less capable or able or to to seize property and not give it back\nAnd again you would think it would be passed and we we have everybody almost everybody not quite as unanimous but I Would say of vast majority of people yeah that's a good law we got to change we've got to change us but no\nOther police unions profit from this\nBy the police staffs because they're the ones largely who who are on the front lines and\nSeize property a lot of it you know seizure is is a legitimate tool right I mean if somebody is involved in a a crime like let's say a drug crime for instance in their car is used or they have cash from that from that illegal sale yeah of course you should seize it but if somebody's innocent they should be able to\nGet it back right or if somebody is is a but we showed a video of how fisherman who may have who may have violated some crazy little permit or regulatory maybe I didn't duck call in the right code when I came in the dock my boat or or whatever they have in their thousands of dollars of their\nCatch seized six thousand dollar Seventy five hundred dollars twenty eight thousand dollars we document on our video\nAnd all he did was commit some minor violation and guess what the D. E. M. in this case this part of the government takes the catch that cash it in\nBecause you can't keep catch it goes bad right so you've got to sell it they sell it they keep the money and then even if the boat owner is cleared often times they can't even get their money back\nAnd again you would think that such reforms would be reasonable but no not in our state because the police unions don't want it to speaker though says well then we're not going to do it\nOne person\nThis has got to change in our state this was this this kind of is why we need to I Believe we need a constitutional convention change some of the powers\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln MTC Lincoln Lincoln MTC and the only twenty eight ... Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of never against it on parallel Marjorie impeccable\nCitizen pro growth pro family pro business reforms that it shouldn't\nBe that way in our state and and there and while we suffer high taxes and while we suffer high regulations\nWhat really drives a lot of people out of state that I've talked to it's it's this kind of attitude is like how can we live in such a state or stuff like this happen you know it's just it's just not worth it so are we going to go to the to the phones\nBecause he and he he didn't like the buddy CNC whole whole idea I Need a little controversy but he's a guy who who is an amazing amazing man he's a psychiatrist by trade he's involved in so many professional organizations\nUm social professor at Brown university's worked at butler hospital I mean he's worked at every everything you could imagine the psych higher because she could do all that with all the boards and commissions he's lead in shared he's he's a amazing supporter of the Catholic Church\nIn fact in two thousand eight he was nominated by Pope Benedict the equestrian order of the holy ...\nBy Pope Benedict I'm\nNot one of the funny things we'd call about that you know if that gives them the right to do when you're in the equestrian order you have the right to ride your horse into church\n\nI don't think he's ever tried that and when he told his pastor about that is pastor told them if you want to try to find a new parish\n... but that's you know so these are H obviously these are ancient orders right\nBut he was made it into the equestrian order of the holy supporter and that's that's pretty cool big story and he he's a member of the Rhode Island is just as Dr Daniel hair a member of the Rhode Island Historical Society sons of the American revolution sons of the union veterans of the civil war\nAnd he now lives on the very spot where the battle of Rhode Island took place in Portsmouth\nDuring the revolutionary war and he's he's making it his goal to raise awareness about that battle throughout our state so we wish him luck with that you started his political career back in Nineteen eighty when he co chaired Rhode Island physicians for Ronald Reagan\nAnd he was a plaintiffs just a few years ago that defeated as unconstitutional a state law that capped individual contributions in any given year after the Citizens United case basis hey you know\nPolitical donations are former free speech it we can't kept that stuff Rhode Island had a cat that you can only put so much and he challenge it he purposely went one dollar over it they they try to challenge him they took it to court and they won\nSo and then he's he's sponsored and funded or a hair up theater bishop ... high school but most importantly of course he was a founding chairman one or the initial major donors are the rallies and freedom and prosperity\nAnd he's a dear friend of mine we've had many great breakfast together at the wheel and square diners doing our strategic ring and how we're going to grow our center\nOr without Daniel hair up there would not be a road island Center for freedom and prosperity so I'd like you to join me in congratulating him as our two thousand Eighteen Jay William mid north pillar of freedom award Henri Dr Daniel ...\n[noise] um [noise] very cool very cool [noise] um\nWe we then went on to talk a little bit about how the ...\nOf progressive ism has morphed or has progressed if you want to use that term it was once the you know I\nI think I said earlier in the show I think this far left out or to whatever we want to call it is a mix of Marxism plus political correctness it's driven by political correctness\nAnd it was one thing one political correctness was something we've talked about at the water cooler or or at our family dinner table or maybe somebody brought up you know decades ago oh we want to change\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if you are for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nPutting now is political correctness is actually becoming the foundation of our government we know how government and legislation that is based on political correctness and this is what the progressive left has become and and it's very ephemeral I mean it's fad driven you know one day it's this the next day it's that\nIt's like let's take opinions rather than facts exactly\nI mean just just look what happened you know well let me tell you a few examples of it so in Rhode Island this all kind of started one of the first issues are centered got involved with was this this whole sustainable living theory and there was this big monster of a of a regulatory program called roadmap Rhode Island or if you remember that we made a hell of a\nStink about that years ago but roadmap Rhode Island was politically correct 'cause it advances green vision for our future\nAnd but what happened is our property rights were were infringed upon and are still being infringed upon I gave some other examples so if I may even in some of these are pretty scary if you think about it\nSo we talked about this earlier when we when we apiece political correctness by mandating quote equitable workplace outcomes instead of defending the free enterprise system and the freedom of employers to run their businesses the way they want\nWe create an even more hostile business environment you know where fewer job creators all want to choose to conduct or grow their businesses and then our economic liberty is threatened when we apiece and this one this one is very controversial but I got to say it that's what I Do\n... piece political correctness at our schools are encouraging gender just for accused to alter their natural essence and we encourage that and put them on that path even sometimes what out their family's knowledge\nInstead of defending the sanctity of God\nCreated life we place our children at great risk of physical and emotional harm\nAnd we infringe on parental rights this is a fad\nWhen bureaucrats you may have heard this story\nWhen beer or cat a Catholic college and appeasing a politically correct social issue instead of defending their students First Amendment rights one Catholic student who advance actual Catholic teaching\nAddict Catholic college who was later threatened with rape and murder for being non politically correct by other students not only did university nothing about it they kicked him off the campus\nAnd they got a restraining order from the Providence police against him\nSo I you're only a victim NPR on their side that's right [laughter] I don't know how to end the ... and when the media wrong report it they would\nReport that case are religious freedoms are put in jeopardy and the most recent one of course when we appease the latest politically correct theory of believe the accuser above all else\nInstead of defending the tried and true practice of due process and presumed innocent\nAnd the media instead portrayed those who believe in due process as the wrong headed ones our nation's entire judicial system in our whole moral compass just turned upside down\nAnd our judicial rights are put at risk progressive policies regress of policy Stalin his policies still tell a Terry and policies are divisive by nature\nThink about it 'cause everything Grover Norquist spoke last year you know if you if you were to buying conservatives one non political or walking for what would it be it would be just leave us alone\nI don't want anything from you live in Atlanta right I don't expect anything from you know just just let me live my life I mean run my company let me\nLet me go to the job and you make sure where else have been doing yeah one\nThat I had bother yours either you do whatever you want let me do what I Want you know as long as we do harm each other or infringe on our our right but ... um the far left works the complete\nOpposite to say hey what are you doing let me ask you that I have\nSomething from person a in order to give it from person to person be\nFor this politically correct or social equity purpose\nAnd at the whole left his agenda is that's why it's divisive by nature because I Need to take something from you in order to give it to them or I Need to deny you your rights are presumed is his sense because I Need to believe this politically correct person from that politically correct group\nIt's divisive by nature and its\nLooking for a guard credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in each bring a generic ended up the best

preserve these God given individual rights instead\nPolitical correct government progressive government\nConstantly infringes on our rights\nAnd this is why I think we have such problems that we have in this country why we have the instability I mean these this this was pretty core stuff right this is an old should we tax you five percent or six or seven this was the question of just like a new

interesting which is more than we can say about our own room [laughter]\nReally sleepy I mean it was sleeping through the primary it I got to stay there hasn't really been lots to talk about there so we look south and what are we find would find a great story as we usually do\nOr if you know most people would would say well first of all we just had TMZ I just spoke with Alan Gordon who's running from uh he's running for writing from running for attorney general with the compassion party all those things might be true I\nWrite ready for running from me because he is he's facing some serious charges as well so we've got that TMZ headline and we've got the Boston Globe much more reputable I Would say are talking about the governor's race but the voice said that folks heard an Armstrong is also running for governor she too was with that compassion party and she's also been\nArrested without having forty pounds of marijuana so that's in your piece\nBut he also learned how to get to see them a lot of money on ... so he switched to this your story has a happy ending after all\nWater everywhere dad a pipe broke my heart that we need a plumber I'm fat road runner this planning meeting somebody to clean up this water can run a return does water clean up\nThe phone and all this water I'm calling a bunch of people I told you wrote a return phone one eight hundred ... wait Rona rudest

they're joining us right now in Lebanon wait sometimes people dip in at certain times speaking with speaker Matty Alou about his race\nAnd all things ah Rhode Island but we're also keeping an eye on this breaking news which is devices that were intercepted being sent to the Clintons Obama's and the CNN offices in New York I just want people to hear that we'll\nContinue our lives team coverage of that so that being said how did you feel about that one debate that was the only one right between you and Steven fries\nYeah yeah and I'm Glad\nI did I felt really good about it uh we we you know I received a lot of very positive feedback though it was a was\nOne more event that\nShut off on our way to November ... than a I I'll be honest with you I'm really looking forward to the election being over why is that\nIt's very time consuming I've uh I've got to get back to my world than uh\nUh spend more time earning a living from my ... my family uh but right now I'm devoting a lot of pain I'm doing a lot of not being a meeting a lot of people and it's all it's all great and I love doing it but it's very calming\nAnd Nick ... is just for the first time you put on it I I think for the first time a video I'm\nAn ad now an you know an advertisement saying you know talking to different Cranston residents and they are saying what you have done for them in the city of Cranston and you know they there's your supporters obviously that's your first advertisement or\nWhat we've done a lot of uh besides male ailing right yeah we've done a lot of mailers but yeah\nRight I leave my first video at a book but we've we've been we've been on online and on the Internet and are getting our message out there\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the only twenty eight gene Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of never against such on parallel Marjorie\nMany different media sources\nYeah and it is it is different now because you've got the Internet and you don't have to spend you know too many dollars and putting an ad like that together I suppose that's a that's a good thing because you've got a lot of flyers out there I've been hearing and seeing\nYeah we're we're trying to and I you know sometimes but I ah regret the number and you're a you know I uh sometimes want to apologize for the amount of liquid and go with trying to do a a male a PR issue\nAnd when I go over my record this so much positive stuff that the that I've done or have been part of that or it just it takes a lot of a\nUm a lot of mail is to get it out there we try to do one message ... or\nUnderstood what was the last one that you could think are what are some of the ones that that are that are out there and do you want to talk about the car tax and I do too because we had some callers\nUh over the last week or so a challenging certain um finances regarding you know how you'd be able to afford the car tax phase out my job as far as the mailers are concerned because yeah I'm sure grandson's getting loaded up and is that because you feel that this isn't going to be yet again another tight race with Steven ...\nUm ... who will see on November six but honestly sour and you know for elected officials or people running for office always put their spin on it um I don't I don't do that I'm\nA feeling my feeling knocking on doors for community leaders in the neighborhood just talking to constituents and getting the feeling on the race or the response and reception I'm getting up the door\nA totally different environment than it was a two two years ago how generally speak\nTwo years ago it was an anti establishment year a folk ... I'm a little bit angry or it was a very um\nIt it was a it was a change year and I I've been doing this for a while sometimes get a sense that people just want a change for no no particular reason not personal is that's just the mode of ... ah this year it's\nA hundred eighty degrees different people are very happy are right now with the direction we're going in and I believe it's connected to the economy we we have a an unemployment rate that re point nine percent right now we're more jobs than we've ever had in our state history\nAnd uh that's ... that's\nBeing reflected at the doors at very positively people recognize that you have to pay for taxes we are on the emphasis we've put on jobs in the economy and and\nImproving the quality of life and economic conditions of our family and I are us citizens and it's it's resonating people I think understand and want us to keep moving in the same direction so it's just a very very very different environment\nNow um we mentioned your mail is ... there is also mailers out there obviously against you and there's a couple of women's groups I Believe in and spend a chunk of change ah going after you Nick ... yellow saying you know they should be a place where they're anti gun violence much I don't know who get foreign gun violence right so that that's kind of\nAn issue right there but um they want to they want to challenge you will for pay equity legislation and some social issues\nAnd yeah you should be beefing up the anti sexual harassment laws et cetera et cetera and this is all part of the hash tag me too movement or that they see that they are associated with how are you I'm dealing with that the the anti mailers against you need medical\nUm I I tend to ignore them or I I think the public understands them for what they are I mean if you look at the pay what you just\nEat most people that looked at the original bill wreck nice how anti business there was and how how much cost there was going to put on business through a frivolous law suits the Providence Journal wrote to us gazing negative editorial regarding the bill\nWe changed it made it more moderate um\nAddress the needs of women and pay equity but we're ... got off the fringes and and the anti business aspect of it\nUm the Providence Journal lights out version of the bill because they recognize the balancing that we've been trying to do when\nThe emphasis we put on the economy and creating jobs um well if if you're a fringe group and a you're a special interest you're into your special interest group that's only ... interested in one\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the only twenty eight ... Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of never again on parallel Marjorie\nWhat our approaches balance it's bits of all I mean are we past the great pay equity bill and I'm\nYou know or are we protecting women are taking firearms away from a domestic abuses and people convicted of crimes and\nI'm a providing all kinds of legislation or insurance coverage for mess deck to me so we we are not require insurance companies to allow one years of prescriptions for for birth control a\nGreater um child care services so\nAh as nice come up we've really been addressing them in a very very positive way but uh you have to stay away from the fringes and things that are in fact business you can't say you're for jobs and you know for the economy\nAnd then do things that hurt the business is now on on those group\nThey masquerade themselves with ... and you know with certain titles but at the end of the day that it just\nAnti Second Amendment groups and ah they run the fringes that those those folks actually want to take everybody's guns away from them and we have a balance viewpoint we protect people from dangerous people but we also respect the second amendment\nI think many limits on the line you said in the debate was channel twelve that you think the governor's doing a great job we've lost a few things we're losing Nordstrom at the prominence play small I Know some people want a pin that on the mayor there ... we've lost the plot socks you had a you know the situation there\nWe are stagnant you know forty six place if you listen to certain indexes um how do you rectify that saying that Governor a Monday was doing a great job and we should just keep going and we were going\nWell if you look at the index is most of the index is we're improving greatly I mean one one ah one of the index is that I like to talk about the Tax Foundation in Washington D. C. or just gave my cell ... an award for who\nOr tax policy in the state of Rhode Island\nUm in in the four and a half years that I've been speaker we moved up from a forty seven thirty seven forty sevens most burdensome stayed out of fifty thirty seven now my opponent during the debate that that that's not great well I I Would agree that thirty seven it's not great\nList in ... what I'm going to say as first I was twelve year old a second of all yes there was an incident\nBut a joke trouble and I have long since reconciled become friends side I've\nHelped them do things in his yard after the incident uh he's he's a good friend of mine and I have your most respect for him he was a great colleague in the house of representatives a key kids about people and that's that's the only thing I'm going to talk about relatives that joke shrill oh he's a good guy\nAnd this is the happiest\nIt's I think it's about forty years ago and he's really intelligent smart guy who was always given back to his community I that I Can't think of anything else but I Want to say about um other than that\nWell my I have to ask you the primaries least said your rotten kid\nA well at first it was Cranston but ... grandson\nNow but that's that's absolutely not true I was very active I mean go were those days when you leave your house and um go and hang around with your friends in the neighborhood and and pick up sport the games and so forth so\nUh we we had a lot of fun and we were active but uh no I I I I was an average kid I Would say\nI hate it I'm going to tell you to go back in Nineteen Seventy five but I had to ask you haven't talked to said this is kids being kids Joe ... blowing his top and everything was fine after that is that how you see it\nEverything was fine our families got along I I I have nothing but effect in respect to ...\nI personally believe we should not be talking about that and that's why I I just don't talk about it I said there was an incident but he's a great guy everybody's moved on from that I have no idea why this political discussion about it\nRight fair enough it came up in you know people were digging for police reports and now it is what it is oh I appreciate your time the ... the speaker of the house and we'll ... we can hear exactly but the context it's not that was important to solidify their take on that note\nBlood Lincoln is southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln him can you actually get MTV and the only twenty eight ...
