[noise]\nIt's not in a great place right now\nUm I Hope that if the house goes Democrat\nWhich is I think the likeliest change that the now opposing forces so that it's not a monopoly on power in

the most sincere way it can be done which is what parties who actually have power trying to negotiate\nWith one another it's an interesting take that the conflict that might we might expect to occur between a Democratic House Republican Senate you think would lend more compromise [noise]\nUh I think the first reaction most people pay attention to sit next to the world and the politics and today

consequences because where you put the money when you find the government is a really big deal\nIn terms of policy\nAnd by and large that has happened without incident\nBy a large Republicans and

boxed in and closed out\nAs a final deal and in the Senate um but to have gone through three of the it's what might be uptick political fights\nWhere they're huge substantive policy stakes involved and have there'd be virtually no news about it because it has\nNot created conflict we just passed the show that's the heart of\nThe conversation was shot in the White House tonight if you want to if

was fixed on another part of it so he didn't necessarily pick it up and that happens to me all the time too I mean it's just please don't don't see this as a criticism of mad at all he kind of missed this um\nBut you know when you're in the chair and you're thinking couples everything's in somebody's talking about three or four different things sometimes things ... things go buy it because you're focused on some of the aspect of the conversation I'm guessing that's what happened here\nBut I told ... is our crossovers recall the top of the show that I was going to I was going to play this uh this voice sounds familiar sounds like a friendly guy a may call it to the show from time to time\nBut I uh I had a crack up listen listen to what he asserts listened to what he would like to see happen for election regulations and see if the whole thing makes any sense to you\nKnow if I'm undecided it means I'm stuck in the middle so I Can't decide if I go left or right oh I think I'll stay in the middle one vote for your trailer but what what what I'm really\nExcited about that ... ah what the right now we should ban the low information voter from voting ...\nSo you would want like a test [laughter]\nYeah yeah right now that wouldn't be about I don't know if if people really pay attention to the debate\nJoan ... basically trying to say and the same way a plumber would be able to come to your house and say look you don't need a new boiler ... could be it could be fixed right I Know the common sense approaches to not wasting taxpayer dollars\nBut anyway so he goes on\n\nIf you're paying attention you know that the lesson right middle thing left being liberal right being conservative the Joe ... is the most conservative candidate in this race\n\nIs kind of a branding confusion that the Democrats on the left and the Republicans on the right\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at flood forward in eighth grade and joined Narragansett\nAgain is not necessarily on the right or\nYou know rhino Republican in name only has long been a phrase an acronym that has been assigned to this Republican political culture in the phone booth here in Rhode Island for you know long time but you know Joe left the Republican Party Joe ... is on the rights\nHe is not in the middle because he's an independent doesn't mean he's in the middle he's on the right if you lay out the platforms [noise]\nSo I mean it's a fairly um those are very honest mistake and I understand I heard the back and he's talking about you know practical solutions\nYou know he's the plumber or as you say in Rhode Island he's diploma\nBut he doubled down on the idiot ... at the booth so he wants only the informed voter now look that's a page out of my hand book I Am about I Am about quality

was funny when this guy who's like I'm going to be in the middle and he's got it wrong and now he wants to make a speech about the informed voter\nJust a letter moment for three eight zero toll free one eight hundred three two one Wu pero um so if you want to discuss any of the gubernatorial candidates on the spectrum and where do you think they are you are more than welcome to do so of course\nAnd if you have a thought about only the informed voter\nIt'll ought to vote that's an age old conversation of course you know Matty responded to take a test\nWhich of course is a natural response and holy unconstitutional that's not going to happen that's that's not going to happen\nI Wonder I Wonder with this reported surgeon interest in the mid term elections\nWhether I'm Rhode Island will be participatory in that that's something that actually have wondered about I don't think so\nI don't think so even with the governor's race I Do not think\nThat we are going to see\nA historical mid\nTerm voter surge\nI Do not think that the governor candidates have created\nTo kind of passion uh\nClearly they've kicked the crap out of each other and clearly the second and third\nA

Brady fourteen to end his career in Buffalo to losses up there and one was in two thousand and three thirty one nothing that was right after lawyer my lawyer was caught and went to the bill\nAnd then there's twenty eleven thirty four thirty one when Ryan Fitzpatrick was working as fits magic and Ryan ... it'll last second field goal to beat the patriots thirty four thirty one twenty eleven Brady fourteen to do in Buffalo and really Chris I have no reason I think it'll be any different time\nNo you don't I mean you look at Buffalo's defense it's a good defense but\nThey're often hasn't really help them out or twelve interceptions buffalo has their own this year that was the most in the NFL going into yesterday\nA gym as Winston help push the buccaneers past the bills but they're just completely inept offensively and really the story here in Buffalo is the story it's been since Jim Kelly retired you know they're looking for a quarterback they obviously had that little period of time with Doug looting and Rob Johnson but\nThis is an organization that still trying to find a franchise quarterback they hope that they drafted one\nAnd Josh Allen back at the draft but he's hurting now with an elbow injury and Derek Anderson is going to be the guy tonight so without a quarterback in this league and without a ton of all kinds of weapons it's really an uphill battle for the bill was against the\nPatriots six one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight by the phone number we welcome your phone calls in a toxic patriots before we get ready for this game let's get to this report from Fox Sports yesterday Jay Glazer on the box pre game show talking about the trade deadline which is tomorrow in the NFL\nThere were some of the names I already know are on the tray block for young PR gr song a Clinton ... Thomas jak is Bruce urban Arab harms the forty niners that he's in there as well which surprises that's the one like Cooper that really got your ears are surprised you also\nKnowing on page rooms they are trying to go after a bona fides premium wide receiver offering up high draft choices for that's\nOkay that's I'm Jake laser who's usually very well informed he said yesterday before we knew of this news with a Josh Gordon today facing discipline\nNow you're sort of put these two things together do we think that one was sort of impacting the other day looking for another receiver because they don't trust Josh Gordon to stay involved or you know I don't know be relied upon whatever it might be\nThe by the report and do you think of relates to this news on board\nI Do buy the report ah I'm not sure it's it's completely or entirely related to the situation with Gordon it wouldn't make some sense in terms of Maine related to Gordon just because we said from the jump I mean really the risk here is not that the guy's not talented enough at that you know you think you have the problem solved and then come December\nThere was some sort of issue whether it's a league discipline issue or team discipline issue but when you look at it long term for the patriots that position Chris Hogan is a free agent you know Jeff Gordon's one drug test away from being out of the league doing adamant coming up an ACL and is getting up there\nIn age so when you look at it if you could go out and find a premium receiver someone you could lock down for the next couple of years and would make some sense\nI buy it and I love it Chris I absolutely love it and I'm sort of surprised by it\nSurprised by it because I figured that the Josh board and trade with sort of take them out of this position where they're still trying to add to the team that position and I'm happy that they haven't given up doing that they're still doing that I Believe Jake lasers report and\nI think it's a good sign I don't know if that means that something's going to get done by tomorrow though but but I Do like that they are looking to add more apt to position now we don't know exactly what type or receive or they're looking at\nBut I think it's a good thing that's how I look at it I also wonder if\nAs they approached this deadline they have sort of abandoned the idea that their defense is going to get significantly better with anything\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to forge twenty eight teams for that one fifty obsessed run for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars from us only a flood forward and he's running short and they were against it\nHe sort of draft capital even if it's at the back of the draft for somebody that you look at and say this person is really just a marginal upgrade\nOr you more willing to give up graphs capital at the top for somebody who could help you\nBe an upgrade not only this year but moving forward what's interesting is you know Jay Glazer didn't attach any names there and so that leaves us disorder to speculate it's like oh you're talking about oh do back um junior with the giants and in that situation is gone south a little bit after he got the contract would that be somebody the patriots would entertain you know we know who you're Jones was unhappy\nWith the falcons before the season and then they tweak this contract a little bit but it still seems like\nThey're on a collision course there and he has no touchdowns touchdowns perceptions this year would that be right a guy what qualifies as premium because if it's you know if it's some areas Thomas or you're a guy and then I I think you know blazers over selling those guys are not\nYou know impact receivers premium receivers so if but if we're talking about somebody like that\nLike in a while back um junior like a Julio Jones I'll even drop it down a notch and just say somebody like a manual Sanders to me is a big time receiver who could help them this year and moving\nForward so they're sort of a wide swath of possibilities there I Would like a little bit more detail on exactly what type of receiver the patriots are looking for and what type of receiver they think they can get\nI Would say this to win it later in that report and you know we're not going to play the whole thing but later in that report Jake laser did mention that the giants had received calls ... back and junior he did not say from which teams\nBut he did say that the giants had received calls and I don't know if that's just sort of his way of reporting it as the patriots were one of those teams that did call and he doesn't want to go to that length and or or that information is not\nA on the record information that he received but he did name or the outback and junior saying that the giants were were sort of pumping the breaks that they weren't really willing to engage in those conversations on that particular player let me throw a couple of more than ... including this report actually already here right now it's from a\nTown tell us arrow he's got at least some names that\nAre out there including one in Detroit that is on the block\nHere's a name to keep in mind not from a team that's a seller but one that has been getting calls look out for Lyons wide receiver golden hey I can tell you that the lion's hadn't been fielding calls his teams have reached out about ... at this point in my understanding is it's not likely take gets moved unless\nThey get blown away with an off slow to take for the lines to being blown away tastes Thirty years old still highly productive but he's in a contractor you're talking about an eight nine game rental thing something
