scale a tooling ... scheme or coming to fruition\nUm and that's the kind of a ... the original was a congestion pricing types arrangements for cars and trucks or ... or a deal which is likely to winning he came out with a plan for truck only tooling and what what was more disturbing was new truck only tools are going to go to\nExpand rail so that's another another issue is not going going into a hose average is doing a rail\nIs not going to end the roads and bridges\nSome of it is but you know all of a show you know\nSome of it some of it you know that sort of thing by going to creep then you know I think the incremental live from ... well just do trucks and you know we'll just do Ninety five and eighty four but all this other routes and stuff will slowly increment of course it's it's a you know they\nThey've got to find ways to us you know stick away that money and all sorts of squirrel holes and there I mean you guys are hikers\nOh come on really I mean you know we're kind of labor to Connecticut spin a week I Will be here Laura and how it's really a nice day how you're going to ask you this box I going to ask questions\nSo who is it more this company is going to destroy the state now I'm getting some big job at a university right teaching yes I Am right\nNow oh sure and then somebody else to\nSomebody else a million two million dollars while he's again he was he was one of the ones leftover he was supposed to go to Washington with Gina\nOh what is the ... all the time they all have promises maybe we could write to hang on you know\nWe've got one millionaire running against another millionaire granted millionaires versus Madison on the coast millionaires than the rest of us would just like what you know you know that sort of thing on the line to slash and burn the state and stuff so you guys might pick up some you know some people desperate enough to be leaving this day to go over there increase your pocket\nLike one of the question is one of the question was when you went down to the governor of Connecticut from what I understand you get like six million dollars really yeah we have\nYou ever have a program where you know you can only raise an anchor Lance of a\nA like a hundred dollars a matching program so it does keep out some of the big you know money guys not sort of stuff the lobbyist and stuff can contribute you know if you if you're into those kinds of programs and everything like that but these guys blew that out of the water though they're not then it neither one of them is taking that\nTheir self made millionaire they've got hedge fund money there and they're they've got all sorts of stuff you know money for out of state you guys got along this but we've got an awful lot of people who like yeah new I'm not running you know not having opponents that sort of thing are very you know ... people that\nYou know have like raised five dollars and that's about it so it's you know it it's really sad I I don't think we're going to have a I'll just end with this I don't think we're going to have a civil war\nBut we got to have you know even if you support Trump you know and you question you know the woman and her and you know and everything like that you don't have to go down to a rally and make her out is a liar just do your own business\nSay you know come on get out and vote and all that sort of stuff you don't have to be you might call in or out of a lie or it's just you know we're probably gonna party is losing people left or right the Democratic party you know losing you know most of the voters in Connecticut are unaffiliated marijuana either one you know anything to do with a you know here's a\nParty I think it's forty eighth out here in Rhode Island\nThat that's a status so that a lot of it is like saying you know I don't have a dog in this fight wild elaborate you know give me a ... ability to make a living\nDon't go crazy with taxes and stuff and you know self up by the way I'm a long time people may recognize my used to be on TALK radio called an eye on them stop for a long long you know I yes\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they

now\nYou know looking for documents that were contrary to the the agenda of the state house Chris in the past it was a he was a very ... shoot eventually get it but you get in a time and to choosing and you know you get you get a lemon boxes of documents a you know for a couple of pages of a\nHeavy ... picks through it in a you know middle finger two years so yeah I mean it's that's the should not be part of China should it should be equal time for began to whether you're an insider on your your your organization like us\nThat was very very much opposed to a to a ... a policy and we we got jerked around a little bit so you're that's a that's a great great maneuver for everybody\nSo yeah I mean you know people\nDon't have the money and and the time and and the effort to fight all those all those obstacles and we need to eliminate that's all\nYou know should they should be free to anybody I mean I see so I think it's a ... right to get access to documents if they require All right next day so a ... you began to education\nYou know ... you're trying to focus you know is is they're going to do what do you what what what do you propose again if you go to and what what what type of change is going to make what are you looking forward to doing here what what are you going to try to do\nWell I mean education as ... and a lot of people say but I've been at the pollen this at the door and I've been I've been telling everybody I meet when they asked me the same question just asked my education investment a future you know we're just across the state that do a very difficult job and they're doing it very well\nBut we you know at the state we need to invest in small class sizes and improve facilities I mean that's what it's about that like I don't I personally I Am going to support the ah the school facilities bond that you want to take the million dollar bond that on the\nUm that'll be on the ballot and unfortunately it it's more borrowing but I think the only way that we're going to the\nThe schools and and that was after that I mean I'm going to try to propose class size limits you know within the law starting at take root three I mean no kindergarten teachers should be expected to\nWorry about thirty kids running around the classroom and kids aren't going to learn that way and then we will slowly fees that into the high afraid but that that kind of my vision well or or education\nYou know it's a good reason to have him in a you know I don't have any kill kids you know Chris does but I I just can't believe you know um [noise] schools are still up when I went to a grammar school you know these uh fifty sixty year old school yeah I\nLike it when I went to another province has been torn down change while a liar so much\nThey have a life expectancy surely do and you know and I'm just surprised that the piss poor planning of that hey thirty five years or forty years into this thing we weren't allocating and and\nMoney to put a wire drill we faced with the toll bridges you know they let this this stuff go until it's too much credit\nYou know and it's too bad and I mean you know I'm the same thing like that at the same thing I guess for just a regular I'm Joe Joe Q. public but that doesn't take care of the house so that you're leaving the house has got to fall down all\nI I agree with I agree with that I you know I've got a challenger on something can we afford the bonding\nWell I I think I I don't think we have a choice at this point I I Do question I Hope that it will come with any new taxes because I don't think are the people in this state don't need any further actually we do we need to figure out how to cut corners\n... wild out but I don't that's my point because and let me interrupt you for second you ... you ... you are right looking for two fifty plus Seventy three twenty we've got schools here it at a quarter of a billion a and then whatever else just sitting out on the table I don't know if the state can handle this bonded than it is\nOh I I mean I I have to look at all the numbers Mike I'm not privy all all the\nBond issues and the balance I'd have to go back and look at some of the fiscal note but I Will tell you that that this is close to my heart with the education system because again our children they're not going to stick around here for road island job I we're not going to have individual\nI appreciate all that and I respect I ... and believe me I understand\nWe've got to become fiscally responsible in and one of the jobs of you getting up there is a rap is somebody's going to take the bull by the horns and say you know what nine point six billion dollars is a little out of control if little Rhode Island\nWill you know where we got back on services so we can provide to the students and and the and the departments that need the money you know you're right\nYou're absolutely correct and and I and I\nThink this is something that people will look\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne as over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nFor cash is not working to fill budget gaps uh we've had a windfall to share a sales tax because of the Internet stuff like that that money went to fill a gap of a hundred and twenty something nine twenty something million dollar budget that money itself writer that could have been allocated towards schools if we proportion the budget correctly that's why when I\nWas going to have to take a good look at it I could have you bought on it but yeah I get up there I you know there's nothing that I can even introduce off ... off work\nSo well I think I could get in I think you're a breath of fresh air for it because I hate to say this but you're not tainted in the mix of what's been going on up there for the last few years ... would have been involved with that and sometimes a good set of fresh eyes looking at a problem is always better than the old eyes looking over it and it gives you the fires through the trees you know I'll say\nThank you I'm Sorry and that's what I'm promoting myself as a new voice a grandson in a in a in a fresh look\nOh just don't get it right away by what kind of laughing about the white one final question\nBuddy why why should the people tell the people grants or why they should vote for you\nWell you know what to find that that we get it if we don't change things now than what a witness or the other two years in other ways we need to change it now as you just said I'm a new voice I Am a new change but you know\nThe person who's been sitting at my feet the last boy he is done anything for the people create a better future he's done nothing for the city of France and he's been nothing or the district sixteen and I want to change that I'm focused on good government education and I want to ... I Want to change how small businesses right to someone who wants to smoke so\nThat's a key point the small businesses are look like I said earlier this government can say what you\nWant this governor is not the smokers and in and you know what we we need to get advocates back up the Smith though\nThat small business could walk in and talk to people and explain to what the problems of what's going on and what we're all dealing with\nAnd and and hopefully you know there's enough fresh voices up there that uh you know what it can get some businessmen on committees or something like that in the end and open up the doors to a to a lot of open government in like government does this work together\nYou know that's it that's it and and and we have to the other thing is as Democrats too and and it goes on both sides will have to reach across the aisle that's going to be the biggest thing and you know we have to work together to the future Rhode Island we really do\nWell the Democrats like the Republicans have their own dissension amongst the way she could have a hard core progressive agenda not so much in your race but a lot of other races throughout the state uh they just trying to rape the crap out of every business they possibly get their hands on it's all give me or take take take\n'em and and I just hope that whoever gets in up there is is is is settled down and and the biggest thing up there Chris in my opinion is in a little word of advice vote your conscience\nWill I Will and I think that that vote your conscience don't you know what that that's I think that's the key to being up there you know had good men last time I voted their conscience got stripped off committees but you know what they're still stand just\nFeel like they will have no last last year I mean

P. R. O.\nAs well as predictable and as I predicted my family and mine names have been totally destroyed [noise] like vicious and false additional accusations\n\nThat is a judge Brett Kavanaugh all eyes on that\nCase and a vote today possibly tomorrow as well and I I have on the line Arlene Violet are former attorney general ... migrants you cover all forms of politics obviously with your column\nA and and and all of your insight in your analysis Eileen so I so appreciate your time\nYou've been following this I'm I'm assuming and I I yeah 'cause I Want to just ask you about the governor's race but also the cabin on whether or not he gets confirmed and how the vocals down first of all your ... your your initial thoughts on how the hearings went and all the it was an awful lot of emotion and drama and holes in stories um and his temperament what's your initial reaction\nWell the ... that entire hearing really showed me the crisis in democracy or that we have in the states of America\nI think the polarization is so adamant and people are so adamant that I really do here for the future and I know some people say oh well you know back in the days of Madison and a even a founding fathers the all of this all happened and that's true but\nIt's not as widespread as it is particularly among the average people who can't even talk to one another so before I even comment I cabinet let me just bring up a study that I just recently read a in a tower it stands for the proposition\nThat we tend to listen to a Kenyan\nThat only baptize our own viewpoint and here's the kicker we may be hard wired to do that\nMe a brain think out confirmation of where we are already stand right so I think it's critically important uh that uh and they said this to the young Republicans months ago even before I read this report when I had the great opportunity to speak with them that we got us away yet\nHow would you like motor trench twenty gene trucks will be here for only one I Will say hello to forge twenty four to one fifty selfish ruffled are best friends anywhere you one hundred Ninety nine dollars for only a board and he went into it\nAnd do they have anything to say in this debate right right so now we come to the cabinet or a hearing and there's absolutely no question that there is a clash of values that are going on here\nThe values of which are good so for example you're innocent until proven guilty or that's the mantra that's invoked a by folks that are already leaning\nToward a judge Kavanaugh\nOn the other side is the obviously cultural issue that many people are not marinated in and that is the culture of what happens with women who are sexually abused\nA regrettably I had too much experience with that as a prosecutor prosecuting these cases of sexual assault I've when I was in that office there were times I remembered visiting among family in Providence because without question\nThe daughter had been raped but it was a disgrace and the family would not allow her to testify on this brutal rape because it made the family look bad and they felt culturally it would\nMake her look bad ah so you have to understand all the permutations of culture classes as well\nWhich so quick to make a decision right uh yeah I Know I Believe her I Believe her we hadn't even heard from her yeah so it's so hard to you know I think it's tough to be a woman of course but it's tough to be a woman who wants to say listen I of course I Want to believe a victim any victim yeah but I Can't make a I Can't say I believe someone if I've never even met them or heard them\nMhm yeah well you know again I get that is a valid position\nThen the issue becomes then if that is what your basic position is is to look at but why not what's the opposite side of this particular issue so ... first of all one thing is for sure regardless of who's right and wrong and that is\nA democracy has taken a black guy with a question you know a here but the worst part of it is for me the inability to people with opposing views\nTo in good faith\nI come to a conclusion now and sometimes we're blinded you know ... what are the things I just recently talking with a friend yesterday and ah when I was running for office my opponent would bring out what was wrong with why shouldn't be attorney general now people will say that's political he's running against her\nWell yes of course his political but the other part of it is you gotta analyze or was he right or not\nWriting your opponent doesn't bring out what's wrong with you is going to bring\nYou wish you the moment yeah you know\nYou got to hold sometimes to ideas in your head [laughter] it's not an either or it's All right above right on time and and to me it was so discouraging watching all of this ah because everyone approached it by too often with an either or\nAnd I I stand for this American principle but they don't stand for this other man in principle and I just think we've just really got a a you know slowdown listen try to understand other people's points of view whether it's cabin or any of the issues that exist in our society today\nAre a real quickly Arlene pilot I Know some kind of a weird question do you think he gets through though I Do think\nSo uh it's obvious the way this is a uh being jockey you know into position a and the a limitation of the FBI scope et cetera it's a foregone conclusion will be close but I I'm not going to be surprised if he gets a selected to the Supreme Court\nAre always a wealth of information and opinion in in all things and I appreciate your time Arlene violent best to you and listen to take care thank you so am I\nNow have long hair was here's your exclusive country wasn't\nClear to partly cloudy scotch and I've done a

put in this specter general make sure that we are turning government back around for us the little guys and one island\nOr you know earlier in the conversation Alan ... you said you know endorsements don't matter if you mean just Patricia Morgan's endorsement because if somebody comes along and says hey I Want to support you you know we've got to get the Republicans back in the office of the governor you're not going to say hey that endorsement doesn't matter if it's somebody fabulous\nOh I'm asking for everyone\nSupport but here's a prime example Patricia Morgan also recruited has supported showing her lawn against the fries and that run a couple of years ago how did that work out for her\nLook what's gonna really matter as me getting out there in the neighborhoods talking

field director is a leading teams out there knocking on doors identifying voters we are going to do what we need to to get our message out and drive out the vote\nAnd or anyone else you know I spoke with Arlene violent a few moments ago a mere filing and she mentioned she she's willing to work with anyone she really wants to the office of inspector general but she said she's\nA concerned with you working with you she wanted she didn't have a conversation to walk through the two thousand fourteen I Believe a police report when the police came in and tried to figure out what's going on with your Cranston police department she said that was a warning sign\nWell but let me take a step back first\nYou know I support the position of inspector general I support the independence in that position but I unlike Mr trail unlike Patricia Morgan who cuts deals and says oh I'm going to put in this person I don't promised jobs you know and I like in a respected the work that attorney general you know former attorney general violated Don\nBut I'm not going to promise their job if she wants that position you know she's happy to apply and I'll consider her a just like any other a competent person that uh is going to have that degree independent\nAnd I've answered this before the real corruption that we've got to focus on a in this is this what's going on under ... ministry should you know just because Joe says one thing or all means says one thing you know all I Want the listeners knows we fix\nFix that police department first time in the city's history because the former number two of the state police morale is up there doing you know a good job and the voters overwhelmingly reelected me\nIt's a ... a understood it you know she's going to have to deal with you if you're going to have to deal with the police report and I think a lot of our listeners are saying Kim we just get to this election day hey when one positive message or you know because I Know there's been some name
