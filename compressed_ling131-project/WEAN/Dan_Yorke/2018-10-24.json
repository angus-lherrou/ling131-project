in the public relations that came out\nUh so it's likely that Joe has a mole in the funk campaign\nAnd keeps getting along to make it appear that does that Alan ... is a copy cat answer to that\nThat's a joke because I can give you cite like came out against being a sanctuary state Alan from came out against the factories the chemo for animal abuse\nI said I was going to get tough Woody Allen from for for for for I came out to put garbage cans of the state beaches when I was campaigning my with my boat Alan from now the last debate said he's gonna put garbage cans on the beach\nI came out with a plan to revamp the registry of motor vehicles including opening nights\nAnd having a reservation system our phone comes out with the same thing I've come up with the pension reform idea ends up in the commission and appointing it's ... it's though is one part of the ... it's a three part point\nWas to give it three percent coal everybody up to twenty thousand dollars on the

cold\nAll right so I'm putting that aside I just retweeted up a tweet by Ted and you see that I thought was was was pretty on it he wrote a decade after GOP governor Jerry was pushing Rhode Island gyms to deal with the unfunded pension liabilities the party positions on the issue have slipped\nIt's true it is ... and ... how do you keep a score card and it consistent mindset about basic concepts in principles of the state Republican Party when you two un fun are fighting over who can give more money back to those\nWho were you know part of the pension reveal wait\nA minute you're saying we're fighting I I've been good for this fight with you\nKnow when you're both much your list you're All right you're both committed to the concept\nI mean this is this where he's very where's the economic conservatism and this is what I'm asking\nThings that fungus committed to anything you're is absolutely it it's just it's like holding fault it's going to fall apart I he's not committed than anything the only committed to doing in saying everything he needs that they wouldn't say that he thinks the getaway it's the whole idea\nMy point is you a stalwart sixteen year elected Republican yeah are moving on an issue that doesn't fit any kind of economic conservatism\nI have never fall into any kind of a mole in my life I Am very very\nWhat is your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common there are all in for Steve we own condition I blood for Denise religion Narragansett thanks right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models had incredible

Republican issue I've always felt like I didn't just become that today and regarding the pension thing I have listened to all of these people over the last eight years since we passed the pension reform and I've watched Gina go out in squander the money\nSo he or she is she saved X amount of dollars and she heard all these people I'm Talking about people that were making pensions of Eighteen thousand dollars twenty thousand both didn't have those Social Security to count on for the they're getting no Cole was\nIn and what what happens is that it's going to force them\nInto some very serious poverty situations which they wouldn't have had to go in had that pension system not taking place now had taken place and we found out that there was no other alternative\nI eat like Gina Raimondo has has accumulated a three hundred million dollars more in the budget since two thousand Fifteen yet you squandered it all well why can't you go take care of some of these people it only costs twenty four million dollars per one percent of the pit\nAlright ... it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a passionate a speech that you making here but you have to recognize that this isn't you know this is counterintuitive\n'em to a how you voted back then and then be what we what we generally expects from the parties here it just is\nNo I'm not disagreeing with you're absolutely right but when we voted back then look at where I was here I Am a Republican city state representative incomes\nThis person that we thought was a whiz kid\nShe's got all these degrees and now she's the treasure and
