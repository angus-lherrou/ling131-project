United a bunch of others spent a lot of time and that courthouse in the federal government swung and missed and one twelve or Thirteen or the other than conspiracy which was the whole\nBall of wax uh I'm not suggesting that they they they trip up often in you know they sent him to the federal pen which was there which was their goal uh I\nBet you're you're right that with that but in my vast experience\nOf them with thing on twelve Thirteen was extremely rare and uh I mean I think our recent history here Rhode Island with the federal government and us attorney bring charges against\nGod

Ninety percent range the conviction rate for for for U.S attorneys when they bring corruption charges right\nExactly well uh\nLet me ask you this do you think that he's even got a problem defending himself against this case\nIn city hall [noise] I I was thinking you using the assets of city hall and the ... of his office to defend a charge which which he argues has nothing to do with his office\nAnd he is right it doesn't have anything to do with his office ah has to do with them allegedly swimming a lot of investors out of a lot of money and uh just committing Thirteen different charges of a crime but they don't appear to have anything to do\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition I bought bought and he's written a generic ... that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models had incredible prices log on to flood Otto John calm now\nProblem well he actually was in the cafeteria today that that's where he made his presentation and gathered everybody and and so it just seems to me to be I did anybody said well\nWait a second\nYou listen you've you've made an argument that this is a charge that you're ... you're suffering as an individual ... elected official the last thing you ought to be doing is defending it inside city hall the taxpayers building well\nObviously we ... we know this is a very young man what does he mid twenties twenty six\nYoungest mayor over for river ah ... the problem is he also comes across as very cool whip\nUh like it harkens back to rip John Connor volley those story and no story [laughter] and clearly there's a story you're just like there was there uh but yeah I mean I think a protest\nIs in charge of all though I I'm I'm saying you used to use the public's assets uh you know for your own\nIt may feel like miscellaneous whatever to to a prosecutor but it seems to me that that's I mean listen you can't do this certain political things you cannot do with the public as as I'm certain that you also can't use the public access for your own personal defense\nI Would think that more than a any criminal violations there I think we're more fall back to the ethics commission in Massachusetts I think it's a preacher is ethical obligations and duties using\nThat facility for as criminal defence purposes but I Can't see there being any criminal activity I think it's just poor judgment\nI got a really interesting I got to really email or from a long time listener here Ken who who says something really interesting time in ... by our legal analyst on this\nDilemma that the fall river mayor has you know being indicted and now defending himself and mowing not to leave a the spending that went on here uh it's it's chronicled in the indictment or you know investor number one you know frozen fifty thousand dollars immediately you know soon thereafter ten thousand is is taken from the account for the payment on a Mercedes and yeah\nThey can rise to me this uh this guy this mayor sounds fairly sharp he's talking up a development of the pap a which is the the business model from which the investors um come or to support a used to develop the up because I suspect is going to say oh the ... the current entertaining to shake and projecting a certain image\nAn image you need to kind of take again the next level or in other words you know these are the things that he had to have in order to be able to to to kind of looked like he was a success story it is a is there is there a defense argument for that do you think\nYou know because the money that were donated them were for the purpose of the creation not for him to look good\nI mean think about it a Microsoft is established in the garage\nOr they were driving older autos at the time and worrying suit with parking right uh so I don't think that would fly at all I mean I like I like the way thanks\n[laughter] bless her credit\nCreative defense though\nIt is but it's not going to fly a that's not what the money was used for factors we know now they are never really been initialized elbow\nWell that's not what he argued today that it wasn't ... and that the public in fact thirty two hundred people had had actually downloaded and use the gap in there were some hundred thousand hits and then you hit that he included a million I'm I'm a

you would hit it and you know titled type in New York style pizza and and a stream of of Facebook Like news about restaurants would that kind of product would come up and you could choose where you

time over several years several firefighters use sick time but may have also received the Fifteen to a maximum bonus council presidents even roller tells us the information was brought to the council's attention\nBy taxpayers Rob Cody and ... when\nWe had a couple of years back when we had two point eight million dollars of overtime due to six on the line item of the budget for sick leave in the war quite upon was eleven thousand dollars so I question you got two point eight million dollars in overtime to ... eleven thousand dollars how is that possible\n[noise] some of the historical reporting that I wouldn't ... you know it was done on the war firefighter sick pay and other issues there\nAnd um the voice of Rob Cody says watchdog who's had his teeth in the neck of the folks and

city council months ago to explain some of the\nI don't know a anomalies if you will in the uh in the budget process in the city of more use a front page story in the journal today by mark Reynolds and I'm not suggesting that because it's in the journal it's not validated I mean we've been talking about this forever won't be toes been reporting on it for a member\nUm and I have a funny feeling that some of the authorities are looking at this if not forever right now correct\n[noise] uh no doubt you know this this\nThe article in the journal for me was was so I think a turning point in this whole thing because of some of the material that was that was in\nThat article but maybe before we get there I I Know this is a really complicated issue or can be very complicated and I think I came up with a really simple way to really describe what's happening in Warwick ... though the basically a there's a contract that they have a contract and the contract says\nThat of the twenty sick days that work firefighters get every year uh for the days they don't use they can get paid Seventy five percent of the value of those days so if no one ever got sick for a year in Warwick\nThey could get paid for Fifteen days okay that's that's Seventy five percent of uh\nOf twenty and what Rob discovered and when I helped him a flesh out after the fact was that there were firefighters who\nTook sick days in some cases a lot of sick days yet they were still being paid Fifteen days a year from you stick type\nThat can't be and as we dove into it and try to figure it out we discovered the uh uh the bad accounting that was going on behind the scenes that allow them in some cases to monetize a hundred percent of their sick days as opposed to Seventy five percent\nIs I recall paperwork accounting correct\nWell yeah so they're just they're being as Rob likes to say it it's it's fourth grade math uh but you know there are keeping track of all for two hundred plus firefighters\nThe fire department is tracking their own you stick time uh intense all on paper so you know it's a really it's a silly actually it's beyond silly it's really tragic that that's how they're doing it I mean it's just it's the stone age really [laughter] and uh you know we deserve a lot better than that\nSo but so that's what's happening and the story coming out of work has changed a lot\nOver the last few months they denied anything was wrong they denied it you know there was any sort of forensic audit\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition and what board and he's really Janeiro against ... that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models had incredible prices log onto what auto John John now\n[noise] now what they said in the article that came out this morning or something that I find outrageous what they said was was that they had a quote unquote side agreement\nWith mayor avid Asian that apparently allow them to take a hundred percent of the sick days when the contracts that only Seventy five percent now if that's true\nI Believe that may rabid Asian end the firefighters probably broke some work ordinances because how can a mayor on his or her own volition\nMake a deal that commits taxpayer dollars that doesn't get the approval of the city or the town council\nYeah I thought I agree that that's that's a factor in this no doubt but I think one of the interesting things can of course can block is a former two term candidate for governor used the greed of the moderate party and he's got\nWatchdog alright where he he looks at this stuff now and I think is pretty much convinced everybody that he's he's got a pretty\nImportant you know high on tax payer issues and of course rub Cody and he'd been working on this particular project together Rob is what I call the Borg watchdog over there what's interesting about this story in Providence Journal firefighters to benefit scrutinized\nDetail scandal when there's no legal issue says the mayor Marc rentals right from the city has suspended and improper practice at the fire department involving calculations of unused sick time in payments for the time and firefighters according to marry someone who says the activities that may have occurred in the past one brought to the attention of our fire achieving myself where she's been way back in July\nBy the way a code he was talking about this way before July\nYeah or how low and I asked me something about this and he was like see no evil hear no evil known or evil or just as he took over from ... who moved on to ripped her but she [laughter] here's the here's the thing can that I think is interesting about the premise of the story\nThe firefighters filed agreements\nCorrect that's the trigger for this story\nThe firefighters fire you know the filed a grievance and then you know mark rentals the reporter walks in the ... oh okay well they suspended is based on the based on\n... finding out about it was you know I don't know what the firefighters are thinking but if there's anything to just kind of walk quietly into this fighting a fire according to soften this one is\nI Know in just a habit\nBut it's really something they should have thought through\nI Can't understand it because the contract is plain as day uh in terms of what percentage of the sick time on you sick time that they can be compensated and and any a dime beyond what the contract says is in violation of the contract so to grieve this ... and\nBy the way agree that it's just going to end up with guess what boys you owe a lot of money\nWell yeah I mean you've been overpaid you wouldn't\nYou know you and I discussed this before my take on this is that found found money is not allowed to be kept typically and legal terms and uh\nLet's just call it found one eight I Believe it could be worse than that money I think it could have it could have been a taken improperly but let's call it found\nThey still can't keep it going back to the taxpayers\nIf if the bank and send you more money than you're owed you have to repay and if the ATM ... more cash than us for it's not yours\nAbsolutely [laughter] and and and we're talking many many many hundreds of thousands of dollars and in fact we can't calculate at all because the city of war by the way the city of work is not a a good actor in this whole thing\nThey aren't getting robbed Cody access to the information from two thousand and twelve and two thousand and Thirteen\nOr so that we can calculate what the total a dollar value of of the inappropriately paid out money's should be so the city has been a a [noise] walk to\nGetting at the data and putting our heads all the way around what's happening here\nConstantly [noise] from them I got involved in the city of where it\nHas not welcomed this inquiry and often they've actually worked pretty hard to make it very difficult to get what needs to be gotten so everybody on the on the city government side of things in my opinion\nUh they're not working for the taxpayer that year they have other interests are and they're not doing the right thing but\nGoing to put you on hold for a second a clean that line up if you can I'm just going and we'll get back to ... for just a moment anyway\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury
