happy with that it's monsters I'm\nSo listen we have been in search of the of of the police report for that incident that\nI think in some ways at least early on this week I felt like a ridiculous scenario I had heard stories of you know ... and his younger years in the neighborhood and this and that and the other thing and never really thought anything about it then\nAnd then the story came out with ... says that he was running to a house next door when you heard a Thirteen year old girls screaming inside the house knowing he knowing that the parents weren't home and\nThere are a handful of boys outside that you know drill it felt like we're terrorizing the girl and he was over there waving his arms in the midst waving his arms he actually hit one of the young\nYouths huge huge and uh and that you just happens to be because it's only in Rhode Island the speaker of the house now ... what they were neighbors\nAnd so we've had this discussion and you know true low in trying to forecast what other um a compelling stuff even with the uh in his ... and they had in his life uh then told Matty the story of how he and Larry Earhart a former state rep eight years ago got involved in a little bit of a thing\nA which is getting a lot of attention so there's\nBeen a lot of behind the scenes political conversation going on operatives vote campaigns funk campaign for sure trying to get everybody to you know get get more on this information so we\nThinking oh no there's no smoking gun every bit of follow up on it we were pursuing the craft and police department for a public records requests to get the police report on these incidents or this incident\nUh and Tim might be used to it on on the at least on the reporting of it\nAnd I I always rely on seeing the kind of come through especially when I'm live on the air is so he's ... I'm sure he's going to have a full report target twelve tonight at five and six and ten and eleven on the newscast but well I'm sifting through paperwork that just came to me I'm going to go the news ... I Know he can make more sense of it than I can in short order\nBecause that's what he does for a living my French in what is on the line\nThis isn't that this ... at first glance this doesn't look good no it doesn't\nOffend me I think the big issue is it um suggests that uh the Mr ... version of events that he told a you know I talked about the girls screaming is not what was a portrayed in this police report so it suggests otherwise I think is what I'm looking\nFor this and I've been sifting through and I know you've got a series of tweets because you've got your thought process\nIs Wally more organized to that might help you kinda wish that I have a full article on WPRI dot com on it but but let me just ask you this is there any reference to the girl in our none no we can say what where and when we start from the beginning is how you see this\nSo in July nineteenth Nineteen Seventy five um it it is then you know young\n... father called the police department saying his son and a group of kids were playing football I'm Out in the front yard and Joe trailer came down and assaulted his son and you know they want they want to press charges so they they were instructed to come to the police department which they did two days later a very heated elder\nA Matty yellow uh went to the police department\nSaid he was going to kill Joe trail oh if the police didn't do anything about it the police made a note in the report that he said this on you know and the heat of passion I think is is how they wrote it the wild thing is is um ... witnesses claim including the young man a yellow that they were all\nGoofing around and in the front yard that with neighbors to\nThe Davis Joe ... Joe ... who was working on his house he came over told them that you know\nCut it out for lack of better word word and um\nHe uh then struck Matty yellow today had three times with the Koch and gun that he was using on some home improvement project and then the kids claim that krill oh threatened to\nTo run them over with his car and\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition I was born in east religion Narragansett thanks right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models had incredible prices log on to flood Otto John job now\nGive me a let me just read from the report if I could yeah I'm really really good to be no question that Mr Grillo did actually strike young and we it's redacted but we know its neck Matty yellow with a tube of cop\nCompound after he had been provoked into doing so by and I I assume that's Matty yellow who is an ill mannered undisciplined little brat who has been a source of aggravation to other residents of this area as well as to school authorities um\nSo yeah it uh it is a different narrative than the one that was presented by a joke Grillo a couple of days ago\n[noise]\nYeah I got I got two reports here one seems to be the incident report actually in real time right some of the officers show up intro actually speaks to them is that makes sense to you [noise] yeah so\nThen then there's and then there's a report as you say from a couple of days later when the she met a yellow comes to ah the police department with two children um and and the ... and he's reference to be uncontrollable is that there is that we have two reports that would that would you were able to get\nYeah so we have two reports we have the report of the actual um incident then we have when the family came to the police department to ... you know officially complain and that includes to hand written statements one from Nick Matty yellow and then one from an a witness who was on ... that's what I'm looking\nI'm looking at I'm I'm looking at a a large a script written statements I mean that they're they're scripture actually actually in the old days kids rode better when you can actually actually read some of this stuff\nWell there was some misspelling well everybody you know [laughter] um and there was also I should say and arrest sheet which formerly charges joked furlough with um with the with the crime I Believe it was misdemeanor assault [noise] um yes and you know again this\n... is just found not guilty okay after trial but that's so you have the original arrest sheet that handwritten thing that you're looking at and I know your listeners can't see it yes um but that handwritten note is actually a from the court\nIn in this is a misdemeanor so this isn't going to superior court does actually all being handled back then there was a district court in Cranston so this is all being handled locally rain so the police file\nIs the court file and you had a clerk who ... wrote found not guilty after trial which is the same thing I found when I went to the court archives\nUm a few days ago to see what I could find their uh Mr Grillo had suggested to everybody that he had pled no contest in that it was expunged which means white from record all all of that that is not the case here we found actually he was found not guilty after trial but it was not expunged which is why\nWhich is why the record or we can see it yeah thank you yeah I'm I'm also one wild um\nSensational part is one of the witnesses claim that Mr Grillo use of racial slur in a threatening to get a some guys to come and beat them up now I have reached out to the ... campaign or for response\nDid get an email back from his spokesperson said well we'll get back to you so we're still waiting to hear a from Mr Grillo about these new development\nYeah there's a it's hard to ... ...\nThe handwriting is hard to read but it's about two thirds of the way down Dan of what you're looking at yeah on the secondary statement not in the ...\nThe ... the one that says we were ... next door we were at ... ... lives next door ... neighbors man's him spilling problems or we were making a little noise miss so that's that's the friend right [noise] yeah\nNo that is we were at in the intro that's Nick ... further down and says it hit me three times in the hat so that would be Nick ... the other one is presumably his buddy or an a or a witness\nThe one that says you trying to scare me but coming close to me with the car and almost hit me is that many ... okay when ...\nYou know and then books you're listening to two guys in the media doing some work here um and then there's the other one is a is a kid and I I I've heard what the alleged word is is it written in here\nI'm Sorry say that I heard that heat the racial slur yeah it is it's misspelled but it's in there is it the N. word yes it is okay\nAlright them um let's take a deep breaths what's your um

drama that's now part of the police report that everybody was drawn to you Bye bye campaign operatives uh there's no reference to this little girl so do you think you might have had multiple situations no\nI don't think there are multiple situations I don't think that it became part of the ... that's the problem or you know they kind of wrote it off I guess the fact that I responded to the girl next for that was screaming because they would try to push on her door but uh\nWhen this was their playing football and your aggravated over knowing a member\nOf the football I don't I don't remember that I Can't I all I remember is they had their plates\nAnd they were writing them all over people on for like that so it was a problem and the police I call the police are number of times on

records of winning you kill the person you know that's going to bring up a lot of bad memories that he doesn't want to talk about so you know he speaks out of both sides of his mouth\nA defense and it was an unfortunate for that because I I was you know I I got a chance to watch it maybe I Will grow up to be such a nice gentleman and he was just the typical kid he was a little out of control but he was a typical kid in in a you know he he became the speaker of the house\nWell typical kid is not what surgeons Smith refers to he calls him he calls him and ill mannered undisciplined little brats
