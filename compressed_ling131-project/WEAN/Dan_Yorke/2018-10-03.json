so\nThis is one of the more unique job actions that the that we've dealt with in this community uncovered here in the media right\nBecause it doesn't seem like we have a big fight over wages\nAnd that's what makes this whole thing more ... more flexing obviously that's the voice of mayor ... and the second voices Frank McMahon\nUm usually what we get from an oil is that I Can't afford it and we will get that number to your you know what we're gonna take it off the table a that's not the case you were just getting a stone wall low but no ...\nNo to this is this is the real puzzle it certainly is when it comes to just the remedy for the city of Providence um ... there's all there's a conversation about can we get a he would get fifty drivers to come in and\nAnd you help with some of the kids in the ... in in special ed and all that kind of stuff because they're you know there than disabilities students there by law required to get the transportation you say you won't use the equipment from for student because they're kind of what the boat\nAnd they would they would be a prophet of involved in that and you know that's really what we're trying to him in the pocketbook right now I'm with the strikes shall wouldn't make sense they would weaken opposition\nUm I I go to college and we're affected by this just as much as we are the community here\nOn my nephew with with that I was not going to school I'm hearing from my from my on all the time about um I have a um a couple of years that are not going to school I'm hearing it from my own family by bus drivers have kids in

for that he was flying and then it goes from a ... credit for that to come down here and basically all of this community are\n... what do you mean by that that they're negotiating it'd be in Florida for ... yeah so so they don't care what happens here they go back home it's beautiful\n[noise] what's your uh I mean everyone's asking the question I'll have to join the the the decor is what's your projection here is this is this is an absolute non negotiable stance that you guys are taking\nTo be honest with you there and I mean clearly these drivers are irreplaceable or they would have been replaced\nMaybe there are a little more a little more valuable that first year to believe that they are\nAnd they're definitely not replace or if they thought they are so get real get back to the

critical in ... I'm In is it is just it would just be irresponsible for students knowingly put it on a that is going to fail at some point in the near future\nWill ask you this is this more about the ... of the company it being a national and international company and you wanting it consistent rhythm of a four O. one K. investment is is is it is it that you\nKnow it it is as I just said\nThe issue is that this pension\nIs underfunded by three point six billion dollar it would be irresponsible subject to the financial well being of the employees and the employees family when we know that was pension\nIs going to fail in there and do you mean though that as well based on their January two thousand eighty filing an art\nWhich said which said the program is of the pension is both critical and declining\n[noise] okay let me let me let me see what the risk is year if if so so it's\nNot one of those things where you want conformity across the board and so having any local couple of hundred group of employees\nUnder under for students you know branching out and investing in in a pension program different from your four one K. it's not that that continuity is being ... is is busted up it's the it's the the health of the pension choice they're trying to make is that your assertion\nThat's correct in in addition to the to the four o one K plan that pursuit at me and\nWe also offered a who who the Teamsters here in Providence that if they would wish to participate in the Teamsters or when a program\nThe match program that for a student has on the table would apply to that program as well so we we are allowing were offering choice to the employees there on crop\nOkay maybe I missed that so there's an alternative middle option here which is the Teamsters sponsored four one K. plan\nCorrect the Teamsters spots where or when it playing in the thousands of people go dissipated and participate in it in us\nWe have offered the union that the employees would have an option to either in the ... or one program or the apes there's awkward or on the program in the ... that we offer it to the student program would be a collectible if the employee decided to move to the tape just\nPoint do you have a examples where employees under for students have opted out of the first student four one K. and moved to a a union sponsored four one K.\nI Do not so this would be a president\nI don't know if that's a a precedent or not and I'm just not I'm not first of all what's happened to him and get stripped\nCelery okay by ... what would you try you're telling me is that versatility is not a problem here it's the health of the of the pension plan that's it well let me ask you this because I think it ... it probably drives everybody crazy who's watching this thing\n... you know there are certain things that you don't want someone to do\nAnd you make them sign all sorts of waivers that says I don't care I don't care how dangerous it is you know people want to jump off buildings usually well that's a pretty stupid not healthy thing to do because you could get killed\nSo here you know I own the building so if you're going to jump off the top of the sun your life all way [laughter] and I don't care well go ahead and have a good time you know wear helmets I might my point here is just that if if if the if if the ... the body of employees\nFeels convinced that their best option is to engage in the Teamsters pension program\nAnd their evaluation of itself is is their own\nWhy not let them sink or swim as long as you don't have as long as the company doesn't have some kind of you know back filled penalty or liability if it goes under\n[noise] well the first thing that would as does UPS and as do any of the other company isn't savings multi multi\nMulti employer pension program so there will be a liability assess the pursuit in the New York but he also is it\nSo that that that's part of the art of the problem you have to fight in Congress in June or before a house or Senate oversight committee over these pension funds and and they express their concern that if the federal government doesn't step in and do something to help bail out these these plans\nThey're just not going to survive and what's going to happen\nLooking for a car credit not prayed well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east British generic answered have the best financed reason they did with rice and cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you could be driving on a force also models interest free log on to what I Do not ...\nWas the case may be in the hardship that that brings to their family you got liability on the company's side is what\nWe're talking with Frank demand from for student a bus company in Providence so so what you're telling me is that the mere asked for a dollar an hour contribution\nOr from the already offered rates of pay a ... to the Teamsters pension on behalf of the employees necessarily unequivocally and unavoidably puts for student at risk yeah\nThere's no way to untangle that risk kind of in a sailor V. yeah will send a dollar that way but don't ask don't don't come to us if this thing goes belly under there's no legal way for that to occur\nAbsolutely not and Mr Williams oversimplify case but then saying well your lawyers can draft agreement well unfortunately lawyers and drought any agreement they want but the Congress step staying says\nYou know whatever the case may be this liability is going to act because you participate in this program you're stuck with it but no matter what whatever agreement or is entered into a law gets asked or regulation get asked that liability is going to be included it keep in mind this program fails which is the worst case scenario\nAnd eat and eat eat these drivers\nWould do in fact work part time but nice drivers will be harmed financially\nAnd in in in Rhode Island we've seen case a case where the employer is is is getting screened at and and lawsuits filed against it because of knowingly or you know some allegedly alleging that the company knew that they should've continued with a certain type of a pension progress\nOr you're kind of your show you're referring to your you're referring to like the St Joe's hospital situation for instance\nWell the facts are slightly different in that case but in in Rhode Island where ... people people are very in tune with violence on the pension liabilities and government different issue on its liabilities in some other institutions\nFirst you didn't know we know today that if our police participate in this pension plan is going to fail these other companies\nHave chosen others did not have that kind of information in the day when those programs were started it's a completely different issue but the point is that why why why we were student knowingly subjected employees to future harm\nIt it's completely irresponsible\nWell I I guess I I I guess the the new one response to that Frank is\nIf she ... I'd have to and I'd be I'd be pleased if you were able to forge me on maybe an email or something some some background information and helps me understand what the\nUm unavoidable\nA liability is for the company should a failure of the Teamsters pension\nI'm occur uh because I think most people think of themselves you know what if they just if these people want it and they want the money directed ended up taking a fun and it's no risk to the company what the hell's the problem you're telling me that the rest of the company's unavoidable\nAbsolute and and there's legal precedent that that shows that I'm I'm\nI'm I'm open to that I I'm not I'm not educated enough on that to know\nExactly how to how to look that up or or figure that out so that would be there would be a help the other thing that is interesting and bothersome is that um\n[noise] the represented from the Teamsters Union just told me that you guys are still up in through October\nI haven't paid a three hundred and fifty dollar matching money that each of the bus drivers is expecting that you do to the Capitol three fifty or over the course of twenty team that no money some contributed to the four one K. that you currently provides can you respond to that\nIs completely untrue um the way the first student uh or all and K program works in Providence\nIs that an employee makes the attribution we're not doing it quarter and then the company matches\nAnd it has a certain number of business days after the end of the quarter to quarter just ended on September thirtieth or water so we've got a number of days to then make the matches and and as as far as the sack new never has there been a complaint filed who first about the property or on a program\nOr what Mr ... games is has ... has a ... today and

to kind of you know parse through that and read a little bit more carefully off the air in and see if I get a hold of this whole thing in my head um but at least this afternoon to exercise has been

Want to talk about flatulence on stage sixteen year but [noise] um [noise]\nIt was all the world watching Senator Whitehouse asks about [noise] flatulence [noise]\nWhat an embarrassment for Rhode Island [noise] less selective problem solver\nMy gas bag I'm ... and I approve this message\n[laughter] I think the gym gas bag is funny\n[laughter] and and they think they I I Know that they're creative minds are in the ... camp\nThink that uh\nThey have that they there's a little bit of video where and you know if you're watching it live you've probably remembered Sheldon looks a little\nA\nDistressed and he's and he's got his head down and I think he's got his hair is Han through his hair and\nHe makes a couple of squinting moves in children's got a little bit of that something's got to kind of a moving face all the time anyway it's just that's just as his physicality and his and his mannerisms\nSo they would consider that he actually looks like he's passing gas uh you know during the hearing that you know they think that's funny um\nFlanders is trying to make it an issue of White House and his prominence in the in the cabinet hearings obviously this judge cabinet that you hear the music is an editor for production value and so too has the laugh track\nUh but\nNow this is to ads that\nHave Bob Flanders calling or the campaign calling Sheldon Whitehouse name sounds kind of because\nThat's one and now gas bag is another ... y and while the word do fish makes me laugh because I'm a fourteen year old is hard right you know\nYou know the word fart makes me laugh the word booth makes me laugh in fact even cabinet during that whole discussion was seen 'em game you\nWant to talk about [laughter] you talked about flex\nIts [laughter] that you know that that makes you laugh\nYou never knew you know there are so it's nice to know that we don't use our youthful ridiculous 'cause flatulence makes me laugh the word makes me laugh\nAnd tell you I'm just I'm just\nDumped teenager at heart right my gas bag [laughter]\nUh I I get their point I don't know that it moved the needle at all I think a lot of people in Rhode Island are pretty happy\nOr the idea that Sheldon Whitehouse as prominent in the Senate Judiciary committee\nA nobody does with that prominence is what ... was just trying to point to see you can tell me what do you think the as effective or not um I think it's probably a bad habit to spend your political money\n... ... humor is tool so I get that they're trying to laugh they've been trying to laugh at at at at the climate change in children's commitment to that with the repetitive head about climate change ends with the two ladies and the old lady sings shield them to do this and then this one\nA\n... ... what we don't see from the ... campaign is the product differentiation in any kind of levels in any kind of specifics and I just don't I I I\nI I again and again a troubled and disappointed that we don't seemingly have or at least at last polling data and again it was the beginning of the general election season just after the primary so you get a factor that in\nA there will be more polling data that will come I'm sure in a few weeks in ample time before the election but it feels like a twenty point race and Bob Flanders I think is um impressive enough not to be in a turning point race\nOr to be on the back
