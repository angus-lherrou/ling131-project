the phone call and you know hopefully you Rob Cody there was gonna wants this thing wide open you know\nHopefully well another another matter that's a seemingly being busted wide open a kid took attention this week at a press conference a with a boy's training school a mayor ... had a a press conference\nOr an behind him was a\nSuperintendent retired uh Joe ... of the Rhode Island formerly of the Rhode Island a training school now the Thomas leader school I'm Joe uh there's been retired um he's got whistleblower status I guess I'm has some insight stories not only about the past um situations and\nRegressions of the training school but how they relate to the the current sitting governor who by the way I got about twelve by Eighteen a very expensive\nGlossy um mailer from the governor this morning saying I'm a\nMan do Gina Raimondo for governor a better future for Rhode Island kids I guess unless they wind up [noise] God Forbid and the training school or\nIn a way that you voted for yeah well I wasn't I must somehow uh yeah that someone would ah and I want to vote you assemble credit yeah it sounds so Joe welcome a welcome to the drug will do in\nA again you are you took a front and center right behind a mayor Fung this this week um you've got a again a a Inside Story to tell a that their religion and the current governor in to\nThe Mike is yours tell us a little bit about your past or how you wound up here in the seat today in in terms of your story and a pretty much what happened you there's a story where you were you were you know out of the loop for a while uh\nUh but you clearly have some some information you'd like to share with us\nWell ... thank you for having me ... um yeah I got I got a long story actually but really I'm here today I'm also as a taxpayer ... times higher\nAnd de forty five year professional public servant in the state of Rhode Island\nAh and I'm really not here to clarify a dignify rather than the response of governor Amman due to a mayor fungus press conference them really to clarify what she said publicly thereafter yup and a couple of things that really\nConcerns me where both of those hats is a well first reference to me about being disgruntled and uh I guess I'll alone at 'em but I'll take it to another level\nOf forty five years of service I think you have a little right to be a little white lies listen to\nYour prior caller and I'll listen to what's going on in wall like I deal with everyday to stay dry\nAnd then once you were you to read on the spot right from the\nWell again I mean the the issue of\nSick time use\nOvertime abuse\nUm uh I I Believe uh put it in his perspective on the role of the administrator of true leader is to really have your facility firing on all cylinders and whatever metric you want to look at it from ... to programming to person held\nYou know all these types of things is very relevant to the outcomes or if you look again a little at the state train school in the last two or three years since I've been out of there are they really couldn't\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free own condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices flood onto flood Otto John job now\nHow do we get there this is an outrage on but to kind of ... you just said my God I mean frankly the systems run on overtime yeah I could honestly tell you even my ministry Asians in trying to address that\nAre on average I did a couple of studies in the last four or five years and again I say this we should respect\nAnd when you tell me as a leader in the state of Rhode Island and her subsets of leaders within the department of D.C why\nWith two hundred and fifty thousand dollars you can't run a safe progress of viable facility were staff and residents don't fear on a day to day basis for their safety\nWhere kids are are ... while I shouldn't call kids they actually residents were residents are allowed to go to their programming educational vocational\nMy ministry she was part of putting up a vocational structure Donny using federal grants and I can sit here today tell you in the public that does that facility is basically a store room\nThat's all it is now or that's what they've done and they've done decimated programming down their offer a number of years they couldn't even get the kids out in the rec yards under the guise of while the fences broke all they kept kids stockpiled and moved to what we call chorus of lock up\nEducational programs of compromise because they couldn't get a residence from point a to point B as we sit here today they can't even feed\nTo you and it's at a time in the cafeteria they eat down which is unsanitary it's frowned on by the federal court which yes the training school or they maybe don't eat meat eater you and it's not in the main OK okay but again it goes to leadership and it goes to control and a lot of other things\nIf one was to ask me my opinion of why so much violence occurred down there it's it's kind of simple\nRight kids needs were not being met programs were not being run appropriately voices were not being heard bullying was being allowed and staff are pretty much you know being allowed to do whatever they want and that's all on the administration or\nYou will replace people were put in place that they were clearly not not confident do the job\nAll there's not there's not a person down there a ... and and managed to ration that I Would even say is credible that's based on knowing practice that's not even against the new guy coming in they're not even credible\nSo we understand each other it correctly yeah we're not we're not dealing with kids who are looking for a place that we're dealing with juvenile criminals wrecked\nWe're dealing with juvenile criminal okay male female to stay training school I'm\nVery sad and it was very sad sad situation or what what what strikes me is it's look the dean fish has had a long story this like you said it's a problem business is not a queen pleasant business they're always going to be problems what what strikes me is that the the ... first female governor [noise]\nI Would think a woman governor would have a different type of outlook and Gina predict too protective norther and other mothering nurturing produce comedy on the ads but you get worried about the amount of course but you would think that as a woman governor who professors and and and hang your hat on that\nWould have a would have a rabbit absolutely all out campaign to protect children even if they're even if they're not hurt type of children of course I'm I'm sure she just assumed not deal with them which is clearly what you did but\nIt just it it it actually is is such a park or see what this coming to the UN agencies such as this with the with the most the most really sad cases of children\nThat are probably never had a break or privilege I'm being being left out in the cold by governor the first female governor in Rhode Island very disturbing\nWell it is and uh again because I I Would say that\nWhere the training school was undermined administration and and and the good people that work there they were part of my administration or as I mentioned earlier we had really met her exceeded any metric including\nA secure in compliance from the federal court order which has a forty two years decree oversee conditions confinement now or the ability for the state of Rhode Island to seek relief from that consent decree was the work of my ministry Asian so does your point because about you know having\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center head will buy yours even if you don't buy ours more gone too far I car buyers are tough\nNot only me and my capacity but it should be supported by the governor frankly my opinion is that discovery came in New people individuals associated with your team\nThat I had reported major corruption on or against back in the nineties okay\nGoes around comes around and it's true or not I mean when it came around ... I'll say this candidly\nThat when I um when governor remodel came into stunning announcer team\nI was contacted by people hadn't talked to in years attorneys and the like in the first thing they said to me of quote it\nYou're going to come after you know and frankly they did in again I'm not above right ... ... if you have something that is um [noise] that reflects on my performance then you need to fill in ...\nLet's let's back up to ... through the process of people giving understanding so a ... a child lives up in court\nOr gets deems that he's going to do some time a judge sentences him to the training school juvenile detention or whatever we want to call it um I'm assuming that point given he's given a case worker or a or a parole officer or somebody who oversees this case are these just dumped upon you when you made a joke for\nTwo years well there's two aspects like first of all the kids come June awaiting trial he's in detention and he's now did you okay but even in that facility and by the way that building was uh the ... buildings that now we have fifty two best was back in the part of new training school that they got it out\nAnd they now putting ... made off Maya population in there on that that that new bills and probably because the route fourteen Fifteen million and go down and they got it already resigned due to a mental population of ... some assets\nYou know that's beautiful yeah so um so what happens is male female Judy ... non too beauty but if you're a sentence and your ... to\nThe way the structures each you go to a mob or part is we call these days twenty four capacity in each part as a unit manager supervisor ... CD B and C they also have a clinical social worker aside\nSo when you still looking at the numbers is ... ... that's what I'm saying this national staff to the what we call the ... mine workers juvenile program workers we upgraded them years ago so they would be part and parcel of any aspect from security to counseling on through\nLet me hold you on that because we have a one of a great call those goals and all the time of Mr Freddie for more with it I'm sure he's got a good ... good afternoon very\nHigh I Will take an Oscar did the most of them around my credit\nYou know let me just say one thing okay you know what's going on down air ethnicity or what's going on there you know ... ... only gas is talking about you know people realize white thing\nThis is not you know just like last month has been going on for decades\nAnd decades twenty thirty has been going on and now it's coming out to light because it's called social media or information goes flying around\nYou know Twenty years ago ten years ago a state worker you got hurt on the job you're set for life workers' comp kill up the check yet until you die\nYou know there there were now I never made settlement right I mean you know that's unheard of only in this state I mean you know ... you know in the city we have three garbage trucks that a court I buy\nIt happened again and then someone broke into our city I drove around slam businesses try I mean is it for that one link change and oh by the late ... a city solicitor oh by the way he was the former Democratic chairman of the body\nOf water okay I mean they're they're they wore flip flopping going on down here or in the state and and your guest I mean you know what kind of hammering that stopped ... from those those those are out there\nBefore that that that you know they were bringing the state police\nOn earth and that's what he's reiterated I I Know that\nBut what I'm saying is it all comes back can't point the finger and this person can't point the finger that per se that apply to one person that's the governor right I don't feel it\nBlood legion is southern Rhode Island from your laundry dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit Weiner of Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln in DC I'm the only twenty or do Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of never against its own ...\nYou know forget watch watch was very important [laughter]\nWe're glad it all at once the Brady Bunch I mean you know\nAnd and like you know it's like this has been going on for decades and\nDecades I mean when we can shape the was in office we act two children they're all fell down in the way I Know I support my down here right in fact I was I used to all the ... back then for all everywhere you know click came in and I'm Glad they came in as I really don't have the time anymore yup\nSo it wasn't but by some support you don't have the money that you don't have the money what you were a public safety commissioner I said\nYou you've got this one I said okay I'll stick it to add a fundraiser I re thirty thousand dollars a dirty ... gave it to the grandmother and grandfather they went to like cheap they purchased the what we need to stay in the fall I\nYour retirement the best part is absolutely the cover of your own home to join this great educational event hurt us on the radio now let's show you with Social Security is all about with the convenience of staying at your own kitchen table called today for zero one Seventy seven to seven to seven that number again this is your one Seventy seven twenty\nSeven twenty seven or check out our Web site at U.

Joe ...\nSo that being said what's the condition right now what what what are the changes that are you're going through right now what's your role right now with the Rhode Island GOP represented ...\nI I like to respond to a little bit I I don't have much more to say about the gubernatorial race officer Christopher true man you nailed it uh it's it's been turned into a side show and I think that jokes rose job and he's going to a heck of a job at it and and I appreciate appreciate his boosted interview or\nTo the Providence Journal where he frankly admitted his job was to take votes away from our song\nAnd so I I think a real issue in addition to the specific policy issues that Christopher are being raised is that we live in a state with a poor algae voting system where whoever gets the most votes with even if they don't get a majority and we have a third party candidate who was essentially admitted that his job is to be a spoiler\nUs so that that's something I think it's highly problematic and I think ... and we need to reassess our per ... per Audi voting system and look at a system this runoff voting\nOr like Maine has done and will avoid these forty percent governors in the future so that that's my comment on the governor's race I'm Sorry what was your question\nYou're listening to the W. B. R. O. B. Y. reach me no end of last so long [laughter]\nGood morning they're fun or more than ... thanks for that intro and the bottom line is it is gross mismanagement of that department in the ... there if we can protect our children who are at the heart of honor goldie then I don't even know what\nWe're doing is leaders and government 'cause ... you mentioned the governor Jaycee said no children died um you probably saw yesterday governor harm it came out and supported me she mentioned the same thing under his cured but no children died but under this governor\nNineteen ups Thirteen serious standard that's unconscionable and it all starts at the top you hit the nail right on the head when you said they had to put up this chart\nTo let people know who they're reporting into on certain issues that just shows the bloated bureaucracy there's governor has had not only at the Y. F. but\nEvery single State Department every department is on fire because all she cares about is taking care of political allies and friends these six figure jobs not given enough resources and that's got to make of what happened to see why you\nKnow if he feels item I'm being straight up with the listeners hearing feels\nHeavy in almost\nDirty an awful to try to blame these debts on one person but there is a problem here and and if you eat I don't want to say it's you know look at the numbers because the numbers represent little children so this is a really tough one you know of course\nYou're you know you're in we were less than three weeks away we're in a tough political race here for the governor's\nOffice and you know this is an obvious one but it's also a ... it's tough we are talking about vulnerable vulnerable children and families\nIn probably the worst moments of their lives so it it's an awful thing to talk about but it has to be talked about at the same time and and of course the ... campaign under the senior advisor my grand is going to say your politicizing this you're taking this tragedy and it's dirty politics\nBecause they can't defend the facts and what I hold a press conference\nNot a single one of those facts wasn't supported by newspaper articles by the D.C wire a child advocate report itself or even her own democratic legislature and you and the leading you had represented in a speech Williams I forgot about her comment\nI put in the words of\nProgressive democratic to um you know tens in there who you know made the note that a lot of this happened because she put in the wrong leadership without a qualified director\nRhode Island's number one board ... again and again the blood borne as one of them are brand new borders games were just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you do more but not\nHad not been the case you know chairwoman surfer it's been so egregious outrageous she couldn't even believe that it's happening\nThis is a problem that the governor created because you put in Jamie and McDonnell we had no qualifications another statutory requirements\nTo be in that position the governor worked or her little magical if she does for her supporters of friends to veterans that you know little piece of the jigsaw puzzle that didn't work and that's what led to all this tragic situation for almost multiple children and it has to stop and that's why\nI you know released my plan yesterday to Riyadh and stabilize that system or in a lot of what we see consistently from this governor is\nToo little too late\nDeflection instead of fixing the problems and now that it's political season now she's starting to try to put you know resources into it you know three and a half years later\nWrong we've had enough for years of this governor hurting people is enough is enough\nAnd she was granted mayor Allen San um when one more piece on this I'm Mike ... of course where the governor because he's running her campaign he said before I had to use ... actually gave two wings about kids he would have had the backbone to say something honest\nAbout Trump's morals child separation policy earlier this year how do you ... the two in what's your take on that [laughter]\nAgain more dishonesty from the ... campaign Tyra I've been on\nBelieve your show or in the debates a previous you talking about that I didn't agree with the separation of children from their families at the border you know it that's one of those things that uh is so dishonest about what's coming out I'm white\nRaise mouth that he just the flex a to flex with dishonest facts here we are talking about facts that have been backed up and supported\nYou he can't even run from you know Nineteen kids that have died in the Thirteen there has been seriously injured you know he's the one that's playing politics when he tries to spin away and use dishonest false backs against me you know I'm using democratic legislators word\nAgainst her you know about horrific over the situation is is this is an important issue that's why\nI Want to ... by adding new workers in my first year to support the foster care program I Want to actually add\nYou know social workers are and not cut them like the governor has done so that their staff caseloads you don't meet the national standards I also want to address some of the problems that are uh the root cause of it with this opioid crisis and make sure that we have teams\nThat are you know special a specially trained to meet the needs and hold people accountable would supervise oversight\nOr there's a lot of work to be done in just ... you know I I think if I had to play devil's advocate or anyone running against your just someone you know it works the governor would say uh you know you've got to give it time you think you can get this done in in X amount of time\nI can tell you what I can get done\nIs having those frontline workers a you know get to it and cut down the ... so they can you know pay the necessary care and attention to these vulnerable kids and their families\nYou know that's what I Want to do any immediate this governors had for years to do it and she hasn't done it and that's the message that I'm sending a jar not only is it from her initial incompetence we can always focus on that\nAre and what the results were but she's had three and a half almost four years now or you know remedy this problem and she hasn't\nIt that's endemic of this administration because we're talking about DC why after you hit it still ongoing six hundred forty eight million dollars is unconscionable no end in sight and still going up\nTaking a look at problems still lines at the DMV you're you're talking about gene a gym at guilty when is enough enough were knowledge have had enough as I've been traveling crisscrossing estate everyone has been talking about the cuts that they faced\nYesterday I was up at east Providence I'm Talking to several individuals\nAt their senior center and one of the things that was pointed out to me was people with developmental disabilities cuts that have been\nMade to their programs the vocational programs under this administration of heard so many they don't know what to do\nI don't think there's a single department that is running effectively under this governor because of her political uh appointees that are just nothing but supporters and donors to her and that's how she makes a decision she doesn't care about the little guy about us\nOh let me just ask you this a mere Alan's on this\nBlood legion in southern Rhode Island's from your laundry dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln MTC Lincoln Lincoln MDC I'm the only twenty eight ... Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of never against such funds here alone Marjorie\nRace Joe ... the independent and obviously you mean your cells and a governor Gina Raimondo Joe ... a has support he he says he's not going anywhere he's dug in he says his internal polling you know has him above the other polling numbers that you hear maybe double digits\nUm how can you say it's a two person race\nWell what I can say is you know I'm gonna use chose on word against them they\nClearly send the Providence Journal that he's doing this just to he doesn't care if he takes two points and so long as those two points are away from me he doesn't want to see me become governor I Want all your listeners to know that that's not the right reason to be in a gubernatorial race you know just because you hate me a and\nWhy he you know he just said you weren't you know we've all worked with people and then they have a falling out maybe you know you get under someone's skin or something I don't think you've ever worked side by side with ...\n... that's the question to ask a parent but what I can really I think we all have a nice\nHe doesn't he says he's a bad guy I Know a lot of things about him but then he doesn't know lowered with that so that we don't really know is there with her personal tolerance kid work for someone or\n... I had no clue all I can use is always call me a criminal that's slanderous the bottom line is it is a two person race as me versus the governor and if he's just in this race to take votes for me\nUm she's the real problem and we need fundamental change and we need it yesterday I'm here with the plans we need not only for D.C why after every single department are been outlining those plans on your show on\nI'm In ... and everything I'm very eager to get to work a vote for Joe troll oh there's a vote for general Mondo I'm the only ones that could bring effective change and shake up every single possible confident leadership I've shown I can do that\nI I there was a press release that says um\nYou know ... you have you're desperate for your family campaign and you're rooting for tragedy this is also from Mike ran from Gina Marie my nose a team or am I Know and talking about a D.C wife which we we started off talking about\nUh how is your campaign going financially are you pushing through the last couple of weeks or what's going on there\nI started doing the University of Illinois courses that matched the MBA program it was like a practice run into the digital marketing specialization then I moved on to leadership courses and economics\nOnce admitted to the eye MBA program courses you've taken out towards your degree\nDoing that for enrolling boosted my confidence to apply so I applied and was accepted them enrolled in the eye MBA program through the University of Illinois\nAre in the same procedure NBA you get on campus one hundred percent on line and break you price train an MBA course today with no application MBA to defend the room to sign the room MBA to zero zero Coursera your course to success NBA did you sign the room you ...\nHave you tried that trendy need eating out you can have months of frivolous fun with people who just love to play games but if you are ready for something more grown up trying to match up over thirty thousand new people a day are heading to match\nFor grown up conversations that lead to great dates and beyond our listeners to go to match dot com can start for free today you photos and informative profile to get a deeper sense of the people you'd like to meet start for free today at match dot com match dot com\nHalloween as this movie time to spend with your friends experienced Roger Williams ... through the jak allegiance that calculus these to rise on the glow of thousands of illuminating carved pumpkins and the magical display of artistry depicting people places and scenes\nFrom popular culture to all time favorites in everything in between joined ... and all of us a cottage furniture for the jak Olympian spectacular\nRoger Williams harms you know through November for [noise]\nYou're listening to the WPRI every one featuring an hour and a few laughs along the way\nGood morning I'd say representative gene anybody morning Joanne morning town of ... good ... I was reminded and and ah thankfully so that you had a big part in this\nWell I I have to give credit to pita form of AT T to ... yeah who was the spots co sponsored the bill with him and at that\nWhat can and should in Rhode Island for new luxury do learn the dream Lincoln's which was one of them we can in Lincoln and junior legionnaires disease I mean only Eugene Levy remember Judy Blume Lois Missouri [laughter]\nWhen we were together okay and basically what he tried what we try to do was um have a notification um\nGo\nThe sex offender registration and notification act which is the piece of federal legislation um that was passed federally we try to have that implicated here where the um notification of sex offenders upon release\nWould be um put in the local police department but\nThen over the years um pita had tried and um they were laws put in to try to switch that over\nTo the state police because I'm a lot of people were getting to the loopholes mhm and um I I Believe that um it it went to the police and they were only the ... was\nNotification upon release of your residence before you leave for pull off before you're out\nUm if they if the um sex offender move they have to notify within twenty four hours the police of where they're going and they cannot live within three hundred feet in school originally it was um a thousand and over the years it was amended to um [noise]\nThree hundred image and no bill was in Nineteen Ninety five and there's been several upgrades to it over the years\nBut the issue has always been that the local police departments\nIt's always been hard for them to keep track of all of that and um I might say I was listening to your program and um I I'd be remiss if I didn't say that the correctional office used to have um\nA monthly newsletter called the guardian\nMhm they would\nPost all sex offenders where they lived and it was ... when a map and their name mhm and it was a a service to the community that was a free paper and it was put in all the neighborhoods I don't see that amount anymore yeah so I'm going to go\nAhead ... ... how does that play into when I was saying Joe Joanne Jean and he's on the line for mercy rep um\nYou you have children in the public school system and I don't know about the private school system because my kids to public school but you would get a letter when someone was released from prison sex offender you'd get a letter with the address ... the the right down to the you know the number on the house where they were going to live\nI don't know if it's because of you know where it is in relation to schools locations of schools but I I\nKind of dropped it up to their warning you there's a level whatever sex offender right here within a certain amount of radius to where you are so if they're you know so many miles from your home and you get that letter if you have kids in school 'cause I don't get them anymore\nNo and and they also would have a website which I Believe they still do that you could go on and check but a lot of people are not aware of that and ah they could go on to a local police department and check\nOn these notifications but some people do not and and basically the only I I it was interesting I read the paper this morning and it said the police\nAre the only ones then notified the address but\nI'm councilman upon T said that he ... he didn't disclose but a police officer anonymously gave him the address so the address ... posted on Facebook\nWould sure did I saw it a couple of nights ago and I did too when I saw it I cringe\nBecause you know I mean we can't as much as we don't like these things tower and we're all upset we cannot take the mad as into our own hands up police have enough of a hard time doing this and I'm sure the mayor is upset and I know that people are upset\nBut we can't you know they they will I mean when we did when the bill was done the ACLU will\nI'm opposed it there was some ... voted against it the ... being a vigilante coming forward right and also the fact that people if they serve their time that they deserved a right\nTo be able to rehabilitate and live in society\nTo the best of your knowledge ah Joanne he can live any I I I like to do all of the reporting you can live anywhere he wants he can go over there\nRhode Island's number one distributor gym again one of them are brand new border strange for just one one boy one for one of every dollar every option and everything you do\nThe ankle ... he's got he could go anywhere he wants ...\nAnd so you know the the the the thought process probably for those people those neighbors that are altogether now and there there are they are you know becoming a force because they want to protect their children and their neighbors um\nDid they figure probably will push him out maybe he'll go to another state well you can get rid of them only\nWas convicted I Believe he in Massachusetts yes\nAnd so I mean I we ended up in Washington park I don't know I served\nIn both Massachusetts in Rhode Island prisons\nBut but what happened but I think I bet he was originally from Massachusetts\nAnd they had a woman on last night that was a one of the victims sell it as though it was talking about it but I mean at once they serve their time as long as they do that notification process yes\nHe can go um where he wants to enlist the judge it puts some stipulation on his uh on his sentence which I don't see and I don't think that they they have done so I see no evidence of that from what we have about this um\nI I don't know exactly what the mayor can do other than the police will do I saw a little pay and on this morning and he you know all they can do is monitoring it\nRight but I don't believe that under the law now they talk about wanting to go back I saw a legislative want to go back\nOr you go back in January you put the law of and it's going to take a while to do that writing and what what will they do you also have constitutional issues here I don't know if they were able to do I remember all the it wasn't easy bill Ben and writer the is it hasn't been easy\nAnd um the notification process and mean and what it was a divided into um [noise]\nThe sex offenders themselves were divided into categories to so different um provisions will put on each category\nSo it it is an easy thing to get to where you can say well I'm going to go back in time and fix it because it doesn't work that way some of these bills take years to get\nRight well that's what I was in even if I'm speaking with former C. represent a Jew in gene any even if you did like you said if if if the generals somebody goes back in ... after the first of the year after elections after this after that she gets all settled in and they wanted to take a new look at the at the laws that you can apply to this guy\nNo he's ... ... you know I Need to use the word grandfather Denver\nEven when when I when we were done like things
