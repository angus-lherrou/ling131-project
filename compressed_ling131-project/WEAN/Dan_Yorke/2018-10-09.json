W. B. R. O. [noise]\nI had to know that the way from the studios heightened special deals for national teeth on the on that and no job\nMr ... supporter close of our our like the governor who just dumped back Russia's probably because certainly donations from inverted who's a part of that project you know I support local controls [noise]\nFirst of all I think it's interesting only in Rhode Island [noise] we we have a governor's race where we have a governor who lost some of the year and a half dollars of taxpayer money [laughter]\nThan we have a mayor that's been accused by the Rhode Island police department of running a criminal enterprise running for governor\nLet me tell you some of that uh [noise]\nSome of that trip low energy has been lost in are the two latest media polls [noise]\nBecause right now it looks like Gina Raimondo he's pulling away down the stretch [noise]\nWith the snow I Would still say that if this was a horse race we're probably I don't know you tell me the top of the stretch\nAnd there's still a few for a long way to go but it feels like a ... that she's just rating you know that the the ... slightly tapping or on the side and she moved out here [noise]\nABC six Rhode Island public radio\nAnd Providence Journal poll has a fourteen point lead for ... fun and there'll be forty thirty four in a Allan Fung has five percent I'm Sorry Joe Chill is five percent with\nA handful of the others you know sharing one percent each so uh\nIt it it makes the I have to tell you just from my guts standpoint and listen you're got maybe different that's all we have phone lines for three eight dirty bureau toll free one eight hundred three two one dirty appear at all seems to make sense to me it just as I live in by the way this corruption add to that reminded was raining down and fungus head is hurting them\nIt just is it just is\nYou could call call it a foul ball but this is the stuff that he had going on with the police department I mean he says to his credit I think\nUh you know learned his lesson and is staying the hell out of I I I wouldn't know day in day out what's going on in Cranston\nBut it seems to me that he's learned his lesson and uh you know put a good chief in there and the police department or Cranston seems to be running pretty smoothly but this was a twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen controversy and it was a state police report that came in a in the early part of his next four year term here\nAnd or at least four years between you know then and now for governor\nAnd she's making them pay the price she's making them pay the price that that that corruption ad where he looks you know very unhappy and they just keep pounding away at a they use the word mafia\nAnd that thing it's it you know when you've got when you've got a message that you can write like that and you got the millions behind you that you can spend\n... it's a it's\nA tough hill to climb you've got to be a surprise candidate you got to be a surprise candidate to withstand the situation\nAnd\nThen I just don't see fungus as ... as the privilege of Kennedy you know intro is making noise but it's not sticking and he's going to have to admit that it's not sticking and he was on with terror earlier today talking about his informal polling at Eighteen to twenty percent\n\nYou know he's got he's got a two week you know plus move here I I don't know when the next media poll will be a Joe Fleming wouldn't tell me to knew she wouldn't tell me ah I I'm guessing I don't know I'm an employee of the company and I\nDon't know I don't know all the winner\nIf uh the next poll is going to be done by a channel twelve in cooperation with Roger Williams University in the past they've tried to pull twice a so if they come out and a couple of weeks and there's a poll and it shows some\nChange in this race then we'll have something to talk about but right now it just kind of feels like it's a fate accompli doesn't it Stephen Moore\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explains it light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln and Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nIn the ... ... what what they're going to take to get her out of it so it is\nIt takes us around her live candidate takes us a pro life candidate in any situation where you have an incumbent uh who's that well financed it it takes ... candidate\nRight but so it's all about money\nIt's not just about the money I think it takes us or prose of candidate they just why shouldn't take us a proactive candidate\nThe biggest is the nature of ... or whether it's just the nature of the get listen Gina Raimondo has a constituency as much as it bothers you and I understand why it bothers you she's got a concert and she's got to ... she's got her ... she's got to do so they are really does it bother me in part it\nDoes yeah OK it does I\nI don't I don't talk to anybody during the course of my day that it doesn't bother and I don't understand what the old numbers go\nWell all you have to do is just take a good hard look at where the dynamics of the politics and the state exist oh she's very very strong in even though you hip is even though you hip is has been a an executed will disaster\nIs still services people who are on the Dole\nAnd one of the one of the interesting dynamics of all of this\nIs that we've got Republican candidate and an independent candidate that are arguing about making that system works better but underneath the system\nIs probably way too expensive for what their philosophy ought to be an end the execution of that system is lost against the philosophy about that system that's that's ... in in a really weird way\nThe ... the incompetence and delivering\nThe welfare benefits that mostly come out of the EU hip thing has been a ... it's been a weird blessing in disguise because it reaffirms her commitment to that kind of government funding and that's the constituency that's responding to these polls\nBut that's her base she's the one that's her based her way dude her basis huge that base exist and this is a blue state brother um boy it's a blue state you can sit there all day I'm I'm feeling below that I hear ya\nThe thank you same Steve last week you know screamed at me down the

he's doing on the ground every day you know I'm looking at his ads I mean they've been very responsive anytime we've asked for Bob ... he does sometimes they'll say hey Dan Bob wants to talk about this and we have\nUm\nI mean he's an impressive guy his take on the cabinet stuff has been interesting I Am sure that that's going to be front and center and I'm sure that he's going to go after show
