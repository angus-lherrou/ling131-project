I don't even think about trying to get a feel go there just OK puck but puts them touch on it don't take it out of the end zone it was terrible yeah no good okay let's go to Steven Winchester icy\nGuys ... good I just think that I just think the patriots just play doubt or up to their opponent you know they should have just low these days out today\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition I was born in east religion there were against it that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices flown to flood Otto John job now\nSeventeen but they've been uncharacteristically sloppy here for both the disease if especially in the second half I looked at Indianapolis game going back a few Thursday's this today like I don't know you kind of seen as really throughout the season for stretches they've played dumb or had bad turnovers are dumb penalties\nYeah I mean I don't ... the turtle was the biggest part that's playing down their competition that's just dumb mistake correct double mistakes things that you shouldn't have happening the ... man that kickoff return bumble by Patterson that one to me is killer that what you\nWant to come on and I felt like they showed like more than a handful of angles up and it just really looked like to do that was called 'cause you bumped into one of your own players now that was caused by a bears player no\nNo at least on the shelves getting hit them six that's great yeah OK and even that I Would say if it was he wasn't hurt I might be more critical that turnover and it was it was truly foolish was the one that nearly wants to turn over now went off Edelman face mask on a punt return ... riding never see that yeah\nYeah that one was bad that was weird that James dead one one was bad you know\nThat's just again uncharacteristically slump before this team for stretches since the beginning of the year Jay is in graft and what's up Jay\nHey guys thanks for taking my call I just want to know what your thoughts on ah you'll see Mike he'll asleep combat considering is a free agent it does yeah they'll hang up on the air\nI think it's a possibility for sure him\nOr Ralph Web you know um who those of us who have to watch the pre season you know it's part of the gay but I Would anyway he did look good in the pre season so maybe Ralph Web ends up during the steam again and uh hopefully you can give him some production because they're gonna have to do something in terms of death the running back boy they've been they've really been snake bit there at this point to it's like\nYou know to people even remember expert kid you know in ... market on I are they lose German hill and the first game and that's unfortunate because they could certainly use immature your situations\nYou loosely he's still on the ... the saints cut him is that\nYeah I was just going to double check that he got caught before last weekend's okay so I Believe he's still out there yeah yeah so I don't usually do you still out there has been picked up by anybody it's I I wouldn't\nThey needed something and I think that's why you here's oh so frustrated at the end of the call like you can't lose to the team because the bears aren't that good\nThat was something that does it multiple times today you can't lose\nDid esteem you cannot do it that would have been a horrible loss of they have they lost their today a instead they get a win thirty eight thirty one and good\nThat's like one of those when did you say good yeah let's get the hell out of here like your route come home and you know what I Would do\nI Would burn the tape of this one yeah that's what I Would do I wouldn't really want to go back and watch this one you got the wind you know you're a much better team than the bears you are patriots know what they should know what we know what\nThose were two very different levels teams on that bill today yeah or find enough that you can clean up between now and I'm not taking that bears game seriously now when you get to face the Packers in a few weeks\nBills getting him and said he said I'm not taking the bears game uh sorry yes yes I'm with you you know not taken that game seriously either did it a a Derek ... starting quarterback they we're warming\nUp naked Peter ms quarterback but I don't believe he actually made it into the game no 'cause I think everyone else on that built the rightfully hate him because he's terrible keeps the ... there was a revolt\nOn the sideline and sided to keep him in the game of checking a box or from this game today\nIt just refreshed on me um I don't think that Peter emitted into the game today they lost thirty seven to five what a score\nThirty seven to five and Indianapolis down beat him and did not make it into Eric Anderson twenty or thirty one hundred and Seventy five yards passing no touchdowns three picks who\nIn rock on the other hand for touchdowns no picks for him ESPN executives have to be looking at that when I say we've made a terrible mistake scheduling that game that was based on last year the Buffalo Bills being a playoff team and everybody should have known better they were not going to come on\nNow six one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight by Joe is in Worcester which I'm Joe\nA bagel nobody ever talks about the

I got to admit though was and I like Trump around a lot I think he's been a great job this year I don't think a little backwards anywhere near a hundred percent\nNo he wasn't playing as normal amount of snaps he was on one leg but okay you know you didn't really\nReady to really deal with much pressure on the left side an credit to lead role model in for um why am I trying to like you I Want to say Malcolm rather than you want to say markets can markets can and thank you yeah so we had remodeled spot duty today so good for him the one guy that if you want to get on that had a bad day and the office of one\nName of the interest 'cause there was pressure coming up in the middle there was a there are a couple of places where\n... in a little uh Atta Boy yeah so I you know he had a decent day but I feel like that front for Chicago is their strength of their team yeah definitely it's it's the best part of their team it was tough and I feel like that sort of showed up\nEven though the patriots as a team put together more than a hundred yards a hundred and eighty yards rushing as a team some of that was white late in the game I think that\nYou look at the way they ran the ball than it was it was tough going up front in the run blocking\nEspecially when you're growing up against guys when it came Hicks white miss so so much that I Wish that that's the one that got away from me in terms of military personnel moves here in the last couple of years but yeah the strength of that front and they did a good job patriots off in the world that\nAre pretty good job you want to be with his mom and Chicago didn't you know that money trumps everything of course it does it send are more expensive cards center on the trip\nShould still be here who did you move to Boston you know if you really feel like it whether it's basically the same bomb cyclone Savage seven seven night zero Ninety eight by mark in the car or raises a good point Marc when he got\nYeah today doing well thank you\nI'm sure it applies though that you know it's a way of getting it back five yards in the five Christian or that they took\nThe time out and said it didn't really make a lot of sense and in hindsight mark you look at it now and now that you know what happened which was you know the puck going into the end zone\nIt immediately gone I mean like you don't know why maybe we could have backed them up five yards and that's not in the end zone\nThere were a couple of things so that you know that's a good second guess and the other thing I Would get on there which is on today is we're was Jason ... what it was so Jaycee Jackson ultimately end up having a good pick but up until that interception believe the some of the second half late he was an ... he was a a flag waiting to happen like it just felt like um oh was too big\nFor young player and there wasn't much Jason ... more in the second half but that was when Jesse Jackson came out so what what was the decision making behind that\nBecause I'm a ... he's been the better one\nYeah I don't know what to tell you what to say about that a Carol is on the cake Carol\nHey thanks at a little bit and light yeah I think he had a couple of pretty still plays\nA we totally agree with you we talked about them early in the show\nI I'm Sorry\nOh don't worry about it it's okay but I agree with your point a very critical and is going to be even more critical to ... if if they don't have Sony Michel going forward\nI think he was terrific at the end and he was just great what they need and and yeah it's going to be going forward so Scott thank God\nI just thought that the overall I worry about the workload other than that James light might be the most reliable player not named Tom\nBrady on that often yeah and you know what I think he's already having a better season this year and when he had a year ago well he was ... I don't I don't know how healthy was was yeah and I who were who does know he knows yeah the rest of us don't but he's definitely having a better season than he did it you know to\nUm the workload is important though to the thing we were discussing earlier this even though he may not be used in all the same scenario is you'd see Sony Michel being used being the guy who's running between the tackles and as being your guy you're early down back when you're running the football\nHe's maybe going to be used he's going to be the big game plan might change a little bit if they don't find justice suitable guy that they can trust running the football yeah trust is a big part of this team if they can't find that guy and they're using white more even if it's\nSeven eight snaps the game more than that adds up right yeah adds up over the course of the season and today late and you know the guy that they could trust to take care of the football and grind out some clock and that guy was white because they trust them\nIt wasn't Kenyan barter wasn't known was no it was James White and even right there just think of those situations\nYeah and the cumulative effect of that and all those hits like that that was at a specially if you get into December and that's\nRhode Island's number one border you are is setting the standard again and again for borders over one hundred brand new border states for just one twenty nine Vermont that's like one twenty nine promote flood of every dollar every option and everything you're looking for like four dollars or\nSix or seven seven seven zero Ninety five you're on the job market Richard Gere Joe ... coming up next I'm sure it's not about sports radio that\nRussia's haven't grab the midfield offers waking up ... up Russia's isn't for lunch dinner and late night catches Wednesday's four dollar\nWith music but DJ for young Thursday's three thirty foot injury thirty five families\nCollege game day even better watch\nSeconds\nMidfield online at ... dot com thinking\nAbout taking your kitchen or back to the next level think about Cumberland kitchen adapt design center mended road Cumberland while other designed centers eat their designers and their house ... kitchen and bad to send\nTheir designers scene you to visualize your new kitchen about your design experience occurs in your home every project starts with your idea and the design fits your needs and budget it's\nNot just the finished product it's about the experience getting their ... kitchen about design center Cumberland kitchen dot com messaging data ...\nLadies and gentlemen this may be the last time you ever have to worry about hair loss because bosley is the real deal\nThey're getting women and men their hair back permanently there real hair all it takes to get started as a single text message you'll get an absolutely free information kit and a free gift card when you text great to eight five eight five zero bosley will show you for free how great your hair could look\nYou'll also see for free why you're losing hair and how to get it back women and men all over the country trust badly because they're America's number one hair restoration expert ahead of the curve with the latest technology\nAnd the best part bosley has permanent solutions to hair loss you'll love what they'll do for your hair\nSo drop what you're doing long enough to send a text get your free information kit and gift card for two hundred and fifty dollars off by taxing great to eight five eight five zero don't forget that G.
