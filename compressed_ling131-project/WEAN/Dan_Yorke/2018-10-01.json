Iran WPRI oh hello\nHi Dan for taking my call you that\nUm I Would say what I heard from Senator flake what also shocking but also the opportunity for\n'em maybe can benefit where I think it makes clear that term on that would allow for senator here to do what's right as opposed to just going but the party their case for the party line\nAnd I and in that sense is that a trauma lemon and now we can because mine and do the right\nThing yeah that's interesting I'm\nClose to ... who ... the force to be reckoned here uh the the forced to be reckoned with here is it\nIs it the elected types that you want to limit their terms or is it the constituents who's who was most interested in the divide maintaining\nWell I I don't you think that the the elected official they actually represent off I don't think there's so much by they represent what we produced we put them there is a reflection of our society and the way we are the way we have\nUm it's kind of like they're more of an output if at all\nAnd\nThey ... they have to tell the party line they have to fall in line with the leadership but as more independent grows where term limits or when a person that that the end of the term they're able to speak their mind and do what's\nRight without having to follow a party line and I think what we're seeing that Activision it's so strange now that something's got raped that term limits would break that they'd also costs new blood to come and continually as opposed to this is that becoming trying to protect themselves\nYeah interesting John thank you for three dirty pero toll free one

because you know we live in Rhode Island about what you know you could never have another opinion on the way it works ... ... how can you look\nLike maybe you'd have to choose to wear a as a British successful governor and he's trying to buy you know he reaches out across the aisle and tries to do some things but you know they have an economic crisis there whereas we don't have that\nAnd ah I'm short you know and that may have something to do with it but if you look at some of the artist and take a long while we're not well\nYou know and I look at California Democrat ... horrible at New York Ron horribly all Democrat Chicago Illinois Democrat horrible I mean major problems you know what I'm saying\nI mean you don't hear much about Wyoming not the answer but I think it just seems that it's just so partisan across the country\nAnd when he was going to watch I I Do some traveling and I'm really kind of starting a stretch to the minute that here in Rhode Island and I got to be honest but that's not going to change in fact I I was going to start paying out earlier it was a great Peter said about having some people walking around and ...\nWe had a lack of the week before when the when Fleming rock shrimp pay\nOff the George I'm starting to lose you on to Ninety five it's a bad cell day but thank you for your thoughts really appreciate it more than ... pero toll free one eight hundred three to one of the parents have been signing stay over here too so I Apologize for that too by the way he was referring to Merrick Garland\nA an intention to the Senate nomination and he was talking about um rusty ...\nHello Dan how are you OK thanks\nSo I have a lot of the artist in sick right now on a actually a cable t._v. or cable news networks are they say their news but they really aren't political commentary a I have tried to listen to a\nMSNBC like am I really can't anymore they've gone so far over and I think they drive a a\nYou know the opinions are a lot a lot of voters and man which you know your eyes um you know the party's fallen in line with their voter\nYou don't see you don't see a symmetry between MSNBC and Fox on the other side\nOh absolutely absolutely I but I'm\nYou know if you if you step out of line with your party now you don't get any party money you get you can't get reelected and and if you step out of line with your party\nAnd you know Fox bad mouth to you because you've heard of the Republican Party or MSNBC bad mouth fear because you've fallen out of step with the Democratic party then you don't get reelected\n[noise] I I think there's I think there's some truth to that is the big question is should chicken or the egg is it the networks that or is it networks that reflects the pulse of of of the country or other countries is reacting to the polls so the broadcast you know it's I really I really\nThink the bride or you know in order to uh to keep their audience has moved further\nAnd further uh to the extreme and in order to keep their viewers\nAnd uh\nI like I said I used to be able to listen to a book that worked and get something from them now I find it\nVery very difficult to deliver the either one for any length of time\nMostly thank you for three nobody pure wrote to a free one eight hundred three two one WPRI is that a contributing factor I think one would have to say yes\nThere's no there's there's no doubt that the networks will convince themselves that they are doing a you know he's a search for truth or at least to offer\n[noise]\nI don't even know how to define exactly with the mission statements are of\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont flood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nAh ah\nIf you're looking if you're somebody who believes that there is perspective to be offered a buy multiples multiple sides or ... for multiple directions I hate to use the term sides because it feeds into the whole dynamic or a it is very\nTo get a consistent flavor\nUh on Fox of what\nYou might be reasonable than a Democrat or or liberal person thinks they're a they're in place is whipping posts but that's about it on the other side on MSNBC you know for I think a a significant amount of their programming same holds true\nAh\nAnd then CNN I think this is the best job\nShe'd end is the best job in the talking heads segments of trying to bring different perspective\nBut there's no doubt there's no doubt that their bias in the ... ... that that that they land in a in a in a more left to place\nThan this administration and or of course Fox News the question for us is how do we determine what the truth is and and what's and what's been lost I think is that stipulation\nFor the for the format of these broadcasts which are\n\nThey are for instance I'm looking at the wolf Blitzer right now\nBlitzer is a news guy\nWho facilitates conversation from talking heads so it becomes a news talk show and then you do a head count as to how you think the bias is coming through it's not\nIt's not the evening news the cable networks do not operate in the evening news format that at least NBC CBS and ABC still do that is not their brand that's not what they do so when we know pining is a central part of the product\n\nYou probably are going to find a brand lean and they have it\nAh Chris you under the bureau hello good afternoon they're gonna do it\nExtreme polarization as\nPeriodically appeared in our political history\nWe seem to go through it's cyclical a and we're certainly at\nThe apex of one of those cycles\nAre one of the show goes it comes on intractable stalwarts I you know I think what\nLike said on sixty minutes was heartfelt and all true accurate and you know 'cause the partisanship as evolved into\nPetty self serving hurtful\nWith sales of character political on it and within the geo hey if anyone is in lockstep especially that GOP I'm not saying that in case on the on the other side but if anyone isn't in lockstep with a ... ... what the hierarchy of the party wants right now\nUh then the power with in the caucus and their chair positions are all at risk and\nHe couldn't have said a lot of things about a lot of things exactly
