mean he would not come out against the power\nPlant Jessica has by and got but what I thought the grapevine I'm not going to say the gospel but the political grapevine up here in northwest corner and he was told back along not to get involved in the power plant fight if they wanted a political career\nLike any you know show Jessica with their\nMm [noise] well he may support the plan which is hard to do in hard to win an election with with with those who oppose it being so vociferous\nYeah well there's a difference in terms of ah you know political career and in position I mean if if he supports the plant\nBy the way this plan is going to be there's going to be decided by a statewide commission which is now suspended the situation and I'd like to be able to say that they're completely independent of the process but there's some pointed in between the timeline and schedule right now the the calendar in an election thing coming up it's it's it's quite it's quite apparent to me that [laughter]\n[laughter] the sighting commission is taking a little break now you know all of a sudden after the election and say oh southern commissions ... blah blah blah\nUm 'cause you and I were not born yesterday already said thank you for that for three eight zero toll free one eight hundred three two one WPRI email me and Dan is ... ... it was all sorts of reasons why the southern

Donald Trump back in July right was July was the one was the original when was the original ask\nIf you think we're going to get away without a without a conversation about Trump's sixty minutes thing last night you know everyone's job of sixty minutes I you know luckily I'm president you're not [noise] I mean that Trump\nI'm president you or not that's the theme of his entire presidency I'm president you're not\n[noise]\nAnd it was oh Trump goes wild on sixty minutes I didn't think so I thought well you know Lesley Stahl is one of the most overrated national correspondents we have in this country\nI mean she is she is she is just the junior varsity\nThey've got some good ones in sixty minutes but she's not one of them I mean it depends on the story she does a very good job in a in a thinking environment\nBut you know interviewing the president is not a sinking environment and it's it's a it's a big prepared and get afterward environment\nI mean she's not horrifying she's just I just I like three times as my wife because we were watching it together for about three times doing that thing last night\nBut oh God listening really look at what they really oh God was really as far as the president was concerned that the same old shenanigans so I don't think it was a bad you know and she's trying to nail him on the you know you're pledging not to end the Mueller investigation he won't do it you know in his defense why would they do that\nI mean he's been playing this thing that we all owe a Trump plugged Trump avoids\nPledging to not to end more investigation Trump just didn't want to tell you that and you didn't get an exclusive and so you'd journalistically twist that that's not a fake news but that self\nSelf engage shelf objective\nNews that you'd like that that I\nTo break something and you didn't help me break it in so guess what you didn't answer the question probably that's come on that's been there done that and you you're playing with a little bit of\nA poetic license CBS ... or so that's my evaluation the sixty minutes thing um did he have good answers on this\nA terrible story the Washington Post journalist who lost his life in Turkey that the Saudi Arabian constantly you know and his answers today I don't think of a whole lot better salaries by the way going to turn that thing into whoops I don't know how you ... what the hell they did\nI'm not sure that conversations really marketable here 'cause I don't think enough people are paying attention to it but the national media is for good reason\nThat's a security problem it's a serious serious security\nProblem what American journalist or or or people who are working for American journalist against these and who are authorized to be here and live here uh end up with that kind of demise\nThat is a serious serious dilemma in this country has but on a slightly lighter note this is what the president said a while back I won't\nDollars for your favorite charity\nIf you
