I gave you ten percent of the Hillary voters those are ten ... ten percent of very confused people that want to vote for the co chair of the Trump campaign after they voted for Hillary Clinton just two years ago\nAnd you still don't get there so if you take the votes equally Joe like you said Neal sound bite you don't get their Jonathan style the broadcast from Tim and Jonathan you're on the day and your show with John Laughlin\nEdge on our everybody great thanks how are you [noise] good though I I never know cows in Pennsylvania\n[laughter] what do you know about politics [laughter] but\nWhat I Do know um I I actually the river but I grew up in it so um I Can't vote in the election\nUnlucky you huh [laughter] I don't write [laughter] but anyway\nThat a lot better early I I Know it's part of it will copy go Joe ... not even a part of the conversation at All right Alex wrong I mean\nEveryone that I see everyone I talk to you all that I I don't think we're ...

what's going\nOn now that are really at you and I mean the Garden State voted for the presidential election I mean they're just they're just they're mostly she they're just going to go where they go with you know what their what\nTheir gender to daddy let me ask you this question do you envision anyone that you know in your circle of friends who voted for Hillary Clinton caffeine you vote for the

Subaru all have in common they are all in for ... for your own condition and blood for Denise religion they're against it that's right over two hundred and three on cars all ... all models had incredible prices log on to flood Otto John John now\nLikely scenario would they not even most likely a likely a possible link I sound like I'm turning into Hank Kimball again [laughter]\nKind of a possible scenario that is incredibly optimistic for Joe trailer or right and then this incredibly optimistic\nJoe drillers get sixty percent of everybody who voted for Trump in the twenty sixteen election sixty percent that six out of ten say you know what we're with Trump and in this scenario I'm Gina Raimondo gets eighty percent of those votes\nUm which is likely just well I mean it's likely that she's going to get eighty percent of Hillary voters um and so that leaves forty percent brown and fun and under the scenario\nFrom beat sound fun but get screened thirty one to forty six and General Motors reelected now if you take those thirty one right in and this is this is that you can't win and it's a fifty fifty raise\nThose Trump voters if ... even a fraction of the mill much larger fraction of them go to phone\nThen phone beats Raimondo\nAt like forty eight forty four I mean it's just math it's not hard anybody can do it with a pocket calculator but you show me I I Want to hear from one to Hillary Clinton voter out there\nAnd don't make somebody don't make it up but as an actual real Hillary Clinton voter who's excited about voting for the co chair of the Trump presidential campaign joke trailer I Want to hear that voter\nAre because I'm telling you they don't exist\nNow and they might not like Hillary but they ain't going to vote for the guy who was the chair of the Donald Trump campaign in Rhode Island a coach and so I co chair of the Donald Trump campaign in Rhode Island they're just not going to do it [laughter] so we're those boats go they either a stay home\nThey really don't like Gina they both round phone that's where those boats go and so I was being incredibly optimistic in in just given Gina eighty percent of those votes\nI just it's an incredibly optimistic but any way you run the numbers and I ran the numbers a bunch of ways um there's no path to victory for Joe ... and I'm not trying to tell you don't vote for Joe ... if you like the guy by all means go in the polls and vote for Joe ... but when\nI Am telling you is don't go into the polls and vote for Joe ... with the expectation that he's going to be governor because he's not he's not going to be governor is just the it's Matt there's not there's no way around it and I've run the numbers sixteen ways to Sunday there's no way around it and and the shape the scenario doesn't work\nThe Healy scenario I Love when people say well what about Bob healing whereabouts popular popular get twenty two percent of the vote last time I checked you don't get to be governor was twenty two percent of the vote unless it's like an Eighteen way race that's not happening either\nSo you need the in the ... the scenario for reasons that we discussed earlier is unrealistic a link shape eat his father was John JV he got a lot of votes in in places like little Compton in Barrington in Republican strongholds like east Greenwich\nBased on the fact that his father was John shaping these served as the United states senator and he was kind of a Rhode Island household name that's why you got those votes\nAnd he was running to the left of a guy who was perceived to be a diner which is a Democrat in name only in Frank Caprio\nThey thought Caprio was too much of a Republican\nAnd so that's how he was able to speak in by the way in a four way race not a three way race a four way race with thirty eight percent of the vote Joe ... in my most optimistic scenario gets to thirty one percent not thirty eight percent in a three way race\nSo what am I missing for three eight nine

comes up at thirty one percent ... forty six percent Alan from your twenty two point nine percent so and he's a smart guy and he knows how to do math\nUh but I don't know what he's ... he's looking at a but I basically took his own words if he draws from from Allen phone enjoy and Gina Raimondo equally he loses he loses\nIts math is not hard or let's grab a Kenny inward you've been holding for a

mean that's why I say I went I wouldn't like twenty feet out on a ten foot board to try and make that the numbers more favorable to Joe ... and that's the best I could do\nWell drilled furloughs shortly has a ... will be cut a lot of self confidence [laughter] and yeah he he I'm sure he does not proceed his campaign has quixotic I Believe in the back of this law and he probably thinks he actually\nCould now with no you know he doesn't there's no way I sat next to show for six years in the house or you know three days a week for you know three or six years\nAnd I can tell you you know do he's a pragmatist ease you should be he's always been a number of guy he knows he cannot win this race he knows it then so why do you think he's not taken contributions from anybody\nBecause it would be wrong to do that try and write them a check for a hundred bucks you refuse it because he doesn't want you mad at him after he loses\nHe's not liking contributions not because he some big house who was the guy keep in mind 'cause this is the guy who took contributions his whole political career\nRight now all of a sudden know fundraisers no political donations all because I'm a I'm putting myself because I don't mean to the people know is because I don't want to look you in the eye after I'd blow this thing and and make you feel bad he wrote me a check for a hundred bucks\nThen John why so venomous towards more fine\nBecause he wants to take phone out you know these are you [noise] that's the the sixty four thousand dollar question\n[laughter] you know that's a good question\nThere's news today that he that religious loners campaign another and it's I'm getting this from ... to give a you know credit where credit's due he's doing himself another two hundred and Twenty one thousand dollars and I explained what that means when you loan your money campaign or can't your loan your campaign money right\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln if there were against it funds parallel luxury him ... his\nAmount and it's called loan repayment\nSo don't be fooled by this two hundred Twenty one thousand dollar loan that he made to his campaign look at what he spends right he's never going to spend that to let me tell you another thing I Know about George ... having sat next to me is as frugal as the days long\nAnd you know and he he homes Nichols around like they're manhole covers he's never going to spend that two hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nThat money will be coming right back into his account November night trust me for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WBFO let's grab Larry in Lincoln Larry you are on the ...\nAre you doing I'm\nActually all your conversation about the governor's race is white noise\n[laughter] okay well I'm [laughter] that would have been described as a lot of things is the first time anyone caught me white noise I kinda watched by that\nI don't have a dog and the rate I'm an independent I could care less about the governor's race actually it'd be nice here when so she can lose another billion dollars my I'm warm or as a matter of yellow no one talks about Matty yellow it like he is being or the\nGovernor's race distraction any noise about\n... you had such a lot of the oxygen out of the room um yeah he's got a tough fight against the fries you know don't forget he only beats the price by ... votes with the right in the mail in any work demands pretty hard and so he's gotta fight\nOne of the only state that no matter what the governors that it just goes back to the to the capital and then they just over a writer or or am you know\nSo well you say that but I mean in in many cases you know 'cause I was there during the Republican administration um and you take the speakers were kind of selective on their veto override they didn't override everything because they knew they couldn't get everything now and they didn't they they really don't like that perception\nThat they're running the state and the governor is not even though we all know that they do where do they they are very selective on that and I'll give you an example where the during the could cheery administration um they passed a bill that would basically take all of the home daycare workers\nThat get any sort of state subsidies so in other words if you're a mom and you get a state subsidy put your kid into daycare and you go to you know your aunt's house and you drop off the kid and that kid receives the state money\nThey had to ... to make all of those in home daycare people state employees and put them in the pension program right that that's a real bill and it passed and passed both houses in could cheery vetoed it not once but\nTwice and they never dared override it they literally wait until ... going to do that [noise] um\nSo you use it as a Republican governor you can you you can at least stop things for a while [laughter] so there is something to do it\nThe thing about it all is all our money goes to the general part and it just disappears and that's why in this state is such a sad sack of road\nAnd all the letter how many calls they hold up it's going to go to the general fund and they'll be everything's being eight in for the wrong purposes and it's not being used correctly\nWell there's a lot to that there's a lot going on there Larry thank all of the race that al\n... and I'm Out of here and I go home\nThey don't learn Lincoln and I grew up in Lincoln in line rock your me with ...\nYeah I'm I'm In the greatest it\nAll right I Know where that is you're that's right around the what's the other side of angel road\nTo me it's a great place 'cause I I'm going back where I'm from where you from all y'all can be treated the same way though where are you from originally like your\nChild graduated with honors did they get free tuition\nAt foreigners at wished it none of this race\nYou know that's not ... you get something for it but that's the Lowry style that rewards ... that's not fair share of the brain when you're going to utilize what we get you know that's not fair\nThank you for the call appreciate it for three eight nine ... is it would that make sense\nHaving a merit based scholarship you know based on your class rank and but if they're going to school\nBut that doesn't accomplish other things that they want to accomplish that's as far as I'm going to go with that when and stay employed four three nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI that is the toll free number\nThe thing is ... and I I I Will tell you this if you feel like you've got to like Martha I Need this friend of mine Martha she's a big time political operative hum has been in South county has been to every convention that you could ever imagine and Mars is a great person\nAnd she's a big Trump voter and and and I would say this Steve Martin and not Trump voter while she was a big Trump orders he was at the\nConvention but she's ... supporter and big thrill a voter\nAnd I would say this Steve Martin the if you got to vote for Joe ... if you want to vote for George Miller knock yourself out enjoy I have a great time go color and the little old will do you
