B. R. O. rewind featuring interview an hour and a few laughs along the way\nDinner gossip is a a labor attorney who is usually a management side works for cities and towns all over Rhode Island is considered an expert in this field or just curious about\nThe validity in the the legality of site agreements and and then I I was considered just side agreements just to be completely just by their nature invalid but you're saying side agreements happened as long as they're ratified than they are part of the contract and you're good in this you know the name that you know\nIt's it's just a description if you will but aside agreement is a collective\nBargaining agreement it's\nMade between a representative of the union representative of the minutes out\nIt's just usually doesn't happen in the beginning when the entire contractors decided to just how it might have happened to be in terms or something like\nThat yeah what they call and the executive oriental middle income kinds they arrived but again it's got to be ratified\nThat isn't ratified at the ballot subject collective bargaining\nRight and so if it's not ratified but yet carried out as if it had been and somebody finds out about it what\nSort of relief or or recompense Kan city get from people who have been collecting money supposedly illegally\nOr a couple of I heard about on the fences defending agree then that\nAllegedly arise from Riley side agreement so cool site uh granted it has an affirmative defense\nSide agreement is invalid and on and force in terms of any uh any other remedy about him may have\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's bring me a luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit line of of Lincoln MTC Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the only twenty eight gene Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of never against such funds here alone luxury impeccable\nFi or they may be claims for rest the tradition for unjust enrichment of certain employees under the terms of the agreement [noise] um and other forms of relief but that would be dependent upon the nature of the side agreement that particular facts\nSo if you somebody you know since I was in the case of war but if somebody was found to be getting an extra payments for something that was done in a sign agreement was ratified and they have to pay that back individually\nIt's possible that the possibility that could be a claim made for restitution that the the the uh cash conversion if you will of leave to uh\nTo body was a maid pursuant to unlawful agreement than unjust enrichment would serve as a basis to recoup some of that money\nIf you have people who are in political positions or appointed positions who are\nYou know fire chiefs who are on this key any any collective bargaining agency ... negotiated between the city in a collective bargaining agency who knowingly get into an agreement that they know was not\nValid because it was ratified and executed anyway\nAre they criminally liable have they are they committed a crime at that point\n[noise] well\nThat's a pretty that's a pretty broad state and it would again be driven by the facts whether or not somebody who knowingly and willfully entered into an unlawful agreement a to derive money or obtained money under false pretenses or to\nA steal money in some way under the construct of aside agreement\nThere's always that possibility\nWhat I find in my practice is that oftentimes municipal officials may good faith mistakes and those mistakes that based on ignorance and I use that word in the sense of it's a\n... not knowing what the law is a there's some belief out there that aside agreement can be made at any point in time during the life of a of a collective bargaining agreement and if the union\nAnd a manager agree upon it it's somehow a enforceable and that's why when I give presentations to the league of cities and towns and I speak to elected and appointed officials I remind them\nThat they should always consider whether or not the subject matter is that they are negotiating I read the mandatory or premise a lawful or unlawful whatever agreements they strike be sure that those agreements are presented to the proper corporate authorities within them in his ...\nOtherwise the agreement is voice I'm going to give you one example\nCan I just say one real quick to think to you I I I Know you're being you're a lawyer and you have to be exact and your speech and you have to be exact in you and your\nUm in the possibilities whenever speaking about this when I see more blunt well just I'm just seeing as an observer as somebody who's seen this I find it wholly unbelievable that any fire chief\nOr any cheap any department or any solicitor for anybody who's the head of a union who are pretty much experts in the stuff that they use it all the time anyway could ever get into his side agreement and ... and not know that ... doesn't have that has to be ratified that's that's beyond my my my belief\nI mean how can I can see why you hold that believe yeah uh I can tell you that I have seen people that\nAre completely ignorant or to what should be done now whether or not people are acting in various ways uh you know again that that's dependent upon the particular circumstances but\nMost of my clients are sensitized to the to the fact that they don't strike deals unless they follow the proper process and I'm certainly these questions of bound in the in the war were sick leave grievance and\nUltimately the greed that's process will play that out but\nYou know a unions have very crafty ah about sidestepping if you will uh the the formalities of ratification and uh you know one case\nI had in Providence involved the so called minimum staffing provision communications division I couldn't find anything in the main collective bargaining agreement about minimum staffing put dispatchers\nAnd when the case was being ready for ... and I show up at the operation and learned that the union had a Nineteen and\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition I was born in east religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models at incredible prices log on to flood Otto John job now\nTo agree to minimum staffing in the\nEarly this bad operate\nAnd of course my reaction was Nineteen and a half years old even if it was a ballot collective bargaining agreement and even if it was Balad as having ratified collective bargaining agreements limited to three years in theory right\nWell yeah I have a trader wound up and forcing that related award and I went to Syria court justice ... Cheney very wisely vacated the ... and the union asserted that well we make the time that's part of our living relationship with the city and stipulated award\nAdjusted salad named collective bargaining\nTo which the judge responded well that really put any city in town at a disadvantage holiday to design whether or not the right and ... and where they where they maintained and was it stipulated arbitration or whatever blessed by the city council\nThey're not gonna run to the news running up against time thank you for for clarifying all that much you could open ... thank you ... never going to talk about this we come back\nFrom the seas gave Christmas Day cold weather center here's your exclusive your weather forecast\nClouds in some study break today to hire fifty six mainly cloudy tonight a bit of rain later on low forty one tomorrow periods of rain and result in the morning and in the early afternoon type to fifty seven with WPRI most exclusive accuweather meteorologist see Travis\nAccuweather on the voice of southern New England news talk Ninety nine seven of him and I am six thirty WPRI\n\nHi Kevin Mahoney here with New England truck solutions north Smithfield too proud to say that when New England industry leader and detailed production insulation in\nFor a true one stop shop because we all aspects of the job without having to outsource any ways\nSpecializing in vehicle rats asleep changes\nAnd one of the few African companies in New England that off the highly acclaimed three M.

I was a an order thing for him to perform in order to also\nSo that there probably will be a the results of two ... two orders pursuant to this particular issue both in calculation and I would think you know the manner\nIf for whatever reason we find out that there was improper payment made these firefighters for for sick time will you seek restitution from them\nWell Matt it it's tough to say at this time simply because um that would be reaching a conclusion a conclusion that I cannot make at this point we're not having all the facts before me if there's a ... it's\nNot just a numerical number or that there are other factors involved relative to legality and I wait the findings of the APA trader and and now they want to paint any finding our of our ... hypothetical actions based on a finding a\nAre you going all over again would you support an advocate for these order to be made public\nOh I did there's nothing or listen as far as I'm concerned it all documents should be public accepts something that are that are related to things of that nature Mm that an individual uh is entitled to their privacy for right but uh [noise] you know\nI I I Am all for open government and you know\nI Know there's a question about there being a non disclosure thing with the audit firms where they can't disclose this stuff so I mean\nWell well maybe there's a non disclosure\nAh ah I don't know what the nondisclosure agreement may be but uh I Would say that uh that may be be between the parties that commissioned the audit\nBut I think the party that receives the audit enjoys the benefit of the results of those are still whoever wants to see them otherwise what's the purpose of an audit right\nI mean to keep it private and then I thought it would make any sense right\nWhat is the right so if what if you find that there is a you know there's there's evidence that this was wrongly given out to firefighters for whatever reason will you then seek for either state police or some law enforcement agency to figure out who made the deal how we're against against city law\nWell you know the thing is this going out for a legal enforcement of such a thing in a criminal nature ah requires intent if there is criminal intent involved\nIf it's a civil nature there's a different way to approach it for restitution and I can't I Can't make a conclusion on either side of that without seeing all the facts and the results with those facts as they come back\nRubber that's what I mean I I I Can't commit to you know we're going to hang everybody higher I Can't commit to we're going to get all that money back\nAgain um you have to look at a uh all factors to recipients participation or the intent of individuals' there's there's many many\nAs you expect to get the evidence of intense from an audit\nI Know but that would probably uh I I Would think that the any findings of a um\nArbitration would give you some factual information that if there was any indication of some sort of malicious intent\nOr are you know criminal intent or something of that nature ... that are at that point the responsible parties would turn that over to legal authorities for for a summit late you know as a criminal thing right but you can't\nYou proceed on hypothetical basis what if what you know I might buy a mega million tickets and I went on you know I I don't know what number I'm going to play right but I'd like to win it yeah\nI just think that you know just knowing where your mindset is going into and what you're predisposed to do is important for people to know because I think it's a big issue somebody's making side deals that somebody's going to pay for ...\nAnd you know something I I'm all for equal enforcement I'm all for equal treatment I'm all for open government I'm all for disclosure but I cannot reach a conclusion on any issue until until I have all those facts before me Mary and when I Do when I Do you ... you will be you'll hear me loud and clear\nAlright man I Know you're gonna run because I'm up against or two in the limited time thank you for coming on it because you look forward to doing it again thank you\nNews talk six thirty in Ninety nine seven W.
