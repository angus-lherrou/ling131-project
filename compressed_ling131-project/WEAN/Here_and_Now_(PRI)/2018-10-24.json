all have here and we gotta we gotta remind ourselves of that and I don't know if we have those if we have enough of those right\nNow I don't know that's what I'm asking you\nAre the reason why I'm Talking about this is 'cause listen I don't know what these ... suspicious devices um are ... who's with the most motivated descending of them I don't know that we can pin this on today's political

probable I doubt it\nBut you know\nThis is what I'm Talking about we're in a time where nothing is believed to nothing is real everything is mediated through your point of view and your language and everything else and so there's no reality that we can all base our discussions on so how does how does a house divided against itself stand\nHow does it happen\nWhat do we do this is why I constantly bemoan by the way the politicization of everything because politicians ... they will um\nThey will make their own reality they'll miss so we see it right now in our gubernatorial race I mean governor ... campaign is is I mean king of this\nOf taking reality and massage and get into something that it's not\nA you know focusing on one small aspect\nIs the biggest part of something they distort

six week yeah so that's why I\nI fear that we're going down that road\nAh we we haven't gotten to the level of violence yet but that could be the next step so\nYeah and it seems to me that we have this weird um you know some people have pointed out to to to a philosophy that's existed specifically on college campuses and through academia this post modern philosophy this oh yeah you know this idea that that everything is a construct there is no reality there's only perception of reality and therefore\nUm you know your your ... your ... there's no nothing real and so deconstructing reality\nUh and looking at everything through a power lead power lands he's the right way to look at society and I see it everywhere once you learn about this was kind of like seeing the matrix of the

have to take a step back and look to our values and I think the first value is\nThe worst of our growth and what made America great was individuals or the rights and responsibilities or the individual\nAnd we need to get away\nThis notion that the political parties have become our religion our our our our source of support and yeah and and and strength you know and and and if both

than\nYou know it just ... our crab has nothing to do with a traditional has nothing to do with American exceptionalism has nothing to do with what made America great\nAnd it's almost like a political

I think the value system you're talking about the about individual rights in judging people on the individual achievements and whatnot is really the key here I think I I\nDon't think anybody can realize how much that's a bedrock of of the the enlightenment ideas that led to the the the American dream\nI'm just it's just true Georgian grandson George Ron WPRI George\n... good I'm not a I'm a train of thought on the opinion that a lot of what you're talking about it they're all they're all a result so one thing I think that's the thing\nIt's the talk of the mainstream media that

right\nEverybody can talk about how terrible it is and how the rhetoric getting out of control in this country but it usually comes to the tail somebody getting shot or bombs being mailed to somebody else but then in the meantime in the in between time when it comes time to do a rally or to have a debate\nOr the train delineate yourself from the rest of the people in your in the in the uh in the race or in the the political field\nUh everything's fair I mean literally a you know you can say that and it's great and Donald Trump it's amazing to me that the one that the media um I remember the journalist was they said that\nBut it just it they they showed their their inability to see a common reality on a regular basis it's I don't I don't know if it's intentional if it's just the perspective you can't get out of your own way um you literally had\nYes Donald Trump said that like he likes the guy that can body slam somebody because of the congressional Kennedy was stumping for was ah was accused of assaulting we're pushing a reporter\n[noise] um but at the same time you had Eric Holder telling people to kick people the other day Maxine Waters to tell people to confront them in the streets and there have been people calmness and liberal newspapers all over this country advocating for that and things not bad thing to do you've had you had Hillary\nClinton saying you can't you know we have to win this election then we can be civil again until then don't be civil you can't say one second that we need to all be Americans to be together and disagree sibling and then at the same time not act that way\nWhen it's when it's convenient see this is why\nThese these political tribes that we we have now started to treat the garlic pet Ford called the other religion um have got

is the place\nTown halls in churches used to be with the American in religious institutions used to be with the American heartbeat was now it's on Twitter where where where people with anonymous uh uh you know anonymous people can can lop all kinds of ridiculous allegations and it becomes reality because they said so\nThis is not the way you want to live folks\nBut then you have people out there who are your date who were raised like me on phenomenal movies like red dawn and actually want to see it happen I you know I don't know why I don't know why\nI don't know why\nBut they're hoping for some kind of a civil war I I don't get it I don't know why you would hope for that the only way\nYou sit there and look at the glorious and this that we have in the United states of America on so many levels and the basic foundational a building blocks of life that you don't have to actually sit and think about on a daily basis\nLike other countries do and\nActually sit around and think about how terrible we have it or not to the point where are we have to destroy institutions that keep those things there are ... is beyond me I I really don't get it\nI don't get it\nThere's no respect for the overall history of the world and the thought process ease of many Americans who will sit there hold a device in their hand that contains more technology than has ever existed on planet earth and any other time combined\nInformation and\nThere are nations where women can't even go out and public unless they're covered from head to toe that just recently got to get the right to actually drive K

I mean it's unbelievably stupid\nBut\nThis is what drives are putting these minority cuckoo's are the ones that are driving the political boat right now they have power they promote themselves to the point where they have a big influence and there can be contended with so we have tiny little minority people\nYou know ideas I should say not even people people with tiny little minority of ideas that are that they think that there are valid having big giant voices what's the cartoon they used to exist if you're reminds me of it's like the it's like the the wizard of Oz\nThey social media and the and the and the Internet allow for these people to be like as\nGreat as it\nEvolves right the big plumes of smoke and fire the big green head on every fears and shakes but in reality they're all standing behind that little Twitter accounts with like five other people going yeah we're gonna be um my son\nListens to a podcast called the story podcast and there's a there's a there's a story about this cave in animals I Want to go into the cave but there's this big voice that comes out of it and says they sing a song\nOn the menu legged legend the jungle jog or not it's in my head all the time and it's all about this big voice and then eventually if you call that voice out guess what guess was making the sound a little tiny little cricket or a little bug\nThat's with these extremists out their little bugs and they got big voices thanks to social media and they have taken over the conversation\nAnd politicians know that the politicians know that if you can pit people against each other the little bugs against\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine promote flood as every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nMotivate people with the with the threat of the bugs that just bugs man people going around and talk about the patriarchy the bugs\nPeople running around and talking about conspiracy theories and and nonsense\nTheir bugs they're bugs they must be treated as such they must\nBe ... we must remind ourselves that the bugs don't run the place\n\nAnd ultimately and when we stop and say you know enough with the bugs and people on both sides of the aisle who share your political spectrum room with their version of the bugs when they tell the bugs to go be quiet and go back ... under the rock from once you came then maybe we can have some semblance of normalcy that we where we can actually uh you know\nGet to work here barbers more Barbary WPRI Barbara\nThat um I guess I Am really enjoying the show um snake so much and I wish more people would listen to you but\nOn the voice of reason Barbara you need to tell everybody that\nYou know [laughter] I Love the way it's written\nNonsense on time 'cause that's what it is\nIt's not that\nThey're I mean as a as if life doesn't contain enough controversy and enough suffering we have to fabricate our own we have to make some up we have to create and racism or racism doesn't exist because there's not enough real racism up there\nWe don't have to worry about we don't have to contend with real sexism are real issues of inequality we have to make ones I get out I mean come on ...\n... exactly and I read something today and it is true this is really bad but uh you know all of these bonds that was the theory team yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "24"}
