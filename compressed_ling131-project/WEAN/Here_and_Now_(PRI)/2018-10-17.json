when you live at\nYou know I said it's all the time before when they when the mayor was pushing this this city councils pushing this community safety act which turned out to be with what's the name of that thing the province police public whatever the hell it's called now but you know that the essay was the original name for it the community safety act where police officers by the way in the city of Providence now don't want to do any proactive policing\n'cause every time you talk look at somebody a cross eyed you are low talked to somebody to write a report they're not going to just going to
