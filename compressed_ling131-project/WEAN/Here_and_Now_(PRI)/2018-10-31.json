yeah it's a problem but it was kind of reset here because I knew information you have today has to do with what we're trying and I would imagine you're trying to figure out\nUm the timeline here what exactly in terms of not just the time but the the exact um uh the veracity of the claim that this is the first the speaker heard about it and this march this march email\nI'm ... and it seems to me that you know this idea of text messages that you guys reporting on now is very much\nA would be very much I guess lean to that writers or is that what you're hearing\n[noise] yes um\nYou know I mean there are I talked with Dustin rap nearly all of whom are willing to put their name for their testimony\nHow would you like motor drenched twenty gene trucks will be here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eight gene for that one fifty ... for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for only a flood forward and he joined Narragansett\nHim that she was not satisfied uh with uh how you know ... yellow it handled her complaints and she still felt\nA you know not listen to you and that you know that the key Lynch and I think that has neat people you know people listening who got to understand is the state of is the rumor mill\nOn time mhm and you know there's a reason you're hearing other orders not just need a we've heard rumors about this situation for well over a year or two or more years but\nYou know good reporters don't report until we have on the record proof that something is happening and that was a high bar to fat which frankly why until I got the email that I didn't and recorded on Monday evening I had not recorded this more than anybody else\nUh I think the reason one of the reasons that so many people were abuzz about this was because it is widely was widely believed and there are lawmakers they have told me they have talked to get their indirectly who said she had text messages from people that corroborate the behavior she alleged and\nUm I think with out if if if she does have that proven again people posters a she died I admit I Do not have it myself um that uh\nYou know that would seem to be in her favor and that perhaps is why people are willing to be her allies are being for you know willing to go on the record and they write the lead her and you know it's really happened and uh it needs to be taken seriously\nAnd then the other situation is and I have to forgive me because I've read fifty reports on this today from a place\nUm I don't know if this is the first reported wherever there's out there this idea that the the speaker of the house of at first when he was asked by by somebody somewhere about whether or not to do after the ... and then whether or not he had any of the complaints of sexual harassment he said no\nUm and then yeah and and then I guess in a recently has acknowledged that there was one other situation besides just 'cause they're in one\n[noise] yeah his office is um his office seems to be as I understand it sort of distinguishing between being told about sexual harassment or\nA you know lawmakers saying they've been sexually harassed and what they call an official complaint um if not hundreds and clear to me what like it clearly they they do not counted theory email as an official complaint you know she couldn't documents sexual harassment but they don't see that special\nAnd that's like the Associated Press yesterday reported that they were told they Matty oh in March and April after a ... ... email had been sent to him so she had a sexual harassment or his office that they had never received any complaint sexual misconduct against\nLawmakers in two thousand eight\nAnd I've seen other reporters say they'd had conversation but they now wonder if they are really match up with what they were all the time and what we know now so I think there's a lot of people trying to gather a who knew what when and whether everyone was honest and forthright this'll\nYeah we're going to play games with definitions define official complaint defined sexual misconduct for sexual harassment define you know all these ... it's it's these words that people are not accurate with their words that they're not specific or they can play with them\nOr to mean you know specifically what ever they want it to mean at that time right so that's the game you have to play unfortunately because you you want to ask the question Seventy five different ways that way they can't wiggle out of the answers I hated it it it's\nIt's one of the great frustrations as a reporter is a you know you learn over time that\nYou have to [laughter] you know you ask me questions sort of in a normal human way right and you get an answer and then later you find out that a lawyer would be able to argue that you didn't ask you this way and therefore the you know the answer you got was truthful but he didn't get to the gist of what you're trying to find out and that's\nThat's off in one of those men maddening parts of being a reporter is you're constantly trying to make sure\nYou're not leaving holes in the way you ask the question that would let someone not tell you what what you're trying to get a you know\nYou're not the end of the day this is about to trying to determine whether or not Nick Matty yellow um enjoy first of all number one whether or not we have somebody who is in the state house who was a sexual harasser\nUh that's number one that's the most important thing I think um and then ... and number two whether or not we have leadership and the general assembly that allows him protects and does not take these complaints seriously deals with individuals I'm In an appropriate fashion that have been accused of stuff and and that's why everybody's trying to figure out here\nYeah and I think again I was the I think what I was gonna say when Nightline cut off and that was just I was surprised as a reporter when ... yellow took a chairman evil ... or ... people out as chairman a which would have been Monday evening Ninety minutes after my first story\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nHandled appropriately et cetera and\nYou know I did not report anything the speaker's office did not know it right or wrong on information already brought them that I end up\nSo you know the only thing that changed at six o'clock on channel ... on Monday Night and what I shared what I knew what the public eye and it wasn't a secret anymore and then ... to ... um you know like I\nSaid it's a great point you know it does have this this was the truth before you aired it\nBy the way this portion of our show sponsored by meeting street cafe if you're looking for good old home cooking on the east side of Providence main street cafe located right around the corner from the street they deliver and you can order online and meeting street cafe dot com here's the thing\nThere has got to be we we have this weird thing that's developed and I don't understand it or you know in a post me too I find the Post's me to enemy to era right\nThere's this thing that exists where um people there's a line that you have to that people have to to to tread where you don't want to\n[noise] you don't want to sound like you're trying to blame the victim of something right\nBut here's the tough part about that are out of\nThe desire to make it so that victims don't get victimized twice which is a noble\nGoal out of that\nHas come this idea that everyone is just automatically to be believed\nRight like it it it it's it's like we we we can't we can't deal in in rationality I don't know why but anyway\nIt's like you take this this concept of you know all victims are are telling the truth and you're completely throw presumption of innocence out the window it's taken a baby tossing out the window with the bath water it's bizarre and I don't know why anybody would do this we can there is a better way to do this\nHow about this all alleged victims must be taken seriously all legit victims must be taken seriously to determine what's going on to protect the rights of everyone had to get justice\nThat being said in order for that to be the case because the alternative has very dire consequences there's no perfect solution because the perfect doesn't exist\nThere's always going to be a downside and so ultimately we ... in order when you're trying to take on something and make it better the best way to do that is to try and do the least amount of harm as possible\n\nChange something in order to make ... so the change we need to make is that we need to take all a legit victims\nSeriously and at the same time what's that going to do is that's also going to require\nThat alleged victims have to be able and willing and have the personal fortitude to come forth and and tell everybody that they are 'til the appropriate authorities wherever that they are victims and what happened to them\n\nThis concept of you know nobody has to come forward and nobody has to tell us anything and nobody has to do those da da da da da\nDa na add\nThis to a political process right to at this at the context of this ... these are people that are not you know in a corporation someplace or in in the in the public eye you know because they're celebrities or something like that these are individuals that are serving the public\nThey have a they are set to certain standards that they they have to live up to certain standards have to deal with certain levels of public scrutiny because they are public officials and public servants\nThey do a very important job they have constituents that they have been they have uh gone out and try and convince to elect them to a position that allows them to go up and make decisions for them\nIn very serious manners matters excuse me in very serious ways so\nThere is a duty that's that is assume presume they shouldn't be assumed and should be a you know openly accepted\nThat ultimately what you do what you think your opinions on things um are going to be a serving a higher purpose than just yourself\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eighty four to one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at point forward and he joined Narragansett\nLevel of importance I'll start with the most important to the ... in descending order your eggs are all important but just one is more important either we need to know number one whether or not we have a sexual harasser that's elected to office\nIn the state house that's number one\nI'm Sorry that that might be uncomfortable for somebody that might be uncomfortable for people to know them that's got to be uncomfortable for a lot of people that person if they exist if that's true it doesn't matter who it is and this case it's the allegations against ...\nUm that has to be that the people of borrow bill where he represents and the people Rhode Island quite frankly deserve to know that\nThat that either happened or didn't happen next number one\nNumber two the people of Rhode Island also have to know whether or not their speaker of the house protects alleged sexual harassed there's even when presented with evidence or or at least a complaint of such sexual harassment or ... if you have to go to the presence of such a sexual harassment\nThat people Rhode Island need to know that the people have cranes didn't need to know that in district Fifteen\nAnd so you know there's ways we can learn about these things and and that's going to take somebody out there whether it's a represented ... or whoever who has been the subject of this kind of behavior\nUm or the victim of this kind of behavior to come forth and to tell the story\nAnd if it's bad enough to the point where you go to the speaker of the house over it than I Would say it's bad enough that the people the state of Rhode Island need to know about it um and need to be able to or I should say and I say no about it's not like the gossip mill\nThere needs to be a case presented\nA to say listen this person shouldn't be a rap anymore whether that's through an election or ruble process now what's interesting about this to me from a political point of view is that we had a commission that was put into place based on a vague allegation\nThat did wanted that that uh once again didn't want anybody you know nobody wanted to come forward about by representative tansy which got her\nA lot of political or a political support got her a lot of ... time in the in the limelight got her her commission and everything else but yet didn't come down to the idea or hold anybody accountable or provide any sort of justice for the people who are ... that that actually live\nIn the state of Rhode Island and our taxpayers in the state of Rhode Island so while she made out politically and got to have a commission I don't think any of that require or maybe the alleged the actually any of the um suggested a bills that were ... brought forth as a result of that commission went anywhere\nBecause it was like a dog and pony show\nBut not one of those bills that was suggested by that committee had anything to do with creating a constitutional\nAnd or you know public process or at least they a I should say public maybe an independent process to which people at the general assembly who are elected officials\nCould create some kind of thing to ... to levy these complaints and have them investigated that seems to me that at this point the the the law enforcement authorities and the only ones that can can go into this and if it's something that's happening on line through text messages and may fall underneath R. E. harassment\nLaws um you know things like that\nBut there was no mention of that and that's what's frustrating to me because it seems to me that the problem here\nIs not um\nIs not so much that you know the people in the public to Rhode Island don't have this thing covered and don't corporations and businesses don't already\nHave processes that are mandated by law and mandated by corporate mandate in league ... best legal practices but I Know sure as hell we have 'em here\nThat there aren't legal remedies legal avenues already existing in the private sector it seems to me the ... at the state house\nIs that you have a bunch of elected officials and and and that doesn't seem to be a vacuum of some kind of a constitutional process that uh that lawmakers can mediate or in or deal with each other when one of them gets on the line\nAnd there's nothing there's nothing like that suggested by there so it's like you know ... you know to go as a physician heel thyself\nGeneral assembly member take care of your backyard before you go after the public in the state of Rhode Island the same thing with Hollywood all these ... jobs in Hollywood they ... they they live in a demented place where where human beings are literally a commodities their bodies their looks their souls\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what for Denise religion they're against it that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood Otto John job now\nThat's the world operates in the same way they do they lose perspective\nYou know they think it happens everywhere 'cause it happens everywhere in their little corner of the world\n\nAnd so I you know I'm sitting here trying to blame any victims here I'm just saying that in a big boy in big girl world\nIf you want injustice to stop you have to stand up against it and if you don't want to stand up against it in a in a in a in to the level that it needs to be stood up to to make it stop then it's not going to\nAnd that's easy for me to say because standing up to power is hard\nStanding up the power is difficult standing but I'm telling you right now I Believe that in two thousand and Eighteen that somebody who has a complaint legs is against somebody that's an allegation like this has not only the benefit of the doubt\nBut a very uh ... historically the easiest road that's ever existed to get it\nRight so we'll talk about we come back for three eight oh you'll be all over the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI time for the one o'clock news on the mat Allen's show coming up next [noise]\nThe way from literally one solution studios away from the general election [laughter] news talk Ninety nine seven AM six thirty W.

Providence Don you're on WPRI Don\nI'm at I'm good how are you fantastic I have a question\nOn other human resource department in the states I mean I Know that\n... what do you mean human resource department or do you mean by that\nSomeone would that would have no complaints from the people\nWell aren't you talking about you're talking about I Would imagine there's a place there's a human resource type of person to go to if you work for the department of of of work for D. E. M. and you're a clerk there or something and then if you have a complaint you have a hierarchy to go to and\nYou can put a complain and there there's the um what's it called the human rights commission that people can go to the state humans right human rights commission that anybody can do to if they've been victimized like this so there's a law enforcement if depending on the on what what happens\nGenerally business\nManager doesn't handle these complaints on their what they gave it off to an independent group in this case\nBy case it would have been a human resource department they that's why you're taking the decision making away from the managers and supervisors going through somewhat independent\n... we'll see what you're talking about makes sense I think from a from a employee employer type thing you have to understand some of the general assembly is a very unique set of circumstances because\nI I understand yeah I understand that but there should be someone that they can go to other there this week or a charge yeah president charge dictates what's gonna happen right is and that's what the way it\nWell I you know what that would not have been a great thing for the commission that was that was that was given to a representative tansy to actually look at you know what do I do what is the Jim ... instead of going out there and trying to create\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the here for only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty so desperate for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at flood forward and eastern edge or Narragansett\nReduced to make Rhode Island less of a place where sexual harassment happened with the fact of the matter is it looks like the place the sexual harassment is happening and going unchecked is the general assembly\nSo what are we ... why do we come up with the process for the general assembly members an independent maybe this is a good checks and balances thing where the executive branch\nOr could be the ... the the the state police or the attorney general's office or something where they are called upon whenever there's an misconduct type of thing that's done here they come in they investigated they present they can't do anything about it unless there's criminality there but you know they say here's what happened they do the investigation they presented to the leadership and then there's the vote taken\nThat makes it right\nI have to get to the truth though Don it's not a fake it doesn't I don't think it has anything to do with you know the politics of it that's the problem\nI I as I say that I think Mr ... dropped the ball in March when they say the email is yeah it should have trust it then I may say that it came out for election but it didn't it came out in March it was it was out there and watch a good point everyone everyone knew it so it should have addressed it that\nThe public to know about it but people in the way he knew what was it right that they knew about it in the ...\nYeah and it's so now he's saying that you know that uh they they basically I mean I understand the point of not being able to move the legislation\nBecause people you know those those pieces of legislation are scheduled people take their time to come out and to testify for or against bills and so I get that part so they created a a workaround where he left the room and she came in to testify and blah blah blah but the fact of the matter is the doesn't take away would you just said\nThat this was going on and supposedly if you believe her email that\nYou know he's known about it for years\nAnd it's not exactly that's the case we should know about it\n[laughter] anyway oh yeah the ... that was going on right what does that happen in four years oh how you can tolerate something or yeah yeah I I couldn't as a manager I Know what I Would allow that to happen or you can you imagine what\nWhat was the issue here is you know you have to speak of the house that evidently if this if what she said is true and he says it's not true but if it's in terms of him knowing about sexual harassment before march ... um but even that but even the fact that you know he made a workaround but then when it became public\nThe Democratic party sent these mailers out to Republicans now why would they do that\nWell if asked [laughter] you know if asked\nWell we're we're tying Trump Detroit lower being negative against Joe trailer\nBut you said it to Republicans well we'll just being there will be some Democrats go too I'm sure there's like two Democrats out there they've got the damn thing but the fact of the matter is what the Democrats were doing is they're trying to create discord\nAmongst the conservative voters out there in this case where you know likely Republican voters and get them to you know take siphon votes away from Allan Fung and go for ... split the votes Gina Raimondo can get elected\nThat's what they're doing they are that they are the funk campaign is putting out this ah this this campaign finance filing that has basically the Democratic party in the state uh claiming mailers as an income contribution\nTo the Raimondo campaign so the the actual Democrats out there have said you know we we basically spent now according to this Providence journal story about this today a Patrick innocent writes that the um the ... the the state wide party which is basically the same thing is that that's the governor's campaign it's a bunch of horse manure\nI'm as had to claim on financial disclosure forms that they made a ... you know in ... contribution in other words we didn't give you money but we did something on your behalf that's has value to it monetary value\nAnd it was a mailer now why does a mailer\nCenter Republicans shake your job trailer shaking hands with the president and and and and linking him to President Trump benefit Gina Raimondo 'cause it splits other votes besides her voters or ... ostensibly tries to do that creates chaos on the other side\nNow whether or not no collusion between these groups and whatnot depending on the situation is obviously not it's not legal so now people are getting all these people in my Facebook page now Gina Raimondo gave a hundred thousand dollars to do the job troll oh no no\nThat's not what happened however now there's two things depending on your on your point of view one\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nMade a deal with Gina Raimondo to split the vote with Alan ... I don't\nDon't have any evidence of it you can build it as I think it's a a bunch of ... it's ... it's rumors it's nonsense I don't think I just don't think it doesn't make any sense I don't think that's true but some people believe it however that doesn't mean it's not that the the splitting of the voters in reality it absolutely is reality\nAnd the reality is that you know what ... does go to use and the Democrats will use every strategy that they can to make it so that she never Mondo wins the governor's race and letting the you know anti Gina vote out there be split a Sunday or by two different candidates makes it more likely that she's going to win\nAnd so when you read the mailer and you see it could be depending on your point of view the president it's either a negative joke trauma mailer\nOr it's a positive jokes from a mailer but it all depends on your point of view and when you said it to rip mostly Republicans you know it's going to be a positive Joe ...\nAnd it's going to be one that's ... that's meant\nTo split votes\nAnd that's it and so\n... it's is it ... the question is do you find that to be dirty politics\n\nCurious my phone numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number is one eight hundred three two one WPRI ... emailed me mad at six three zero WPRI dot com\nHousing Cranston\nUh yeah I don't believe a Joe ... and ... with the governor either\nI have spoken to Joe up on a ... Columbus Day up one of the bill mhm and uh I I've known him in the past\nAnd he just tape that on the phone yeah\nBy the way and and that's not a reason to run for governor by the way\nIt's not a reason to run that Governor yeah I absolutely he is staying in this race just displayed Allen fun that's what he's doing\nWhat I was that what what I've asked that question many times he said I'm running 'cause I Want to be governor he's quoted in the Providence Journal two weekends ago saying that I don't care if I get two percent as long as I take 'em from him\nThat uh you know and and maybe maybe if you if you look at him in the most positive light possible that was an angry reaction to something he thought was unfairly done by the ... campaign fine but now you said it\nYeah and now you're going to now you've got to live with it and uh you know as somebody who has said publicly that I didn't think I think jokes really really want it to be governor when I saw that I was frustrated man I got to tell you I was really frustrated because they told me\nYeah he told me he is doing this phone is his words are they doing it there's this fight song so\nWell I mean I don't know what he told you but I'm just saying I mean it was ... yeah well listen and to me it if that's the case and that's not a ... you don't you don't get it to the governor's race to do that\nYou don't do it\nBut you know the the part the politics of the Democrats and this is a is very interesting it's interesting it's it's a filthy gay men and but is he or do you consider to be legitimate strategy\nYou know depending on how they report it and whether or not it's illegal or it does not prove\nThat Joe ... has some kind of secret deal with the governor just doesn't\nIt doesn't prove that the governor of in the uh the gum at well I don't approve this but the governor and the party or have a similar goal and why is to give Gina Raimondo elected\nAnd if you can go ahead and muddy the waters in the on the other side and make people crazy than that and it makes your candidate look you know more likely to win then they're going to do it and that you know\nI got people saying that uh the Gina Raimondo give a hundred thousand dollars to Joe true it's not the case\nNot by any stretch the party\nDonated mailers to the tune of a hundred thousand dollars\nTo the ... campaign and they went in\nAnd they screwed with the minds of Republican voters\nSo that the Republicans out there who are you reading these things go I'm a Trump guy I like people were Trump guys and\nYou know how effective that is I don't know but I Will tell you this\nIt is it's devious Lee brilliant [laughter] devious leave strategically brilliant good at taking\nAdvantage of an actual I'm an actual situation that exists and making it so that people out there\nI'm ... I mean if you look at the mailer I think it posted on my Facebook page you to go check it out um it literally is\nLooking for a car credit not played well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nThe cartoons what do you see when you look at this one\nAnd depending on what you see that can tell you what your what your psychosis is right it's one of those things depending on what you see a it will tell you where you stand right so in this case if you are pro Trump person you see wow\nJoe ... is a good guy 'cause he's with Trump if you're an anti Trump person you look at it go wow Joe chose a terrible terrible guy 'cause he's with Trump\n\nIf you send it to all Republicans are mostly Republicans chances are a great overwhelming majority of those people are going to look at that and go wow what a great guy he's with Trump\nAnd so either way you when you either\n... you know you further grind into the mud a guy who is not a not who's running against you or you support the splitting of the vote that they're that he's going to do for you with your Republican\nOpponent and that's what happens\nDirty politics or good strategies the question now my phone numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WNPR oh you can email we met at six three zero WPRI dot com now the other thing is that now also becomes a political Rorschach test\nThe blood test because depending on what end of the strategy you are on it will depend on whether or not you think it's smart and or dirty\nSo let's see lose in Providence Lou you're on WPRI Lou\nYeah how are you doing I don't know if anybody has done this or not but if anybody ever asked ... if he had his choice between Fong in ... which one he boat for a and he'd\nProbably do some kind of weasel thing to get out on our but I like to hold his feet to the fire on that one there but the second that wasn't the main point I but I think I've asked them that\nOh you say uh I'm trying to remember exactly what he said I Can't ... let me think about if I can remember when I when I see what he said uh a leg and I think of what I think\nWe all know but couldn't come to my point by point of this is never Mondo has such an has had such a disaster is a four years here community you have been and the taxes and uh and and all kinds of other things she's such a terrible governor and and and the worst part of this is I don't think they\nThey understand I I think did they think that Republicans are just stupid\nAnd that we're just going to vote for this thing sponsored by the Democrats just because she sent it out or just because ... has a picture with Trump the fact of the matter is we we really just want to get Gina out of there because she's a disaster but basically these days it looks like the whole Democratic Party is headed in the wrong direction", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "31"}
