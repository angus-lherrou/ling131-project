I like the\nDescription before about about arm waving a and uh I I was just looking at him and and I\nCouldn't reach resist the temptation and I remember very specifically because it was two fingers but it was my thumb in for finger and what I did was I reached out and I tweaked his nose or I attempted\nTo tweak his nose just because I thought the situation was so ridiculous at which point Joe went wild as you say the\nArm waving a bear in mind\nThat both of us are at that point or over sixty five were bode well over Seventy now uh so this was a couple of old guys\nKind of bumping into each other and I stand physically I stand head and shoulders\nOver Joe uh uh you know ... six one uh over two over two hundred pound ... I was never in physical danger that we've got this whirlwind going in front of me and I just kind of put up my arms you know to to to fend off like you're seeing those cartoons\nAnd the result is you know that he hit my arms\nA number of times I I think they were fish but who knows a and I ended up with a quite a series of bruises or between a man elbow and shoulder on on both arms but that was the that was\nThe so is he took you're tweaking let me see if I can get this out what was she kind of boils down to listeners so he took you're tweaking the nose as an assault of some kind and start whacking out you're waving his arms at ya and that's\nA that's essentially it then we ... we we left the room and uh I ... I Do recall specifically that that was that was just before the session we went upstairs\nAnd we sat at opposite ends of the same role and I I I Do recall that Joe spent most of the rest of the afternoon suggesting that he wanted to put his finger in some place that would have been very uncomfortable\n[laughter] ah but ah that was that was that late ... century the end of it\nI don't remember what [laughter] when they get rid of it\nBeing presented with the opportunity you agree with\nSome passions is two guys get you know get a little ... so representative just is not something you think that this action would preclude Joe ... from being governor\nOr not not not for those reasons that I'll I'll I'll be very up front I'm a I'm a supporter of our own phone and uh I I Know everybody on that slate first hand having been up there for eight years and ah and Allen Allen clearly as my\nIs is getting my support but ah that has nothing to do with this with with the story [noise]\nSome so there you go there's this story we rushed it out and uh she doesn't seem like a big deal on represent them Earnhardt side in a ... ... when I say when you're on Wednesday or not I'm Sorry I Apologize\nFor the straight talk All right Laurie good talking to you take their banks\nRep there you go with that dispense was by the way I just want to see this I'm sitting here hum as we're looking at this and uh and and wondering to myself that this comes this this\nOther story you just told the story obviously represent America Earnhardt a mere hard you know what I'm saying I'm thinking Dale Earnhardt I don't know why I was in a Earhart\nIs um is kind of pulling it and he's a ... supporter right so you know these beings are there any other story out there that you can think of the ... will be talking\nAbout I have gone pretty deep and my memory and I can't think of anything\nThat's why I said let's bring this so I Can't think of anything else so there you go\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nDirty bird that he plays dirty politics and his dirty politics are trying to intimidate a twenty year old girl that wants to come and work for my on my campaign trying to hurt her with their political future that's the kind of crap that comes out of the phone campaign but\nWhat about what I have about ... I have no choice but talked about things like he killed somebody in an accident he shot the body Ninety six feet and the fire is sealed open the fire well let's find out if you were on drugs let's find out what was going on he was\nNineteen years old and a grand jury has a grand jury said there was nothing that it in a diner um if there was floods lightning charged\nHe was additionally charge would kill a homicide his family at a restaurant across the street from the police department so he was in with all the cops in France thing he went\nOut in ... the mafia lawyer to defend them\nLet's let the facts come out okay open the file let's find out where your drug test and were you were you under the influence of al ... of alcohol you hit you knock the body Ninety six feet in the air\nThat's not easy to do he claims that he fell asleep you fell asleep you black dogs from alcohol ... let's see the details if this is the truth this is this is the kind of stuff\nThat Alan fun just wants to sweep under the rug and say or took responsibility for it the same way he took responsibility for the police departments running as police department like a crime syndicates and and that was not me sane and that was colonel Donald ahead oh they were putting\nSomebody in the report that he had that they put the yeah yeah what is the so you know I I'm sitting here and I'm thinking to myself\nI hear you drop that bomb today this has been discussed and kind of disposed with for a long time and in in a response to this you know perceived attack from the phone campaign and I'm thinking to myself Gina Raimondo is laughing her ear and off right now this is probably is what are you saying that\nThe people out there sitting there going Joe you're making it so we get for more you hygiene issues the\nDirection that the campaign is going to go in Allen fungus choosing it by\nAll his minions that he has calling into talk radio swimming me viciously on on social media every chance she gets\nGuys like Brian do very coming out in in in doing this other assault look when you put me in a street fight that's we're in I'm going to come out slamming and that's what I Do what\nYou might you might win the street fight with him\nBut you don't win the election well I'm I'm hoping I mean you don't want to be governor right absolutely absolutely\nYou know Matt I Am what I Am I'm a fighter\nFight I fought for the taxpayers for Eighteen years you want to hire a fighter they go in the state house and fight for the taxpayers I'm your guy you want to hire a ping Xie that's not going to change anything he's your guy\nSo don't compare the two of us because that's what I Do when I ... and nobody walks over me nobody so I'm not going to get pushed around by the unions I'm not going to get pushed around by anybody\nThey're going to run into a stonewall when they start to deal with me I'm not the one that's taken millions of dollars\nFrom the lobbyists I Will stand up to any lobbyists and I don't know them a nickel when a lobbyist raises you fifty thousand dollars for your campaign he owns you he owns you and they're both bought and paid for by the lobbyists\n[noise] what do you uh you know it it does this poll comes out today gives you five percent of the vote by ... percent they got a you know a a fungus behind double digits from Gina Raimondo you see that Paul what do you send me to you all these polls have you in single digits basic\nYou know initially I I I I've said that I didn't believe the polls I still don't believe the polls in the last\nFew days we've said I've sent people up volunteers out on the street all over the state from Newport west Warwick standing outside of wall green standing outside of supermarkets going inside the Providence Place mall just asking people a simple\nQuestion who would you vote for for governor Gina Raimondo out in ... trailer Porter simple these polls they're all complicated they want you to give them your history before you answer the question\nAnd and what I'm seeing from the people on the street that we're going to use the Joe Joe is in this race very seriously polling way above what what the\nPolls are reflecting so you know all I can tell you is not what I'm doing is nuts\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free on condition at what point and he's written a generic ... that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John job now\nIt's worth I Can't imagine what it's worth but what I'm getting at is I Do it for myself if I thought I didn't stand a chance I wouldn't have been this far\nBut I'm In it and I said it from the beginning I'm In it to the end people think that you're going to just get out hunting again oh I've been fasting hundreds of thousands of dollars in spending\nYour of your own money in this campaign right now I don't even know because I didn't add it up you know everyone out and bought motor homes and I didn't run them through the campaign I bought vehicles I I've done a lot of stuff above and beyond the campaign\nEstimate how much if you think you spent\nOh I think when I'm done probably right now I've spent about four hundred thousand gee maybe with another two hundred thousand to spend so I don't know I'm just guessing\nDo you have a limit [noise] um\nI I never put a limit on this at the beginning and I'm Still not putting a limit on it no\nYou don't have any idea what you say you know what I'm not going up to this\nModel but I don't have the money to buy two TV spots in every half hour of TV I mean that's a ridiculous amount of money Gina Raimondo with Allan Fung habit um you know I Can't do those kind of buys but I I Am out there were TV ads um\nI'm going to be up on this station in it and another week I'm going to be up on although radio stations um so I I mean social media I'm doing as much as I can with with limited resources with hundreds of thousands of dollars\nWhat is going to be your answer should election night Tom and Jerry Mondo wins and the exact ... monitor that she wins by the exact amount of money amount of votes you take and the Republicans who you of worked with and worked for and worked around for years look at you and say I can't believe you did this\nAs far as I'm concerned I don't know the ... Republican Party any explanation [laughter] and I don't know anybody in explanation I got in this race because I hate the Republican Party and I think they're totally dysfunctional and they resent the fact that I that I dislike them\nAnd if you look at what's going on in Washington between the Republicans and the Democrats the both of them should be ashamed of themselves\nSo the other reason to get it I got it is because I could never support Allen fun I Know too much about his duty Bertie activity the fact that he threatens people that they don't support him that he goes after the jobs\nI mean there's just too many stories I've heard about Alan ... that ... of turns me off on 'em let alone the police reform bought and the fact that he killed a guy and he's got the files field\nIs this I've asked this question out loud it's just something personal that happened between you and\nYou know not at all I don't dislike Allen personally at all I mean I just like we're ... what he represents but I've never had even a personal argument with him\nIs there is this issue that people calling all the time of the deal between you and reminder\nYeah what's the deal that's gonna make you spend this kind of money give me a break like I'm going to try to help Gina Raimondo a she's got a better shot at getting landed on the moon next week [laughter]\n\n[laughter] and be paying for it [laughter] well the issue\nIs there I mean whether or not there's a deal to be done I mean that said they look at that is that this is\nYou know what what is there a boat you ... I Can't support him I Would I support Raymond patriotic I Know I Know that's an exaggeration but you're asking me to support a guy didn't morally I think is very bad for the state I think he's corrupt\nAll right well you told the story you told us about unit Larry Earhart there so that it seemed to be anything there there's nothing else that would by the way that day was there any\nDrinking involved when you were together no no we never drank ... I'm not a drinker and so and I don't think Larry was drinking either we just we were in the ... ... ... he was trying to kill the bill that I had bought him he didn't like the bill and we got into a heated argument over it\nAnd that's that\nThere's still there's nobody else am I going to you're going to leave the studio in this can be five of the stories that come out ...\nOf that I didn't think of because I if there was I'd rather get it out right now I'd rather get I mean who knows maybe I stole some kids are potato chips when I was in St Pius I don't know\nWhat you did have a lot of snacks and your desk at the job so I did I did I have all our member that yours yours was the one to rate for my mother represented and they used to read it [laughter]\nAll right Joe ... a gentleman interesting story doesn't seem to be much there in terms of the air heart thing it got aired out um\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again borders over one hundred brand new border states we're just one twenty nine from us that's right and one twenty nine promotes blood has every dollar every option and everything you're looking for like four dollars", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "10"}
