with her last awards things are really bad uh you\nGuys are good though let's go to Daniel in San Diego Daniel Iran with mark\nAnd mark how's it going buddy tend to see a back and I got called in when you were working on the ah the serene issue you know we're talking about it and so it's good to talk to you again on Monday I wanted to\nBack up to something you said earlier a believe you're referring to something somebody said about [noise] uh this is the times that we live in\nAnd I hear that a lot and it's not that I'm trying to argue with you or disagree with you but I think\nWe're looking at it and the different says that I think it's not really that I don't think that's the case I think it's more it's the media so embolden and they're out there they don't care now that I've been trying to hide what tent that they believe in\nAnd they don't care [laughter] and so because of that they they get so many we find that people that just buy into that garbage\nAnd that's why they have this perception of this is the times we live and and but it's not really that I think it's just the media is so abusive but all I get your take on that\nYeah you well you you may have points I should have brought up thank you Daniel the the influence in the media right first of all they don't hide how they feel I don't know why I think of an entertainer when I used to watch Johnny Carson\nOh uh I never knew his political point of view I suspect he was a Democrat or liberal\nBut he never had it out there now again he was a comedian\nBut but the media is such a powerful role because so many people that's all they hear right the major news channels not so much right now that we have more\nOf blogs and the Internet and all that stuff talk radio but the place to be role and they have an agenda who's the guy from CNN or like the character that it's always trying to get something on Trump I Can't even think of his name they they ...\nI don't want their name [laughter] I don't have the mountains [laughter]\nMine mine reducing Don Lemon you know I mean right and he wants to publicity and they don't you're right they don't even know there is any more they don't hide wise they act like advocates and they're not journalists\nThe problem I have with it is is that this is supposed\nTo be a country that has room for all people are all political parties and they're making all about them and that's really an image from a point of view away to perceive them and then look at things it it means that\nYou can also blew out those people and that's not what America's about [noise]\nI I got to answer but I got my aunts my producer who just told me he said the Anderson Cooper no 'cause I thought of Jim Acosta and you didn't want me to give publicity but that's the guy and he loves it it's about [laughter] and so I'm playing right into you know the name I Know you didn't but I'm showing my producing doesn't have it\nThat he told me to [laughter] wrong but there there's so many of them he's actors right right they they want to take on the role of being a powerful to and making when they're not supposed to do that if we were lucky that I it's so you are to help them individual you win the prize oh they go to run of the time who\nI don't want to stay in it's cracked when I hear that they don't want to talk about issues and I think I remember correctly that with Hillary was running for the White House or the Democratic party didn't want her speaking about issues\nBecause they knew that she was so ill informed\nOr tub and such\nAnd I don't understand how this country can pick a Democrat\nFor any position that will not talk about issues who will do nothing but call so\nLooking for a car credit not break well isn't it time you financed with blood

ills\nAlthough right now I think is going on a very good direction would trip uh I think over and get some ... related but if he was running I Would love to see somebody that I think is brilliant Newt Gingrich\nIs a hurry up man and it and if Trump or the White House\nOr pets pets as a would be good also because I think he's learned a lot but I Would ... would be Newt Gingrich as I say he's brilliant and a base for letting me speak in a ...\nAnd yet but it was a\nNo no no you got to tell me who you'd have coffee with on the Democratic side\nProbably an analyst with the war to try to to try to talk of sets in her stupid head about her claim of bin Laden American first\nAll right you you got out of it that way it's supposed to be friendly cup of coffee was supposed to be an angry cup of coffee or you guys don't like to watch some of you but\nHe had some uh certainly had some good points there which reminds me I Want to give my a mark on the show dot com is where you can check out my website and of course in Washington DC or anybody else you can email me\nA mark on Saturday all dot com M.

Ventura I just think uh it'd be just be very entertaining\nAh they're both sides\nSo you when you need a box on the on the podium and it just be fun to watch\nYou know you're being tough already what he's you know to be fair as my producer pointed out I gotta compliment him no no one's\nA announced officially I don't think and therefore in the English that I saw somewhere so so you you're right you all of your right if you want to come up with someone that they haven't announced except it'd be nice if they made some sounds like they were running so it's okay you do Jesse Ventura what's he up to these days\nI don't even know\nI Know I'm not sure and they just had some stuff on the Internet here where he's been he's been hinting around the different talk shows\nThat he may be money huh yeah I didn't know marriage is All right ... thank God you don't okay your time\nSo that Jesse Ventura let's go to ... in a Gigi in Washington DC Ron with mark\n\nHigh ... thank you for taking my call and thank you for helping out the guys\nGetting a number of insurance and um I just wanted to say I love my country and I respect from the president that's the first phone and I don't think I don't think this country\nGo anywhere without helping Donald Trump do what he's doing\nI I don't even know how he's accomplishing what he's accomplished you with us hands tied behind his back already owns the scaling it was because he owes nobody on the front in this state problem was only I think going to be solved\nBy making people accountable leader and FBI when he gets the IRA and when you get justice system but we can\nAnd they didn't make testing taught in third world country I mean there's a whole laundry list of things that Hillary Clinton could go to prison for as well as her husband as well as your daughter\nAnd starting with Rocco Donna and down to the lowest person working in the White House right now under this administration they need to be held accountable and by that I Need you need to go to jail and they need to give up their mind is\nBecause money is what gives them the power\nAnd and and without the money and without the power and nothing no need to start taking this seriously my God we ... the main show who called a ages ago a out you know what are we teaching our children I stand on the top one night next to him everything\nLooking for a car credit not break

board to also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nCandy or they're teaching our children to hate our country to hate America\nAnd and now we wonder why the countries the way it is\nBecause nobody's been taught civics nobody knows how the government works they've done them down that's like the way they like some\nKids need to be sent the kids being sent to terrorists you know uh to to do their um say in college when they sent to Cuba doesn't get killed off or to Venezuela and see how that works out for them that socialist life\nYeah but they they don't know that I'd known or your good but they\nAnd now that that's why like capitalism go down there and play football and see how that works out for him\nYou know people just aren't educated\nYou know what I mentioned Bruce or something last night one of the things he said on my show years ago was every generation has to learn what makes America exceptional over and over again because certainly if the schools aren't doing it and ... knew that if they can indoctrinated to give give them early enough\nThey'd have future generations voters but you're absolutely right they ... except for people like me they never hear the other side I get both sides they don't even know what party I mean\nBut they never hear when I was on these standards and giving\nRight but the opposite president United States the man is a pure communist I mean and what's your name Hillary Clinton is as solid landscape personified I mean it\nWas the rock Obama ... why do we want these people to turn this country into what one is the way it is\nRight why\nBecause you're asking me how ... it\nWill people don't understand they don't how evil communism is was they don't know member I quoted Michael Moore the when they know in our capital planning on let me just finish for wait hold on hold on one second I quote him you know it's okay\nI go to Michael Moore when they said to him or he said he doesn't win capitals and they said to him so what would you replace it with and he said we haven't found it yet so even there are some people who are proud of don't even yeah that's what he said uh you're but you're absolutely right\nBecause they've never heard the other side and they think the young people thing today that socialism is wonderful they have no clue because\nThey've been taught that I mean it's I I'm sure you were ... civics in school to you're taught how the government works to three branches we had to learn that we had to run a court case these kids today they they don't they don't mean me and in the street I

L. on for a couple of minutes and hurting me call in and talk about how I like Trump and she told me from that point on she did not want to have anything to do with me she wouldn't read my mail anymore and\nWouldn't take me shopping luckily I'm I have other neighbors that can help me and when I met my fiance twelve years ago\nUm I told her that I Do listen to W male is that going to be a problem and she said no um I went through this my wife walked out on me a twenty five years ago because I wouldn't stop listening to your affiliate\nAnd I'm like I said I have to be extremely careful [noise] um what I say around the neighbors\nThat it's just truly amazing she was helping you out because you're blind obviously couldn't read your mail and none of that matter because you're on the wrong side are you like Donald Trump that was enough to take away any of her compassion ... exactly\nAnd I told her I said you know my former wife how nasty as she was and she doesn't make any difference you voted for Trump and I I said I could never vote for Hillary she reminded me of my former wife\n\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and siblings all have in common there are all in for Steve free own tradition and what they need religion or against it that's right over two hundred free on cars all make all models at incredible prices are going to flood auto jobs now\nThat are which is not hard it's often as part not not you know they're good and bad conservatism good or bad liberals and so on I'm trying to say that\nBut you you just hear these stories blind used to read his mail and now she refused to read his mail he voted for Trump I didn't even expect some of the stuff let's see what's going on because in Canada let's even bad in Canada years ... Ontario you're on was mark\nHi Mark thank you for taking my call wow [laughter] it's a whirlwind um and as you say\nIf you like ... ah my husband and I we both follow with very carefully what's going on in the U.S and the states and we absolutely love Donald Trump\nAnd um there's a big problem we have to be so careful\nOf what we say shit here at the CDC which is the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for candidate\nThey report the news coast to coast and they are all the people the last say the Trump bashing egg free things cool day every chance they get they just\nI don't know what is going on and with people my daughter just graduated a couple\nOf years ago from journalism school okay in Canada and she had to be so careful when she was going to court or to lean bit lean on the left right\nBecause here you can't get a job and Canada's professor if you're not\n... really loud\nAnyway they don't present both sides of the story is that at any of the universities here as far as I Know and that children today are being brainwashed it's a social uh\nIt it's terrible what's going on\nAnd I don't know what people now my rights to assume that people in Canada are pretty far left I mean you got your do now he's pretty pretty far less you had a good prime minister before that oh adviser leave is\nWonderful and we had our um our debt was not a big deal at all we are hardly had actually had a balanced budget and everything was Harper\nAnd sin is they put him in a to do because of his name uh you know what he graduated from\nWas um uh what do you call that acting um\nActually when he went to school for acting thing still doing it [laughter] well during his acting\nYou thanks for your call he's the acting prime minister he still continuing now the official prime minister Ali boy it makes you ever wonder why we ever win an election on our side everybody's telling us they're surrounded by liberals you blind guy the lady will reduce mail anymore daughters sisters\nA son is it just doesn't seem to matter how do\nHow do we ever win elections\nWell I guess we're just finding the people that they won't talk to us and the friend us so we don't get you know the people on our side wouldn't do that you don't know who they are let's go to well I don't know if we have time for one more call it wouldn't be fair to you but I'll tell you this\n... is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I see my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or the when they found out what my views were I was in big trouble\nI've been to a friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era of member MacArthur was you know calling everybody communist and with whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what it's come through and let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this\nI Am a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show host let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that it was probably conservative talk show hosts are some liberals are most of them are\nNot among many good you know what shepherd I been what what kind of America to we have in twenty eight teams when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about\nWhat's your Chevy GMC ... Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve ... edition at what point any religion or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all make all models at incredible prices are going to flood auto job now\nPrediction Center has issued the winter outlook yeah it'll be warmer and the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S is expected to be wetter than normal\nBut no parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter\nNow NOAA warns the forecasts should not be interpreted to mean that period of prolonged cold or heavy snows won't happen most of the country will be dry today with the exception of a place where we don't need any more rain and that's in Texas\nAnd mark how you doing well\nGood good hey I just wanted to follow up with something you'd mentioned um briefly a little while ago about a social media and the affected his habits on relationships friends\nFamily colleagues um I've had experiences where I I quit the race for five years ago because I just couldn't take reading some of the things people are writing and you know it was opposing me but I thought I don't want to\nJump in here and and you know say something I might regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because it was revealed on things but how I felt you know\nBack when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a ... with a lot of relationships you know\n\nWhen I started to go in your direction first of all I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kind of stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned like you became I've learned not to say much about politics and the ... when they know I'm a talk show host and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know trying to\nSay all kinds of things that they can see if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general or I Try to stay away from it I think the social media you're right\nIt had done some good but the I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the radio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious when the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things are happening they're finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and\nI admire that Tom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on with mark\nMark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I uh I I Do a lot of community radio up here where I'm at\nAnd she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know both the duct tape you she CBS NBC or just regurgitate it everything\nThere is a bright spot and let the Canadians weren't aware that the U.S electorate was going to do its best to not get the candidate\nThat the media was trying to and this and that worked out in the end show all that horrific stuff that came off of a a Paul Kennedy and a a\nAt a Charles Adler and uh and right and uh and green or all of that probably helped a\nJet of Obama or get a Trump elected because it was trying to hurt for we're coming down from Canada like that\nAnd uh but the reason I called was so we had already been told a for your Twenty years Thirty years that ah you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and you have the racial issue\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our high car buyers\nAnd then when he got elected she ignored his mandate anywhere\nClear off on another Chang judge and things got worse so we were very very disappointed or you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama will review review to support it and it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time\nWell I think if they voted for him because uh they want to show they weren't prejudice that was a mistake you know color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is than he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was when he first came out\nI or not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who is the red river in ... and ... you pretended that the you know and they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was\nYou get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people can pick on Trump that from the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far left he he really has he got closer and closer he's behind that for for half a second\nI'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him\nAnd that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him probably as much as people dislike Trump all of that is a high bar I've got to admit that ah people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in gurney Illinois you're on with mark\nHey I've got two observations and then eight point to make a first of all you notice\nAll the calls that you have coming in [noise]\nIt's always the liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the observation and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem with liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise\nAnd the power of the individual not the state\nAnd isn't it funny how the left can sit there in town for individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country which specifically states that we have powers are as individuals and not not the state\nOver us as individuals but they are fighting\nFor their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nBoy you said that very very well and I by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights than this so far out there and you know they claim they're against fascism is example within ... fascist themselves\nAnd they even when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about and what does this group think what does that group think\nOr they want more power for the federal government whereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives\nSo I I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to protect the little guy and\nThey they care about my minorities and they cared about the basically for no they did they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left they're all Democrats that you can count on to be moderate to scoop Jackson's of the world\nOf course John Kennedy a lot of people say when the tax cut that he gave he'd be Republican today\nThe Democrat Party that I as a kid supportive and someone said one of our caller said then they left me um they're not the same party they

the stuff that's going on in the oval office that's why I mentioned President Reagan wouldn't walk in there without his suit and tie and I've learned I'm not always agree on this though\nAs much as you guys who were Democrats can't stand a Donald Trump or George Bush for that matter\nI felt the same way about a mile but I Know I've learned if you walked in the room you give credit to the office of the prison in the United states and use than\nJust like him if he didn't couldn't wait for him to get out of office but that's part of the respect now here's the next call I what we have time no
