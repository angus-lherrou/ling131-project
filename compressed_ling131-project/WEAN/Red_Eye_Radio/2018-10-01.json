just happened to be the one\nI face he was on the on the road getting ready to run with federal ... with which whichever nominee\nOh God I'm it's just that she was too much work and when she when she said she believe a hundred per se but it was capital right there and there I mean\nWell all the other well I I I Will tell you this I mean when when they say that she's credible as I said the reason she is Incredibles because she only remembers one thing you're credible because they\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTC and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for leaking of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nI Would love to interview one of these Democrats who say she was credible oh forget about the fact that her own witnesses you know there is no forensic evidence and know witness even the ones that she names of ... story but the fact is what she says her so\nIf you just came in you'd say well look how couldn't remember this so clearly but you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this her testimony alone irrespective of the other ... evidence or lack of evidence her testimony itself was not credible\nMhm yeah I mean that's the that's what a centrally was at play here\nWas responsible for relief you can get but it doesn't matter and that's the attitude on the left which by the way it is clear it doesn't matter because they leaked it\n\nNo one's even trying to defend the right one and they're they're getting paid with it yeah it's a great point they're just ignoring the question\nAre we now a ... he did say Lindsey Graham did say they're going to do an investigation on a dig us we'll get him he called for an investigation call them or one yes yup let us go to Lee in Chapel Hill North Carolina Lee welcome you're on the Radio Welcome highly\nThey're good show and you're listening to think ...\n... ... they call a Ford last week says she ... member where all happen what he or she said she couldn't remember what year it off or if I Love steak well right\nNow she got there how she got home\nThat code or ... only ... all over the last ... last away\nWho are for the yeah you you would have to you have that you and we'll have to weigh located lawyer would act like\nYou would have to ask the Democrats that question I Can't answer for the Democrats aren't as ... as I said very easily that's why she's not ... that that's why that alone she's not a credible witness unless\nThere were people to bakar up when they say she's credible on like based on what and this is a legal statement this is a personal statement against her right I don't know what she went through\nBut when you say I'm a hundred percent somebody did it where\nI don't know when I don't know how did you get there I don't know how did you get home I don't know\nAll you know she did it but any information surrounding it and then the witnesses that you give give contradicting testimony that you gave\nIts not credible right the ... and that's why I said I don't uh somebody's asked the Democrats that specific question but again as you see for example George Stephanopoulos last question when they don't answer it just moves on it's like okay give me an answer\nYou want to look something that bothers me more than even even the the the ... which we call the fake news is the lack of guts of journalists to say I'm not leaving this question until you answer it right because it's very important that there's an expectation\nYep huh remember\nWho ... who who was it who has the Obama the follow up question where was that\nWas that ... that was here in uh in what was it oh no yeah yeah well there's two separate ... okay uh one where you have a local reporter here\nAh from W F a a TV in Dallas but no the one you're referring to was Chris Wallace and then they came back and said well we weren't told there would be ...\nThat that if you asked a question did make sense to be a follow up question right that that there's actually an and this was something that has to stop\nThis ... this kind of bizarre old world respect that we have for politicians when I'm a journalist and I ask you a question if you don't answer it I'm going to ask the question again and then I'm going to come down and write to it and say you're not answering my question\nWell I don't feel it's important oh so you won't answer my question I Want you on record that you don't have the guts to answer my question I phrased it that way which of course is not permitted because there is some kind of bizarre real world versus fact\nThat a journalist is supposed to give a politician who won't answer a question on an issue that is the reason that you brought them on the air\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai kid Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free own condition that flood forward and he's written a generic ... that's right over two hundred and three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices log on to flood Otto John John now\nGot list go away I feel like I'm Talking to somebody right now and yelling at them but if you're yelling at all of them and and you know that's but that's that they get away with it drives me up for you know because people like well Stephanopoulos and everybody else allow them to get away with\n\nThe the person especially a public servant who's being interviewed does not dictate the questions\nNope no no\nAnd what would they do when they don't answer the question they do when when when they don't answer the question they are dictating the question\n... well and that's just they need to it it's very clear to us but it's just state it we're going to help this person build a narrative here so let's talk to them let's help them build their own narrative\nYeah we'll forget journalism right oh\nI'm Sorry then my question isn't the one I should be asking oh my focus should be elsewhere you're saying well okay and and the easy thing\nTo do is the challenge her own owes answer as soon as she gave that non answer I would've said okay so you're saying the Democrats did\nLike\nYour your your\nNon answer their tells me that you're basically admitting the Democrats did lakes is\nYou can respond to that statement if you'd like to yes or no true or false\n[laughter]\nBut this is why people right at ... at least frustrate the daylights out of them ... this is why people hate it nobody's going on with Tim Russert because they knew it didn't matter which side they were on they knew they were going to face tough questions\nOr remember for two weeks in a row none of the Democrats from the Senate Judiciary committee would come out with Chris Wallace for what they do is is if you do that you become black balled\nYeah they won't come on your show any more because you demand that they\nThat they answer the question everybody knows what the questions are going to be [noise] yeah when you come in with look when you're a U.S senator and you come in to talk or you're the president or whatever you're somebody the White House\nWhen you go on a show you know why you're going on the show ... they'll tell you we want to talk about this\nAnd so you know what the general questions are going to be and your goal is okay oh look I Need to get my staff around here we need to figure out how to way not to answer any of the questions out of white filibuster\nWe the every journalist knows everybody on ABC CBS NBC and Fox knows that's what is CNN they all know what's gonna happen mhm they all know they're going to do that when it's somebody going to finally say\nA you're not answering my question would you answer the question and at that point what happens is you're not going to get the major you're not going to get the major personalities anymore I think about this we live in a society\nWhere the media believes we need to get the manger personalities on the major political personalities who run and drive this country it's important that we get them on the air so they won't answer the questions that we asked them\nYeah that's it\nFace the nation no its face the other way [laughter] meet the press Elvis Presley me we're going to do a handshake that's the way it's going to we were just going to go

well be giving that answer to every question here mom [laughter] what do you think that you're a mom\n[laughter] [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] ... because that's the ridiculous nature of this why not

because that's all it is exact nobody's taking ... ah the their constituents\nAre seriously in the case of Jeff like he didn't care ... ... you know how she could answer it I don't know I don't know who would yeah I don't know like you're asking me a question I Can't answer right why didn't we but why didn't we get the I don't know that's a great ...\n[laughter] this is an [laughter] ah\nBecause
