that's the only role of the FBI and its entire equation\nIs to give the Senate the information you're making it sound like the FBI but then do an investigation on it no it would end up in the partisan body anyway\nThat's in fact the only purpose the FBI serves in this scenario is to deliver that information to the White House in the Senate\nIf I mean she would officially be dip putting it into the three oh two had she'd done that during the process and the way I agreed to take out the way they they tried to put it in the process would chairman Grassley twice his call for it\nAnd uh it's a

simply take it and give it to the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee kind of ended up in the report we wouldn't see it the the the only by senators\nWould set the only the centers would see it and there for a goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence mhm and she wants to people who said she wants to people to see it so then the people can decide\nGive it to grasp it directly outside of the three oh two because\nThen the other members of the committee including Dianne Feinstein would get it and immediately leak it\nExactly or\nGenerating we waited for [laughter] just release the entire right to the

do the more professionally and and and uh they were in a conversation and it was a ... a black man who was a huge fan of my show\nNow I sort of knew her politics were more of\nThe liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend because in a conversation a black man said he loved our show right\nThink about that and that was really my first taste of that type of sanity\nBecause that person you refer to as you described it before I went\nFrom zero to you know basically right or just just a small talk with you have

I'm ... I'm sure they're going to make this work while your daughter's in ... wedding is certainly paramount uh I'm certain there was there was no way the Danes was going to miss that\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explains it light up of Lincoln ...

the El Paso district right I mean he can win your Paso district as long as he wants to run for that house seat um and I have friends there that say oh man he's got his hands and everything you know so um yeah uh\nThat's different though when you broadened it out to the rest of the Texas\nNow certainly he's done better than um\nA lot of the people who jumped into different racist or the former ah Dallas County sheriff Lupe Lupe Valdez uh and uh you know her running against ah the the current Governor Greg Abbott um that's you know again he's\nHe's very well in the lead but well when you broaden it out to the state right level you gotta go wild you got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle\nWell then and that's a bit of work he's trying to do is try and do you try to picture himself and he's not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that he has to lie even to get dumber he can't be truthful even with Democrats in taxes\nAnd hope to get elected and that's the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the time they used to\nWe need to move to the middle we need to move to the middle we've got to move to the middle we've got to move to the middle\nAnd and then over the last ten years or so no they were basically this is who we are I guess my point is that when you think about\n\nTen years ago right now\nWhen you think of ten years ago mhm\nWhen Obama was running for president ... wasn't it right about now right around this was in October remember he held it would've been no would have been the convention where we are convention when ... when he was at the stadium the football stadium in in in Denver and they had like ... it looked like\nHe was a you know the the the entire stage it was set up with these ... and everything else where he looked like like some Greek forum yes yes mhm and ... and people going crazy and and remembering his first term Evan Thomas from\nNewsweek at the time he's God blight yeah\nHe's he's a ... you know as a post partisan he's God like heath hovers over the rest of us he's the smartest person in the world to now ten years later\nOne of the leading\nSocialist candidate in the country mhm I\nRide on a bomb that we don't they don't need all that we don't we don't need about ...\n... there was a Hollywood they come out and that's that's a great point because here's the thing is that is deadly in inside the state it doesn't work but\nA work has no problem taking money from outside the state from the liberals you know who have been pouring money into the state but well into his coffers in order to be Ted Cruz an an effort to be Ted Cruz um you know so you know even the liberal basically the liberals to are you guys stay outside of Texas\nLook we've got our liberal places in in Texas are there are plenty of the districts that are blue and counties that are blue including the county we broadcast from yeah but\nBut here the the point is though the point is not who he would have gotten in addition if he would have got Obama ... but the fact is he knew\nHe could reject Obama publicly yet but then the banks and I'm going I'm going to ask core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing no anymore\nNo no that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too is that it does nothing for them and it only irritates someone who might be in the middle and tied right\nI mean is it only works against that middle which might get you over it actually is the only thing that in this case especially that's going to get you over the top of the win but he knows by essentially denouncing and saying you know turning down the Obama endorsement\nThat it does not hurt his base\nRight they don't care right we don't uh well because Obama yesterday's news well listen\nI mean I'm lawyer Lanny Davis remember he was going to be the hero you know so he was the here over the ... the point is is not the Lanny Davis is is a rock Obama but the point is is that there is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left am I the way that you're always going to be the demon tomorrow\nThat's the way it works because\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our high car buyers are tough\nTo be you here's here's but my my uh again I could be wrong but\nHere's my here's my gut that liberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know a better work here in the state of Texas right\nLook at I Can't believe it or use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster right he really said it was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat up there and he liked being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes\nThat we believed in that he went from God to light to pose or in ten years\nOr by the beginning of his his ... inauguration to the end of his term as president of the United states that is how the modern day liberal looks at him they look at him and they just say\nWow okay also ate him anymore he's not to think about this is all Obama is not ... president like him 'cause you and I talked about is that you know by the by the time we got to the terms that Obama would be the leader we ... I didn't I don't have predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama\nBecause there was nobody else and Feinstein you know or or or\nPillow she's getting old and and you know Schumer is to New York and so it would still be Obama that would be the leader for a while of the Democratic party is nothing anymore\nNow ... going back to the the tragic night here in Dallas in July or twenty sixteen when five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson\nAnd the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started I was online uh I follow the local media on Facebook and one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking\nThe protestors because it was a protest march and was peaceful up until that point of course but\nThey were talking to the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protests the ones who were speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because there are broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcasts was over so they went to like Facebook so I'm watching\nThe thing I remember the most\nIs them saying what does Obama done for us remember this was began or yeah twenty sixteen months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen waters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us nothing and I thought to myself\nYou know there because that was one of those\nAh cracks in the foundation if you will of the left although it had started happening before that for me it was telling\nBecause you had young activists and the two that were speaking were African American\nWhat does Obama done for us what does Hillary done for us the left or the Democrats the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the when you don't get the win just because they may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause now it's no rational right and it ... it it always will be that's why the party has no direct\nLine by right now that's what you get with identity politics because there is no there's no ... there is there is no general issue or goal ... goals that they actually want because when you split everybody yes when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party having\nA particular political goal this is probably the closest you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh\nYes if the activists are are are going in multiple directions ... then then the party has led by them they're going to try and it was every direction and they have no direction at all except for abortion\nWrapping right now unite the Democrats right eight six six Ninety right I\nWas very much tomorrow's and they're recording it would on radio [noise]\nListen to read I\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like flood auto\nSuperior driving skills if you or someone you know it's a truck driver with a million miles or more driving without a preventable accident register online at red eye radio show dot com that's right I radio show dot com\nThe red eye radio million mile club would not be possible without the support of our great sponsors including Petro stopping centers\nHow's lubricate or the ... the family of companies motel six the sink Christopher fund cats scale\nAnd cobra electronics we applaud the individual truckers athletes who drive with care and keep our highways say\nFrom doing drugs delusion that whenever I Am six WPRI station\nConfirmed amid protests high level diplomacy on barbecue that\nThe newest justice on the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in after the Senate voted for confirmation\nThe president allow media into his air force one cabinet if he wants the Senate vote afterward he brushed aside the protesters as a minority of the nation especially women women\nWith Kevin having been accused of sexual assault from high school days the president elaborated that women are worried about baseless accusation bumped often teeny Washington\nA visit to the Korean Peninsula in one is why the docket for the United states' top diplomat more from corresponding T.

incredible prices are going to flood auto job now\nReasonable prosecutor whatever they say I just want to throw right off going on over there were quote and quote me don't call me and they're not but right 'cause they're just you're using the term but he's destroyed that term rabbits like\nThe uh the the whole uh Brian Regan does a as a comedian my favorite I think people know that if they listen for any amount of time does a bit about the no nonsense judge\nOr what does a nonsense judge look [laughter] I mean if Brian does a much better than I Do it and but that's the point I mean over the years we've heard well that's a no nonsense judge I Want a total nonsense judge\nOkay we're breaking for ice cream [laughter]\nKnow in other news uh this from the hill dot com this was breaking news yesterday afternoon and yesterday evening congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official this is from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign and\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney from ... the Democratic National Committee private law firm\nThat's the from used by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dos ca\nOf uncorroborated man never we talked about the left it's always on cooperating cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a bite testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between Perkins ... law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground about the FBI's use of news media in twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case\nAnd about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive\nWe've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said\nAnother said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about FBI immediate contact citing ongoing investigation by the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election\nAbout the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nA new how much the FBI and Justice Department had withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump\nAnd so that is you know breaking news because what you have there you have you have the first person from\nThe last administration the Obama administration that worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon test to find the tie in we were ... there's no reason\nIf you're investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the ... lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured worn right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said they talked to they talked to ... the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why why would that be why would that be\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure in the upcoming days or they just want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to a near record levels\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed rates prices in cars with zero percent if you are for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nSet in November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nAre the key insights this is from Bloomberg their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure from Trump\nNow we talked about this because we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil in the war yep we beat started we beat ... every other country and somebody called up and they said well the outcome prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors in all ... there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect him to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you produce your own oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here\nWell and and you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you had the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now it looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably good\nAt some levels well that comes from an expansion as you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nBeen saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations only the regulations were holding us back that we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nAnd I get I give credit here to President Trump yet where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia mhm excuse me\nWe're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we ... we're we're there for you all the time ... ah and whoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia OPEC member I deal pact member [laughter]\nVery avail back the OPEC member right Saudi Arabia to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we talked about when he does extremely good things we talked about the fact that no other\nThere was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrat there is no other Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we had talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um the wild stops it could be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we had said look we've said this a long time ago we said one of the reasons that we are concerned [laughter] ... babies\nAre one of the original chair of the original ... [laughter] you know one of one of the reasons that we were concerned who said look\nEventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different\nThan the agreement that that we have now ...\nOr ... who's a leading economists for the wall Street Journal exact same thing yet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like\nA lot like the old NAFTA mhm\nOnly significant concession was on automobiles and parts rules requiring more production in North America highway higher wages for workers\nAnd potential tariffs if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicle that even though there is a cat because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance\nThey talked to ... of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower price models now assembled by Volkswagen miles to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry\nBut they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariffs and will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we have said and they've said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from sending expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments\nA they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with South Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again for board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine promote flood of every color every option and everything you're looking for like four dollars out\nOf truckers warmed up or today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nFor now as you can help we encourage you to educate yourself in years on the sink Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help to ... dot org let's band together for a better tomorrow\nOn TALK solutions to sell whatever than I Am six or WBRC\nStation port\nChef cardinal misconduct I barbecue that conservatives now have the five four majority on the Supreme Court like president Mike Pence confirmed the Senate vote on Saturday elevating Brett Kavanaugh to the high court\nOn this vote the eyes or fifty the news or forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed\nKavanaugh was sworn in as the one hundred and fourteen to justice as a springboard replacing the swing vote of retired Justice Anthony Kennedy having all was confirmed by one of the narrowest margin in Senate history\nDrumming up support for Republican candidates ahead of the mid term elections President Trump took a swipe at protesters have gathered outside the Supreme Court in Capitol building in opposition of Brett Kavanaugh who went on to win confirmation\nSo radical Democrats after Jew an angry mob you saw that today were screaming and shouting not from the two hundred people are less\nPope Francis authorized a thorough study of Vatican archives in the case of former cardinal theater my character accused of sex abuse\nThe pope has authorize a thorough study to determine helmet Carrick advance through church ranks despite allegations that he slept with young seminarians\nIt's the Vatican's first response to explosive claims of a cover up for this roiling the Roman Catholic Church but the statement does not address allegations that France was himself knew and twenty Thirteen of sexual misconduct allegations against Bill Carrick who is now an ex cardinal I'm able to paint it\nChristians gather for Sunday sermons in the earthquake and tsunami damaged Indonesian city Apollo they're hoping for answers to the double tragedy that claimed more than sixteen hundred lives inflicting deep\nTrauma on their community\nMessage ... if you're considering going back to school after the following question do you need the flexibility to take classes on your schedule he left college credits in each transferred\nTo you want to earn a quality degree from a world renowned university if you answered yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school for you\nArizona State university for over a hundred and fifty highly ranked degree programs a hundred percent on line to learn the same degree as he went on campus from wherever you are on your schedule plus ask you one line except most transfer credits\nFor information ... three five five one seven\nLearned for yourself by the wall Street Journal rinks ass you fit in the nation from producing the best qualified graduates and white eighty seven percent of ask you grab recruited within Ninety Days have graduation learn to grow learned to succeed and learn to thrive at Arizona State university to learn more about ... the one line degrees\nText get two three five five one seven that's G.

first hand knowledge of the allegations we've heard from\nA the ... lawyers that well known she had twenty people she wanted them to talk to them all they cared about was anybody that potentially had

in an effort to cooperate the allegations against cabin off by California professor\nAh Christine Blasey Ford who testified in front of the committee that Kavanaugh had held her down put his hand over
