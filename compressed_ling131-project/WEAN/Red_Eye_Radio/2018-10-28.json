[laughter]\nPeople a vow of every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population that people learn every day and\nA teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that have called the show and I said you know I used to think this way and then I started you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realize I changed my mind completely people change their mind you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing your base and never being satisfied with what you have always trying to grow it and we believe if you promote\nFree markets conservative economics conservative principles and you explain it in a simple way a nation that\nLargely remains and we're not talking to you who was listening to the show you have taught us out you've sought out shows like this you've sought out information like this so we're not referring to you you're already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time\nAnd you are able to introduce them\nTo different ideas there is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost probably ... I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there and that is the goal the goal is to win\nThe goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate you use a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love and people right if you guys don't understand the frustration out there\nYou're kidding me if you liked it just would you like to sit in this chair for the last almost Thirty years Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here yeah right that's what it is being a conservative radio talk show hosts for the last Thirty years yeah\nIt's really an Tom [laughter] it's always a very high scenario it's like doing constant yoga all the time meditation\nOh it's like sitting on a beach\nSo like that just sitting there and say I I got friends in St Thomas sending their Virgin Islands St Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is day after\nDay here as yours and and so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you disagree with that you believe is unfair and in some cases evil no that's\nNot our goal look after them on the issues go after them with with uh you know with everything you've got on the issues\nAnd spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric because it doesn't need to be looked at the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and that the ... the window is closing and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that\nBecause we've been doing it so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean mess of doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person\nCan be communicating ... you can set the messages are ahead of time to automatic would go out while you're sleeping you can you can communicate right now around the clock\nGet the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins\nAnd you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already what\nMe is understanding that the left uses the heat of heated rhetoric that they that they use\nThey do that out of desperation and they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand that on you know the other side on on the the side that I'm most closely relate to that it gets\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the here for only one Ninety nine brought will say hello to forge twenty Eighteen Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at flood forward and he went into the Narragansett\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell\nAnd we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need that that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they\nWork well well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there former leader was in Nevada the other night and we've gone over the years from that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand for\nUs to him becoming president in two thousand eight on hope and change\nTo just the other night Nevada Belgian Blue boat on well almost it was it because it became ... if you think about it it's not even a political tactic what would you what I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or raider\nRock Obama this big speech built on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and vote they're going to win but yeah ... okay thanks captain obvious we already know that\nDon't boo vote okay Kenny can you\nCan ... and ... and as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issue is that's the difference look at you know we talked about how we don't like the political ideology on either side and but I Do understand that because of political ideology on on the left\nIs based purely on personality and on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar free we worship a candidate it's still always has bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas right\nThat are that are specific and work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it\nBut as you ... you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other day for what you saw was the shell of the Democrat Party which is the other night which is no ideas just

[noise]\n\nOn during her along with our early this hour sponsored by ... runs mark helping you run more efficiently afraid hunters number one goal is to go to John in Minnesota John welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nThanks for taking my call and say I'm just like to take exception are kind of cheer premise of believe that President Trump's going to have a long term effect accomplish 'cause you know I mean it can be over to X number one you know he's got three branches or the ... all three branches of\nGovernment I'm like oh I bet you first right presidents come and go\nAh ah okay I'll I'll tell you what to say it will because we're short on time John I'll tell you what the anti reverse I have a two year construction is on the Supreme Court good point yeah excellent\nPoint yeah an enemy or not I don't I that's why I don't remember us in any segment today saying what you claim we said\nWell I Believe that data about maybe forty five minutes ago that you know this kind of revolution and you know they got all the ... you got all the answers\nFilmmakers from you know John John John John Saddam we said that the president and the Republicans were making progress and they are and so what we want them to do is be able to focus on that message and keep the message going it's that simple\nYeah saying I made about long lasting or anything else like we didn't say anything but of course I could I could defeat you on that because I pointed out uh with Kavanaugh and Gorsuch you have to construction yeah you're right on the ...\nOr ... that right and and when we want we ... we were the ... we were the first to say that in the executive branch should we look at Obama most of what a bomb and done has been dismantled because if you don't use the legislature if you used executive orders ... uh in order to run your executive branch instead of trying to get legislation passed through the legislative branch yeah\nIt's not going to be long term but the tax cuts could be long term\nWell and and here's the thing to what did you have with the tax cuts in in the uh the while not retaliatory but the the response from the Democrats was what\nNot that we're gonna take it back to you know thirty five percent we're gonna we're gonna take it to one eighty five percent\nRemember right almost right away what we need to raise that we need to raise it to twenty five percent less I I I it was the Republicans that weren't even saying twenty five percent during the whole discussion on it and we didn't think they would get anywhere close to Twenty one percent so it's you know this this whole thing\nOf of being long lasting a good economy is not going to be defeated because the American people want to keep it going I'm\nThe last administration tried that they tried everything they could to step in the way of private sector you didn't build that that was their attitude that was the attitude by the former administration but the the fact of the matter is is private sector built all of it the roads the bridges and the business\nYou know so it it's just because\nProblem is is with with if you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they don't sweat it was an oversight\nRhode Island's number one born dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont flood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\n... that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here just about and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the scent\nWhat Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with all the hunger was harm you know a along with the\nSuspicious package was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not pass that\nAnd you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now people are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible look at the time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it and that's what I told us an earth are saying the bomb was harmless right this is in our personal meaning not on the air\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence\nIn Associated Press separate the two yes and then says pipe bomb now again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were\nActive bombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have gone on\nA ... you know and\nAnd whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever or were they set to go off and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point\nYou would look at it and the questions that you would ask is an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm or they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent for a political statement would be the next question that you would ask right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we uh\nWhen we talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat\nThey're saying the divisiveness must stop\nBut yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody for an incident where they don't have the fact they don't know we have no idea that the motivation behind the\nThe the uh the person or persons nobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against the advice of this and it's exactly what they're doing\nHow many times a week on the left doing that it's like\n[laughter] we're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah right well anyway specially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know they're trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces\nThat\nWe've got to it in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work\nAnd I know sources of said they believe it's the same you know right people are person or group of people based on the ... which again that that the number of the number of of ah devices\nThat you send out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm yeah\nIf you look at the nature of ah how this was sent a the the packaging the if you look at the um the the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN\nOr you know the multiple stamps it went through us ts\nBomb each of these by the way depending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own meals are usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that assorted and there's a great deal of security um but\nLooking for a car credit not played well isn't it time you financed with blood blood born in east British generic ended up the best financed rates rising cars

the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of\nCourse that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place but but the point being is that they have a a\nGreat deal of resources that the secret service has a great deal of resources in ... in in finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle\nThere's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days\nThat they know it may be where the facility or facilities were at these were sent from what I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now whether these relied bonds or not they know right they haven't said no we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go live and could have been triggered\nBy a ... a phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not write\nWell because in in in Illinois ... is there a reason that you'd I'm I'm I'm not throwing out of conspiracy and I'm saying there is there an investigating reason why you wouldn't do it well and if they were\nArmed or or or if they were at that at that point those were those devices were ready to go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city\nA right there in the building to CNN building or the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock some time that but they were allowed to go back in the building I'm ... and so does that tell us anything about\nThe threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days you know because if\nThey were armed and they were ready to go off and and you suspect that there might\nBe more would you allow people to go back in that building\nYou know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have as ex presidents do a secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level security\nAh but if it's if you're talking about you know the media\nYou have to assume right that the if the threat is real and if that were at that device word dangerous or we're ready to go off\nThat there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um but I don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got\nA\n... ... you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent to\nAnd and that's about it\nWe ... we we've seen the pictures on on uh on line and in the media as to what the packaging was at least with the CNN device but again where the the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here\nThey're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\n[laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nEven the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they're really looking at\nIt looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation suspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it and when the FBI tells us or authorities tell us more than\nWe can start having that broader

of the early voting sites for me right and it was pouring rain or just more ... and when it was funny 'cause I never even though this campus is only five miles from my house I really just\nNever been to never drove through this community college right oh drove through what the signs were out front on them you know the that you could tell me okay this is early voting ... political signs all over the place and\nSo I started driving around trying to find the building saying I've no idea what building that's going to be in but when I but I Will know it when I see it because I had a political science will be all over the place right right yeah and they were\nThe only thing is they\nDidn't have any parking if you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college uh yeah yeah which\nAnd I just thought to myself because that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a courthouse right uh where you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little further couple of more miles and I was going to go there and I said nah\nI Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been out of before you know I had about a thousand foot ... pouring rain but when I got in there everybody friendly ... no matter what the ... is\n... outside the anger the rage that we see in the media every day\nEvery time I Walk into a polling place hey how you doing everybody's laugh and joke in what's going on all you're doing and they had the the the new don't didn't have to actually sign you know how you're supposed you

the great thing there is that um that that understanding and\nAnd the only thing I and I think I we might have discussed this before the the only thing that I think that you know were needed for is the fact that there are busy doing their jobs they've got their jobs they got their families\nAnd our job any of them were heading right now right in and and and our job is the fact that we have\nWe have time to pay attention to everything so we can articulate what's going on to them so in a in a condensed sense they can get an idea of what's going on every single day in what's going on in the

[noise]\n\nInternet radio eight six six Ninety red eye these are counting on Gary McNamara stock markets are to hit yesterday was a bear of a day\nYeah yeah yeah down or over six hundred points\nSo ah the you know here's the other side of I guess and not a lot of media on on that obviously the media was on everything else that was going on with these suspicious packages and everything but\nYour the administration and they're they're probably looking at this going okay as we go in get what a you know again twelve days out from the mid term\nThey need to build some momentum so they need to I guess return uh some of that a positive stuff to back to the market uh we'll see where it goes uh in terms of ah any kind of rebound later today or or maybe next week if that has to happen\nBut you can bet they are watching this and a lot of it has to do with trade and tariffs\nSo the material costs especially with steel and aluminum right now you have and the retaliatory tariffs on\n... remember also the I Believe the temperatures are still in effect from earlier this year on Canada timber coming lend until NAFTA is actually sign right or whatever it is the new now than they do now and we're not calling now [laughter] All right\nUh but as far as I Am and so housing has gone up you know we look at there is an apartment complex behind us\nAnd and it's I how many units are in there maybe three four hundred there it's pretty big issue John ah and the rate of construction every time we kept its it's almost as if it's not moving along at all and you would hire totally asking\nWhy why is it going so slow he's the labor is a material I've never seen a building built so slow and this is a major\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free

yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region or the later part of the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers plugging along

Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan at upstate New York the south Gobi drying out today the deep south as well as the southern plains Texas dried this weekend\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration because they have not just about the attack that they are for open borders bang go\nWe've been saying for years\nAnd this is what we said pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and the earlier this week as well they have to be positioned very clearly the question has to be asked\nWhere do you stand on the border they must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do you support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want\nHe said again I have argued elsewhere the party should have been raised an immigration compromise where the wall would be built in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong\nUh uh you know a Democrat and a former Democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this is a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president\nTo back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have this comprehensive\n\nAre you for that but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on this show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a\nWas a a a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm\nWhich was the amnesty that was two thousand five just if they they made the decisions a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right and so for Thirteen Years of Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWhat was their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that say Republicans failure mhm because of Republican should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it should be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said\n\nYou make the accusation Democrats wide open borders and when they cry you are a line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want a gun\nIssue them the challenge and that's what it was shown as saying here that again they haven't had to answer they haven't had to they don't then they some of them\nDon't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice you don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public and\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one Ninety nine brought will say hello to forge twenty eighty four to one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a flood forward and he went into the Narragansett\nAre here and\nWant to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we brought it to your attention the demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country\nAre blacks and Hispanics ... when you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see that the numbers\nOf\nOf\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level\nOf legal immigration that even from\nHas never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat mhm\nNo the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically but the other side of it is is that\nThe Democrats have not been forced to choose say what they want at all you do with the president wants\nYou know what the Republicans won and and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have to you have to force them and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the caravan saying we'll pull ... we're going to pull\nMhm but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people come\nUp\nBut you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something yes\nBy the way also we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag ... and all that and so people start question well why do you want to come here right do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then\nYou know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to well what do we want from people who come over here as citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to\nYou have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice protest\nThey they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders\nThey should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level tell me who and\nI mean the ... from the party\nThat is actually saying that and promote\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log on to our our car buyers are tough\nJoe Manchin we haven't heard it but we're you know there might be one or two maybe clear [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats but where's the party saying this is what we want\nBecause that's the official political battle how can we ever how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement\nWhen the other side won officially tell us what they would ... what they want right except for those that are in the party to promote open borders and the elimination of bodies they won't even have the debate right right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans we Republicans have Thirteen Years the pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role doing so right they have another opportunity to do it right now with the caravan coming

liberal and democratic political figures over the previous three days that contained quote potentially destructive devices and to quote the bureau initially said it had recovered five packages or were similar in appearance and bore the return address of an office for representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nFlorida the packages were dressed to George Soros Hillary Clinton a a former president Brock Obama former CIA director John Brennan a pair of CNN and former attorney general Eric Holder the FBI said it was possible that additional packages were mailed to other locations\nUh this investigation is of the highest priority for the FBI Director Christopher Wray set in a statement we have committed the full strength of the FBI's resources in together with our partners on the joint terrorism task forces\nWe will continue to work to identify an arrest whoever's responsible for sending these packages we ask anyone who may have information to contact the FBI do not hesitate to call no piece of information is too small to help us with this investigation law enforcement officials involved\nIn the investigation told Fox News that the similarity between the packages has led them to believe that a single individual or group could be responsible\nIn addition to the five packages identified by the FBI US Capitol police were investigating a suspicious package address to representative Maxine Waters of California\nAt the Capitol Hill screening facility and Marilyn water set in a statement that the Capitol police have told her that her Washington DC office was a targeted based suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI late Wednesday the Los Angeles central male facility was backed away the dapper employees\nFound a suspicious package which the Associated Press reported\nWas

I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say she approves this message this is her\nCampaign that she's not saying the people that are protesters she's referring\nTo her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members\nOf the party that she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree you know uh you know with my my party in it no so I wrote a writer I again it wasn't it ... the men\nHaving the conversation and say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme is you know in there that she doesn't she's it was the term as you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and then she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put into that ad right where the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's uh\nBlood Lincoln is southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable service\nWho they are looking to sway\nOne way and it's\nIt's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw air just what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah because I think what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that they're they're they're they're looking at ... because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats my not part of the crazy Democrats right but it's using that\nTerm crazy Democrats specifically and not a you know not radical not yet a extreme cause extreme if something is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right\nAh but\nIs this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing is that it doesn't\nMatter that you're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter that you're not a ...\nA lizard with Warren or just you know a pick a number of them that are in the Senate or that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times\nIt's because of their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago their actions go outside of their state in terms of the race right they will uh taint the races in other states but especially of course those\nThat are neck and neck and I and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we\nSo that's the effect is that come out with Harris or or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and those people in the ...\nThe state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with\nAt some point Kamala Harris or you know inside with as you're crazy Democrats she as she just did as ... outside [laughter] and which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote app and\nWhere does she go on this well she made a choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but it's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale that tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThen that doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats whip that no vote she can dome that behavioral Lenny we saw during the cop Kavanaugh process\nAnd and that's ... I'm I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should thing and we're not ... we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right you're undecided independent\nWho is looked at the cabinet thing and said they're crazy I mean they're ... they're really crazy and I can't vote for care\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the feedback coming back mhm that ad may be received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote\nRight but you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the lame duck you will do you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with\nThat vote on Kavanaugh that was also condoning their behavior him not you know all of that\nThat's you know that she evidence to back up their opinion you have to come in to that conclusion yes haven't I'll just proved that eight six six Ninety right I\nWas very much about rose and their record ... radio [noise]\n\nWhat their Chevy GMC ...
