those warehouses where you know well why would I pay someone to you know do this part of it when I could do that automated it would be more efficient it would last her as the people can do other\nJob as as we said with the you know the on the uh the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada mhm ah by the president coming in and and and stayed in\nA that there has to be more American or should be more North American materials are in these in all the vehicles and all the three countries and setting labor standards and some wages in Mexico what you're doing is you're going to be driving out the lower\nUh the the the the lower worker and expect to see a ton more automation coming to Mexico and the United states lowers your workers will be again right ... lower ... lower skilled workers in the United states and Mexico will be overlooked and they're going to be looking to do whatever they possibly can because\n... fewer cars will be sold because the price of cars because of the new trade deal will be going up in the United states Mexico and Canada and that that's not the only worry the other worry 'cause remember what the president said one of the president's ... main goal we talked about this yesterday which to have\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to forge twenty Eighteen Ford F. one fifty ... for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at flood forward and he went into the Narragansett\nOn cars in all of North America and Canada and I have to say North America and then say Canada Mexico and not in the United states because they have\nChanged North America to that in the actual name of it\nAnd and so you know we discussed it a yesterday I not the wall Street Journal and others\nYou don't have that discussion saying look you're actually going to hurt car production in the United states you're going to hurt lower skilled jobs especially in Mexico where there's something in a safe fine you're gone automation you know automation a that comes in Tempe comes into this particular point\nAnd in the United states to and you're still not going to be able to\nDefeat all the cost of the regulation from government\nIn the new trade deal which means what there's less of a chance we can build automobiles here and sell them overseas which is exactly what the president wanted and now he's implemented a program that does exactly the opposite of what he claimed he wanted to begin with mhm that's the frustrating part and well and keep in mind in two\nThousand eight when the domestic auto makers were bleeding cash their their foreign arms their foreign business was what was keeping them alive\nYou you've you've now encouraged the foreign arms to say okay we're going to make them all over here mhm\nAnd that was one of the president's number one complaints and so we implement something that will have the opposite effect ... based on

almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lacked the same access to health that other Americans enjoy\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are off and unable to get treatment and the early stages of disease\nMinor illnesses become severe

sleep\nYou're talking about again the independence there those are independence under saying okay I'm not sure maybe I don't think so but yeah I think an investigation should be done\nRight\nSo that sixty five percent of American of voters favor or that an investigation where we are right now\nThe FBI report could be released only to the Senate it will not be made public unless it's leaked uh [laughter] yeah excuse me it won't be made public until it leaks\nAnd then liberals will be screaming for transparency the first time they've screened transparency ah regarding the FBI and oh I don't know roughly I'm just taking a gas the last couple of years or so\n\nOr you know it's interesting that seems like a after a two years Americans are paying attention to probably do the Russian investigation to sixty five percent of Americans mold\nA a you know believe that the investigation or you know into the FBI and department of justice or to see how the investigation started ... a is a is warranted hey maybe there's a couple of Democrats and they're like we said they believed that Trump committed collusion\nAnd they want to find out where everyone and wanting to release it to ... to ... that he committed maybe there's a\nCouple of people in there that actually believe that well I mean if you look at the number I mean that would go\nA you know beyond that uh that typical party line number of just ... you know of the people in the center being roughly wanting a the independence and then Republicans being the other forty so that goes to sixty five which\nMeans there's likely a ... a few Democrats are liberals mixed in that and who knows why they want it but yeah maybe they think that it's going to show that he's guilty but we but we've been saying this it doesn't matter\nWho's guilty of what what was done was done so somebody needs to be brought to justice\nThere needs to be justice in this case but there can't be without transparent\nAnd by the way we pointed out again today because we haven't been able to or we talked about it earlier because we received an email we talked about it we believe it was early last week\nAnd and this is the because we've been getting some questions say what happened to the whole Pfizer warrant application and and and those Twenty one pages we're getting we're getting feedback from our listeners saying hey it's just disappeared for instance there's going to declassify to disappear and what happened nobody's talking about the story\nRight well we did a a early last week when we said because we were sitting here on the air and the Kavanaugh thing was big at that point and we finally are guy just started talking about casually\nOn the air and saying I mean what the world why would you send it to the inspector general\nYou know because what what what they're saying is okay ah there there may be some sensitive things are in here we have some of our allies or we're going to release it ah but ah we're\nA even we have some objection from our allies and we're going to send it the inspector general to go through this thing uh uh uh to go through the saying an expedited way and we went inspector general when he was elected general has nothing to do\nWith whether you're release something because it's sensitive top secret material that would be your director of national intelligence but that might be you might get advice from Mike Pompeo because his former CIA director\nAnd talking about OK what our ally subject to which we heard was\nWas a Great Britain and an information on Christopher Steele that they didn't want released\nBut we still started thinking to ourselves wait a minute why would it go to the inspector general inspector general ... we don't understand that doesn't make any sense he only investigates corruption oh\nSo in the un redacted version they have found information that they wish to give them\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen trunk of the year for only one

essential Narragansett\nAren't men of justice because you look at the aerial imagined that the okay so the president's reviewing that and certainly a you have Kelly in the room or with him and then at advising as chief of staff where do you go with this I can see General Kelly look confess and and the president clearly looking at this going okay\nIf this is this massive abuse of power under the a ... in the Obama administration if that is the case if we if we're seeing what we we think we see here than this actually will require\nHorwitz inspector general to be involved I mean that's going to happen anyway right yes but\nYou take the politics out of it because you let the I. G. to all the investigation on it tell us what happened here\nBecause the I ... going to have access to records keep in mind what it was like for Republicans on oversight committees and really the White House the White House has been calling you know the echoing a the the uh the ... and and the death of a new noses of the world\nAnd calling for the release of those documents by the FBI well guess what the I. G. doesn't have to call for that yeah gee has access to it directly yet so the I. G. takes this\nAnd the president because of the president comes out and says hey we we recognize abuse here we see this based on this\nUh on redacted material now from the Justice Department will that instantly becomes political especially with this president while the president has that authority to come out and announced that clearly and has the authority to declassify that that's not the issue\nYou take the politics part of it away and you also expedite the process of not just looking at these documents but the I. G. has access to everything in the department of justice\nAnd any kind of trail on devices and everything else that the president would ... ... ... it would it would take a million years for the president's call for that and for that to to be handed over\nAnd you take away from Adam Schiff the accusation that you're selectively yes just declassified part of it right because when you give it to the inspector general he's going to cover that part of it okay what are the context of everything that you have released let's expand the investigation and all of a sudden\nEverybody went quiet and the interesting thing is we talked about uh uh that you know Deborah Nunez initially was asked about what's going on here I mean they they could have done this thing and why give it to the inspector general and then he's gone quiet and everybody has gone quiet on this you hear nothing right\nAnd the media is not covering it really the mainstream media I haven't seen one story in the mainstream media about why did they give it to the inspector general\n\nWhy is the inspector general looking at all this they only he only looks at corruption\nRight that's what he's lucky he's looking for corruption in the department of justice they redacted this and all of a sudden they don't release it and it goes to the inspector general well did they find out that it's that the the redacted part is things that the inspector general is actually been looking at right now right\nAnd so it goes to it goes to either help assist in the investigation or the fact is he's got all this material has looked at it already\nAnd it's part of the when you talk about Russia probe Trump didn't say what Russia probe right which one which one because I read it and said oh Russian pro which Russia probe\nWe initially thought you know because I'm On the one time they said well mothers in but there's this winter for Mueller's investigation right but on the tweet he said Russian probe\nRight and I went oh that must have been Mueller investigation that [laughter] [laughter] right might not be you know they may not be the investigation that they're talking about you did well my mother said Russian probe I'm like whoa now look at the\nPattern of behavior in the in the entire history of this this whole thing starting in the beginning of twenty Seventeen right yeah what was that pattern of behavior leaks to the media how many of those leagues favored Trump or almost or maybe exactly zero zero\nSo you have the situation there are people on Capitol Hill and in the Justice Department that are not obviously not Trump on Trump's side\nIf if this\nWhat their Chevy GMC ... Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free on tradition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices log on to flood auto jobs now\nSay it's very damaging on Trump and if that were the case\nWould he also turned it over to the inspector general if it were\n\nBecause it wouldn't serve him politically I don't it's not required to turn it over to the ... right but I don't\nThink this I don't think any of this has any information that Trump was involved in this was all the up yeah in the department of\nJust I Know but what I'm saying is it would be damaging to Trump that they were finding something on Kim ...
