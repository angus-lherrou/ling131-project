when you were looking on the ah the strain issue you know we're talking about it and so it's good to talk to you again on law I wanted to\nBack up to something you said earlier I Believe you're referring to something somebody said about [noise] uh this is the times that we live and and\nI hear that a lot and it's not that I'm trying to argue with you or disagree with you but I think we're looking at it in a different sense that I think it's not really that I don't think that's the case I think it's more it's the media so embolden and they're out there they don't care now that I've been trying to\nHide what Ted that they believe in\nAnd they don't care [laughter] and so because of that they they get so many we find that people that just buy into that garbage and that's why they have this perception of this is the times we live and and but it's not really that I think it's just the media is so abusive but I Want to get your take on that\nYeah you wow you you may have points I should have brought up thank you they know the the influence of the media right first of all they don't hide how they feel I don't know why I think of an entertainer when I used to watch Johnny Carson\nOh uh I never knew his political point of view I suspect he was a Democrat or liberal but he never had it out there now again he was a comedian\nBut but the media is such a powerful role because so many people that's all they hear right the major news channels not so much right now that we have more of blogs and the Internet and all that stuff talk radio\nBut the place to be role and they have an agenda who's the guy from CNN or like the character that it's always trying to get something on Trump I Can't even think of his name ...\nI don't want to learn [laughter] Hays how north a mountain [laughter]\nNow I and my ... and you know I mean right and he wants to publicity yeah and and they don't you're right and I there is any more they don't hide wise they act like advocates if they're not journalists\nOver the problem I have with it is is that this is supposed\nBe a country that has room for all people are all political parties and they're making all about them and that's really an image from a point of view and way to perceive them\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln I'm Casey Lincoln him

no 'cause I thought of it Jim Acosta and you didn't want me to give publicity but that's the guy and loves it it's about and so I'm playing right into you know the name I Know you didn't but I'm showing my producing doesn't have it\nDoes is told me to [laughter] wrong but there there's so many of them he's actors right right they they want to take on the role of being a powerful to and\nMaking them they're not supposed to do that it was like that [noise] I it's so you are to help them and did you win the prize oh by the time who who your choice for president real quick [noise] uh I like Trump\nIdle Stan it's correct when I hear that they don't want to talk about issues and I think I remember correctly that will Hillary was running for the White House or the Democratic party didn't want her speaking about issues\nBecause they knew that she was so ill informed\nBoth top and such\nAnd I don't understand how this country can pick a Democrat\nFor any position that will not talk about issues who will do nothing but\nCall somebody racist homophobic\nMassage in this day and this kind of stuff they getting nothing done when you don't speak about issues ... gets done that's what this country needs\nPeople to speak about issues of ... problems can be fixed the country can be fixed of his heels\nAlthough right now I think is going on a very good direction would trip uh I think all of it gets ... related but if he wasn't running I Would love to see somebody that I think you'll worry it Newt Gingrich\nIs a brilliant man and it and if Trump or in the White House\nOr pets pets as a would be a good also because I think he's learned a lot but I Would my third pick would be Newt Gingrich as I said he's ...\nAnd a thanks for letting me speak in a I'll Wait wait wait wait and yet the lives of\nNo no no you got to tell me who you'd have coffee with on the Democrats' side\n\nProbably an analyst with the war to try to to try to talk to themselves or her stupid head about her claim of being Native American first\nAll right you you got out of it that way it's supposed to be a friendly cup of coffee was supposed to be an angry cup of coffee or you guys don't like because

Need they need to go to jail and they need to give up their money\nBecause money is what gives them the power\nAnd and and without the money and without the power there nothing and we just started

educated\nYou know what do I mentioned Bruce ... was my one of the things you said on my show years ago was every generation has to learn what makes America exceptional over and over again because certainly if the schools aren't doing it and ... knew that if they can document give give them early enough\nThey'd have future generations voters but you're absolutely right they except for people like me they never hear the other side I get both sides they don't even know what party I mean\nBut they never hear well Bernie Sanders can you can\nRun for the office of president and the United states the man is a pure communist I mean and what's your name Hillary Clinton is solid landscape personified I mean it was the rock Obama ... why do we want these people to turn this country into what then is the way it is\nRight why\nBecause you're asking me on our side to it\nWill people don't understand they don't how evil communism used was they don't know I remember I quoted Michael Moore the when they know they have in our capital planning on let me just finish with a whole hold on hold on one thing I quote him you know it's okay\nI go to Michael Moore when they said to him he said he doesn't want capitalism the symptoms or would you replace it with me so we haven't found yet\nSo even there are some people are proud of don't even yeah that's what he said\nUh you're but you're absolutely right because they've never heard the other side and they think the young people think today that socialism is wonderful but I have no clue because\nThey've been taught that I mean it's I I'm sure you were taught civics in school to you're taught how the government works to three branches we had to learn that we had to run a court case these kids today they they don't they don't I mean
