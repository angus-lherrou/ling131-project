and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat up there and he like being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes that we believed in that he went from God to light to pose or in ten years\nOr by the beginning of his his inauguration to the end\nOf his term as president of the United states that is how the modern day liberal looks at him\nThey look at him and they just say wow okay also eat him anymore he's not to think about this is all Obama is not the president like him 'cause you and I talked about is that you know by the by the time we got to the terms\nThat Obama would be the leader we ... item on so predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama because there was nobody else in Feinstein you know or or or pillow she's getting

but\nThey were talking to the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protest the ones who were speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because they're broadcast the six feet and broadcast news broadcasts was over so they went to like Facebook\nSo I'm watching the thing I remember the most\nIs them saying what does Obama done for us remember this was ... twenty sixteen months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen waters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us nothing and I thought to myself\nYou know there because that was one of those\nUh cracks in the foundation if you will of the left although it had started happening before that for me\nIt was telling because you had young activists\nAnd the two that were speaking were African American what does Obama done for us what does Hillary done for us\nThe left or the Democrats that the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the when you don't get the win just because they may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause no it's no rational right and it it it always will be that's why the party has no direct line by right now that's what you get with\nIdentity politics yeah because there is no there's no ... there is there is no general issue or goal ... goals that they actually want because when you split everybody yes when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party having a particular political goals this is probably the closest you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh\nYes if the activists are are are going in multiple directions then then

interesting to know that that's what that is what it has come out in the summary\nWell what's interesting here is that it was likely going to happen anyway but you mentioned this uh believe it was yesterday on the program and and we were we were wondering\nIn this process because of the rule the Senate rule that keeps the details in those three oh two reports a secret and can be viewed only by a hundred people\nThe there is going to be inevitably there is going to be a a summary overall to tell us essentially gay or nay if there is something new there or something more to this investigation in other words something to substantiate the claims by Dr Ford and ...\nAnd that summary of you if you look at it by the the Judiciary Committee is basically I think in part works to the effect\nOf as you mentioned yesterday would they be trying to get some of this information out so the Democrats don't have the claim that this wasn't a thorough background check the facts of the matter is\nYou're

on the uh with uh why is she ... the American civil liberties union national political director they put out an ad where they had Kavanaugh side by side with Bill Cosby\nYeah it's a terrible slander reset and let's put it this way any it'd be a show you ran that ad against a private citizen they'd be sued for millions of dollars a there is no even\n\nThey're not even trying to hide anymore that they're not about civil liberties that they don't believe in the presumption of innocence but I just want to play a part of the interview that back and forth because it gets to the point of being in sane remember the American civil liberties union what are they what why were they created to defend people's individual rights\nTo protect people that have been wrongly accused not just wrongly convicted wrongly accused\nThe presumption of innocence is always the ... the number one thing that evidence is what determines whether you're guilty they existed or used to exist to protect people's civil liberties their their civil rights here's part of the back and forth\nThis is a disgusting at obviously but what's so distressing is that you ran it because this is guilt by association the very thing the ACLU no police stood against ring for instance the blacklist period\nBill Cosby and Brett capital have nothing in common than you and your twin them in order to discredit capping off how could you do that has the feel you so\nAppreciate your comments Tucker the common thread here courses powerful men whose careers are on the line issuing denial about sexual wrongdoing and this and since then since we believe that the denial issued by Brett Kavanaugh goes right to integrity [noise]\nA position that he's applying for on ... on the Supreme Court in what she said some judgment of the rest of the nation integrity is on the critical importance the most important thing about about a hold on I\n... I I agree and I I Would never arguing against the importance of integrity but Bill Cosby has been convicted of crimes\nIn court and we all know that's the one that the ACLU before it was taken over by partisans like new ones defended Brett Kavanaugh has not been so toning them together is by definition guilt by association and unfair\nDo you think that the person your position Twenty years ago would have seen that\nTucker this isn't a civil or criminal trial I think you understand that we're talking about a job for ... pine assessment\nWhen I'm making the standard of proof here is not a brief beyond a reasonable doubt so then why didn't you forget next to Bill Cosby who has been tried and convicted he is not entitled to the presumption of innocence a few of the ... assume that\nYou're saying he's entitled to the job I'm ... I'm I'm not actually hold on I'm not arguing that I'm asking\nYou why you put them next to a man who was tried in court and convicted of felonies and sentenced to\nPrison because they had on than any of those things that individual also denied the accusations I think he would appreciate soccer network criticizing people in the left and I don't care about the left and right I care about the participants to make the country was what she wants to end it and now you hear an eight on\nSo that was amazing the sexual assault has to be taken very seriously haired talker and I think that we're often crowding out the voices of women and believing the men\nAnd not believing women in this case this woman came forward and we're not sure how it certainly is on the circumstance here ... years ago a tale hold on your the ACLU\nYou've don't believe in collective judgment or collective punishment and we've lived long enough to remind you believe 'cause I think I Know more about your organization or you have a lot of the nation\nOkay it's an individualized determination about this woman who had or die and actually one of the ...\nThey could not hear that can reasonable mode so why would you say it's about women being heard when of course\nA snow in one wasn't making one allegation against one man's father Jose ... says there haven't been other men who have denied accusations then ... that we've said all are saying is that in this instance like in previous and says women deserve an opportunity but it's beyond her about hold on suing your endorsing\nCollective judgment and collective jaw managing heart what do you do other women have nothing to do with that sort of the ... is on the merits of the issues against Kavanaugh has\nNot been honest and forthright Tucker I Believe that that had he come forward and said listen\nAll of us were yelling at some point in life we did they know you're getting this last season when they ask with okay ... okay well let me ask you have somebody like one of the time the ACLU is this\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey

defending right now they were low for\nDefining window that Charlotte I'll tell you how do you want me to name another group it's out there hell you know we have all that with people on a different ideological or the other group to\nMore than on the air try this out of it 'cause you know I'm trying to the principle of the memo from your group\nWe're not going to assist in cases that may advancing goals of white supremacists or other as soon as the themes are contrary to our values if you're not defending people who are unpopular who disagree with why do you still exist we absolutely

known it was done at that point in humans with [laughter] right well because they they do draw the line and they are political organization\nAnd let her just let it go learn while you're there and ... and and he read remember when they they said they're going to change right that they're not going to defend people that don't share the same value right hope that you've been you've blown it completely you were not going to defend their rights over there to free speech\nBut again as we've said all along on this issue there had been so many\nOff shoot arguments that had nothing to do with how Tucker Carlson right there was trying to bring it down to no wait a minute we judge this case in our system we judge this issue by the merits of this issue as we said earlier\nBecause somebody else has been sexually assaulted\nDoes not give them their opinion any more credibility on this particular issue the only thing that matters is the evidence to back up her allegation that's it ... it
