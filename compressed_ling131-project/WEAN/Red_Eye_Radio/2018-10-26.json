you can go by so you go buy it and not that there wasn't government spending before but they looked at the acceleration of the increase in spending\nAll over the last year and said that is cause for half of it and the reason that it's important as you know we look at you know everything in an economy and what might affect it we look at the good portions that we've seen mhm we've also looked at the things that can hurt the economy\nThe the terrorists increased because of that the increase in cost of\nOf timber and steel and materials\nOr the you know the the housing up or slow down over the

about was that the tweet\nWas a Donald Trump junior the put it out earlier yeah Donald Trump junior making some a very good points on social media uh yesterday Thursday and and I think on Wednesday as well saying well where was the call for civility when someone sent fake rice and to his residence and and\nIt was you know they've got a ultimately close to to his wife it was intended for him Donald Trump junior and the same thing happened to his brother he was asking uh I forget who was he was asking\nUh in in that tweet or he was responding to somebody else's tweet um but that's that's the whole thing is that there was no call for civility when that happened I mean you see a number of things have happened um that and with any president or presidential family but especially this one\nYou've had how much you know that has happened and been sad\nUm and we have to point out\nBecause Gary laid it out a and thank you might\nFor the call a this was a several months ago but you're talking about when you call someone\nHitler what the threat is\nThen we were talking about civility then that was the setting yes and the media was you know talking about well civility and civility we'll wait a minute when you compare to someone to a arguably one of the worst\nMass murderers in history pure evil you're saying the threat to someone is that guy is capable this person is just like Adolf Hitler and his capable of doing the same heinous thing\nAnd when you do that that becomes a threat that that you're saying that this person in this case the president is the same kind of threats that Hitler was and that's the ultimate\nThreats so the ...\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent if you are for Seventy two months you can be driving on a Ford's also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nRhetoric is one thing comparing him to a mass murderer ... one of the most evil people ever exist on earth\nThat's very different\nAh not only Hitler but when they combine Hitler with fascist and the ... or ... mindset yeah Donald Trump wishes to be a dictator as we've said nothing that indicates set in anything that he has done in any of his executive orders anything that he has fought from the court's everything\nHas in in my opinion about let me let me say this Ninety nine point nine percent of what he has has of what he was promoted maybe somebody can find one percent and make an argument\nThat that will be willing to listen to so I don't want to say one hundred percent ... so Ninety nine point nine percent of what Donald Trump is best promoted or his rhetoric may offend you mhm or his provocative nature may\nUh uh offend you but what is he actually does\nDoes he deserved is it fair to relate him to one of the worst mass murderers\nGenocidal mass murderers in the history of the world right is that even close to any type of accurate portrayal\nNo it's just pure demonization and inflammatory rhetoric and what is it designed to do it is designed to create rage in the people that will believe you fear and right it is not an attempt to have a discussion on the policies of the president\nWell let's look at this and is that too much government intervention no it's Hitler it's the same as the guy who\nAre committed a genocide of six million human beings in concentration camps that's what Donald Trump is he's a fascist let's throw most selenium there to ... you know while rabbits and let's combine Hitler was Mussolini\nAnd let's combine the worst\nBrutal evil people that have ever existed and say that as Donald Trump\nWell of course that's just the most bizarre and inflammatory things that you could possibly say and the other point that we made over the last couple of days is after\nThe Steve Scully shooting a going after the the I Can't think of his name right now but the man who was a\nA you know a supporter of of a Bernie Sanders who attempted to assassinate members of Congress if it wasn't for the Capitol police you probably would have quite a few dead Republican Congress people right now ...\nAh they came to the defense and we're we're able to stop that that situation Steve Sebelius represent 'em ... seriously injured did that change\nThe rhetorical nature\nThe inflammatory rhetorical nature of Democrats at all or have they asked it up to the point of as we saw with Kavanaugh auditor insanity over the last couple of months\nThe reality is it's not going to stop why we live in a nation of free speech and people are are going to go to the limit of their of of of free speech they're going to go to the ... that's just what happens\nIn our society we may not like it people may view it as an civil but it's the reality of where we live and what is the thing that will temper that what will temper that is if they continue to lose elections Americans must reject\nMust reject that and it gets to the it gets to that point and so you know we we have talked about you know also the morality the media\nAnd and this is that we think extremely important when you look at Donald Trump being accused of treason mhm the Russian collusion almost two years of it never ending pounding by the media\nAnd they sit there you know when Sarah Sanders defense and said look it's it's been\nThe the law is against this president coming from the media had been never ending right the source stories that have been inaccurate that you hide behind your sources say well this is what our sources told us well if you can if it's not true\nAnd you can't prove it's true you don't always believe your sources well it\nYou know you have or the remember

incompetence either you don't belong at any you don't belong on Twitter if you're if you're putting that kind of if you're a reporter putting that kind of be asked\nOut much less a major newspaper because there was no proof none still is done to this day\nNothing and you have what a false narrative that has gone on and still goes on and no one knows what more has in front of them know that may change but what hasn't changed I'll tell you right now is the false narrative\nWill think about this it was just a couple of months ago in front of the White House remember they were there for days ...\nBecause of Russian collusion right and trees and the president now we have the midterms it's not even a topic of discussion right it's like okay we can't go anywhere with this lie that we have perpetuated for the last\nTwo years so let's move on to something something else and then they they attempt to walk away as if oh no we barren no responsibility for the instability that happens today or the heightened inflammatory rhetoric that exist today were completely innocent were just reporting\nWhen we're just really don't think it's a bunch of crap right the only thing we're doing is

broken by her\n... that was a law that was broken by her a crime that was committed we know it we can point to it now again it is rhetoric but it's it's the people what they're what the point that

background and we were you and I talked about this when it first you know most about a week ago mhm was first started that\nUh when we came back from vacation and we saw the you know we saw social media\nAnd a lot of Republicans were saying well this they're doing this in order to affect election day and you and I came in and said wait a minute when you see how far away they are and how far they can walk in one day I'm not going to get here to weigh after election day so really this is going to hurt them this is not going to\nHelp the the Democrats\nAre and I saw the story that the president you know plans on sending you know eight hundred troops down to the border wasn't as big of a stories I thought it would be and I wonder that over the past\nWeek at the media has looked at this and said this isn't going to benefit us let's bring it up after the midterms right we believe this is actually helping Trump right and so since this isn't really going to switch is only going to hurt us before the midterm that sort of berry this story a little bit or not give it the emphasis that we were given it before\nYeah I mean it's it ... it is the the um the the political tool at the moment right so\nIf there is a greater political tool than you kind of jumped to that and we'll see where the story goes with the you know suspicious devices or whatever we're calling them now I'm over I suspect that if if they know\nWhere these things are being mailed from there it will only be a matter of time if if if not hours\nBefore they find out or at least know who the person might be\nUm and and and even apprehend them someone had said on Thursday morning\nWas watching some of the coverage and a one law enforcement I'm a expert not not an unofficial or investigator in the case but an expert commenting said it's quite possible we could see somebody arrested were apprehended\nAs early as today and that that's just just based on how quickly it works and how much physical evidence there is in this case\nYou get that and and we find out what the motivation is I guess of the person possibly I'm assuming that they are taken alive\nAnd it becomes again I'm that\nChanges this narrative and and do you go back a few of the media or you're a an operative on the left\nYou go back to the caravan um the caravan sing it kind of paused because of so many I guess I'm concerns along the way now you had um you know the the department of homeland security saying look you know people will be apprehended\nLike they're doing to you and you get a moment of satisfaction out of it\nIt's one of the reasons that they're losing but you and I said this\nMany times when he was true mhm and when you look at the things that we believe\nThey work mhm that's why we promote them that's why we do the kind of show that we do we spend a lot of time talking about this yesterday that's why we break down everything that's why we get down to the issues that had and we get pushback from people on the right when we do that by the way mhm there are some not all but there are some of the right\nThat want to believe the rhetoric they want to believe the height\nYou know you and I and and that's why we you talked about dictator remember when uh we we\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had

we said come on\nIf you look at Obama certainly not religious what do you think\nThat somebody like Obama worships anybody else out there do you really really think that you really think he's a devoted that there is a got up there that tells him what to do and please and so we had some fun with it but we said no the evidence doesn't show that at all evidence batters across the board and we've been pushed back because we've done that\nUh one of the biggest push back we had was when we made fun of jade helm Fifteen remembering wanting Fifteen ... remember the number of people that called us and were furious at us\nBecause we were a mock and it was ridiculous\nOh the government's secret they're going to be in Texas and it's these a secret raids that are going on and and remember the tunnels in Walmart and everything else and\nPeople are jumping aboard this crap mhm and it's pure crap and you buy into it separate yourself from those idiots over their deal with the truth that's all you need to do is deal with the truth not being fantasy bizarro conspiracy theory world\nBecause everyone knows the tunnels were under target exactly [laughter] well I mean we're we're just going to start investing wasn't I'm never forget the I'll never forget that\nMoment in a jade helm ... Fifteen\nWhen you know it was the night we were getting barrage with phone calls you guys just don't understand you don't understand what we know we know we know and that's always the argument from the conspiracy theorists oh you know something that you don't know there are more I feel special mhm because somebody else has told me in and and I know\nAnd this is when they were talking about how top secret was and we had to bring out\nOf the uh a press release that was done from the local chamber of commerce at one of the counties that you know you were going to have the special forces in that had already figured out the economic benefit to their county frightened by [laughter]\nYeah somebody that was going to be spent on runny nose was going to be be be spent that's how secreted was right that the chamber of commerce had done it I mean they've spent over two million on the tunnels under Walmart alone [laughter] you know we we dealt with it we we've dealt with it after the nine eleven conspiracy thrives remember we had to go to\nWe actually had to go on the show to Popular Mechanics and these are people that listen to our show yes so for us it's a constant fight\nAnd you know with the nine eleven conspiracy theories that people were buying into I remember we had to re portions of Popular Mechanics number of Popular Mechanics said look\nI'm we do mechanics ... and so we weren't getting get involved in this and we realized wait a minute that's what we're here for\nThese things these theories about mechanics in physics are being put out there that's what we do let's see whether they're actually possible or not uh what was the other way we uh we dealt with it um we dealt with it the night of the Saudi off brothers oh man\nSo we go on ... we had been getting a information coming in about what was going on and we're in Watertown uh uh about thirty minutes before we went on for about eleven thirty central that night\nAnd we started coverage route twelve thirty when we started getting confirmation of the of those reports because there there was breaking news\nAnd we we continue that coverage or through the end of the show\nSomewhere in the middle of the show we started getting emails this from Boston bombing the other bothering bombing suspects and when they essentially went through Watertown and\nAnd uh that night that uh you know one of them died and the other one uh eventually was captured the later but when you look at the the the\n... about I don't know halfway through the show when we looked at our email that was coming in and it was about well it it then they gave us Pacific names these are the people that they're chasing these are the people that there why are you\nSaying this asking nuts and they were and by the way they were to Middle Eastern names right\nAnd look we're not going to be I don't have\nA desire to go out and be first I only have a desire and I believe responsibility to be accurate if we're because we often report on breaking news we don't I\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one Ninety nine brought will say hello to forge twenty Eighteen Ford F. one fifty so desperate for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at flood forward and essential Narragansett\nI don't because here's what's different about specific names\nIf we if the details do change on on breaking news stories we know that better than most people because we recovered we've covered some big stories over the years the details do change but we're talking about like numbers or maybe okay it was over on this block or it was in this town not this town\nWhat it is a specific name\nIf those names belong to people who are innocent Brian Ross or anyone else that might be reporting something\nThen you start saying that because Brian Ross so they'd be see after the Aurora shooting well right there's information that there is a man with that name that belongs to the Tea Party well how do you know it's the same one you just put that on ABC TV and they got burned and and he got burned big time\nI Believe the goal and it is our goal to be accurate but the thing is is that there were people just they just kept pounding as for the last half of our show because we weren't putting them out in fact you and I it wasn't until about thirty minutes after the show was done when authorities announced who they were chased from\nAnd that always the sunny and we set it on the air we set it on the air that look there's a couple of names out there we just can't verify many legit source that we believe that we have confidence in that it is uh that that is true and and as you mentioned thirty minutes after our show\nIt wasn't the people right\nAnd so again we were called every name in the book we're you know you name it we were called it for hiding the truth from the people\nSee that's the implication hiding something from the people were not looking to hide anything we're just looking to be accurate\nAnd so when I looked at this week that's what we've been focusing on\nIs for the Republicans and the conservatives just focus on the truth\nThat so you can you can passionately attack the other side I don't play their game\nI've said it before they need to do it they don't have the substance of the issues they can't back up their points of view they need it it's out of desperation that they do it\nI don't feel desperate and whether whether\nWhether the side that I favor more wins an election or loses an election right I have never felt\nThe need to use inflammatory rhetoric\nBecause I feel I have lost the substance of my argument two thousand\nTwo thousand eight denied of election night uh you know are they all the power goes to the Democrats and we got calls why aren't you guys angry\n... look it didn't go my way I'm disappointed but I had my say in it well we have been blunt uh I've\nA friend of mine yesterday posted wow you know the whole country's going much more conservative right now and I said look on social issues they aren't fiscal issues or not\nAnd explain it to him the debt and the country is not going the way that I Want when it comes to that Republicans don't care about the debt that we're putting on future generations right they've completely\nJust said let's not even pay attention to it right that doesn't matter anymore what we put on future generations doesn't matter anymore we don't care we think that's wrong for the Republican Party right we think that's immoral of the Republican Party to not be wearing that as a badge of honor every single day\nWe understand that because they are following what the people are doing that yeah the rank and file of there and that's why we brought up that remember that the swamp\nJust three years ago the swamp was about Republicans who wouldn't be fiscally responsible mhm that's gone yeah that's like all that that swamp doesn't even

[noise]\nInternet radio eight six six Ninety right ideas are hunting I'm Jerry Mac murder just reading the New York\nPost story of a from a yesterday talking about how the FBI described the devices as potentially destructive in law enforcement sources told the post\nThat the one first discovered in the mailbox outside the home of billionaire George Soros Monday had black powder on it but a source of brie briefed on that device and the one cent to CNN told all the New York post\nOn Wednesday that they couldn't actually blown up because neither was equipped with a blasting cap or other means detonating explosive materials there was nothing to ignite it there was nothing there are the source\nA set ...\nUh so you know I'm I'm I'm reading that as part of the reference that Andrew McCarthy used that said okay but we're wondering you know talking about the apparent bombers or a objectives you know if\nThey really were not bombs is the objective then at that point purely political in order to make some type of political statement right and that's why the whole false flag issue has come up right\nYeah\nUm I I think that's something that we're likely will learn about in in the coming days if you think about the um the forensics behind such an investigation there's plenty of of physical evidence to work with\nSo we'll we'll be looking at that and and as authorities are seem to be right now focusing on forward as a possible place where these packages or at least some of these packages were mailed from\nThen it's only a matter of time before they narrow that investigation down and at least have a description of not a full on identity or the person or persons responsible for mailing does\nI mean it it won't take it won't be long\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what point and he's really Janeiro or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John job now\nFor Texas high pressure remains clear skies today over the state rain has moved to the east and we'll see it run today from I fifty five and I sixty five north and south\nAnd a good part of the mid west and south will see showers today most about Seventy five will look to see rain later in the day it'll be clear in the northeast the desert southwest and dry in the nation's midsection\nAnd six out of the seven said absolutely not I Wonder what they would say if you said what if Chelsea Clinton came in\nAnd ran yeah would you run or campaign to write whatever right\nOkay good good so ... did did bill and Hillary completely changed any possibility shells yeah we're having a ... career which is why she would only agree to do it if she would be appointed if somebody's stepped down a retired and she was appointed to that position imagine she\nRan in twenty twenty imagine that she just sweat and I mean it was\nJust an overwhelming victory and got her mom standing on background going what really my husband my daughter [laughter] but not me [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter] ah\n[laughter] it's okay you get to be first mom [laughter] ... [laughter]\nAh\nYeah we'll we'll appoint you secretary of making pies\nYeah\nOr is this a out yesterday Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley announced that he is referring Julie sweat Nick and her loyal a lawyer excuse\nMe Michael ... to the Justice Department for potential criminal investigation as to whether they made false statements to Congress about Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and\nGrassley said that in addition to making false statements he is asking the Justice Department to look into whether the two sought to obstruct his panels investigation of the allegations of Kavanaugh\nQuote the law prohibits such false statements to Congress and obstruction of congressional committee investigations for the law to work we can't just brushed aside potential violations I don't take lightly\nMaking a referral of this nature but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future Grassley set in a statement and having any quickly fired back in a tweet saying it was ironic that Senator Grassley has now interested in investigations\n\n... that would be interesting to see where a case like that would go right\n\nYeah um you know you have a number of things there that honestly that that that\nWarrants an investigation I think\n\n... here's here's the question what if anything\nHappens to it after the midterm assuming like the house\nTakes control does it does an investigation like this go anywhere I guess\n\nBecause no reasonable prosecutor [laughter] what would pursue a a a a\nRefer I I I Would have to look at everything the Grassley has but here's what he writes here in light of missed what makes him Mr ... own statements to the media information obtained from committing interviews of her associates and publicly reported information about her and Mr ...\nIt has become a parent that the statements Mr ... submitted to the Kennedy likely contain material false claims rationally wrote him a letter grasses across does not guarantee the Justice Department will open an investigation\n\nIs the last part of that\nAnd well send he sent a letter to attorney general Jeff Sessions and FBI\nDirector Christopher Wray right because\nIf the if the committee words to do I mean if they do an investigation then what would happen about if they found that there was wrongdoing you essentially send the Senate you send a a referral to the Justice Department at that point I mean good\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if you are for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nI don't know everything that Grassley has yeah so I can so and I I ... I can only speculate that if it's you know she claimed the gang rape ... right\nRight right and then but here's the thing\nYou the investigation doesn't go doesn't have to go too far because of the fact that she went on TV on a national television show on the today show and started to walk back some of the things in that sworn statement\n\nSo it's not like you it's not like the uh the the the house and their investigation into the Justice Department where you're looking at you know it's like pulling teeth and getting some of the evidence or documents you have things in the sworn statement that are countered in a nationally televised\nInterview that are different by the same person\nAnd the question is you know what do you do with that I mean does the political climate change if a if the Democrats take the house or you know and does that kind of soften I guess the or or or steal from the the the desire\nTo pursue justice here oh that this will be the Senate's I Know I Know but it doesn't change anything about the sentiment because there has to be that while it was again he goes back to that political will I think again no one is above the law and if you go through the process and this this really focuses on\nThe the if the uh the\nTearing down and the shredding of the actual process itself by the Democrats especially wrong that committee during that process we know that that was the you know the the hearings ... were about Dr Ford but this war was to add a this was adding to a an intended to influence\nThe the outcome of the vote\nOn Kavanaugh the confirmation vote on Kavanaugh it was part of that entire process while it was a separate from Dr Ford part of the camp a confirmation process\nSo when you talk about doing doing away or trying to do away or or completely dilute or shred the process in as well just then then I don't know why you wouldn't at least pursue an of\nA well when we had to come out and said look this isn't a trial this isn't a trial we said well no it is a political trial then and there are things that are similar to a criminal trial which is you're under oath mhm if you commit perjury\nMhm\nIn you know if it is and that's what he believes you know making false statements perjury mhm if you don't that is against the law that you are breaking a criminal law at that point right as we said it's different than a criminal trial but as a political trial that has similarities you are put under oath\nAnd so the circus that we saw going on and I understand we're Grassley has going from if they if he believes and I don't know what evidence she has I don't know if anybody came forward after it I don't know who didn't testify or what information was not brought out then crashed we had that might you know that he might have now so I really don't know but if he believes\nThat he can make that case for making false statements base based on what she said based on the TV interview and based on\nWhat other people that might have come forward have come forward and a might have come forward since then have said to him absolutely he should go forward with that because\nIt is a it is a legal\nProcess where if somebody commits perjury or makes false statements they shouldn't be prosecuted we see what happens when we see what happens when somebody makes a false statement to an ... an FBI agent they go to jail Martha Stewart went to jail\nSo should we said that when a political trial happens because that's what it was\nThat none of the law should be followed at all that people should be able to go in and make a circus of it if you can prove they know you know that they lied and their lawyer lied and their lawyer put them up to line\nShould you go after it I think the majority of Americans if you ask them that generic question and kept the you know kept the case out of it the vast majority of Americans would say yes well because it is it was an attempt I think you can\nThey would probably be able to prove through this investigation that the attempt the the the uh the the motive or what they were trying to do was disrupt the process\nAnd if you do that through false means a well giving false testimony a sworn testimony to the Senate committee is against the law for a reason that that that's what that's about because that is a part\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all

what did they take the house or not this is now in the department of justice which is under the president so I don't see it stopping if they believe they actually have a cat ... because it does this really is at this point\nIsn't about political will because frankly the left doesn't care about sweat no or apathetic no so you know my question on the on the house thing is that stuff in the

reporters he added that some Justice Department and FBI staffer should be referred to the department of justice's office of professional responsibility to determine whether proper protocol was

said before the true grow\nAnd if you listen to the show you know we've been consistent uh irrespective of whether it's been a Republican president or a Democratic president uh the GDP is not the most accurate way it's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way\nIt's never been the most uh uh accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth\nBecause money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way as private sector profits and sales and we believe that that distorts\nThe actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well it's important to monitor the true expansion of well\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense spending no we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how it applies to the economy is doing so without the increased in government spending\nOr you would have had a a\n... a growth rate of of two point five six percent up from the two point two percent from the Obama administration the point is how critical it is because you see the increase you see the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels\nWhich drives the majority of the private sector increase in GDP\nThat's still what's driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector\nIt's still not as much as government spending right\nSince April of of twenty Seventeen that's how much you know we have increased government spending\nOver the last roughly year and a half\nWhen that government spending goes away so does the GDP increase that's why we have been so concerned and we've taken a great deal of criticism\nFrom people who used to agree with us but now disagree with us\nOn the increase of increasing the cost of goods by terrorists and as we've stayed it doesn't matter who you are as a matter of whether you call yourself a Republican or conservative or liberal a socialist a capitalist if you believe\nThat an increased cost in good\nIn the marketplace benefits the economy\nThen you don't know what you're talking about it's that simple\nAnd so that's why we have always been so concerned about trade and about artificially increasing the cost of goods and services when we've talked about the president and the new NAFTA the president's number one accomplishment on the new NAFTA has been what\nWhat he believes he has done to the car industry which will increase the cost of buying a car\nIn the United states in Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder to sell that product made in the United states overseas which was what the president claimed\nHe wanted on trade and we will continue to say this on tariffs the president just all over the place and when you're all over the place on a particular issue one has to ask do you have any idea what you're talking about\nWell and as we are break down the GDP Growth and you look at it right now and the way that there's this long lead and then they point this out on this Wall Street journal article for items like aircraft carriers and things like this so we're ...\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason they do prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nContractors were likely to see some of this growth continue in terms of the defense spending growth a leading the way into twenty ... twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty\nSo what's important here is that you kind of separate that from what the private sector is doing we're the growth is in the private sector or where the lack of growth is\nIn the ... in the end of that you do yes you you do have to\nSeparate the two because government spending even for\nA quick and even though there is a benefit for those companies doing it that's not why you do it right it's not ... it's not why you do it and but also that is the majority of that money mhm of increase in that money is coming from borrowed money is coming from money that the that we are putting on future generations\nSo the economic impact overall may help now but down the line the burden of the debt is going to hurt one works against the other one the other thing is the multiplier effect is not the same as in the private sector\nBecause the multiplier effect in the private sector is if you build something\nThat makes somebody else else's life more efficient or make their business more efficient they use it and it's the combination of building that good in service and the increased productivity along that private sector in line that really boost\nWho really is the true economic engine that that shows that you are having an economic growth
