you knew there in Bay where you have to come to you have\nPlenty of opportunity or are they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee out where they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee ... and the Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over that right\nThere isn't anything of substance that the left has I'm not the only thing the left has is again and it was ever changing\nYou always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman\nOr a you know you ... you never believe the you're never believe the uh the the man you had white males on the Senate Judiciary committee but when it came to the substance of the actual case\nYou know of of the political trucks that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview\nUh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI and a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath\nUnder penalty of perjury for the average job interview so if you're saying it was just like an average job interview or you're a little bit of you were a little bit mistaken it got down to the point where all they had was an allegation and they believe than an allegation should\nBe enough ... really if we reversed roles would that be enough ... really is that where you are now the allegation is enough\nAnd then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well or it doesn't matter the the whether he's guilty or innocent such as a matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yes yes\nWell then you get what you want to have multiple unbearable hide threat allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing that\nThe left are brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify this because we always get those road that's not just the if this was the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy\nThey were trying to get you to buy that the allegation is enough\nThat up a woman says it in this case it must be believed not another cases but just this particular case it must be bullied now I Know that they generally said all women must be believed but then the women that said well why don't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right\nYeah and and so that's what we're being told that the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence uh uh you know doesn't exist uh up for for a man or defending yourself in a passionate way shows guilt mhm\nAh everything that they sure while does not past the rational thought or critical thinking test ...\nNone of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not the fringe Democrats this is the main stream of the Democratic party it is the Senate it is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party\nAnd they're trying to get you just to throw away any mind set of due process site\nWell as we saw even independence when the polling came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that\nAll are witnesses that they couldn't cooperated with the no\nConfirm yeah and and that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers\nUh the the process was even distorted to that extent so in order to facilitate that and then ultimately it came down to one while I was voted along party lines\nWith with what two exceptions really and then other than that that's what it's always going to be and it doesn't matter that it's Trump as president it doesn't matter that it's kept when I was the nominee is where we are as a nation politically right now\nIf Trump wasn't president if it was somebody else yup and he was Kavanaugh was up there yeah it would've been the

show for a while you know for the last couple of years we've been saying if the left truly wishes to get rid of the electoral college in the next step also is to get rid of the Senate\nThere you go yeah yeah yeah Ken delineate ... a reporter at NBC News ...\nOr over the weekend on Saturday\nIt may not happen in our lifetimes but the idea that North Dakota and New York get the same representation in the Senate has to change senators representing less than half of the U.S we're about to Burma nominee opposed by most Americans oh\nI don't know if that's true because I saw the poll but was across America that showed\nA that uh\nIf the FBI did the investigation that's sixty percent of Americans are in favor so I'm right\nWell and I guess they're doing it on the population of the states represented the yes okay okay uh being those fifty senators in this case so then the senators don't necessarily represent\nThe population of the United states\nRight necessarily oh that was that was his point yeah uh but it you know when when we we've talked about this for the longest time that\nUh and we started with freedom of speech few years back when the luck came out and it was the big thing that you know corporations and any group people should not have free speech runs ... that they're free speech is only for the individual\nUh but gun rights or for the groups right [laughter] for the militia but not the individual right and we said no the the bill of rights ah is\nAh about the individual and groups of individual ... because you have two people does not mean that you lose your

change do you what would the Senate completely\nWe didn't know we were going to happen but we thought someone else was going to pay for it\nYeah well lessened more you start coming in and you start changing the very foundation of the constitution and they do believe this is this is really been the game all the law\nYou know the the whole um changing of the first amendment\nIsn't just about protecting their free speech because of the things they want to say and doing away with yours and we've talked about that battle but it's also doing away with the freedom of religion because your religion is big of it\nIt it needs to go away completely because we disagree with the freedom of speech while we protect that when it's a it's our group talking we don't want you to be able to

that uh we don't do when we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything and tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience and the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant not our listeners but others may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision\nOr you know or are there still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about\nAh when that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm skills from day one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course the head of that work\nYou a back them in order to you know uh to to\nHave them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W. Bush or anybody else that came together in most did on the right or for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about\nWhat the work and and and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work there\nAnd why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together or because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure of the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates\nUm but the ... and one of those moderates along the way would include a Lindsey Graham I was just going to I was\nJust going to um mentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the left was motivated because I hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know right to swallow to make them more or whether there'll be a\nA whether they'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know the young people and I haven't seen a change in the ... young people that vote Democrats are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term ... and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight to defend Trump and his pick yeah because if you are defending his peck your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that called\nCollins numerous times uh to tell her how to a vote when you see the colon speech\nYeah and and except for here it's really a ... there were some things I disagreed with her honors and beach or like when she gave\nA Dianne Feinstein the past and the big pass which she shouldn't have done because Dianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with and to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nAh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walked through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins\nDefending\nThe great Trump pick of Brett Kavanaugh\nUm you know you can only fight so much within your own party before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to\nA ... ah get done as a Republican or Republican is we're party right now it's a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is as many when you come when it comes to spending culturally uh probably a more right than they've been in a while\nA more constitutions listen they'd been in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues are there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah ah ah right now and you know and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it you have unity in that party\nAs I said last week like I Can't remember when we had such unity part of it is the fight\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai kid Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free own condition that flood for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred free on cars all it's all models and incredible prices flood onto flood Otto John John now\nEven you know going after sections as he still goes after them as he did others early on made you think OK doesn't really know who is picking does it really of confidence in the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know or what was the spark that drove Lindsey Graham touched still be on the Sunday Morning news show same he'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state\nYeah right you you know and that's it ... because\nThat's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right\nOn issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending\nTo change fiscal policy or to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country I I think we are light years right now to say that this kind of momentum can get us to that point where we can change the spending habits\nI mean for Republicans and their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably away from that because that goes back to again what we said the base uh the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the left while in social media and then the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process of the uh Democrats of California you know not backing her officially\nA for her run and that kind of again that's there's that's an anomaly\nOften on the left they are better than the right at\nLetting the uh mansions of the world and even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do in their state because it gives them the seat ultimately on other and the vote\nOn other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill of\nBuilding building the wall really if you if you think about it that guards guards this nation\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks this is not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process and other items if they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate\nAnd we predicted this the moment they talked about getting away with a good well in the way with the electoral ... the Democratic senators won't before they do that's it's not going to ... no it's not ... but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that and and\nIt means if the because of they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of moving growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which again will never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that power that castle\nIf you will that wall that ... has to be built around this nation to protect this constitution you can get a few things done if you're not unified\nBut I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified over the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence right due process constitutional issues not defending somebody when you talk about those are all ... huge Lee moral issues\nAnd that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they are able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed that is extremely productive and conservative\nAnd hopefully give Trump a chance to win in twenty twenty against state\nYeah ... ... memorial Booker right by the way I remember after the Roy Moore last that's when they got the tax deal done that's when they got that legislation done they couldn't get it done before they lost that seat when they lost that seat that was motivating it shouldn't have been they should have been ...

[noise]\n\nAntoinette radio he is are coming on Gary McNamara a chick six Ninety red eye coming up on the bottom of the hour\nWe'll hear more from Lindsey Graham ah who made us rounds on the Sunday Morning talk shows yesterday some we'll hear from him on a on that the interesting thing is you heard of a representative Jerrold Nadler say that if\nUh the Democrats took the house in a November that they would start impeachment proceedings right a on a Brett Kavanaugh that would mean you'd have to bring all the witness was back again and everything else that would be interesting from what it says especially Dr Ford who said she doesn't want to continue this any longer\nAh and ah you know it does ah I really wonder whether that's just an idle threat or what the Democrats really want much more transparency on the stories of these different\nUh women who met allegations are against\nA a Brett Brett Kavanaugh but as we know the process or even if you did get the impeachment which would be getting a the majority of of Congress you would still in order to remove him have to go to the Senate and there's no way you're going to get sixty six votes in the Senate to get rid of him so he's on the Supreme Court\nAnd he's on the Supreme Court state yes and there's nothing the Democrats can do to do it there's nothing that Democrats can do to stop it\nAnd if they try to do what they do it at their own peril if they end up taking the or the house yeah it's only really uh they're they're going to use it as a motivator to get people out to try and give people a motivated to get to\nThe polls in November beyond November it's not going anywhere whether they win the house or not ah my I guess my question would be isn't a motivator to get Republicans out\nOr is this ... because we can we we've seen it I've probably in the past I Can't think offhand of\nOf of an instance but you know where it was something will come along and once it happens it's like okay we got this and then it seems as if the excitement level to go out and vote is dead I don't sense it here at all I sense there is a a anger here and a unity\nRemember you had a significant portion of the Republican Party that was\nWet\nAnd and I don't believe this is just about ... I think it is about the fact that\nYou have the as I said why'd I think it will Washington Examiner said or a quarter of Republicans or identify themselves as socialist a quarter and a half a Democrat but a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is\nUh uh right now and this and the anger and the unity comes from the fact\nThat they've listened to a Democrat Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party who when you listen to it you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about the mainstream leadership those in the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat are talking insane ...\nThey're talking about things that are completely against fairness and constitutional issues that are just so important to so many of us a

acceptable\nThere is a tough pollen in the New York times today that that attacks you I Want to put some about Frank Bruni writes I Can't think of another Republican whose journey from an anti Trump outraged approach from\nObscene ... was quite so illogical or half a sad end he suggests that you are auditioning\nFor a play is Jeff Sessions as attorney general you're a sponsor\nA Frank you don't know what you're talking about in your world Frank is a noble cause to destroy a judicial candidates whose conservative or the the Thomas lido more now have enough\nOn bipartisan point it makes sense [noise] uh I Try to have a good disposition costs are like my job but don't mistake that I don't care\nAbout the conservative cause\nSo if I made you upset because I Would not want to generalize McCarthyism thing good and I think I can survive in South Carolina is\nWell you know the thing is is that um I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning I'm a second\nOf all I think the momentum from the from uh the uh the outrage that he delivered a there on Capitol Hill that day\nI think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election\nIt needs to be carried through and that attitude needs to be carried through a on important things that that ah that matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows what kinds of other nomination process we may go through a while a Trump still president\nBut uh you know making some very solid points\nUh the what was going to you know they used to it when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right ah Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president the left wanted to use that\nAnd and and\nAnd really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the by porters and willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was but of course you're demonized now you're Hitler\nBecause you stand for something on its merits you stand for something\nBased on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly so well\nYou know the thing is and reading Frank Bruni column and the New York times that none of it relates to the actual\nCase and what he was talking about there it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and you know in Trump is you know Ben ... has been mean to him and called them names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore\n[laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump's side with Trump's candidate I mean I didn't have that really\nDoesn't get what we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump\nIt really wasn't a a Bernie doesn't get that and I don't know I I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump or from Lindsey Graham\nBut Lindsey Graham's a when he issued his concern that day a week ago last Thursday\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case\nAnd the and and on the larger a much larger than a pretty much the treatment of Kavanaugh by\nThe Democrats and and not the not the liberals with the signs outside look right the Democrats on the committee\nFrank Bruni has nothing to read the article he's got nothing well he's your angry he's yeah they're they're their own as I've said we discuss this for the last\nTwo and a half weeks we didn't have anyone I Am not seen any\nRational thought were critical thinking statement come from the mainstream media or the Democrats just said that the position that I hold and you hold which would be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah where is flawed\nAt all except for reading\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit letter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nThat came forward every single point that we have made\n\nWhich are the same what I can see as Lindsey Graham are all legit and the oldest is going to drive the nuts and moral and correct\nAnd right and you're wrong and reading Frank Bernie's column in the New York times you're a simple pin Mr Bruni\nTalked about the actual things that Lindsey Graham brought up gold point by\nPoint and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be lying yep\n\nYeah I mean it is again a the\nThey just lack the will to have the debate they don't have the debate Canada debate so they have to step up and now everyone what Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what well they used to be for Trump now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right\n\nWell from their world absolute loyalty is expected as we've said in the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this all the right over there that's a good nominate that's that's a good nomination pick over there I like that I don't like this\nReal people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bernie can do that\nI can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed with Lindsey Graham yeah and I might in the future\nYou are you running for attorney general right [laughter] what ... what do you want to get her to general what are you trying to get out ... exactly exactly well that's it he's only doing this well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have as he was against Trump and now he's for Trump\nWe've we've said with the simple ten you know a arguments that will never and I called them simple and arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always try to bring up side issues that aren't\nAren't even a pertinent to what you're discussing right\n... and you read British telling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump's fought to become attorney general yeah\nYou know evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because he was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump you must always disagree with Trump which of course is hogwash yes\nYeah it it it is the insanity of the left and and again uh they ... well\n... it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the site that had the greater intellect\n[laughter] I don't try and tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... they keep going for the low hanging fruit band and the and and really the brunt of the

Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nSlander ugh it stunk report or\nOther ... whatever his name is uh uh I think that men do some I think I think it may slow them down a little bit in their efforts because I agree with you guys are going to continue their home this guy um but I think that if judge were super slander or level a\nHe's a private citizen yet he ... he's not on the same rules of capping off down or anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who has\nThey brought in I think it would slow them down that we give them food food for thought\nYeah I I mean you look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically\nNot pursue this any further um maybe there's something there may be their ... they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is fact is that he would\nHave a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but um he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was was was made public\nA through this with with the leak and everything else ah that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the leaked to the media and all of that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting\nYou the names were brought out as a result of the leak\nForward as far as we know she didn't leak it\nSo if that if that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it\nBecause what responsibility do they have in a case brought by ... by mark judge and or his lawyers whoever leaked it to the media would also be partially responsible\nOr for getting his name out there\nAnd that you could see I think ... part of that and you have in any case there that was that was him yes you have in any case eliminate because it's likely to get the of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yes right\nRight right I the only possibility of backlash on the hitters you wouldn't want to put it is a good buddy or do they already\nThe wind is yeah yeah you know got tempered problems I wouldn't want them to think that they're good at it sure does in spite of using his buddy to do this for a spy and\nYeah well they you know it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out\nUh in every up predictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come they use our imagination to come up with things and and thank you a market for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question uh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nUh you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination or as the capital capital did\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge or that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that that survived at all was Dr forge claim\nAnd and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further so that's\nWhy I and and I think can make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so she wasn't trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the ... case yeah\nTo me that would even be a ... and again I don't know who leaked and so I I don't know I'm just I'm On the doctor or right I'm just using right that that is a possible exception here right ah but with the any case\nTo me that's clear I mean it go in going after cabinet all with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time right and there are public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm spiking drinks you know things like things like that or you just you\nCan't say you just can't go out and print that right ... and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm and says then you've got to make your case it's the worst of probable cause while I think it might have happened\nThat's not good enough no no absolutely not so I I like to just do ... personally well I mean well because [laughter]\nWhere the ... the claims that were carried out and how he pursued this what role did he play and pursuing this in the media\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai kid Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free own condition at what board and he's written a generic ... that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices flood onto flood Otto John John now\nOr Hillary Clinton or Dianne Feinstein and so on it's like telling a bank robber I complaining about it\nThough we're ... we're not going to have oh whoa whoa where's the perjury Heidi approved the perjury\nHow do you prove that perjury prime well you know ... if you don't want to take that one guy and finds fang\nOkay well I Know how my ... well my point is we go point by point by what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge poured who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with a ... she has a spy a at a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course\nRight I I I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree with you on that\nAnd I believe they have done it in their promise their their ... I Believe they're promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make a charge of any kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\n... that stock prices followed that wasn't Republicans fault no\nThat was the only guy that was trauma who clearly was politically driven and and that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats to stop\nDoing any of these you know without which are what are they get them but what does this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen massive loss\nIt is but because the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody an elected office would bring these up of these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe've said about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's the which wasn't enough itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email a investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would uh prosecuted\nWe said well it what matters shears the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November or twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call it is not\nAlways that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice\nHaving her in jail\nOr is not as great as not having her in the White House you know here's here's\nThe uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding ... sparks Nevada was responding to\nWhen we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened\nBut he said she said a of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness dating she's lying about it right\nUh you know or it was you know about you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of wins you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know\nThe doctor Ford situation is there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah uh any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can cooperated so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nAnd and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost when he's sixteen\nUh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't\nAh when the seats that they should be winning\nA in a first term of a president in the first midterm afterwards that almost always the party in power loses seats and that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was ah was confirmed ... ah and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explained Clinton wasn't the Republicans and\nIf you're angry that justice isn't always done\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed rates unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent if you are for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nNever charged is because there's a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty would wander charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted mhm and so the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know of some\nOf his bumping gossipy for example Susan Rice sure in fact we laugh when you said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would consider running against Collins and seconds gives me you're the one to lie to him on big gassy now it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line\nAbout a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone in the United states knows its ally for everyone in the United states you could take them and you can show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you could read the law\nAnd and everybody would agreement that's what she did and they would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with that\nCan't do anything about it the best that we can hope for in anything is that the truth is told you I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption and now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to relieve some of this information and uh so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make a ... my ... we're going to give it to Michael Horowitz from like ...\n[laughter] don't give it to my colleagues Minnesota rather than I don't have the [laughter] whatever you do\nGive it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I\nSaid to each other this was on the air when we went Doug\n... is it doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general of the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\nOh wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption ... improprieties right oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not release it immediately\nAnd give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd so we don't know what's gonna happen there but that is true and if the American people if they get the truth and still decide to do the wrong thing\nThat's on them yeah and that's that that's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency on on all of it the whole Russians scandal thing\nWe've said multiple times regardless of where it falls politically as long as it as fully transparent in the process the American people can decide\nBecause we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want an investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want\nFrom three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this is this would play out in the public\nOver
