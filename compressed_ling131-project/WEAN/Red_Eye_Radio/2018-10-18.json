talking with you the last couple of days and I look forward to the next two days and Gary ... is actually the Sunday night Monday morning\nI could easily get used to filling in for them especially because you've been so gracious demeanor kind comments about my work and you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the year next on my Web page at the market will show dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to\nAfter this week I'll next to be on October twenty nights on another show but you again check it out of my Web page there are number of topics I said I Would get to tonight so I Want to keep my word for someone to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now in the air doesn't mean he didn't think about this\nLooking for a car credit not very well isn't it taught you financed with blood born in east Greenwich and never again that have the best financed raise the prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nOn first segment of beliefs and see your response\nIssue is really not that difficult if you'd knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens one of the college last night and you know markets illegal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term document an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or loss them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over if they're legal they're not allowed to be here in the store in another caller said that why you know why is this going on it's pretty simple\nSo as an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lacked the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walks into your say your bank and wants to take the money out of your account right there to be asked to prove that it's their account\nIf they said it was their account but they just tend to have the documents to prove it the bank would not permit them access it's not obvious\nWhich is why you just so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this that can have your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents for years now I've said the left as one of the argument over language\nBut how 'bout they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need the care they cooperated with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harbor and criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that they do these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say the first CEO to jail for hiring an illegal immigrant and they'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun they actually had a right to use the wrong language ... there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government's sending out the wrong message message with actions like ball legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at all a silent they were so happy to have landed\nAt the land of freedom so let's build that wall and do everything to end the loop legal immigration and take our country back tell me what you think an eight six six

B. R. O. [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] Marcus\nBack with you again to your calls at eight six six Ninety ... we're talking about illegal immigration\nAnd let's see what Fred in Washington DC has to say about it I\nThought hey well go ahead\nOh a language that you were talking about one of the biggest wearing things is that you even do it yourself are you a merry you say American what actually we are us citizens in America and\nThe liberals are not a liberal that's called radical there they actually taken that word applied it to everyone on the side of this so when they when they're walking American you know\nWe think that it's just you know there are thinking the other side of the world and immigration means nothing to them I mean this is just normal stuff we have been great\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood what born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason unbeatable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nWorst day in cities and they and they think they're brainwashed us to think that\nEverybody uses American but when you look at your passport if you have won it says us that that's what we are\nAnd that's a huge difference we have to be so deliberate with what we stay or words have got to be delivered and that's that's got to be a main thing that we have to do even on the air because the radicals or taking those words and that's why I say\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that word to name I just refuse to do it I eat when I hear that word America or Americans it would be you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them use or that and just because they think Americans\nYou know north Americans whenever they want to use it for looking let them get away with that oh and you know some of the songs right American the beautiful let that that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them as NATO chance I'm going to do that and I don't want to concede the language and all that is why it's important in legal immigrants illegal aliens I Know people kept me on that\nUm but I don't I don't see anything to him\nAnd and if you do that and then you're kind of giving up a little bit no we're Americans password United States citizens great I get it but there's something special about this country called America where the United states of America America usa whenever you want to call it\nAnd so appreciate your call that's my take on it and now you're national forecast for cobra electrons\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of snow this system\nOn Lake Erie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on I. eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies\nYeah well we don't get me to the Soviet Union I mean you might say well now Russia there are certain countries you know you might say we get paid like the China you might say we give them aid because they take inferior vantage of\nUs but there are a lot of countries where are we going to have those endeavors actually there were\nActually the Russians are helping us more with the satellites right now than we may be helping them financially but that's not your point your point is a good one which is we ought to charge the country's I'm a former their illegals coming here I I I kinda liked that idea\nYeah even though oh\nNo no it's a it's an interesting idea\nAnd it forced them to monitor their own people at that point\nYou know and as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us an airport right a lot of especially Mexico right to send us send us the poor and his ... not our problem right [laughter] you're pro ...\nAnd ... and then you\nCan also add onto that health care bill on the health care bill I'm Still ... villain for every ... basically it will stop dry up a tree or will stop spending here or let me but\nI yeah there's nothing like the right in the Senate and that's the point with right now it's been the wrong incentive you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get past free hospital care right and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this is terrific you you you know I I Would come here to that's why\nThey don't charge interest and we can make money so interest then you know what\nYeah you should have given this idea that President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for the wall\nYou know any better than I Do only about\n[laughter] I don't know [laughter] that's a great call thing Steve appreciate it very much actually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be\nA way up there in the department of education but as a person I send to then I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's the head of communications for I think the department of health\nOr and so yeah it does happen then you know some people but you know what I'm here it's tough and and that's one of the news stories that are I think that\nFlood Lincoln it's southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln and Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Marjorie impeccable surface\nCertainly it's not the connections you want it's tough it's tough and a lot of your points that out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot to become president United States you could say well it's an ego trip this power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and that and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days if they can power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after his tax 'cause they're they're sure they're going to find something there\nThat though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of deal the Russians but even if they don't want business is it um there's\nWhat his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents have done on I don't think they should\nIt's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's one of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know what I don't I I pay what I'm supposed to pay him do my share but if anybody else's business\nBy the way after the cabinet hearings and all this other stuff as they go after his taxes\nWhy to good people exactly why good people want to serve a pet especially people with assets why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider\nDemocrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life\nYeah they're the ... part of that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those that hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they're much more likely to say I want to go back to my family and to my life because they don't believe in this the whole part and that's what illegals don't know what makes America special one of the big things is limited government\nThat government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least\nThat a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what did he do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's really bad\nSo the you because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and you know they say who's the vice president United States they can't name that that's not so important\nWhat's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country exceptional\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get and I don't try to indoctrinate them I give them both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights you're going to have energy\nBut on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible\nThat's why some people question is\nWhy I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military\nI Can't have a tank in my backyard or grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective where the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think well mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were out of the strongest tribe and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they did this because we can I don't I don't trust humanity I I don't trust that\nAnd there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned that\nWe have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant\nSo there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of and the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose\nBut even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this the house has to pass the Senate has to concur and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree he vetoes it and then the house and Senate could override it\nAnd then the Supreme Court could say you pass a law that's unconstitutional\nThey really were afraid of big government\nSo that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special\nBut most do you guys do and even if you're on the left I Want you to explain to me while I'm wrong about illegal immigration gimme call at eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine I'm ...\nWhat their Chevy GMC ...

mind where our ... our whole immigrant okay because well ... ... I mean when the United states was founded on the fact of\nWhat as they say pilgrims land announcing that rock but the Native Americans were already here so that land was taken from them from the beginning that's been about\nWashington gap why aren't they took over the land they decided to get in here and go back over the and get African American leader will will and everything else and bringing back over there to pick your cat\nOkay then once you did that that I don't even agree with that\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nIt's real good to have them up because any of us know that the north won the south laws and then Texas substance they didn't even want to let that blowout very\nLight it with audit city from the beginning we didn't find out until would not dealing with pain but yet the June issue of the other\nSide the twentieth of June Eighteenth sixty five so my point being is this your dad wannabe Ali's walls yeah I Want to have yeah I Want to complain about the sanctuary city my whole question is I'm\n... from\nThe white man is not being in jail for a for\n... billion with these girls you know you got ... in this for one and most of them out and enjoy them away but they're not being locked up for a certain crime and they feel like that's real nice for them to be able to do those things you have comments\nYour last you know ... and I'm all the way I\nCan give 'em well I appreciate you letting me finish on on the show that I'm doing but okay go ahead I'll let you finish but you may I gave a lot of time and again\nAnd okay I mean I'm I'm a cut it out and then you know a lot of times when I look at the the\nSome of the incidents where people have been shot not people I I kinda agree with the police I don't blame them because you say to you know\nHey you should have just you know at here to what they were saying instead of you to do but still I mean I don't no matter how you look at it no matter how you put it out immigrants to a land that was never our than the first place\nNear ... I'm going to the first and I know I'm gonna let it had no if they want to go in the history won't ... was never around\nMe respond okay I'm going to try to respond to okay so I gave it a lot of time\nSo first of all you said something about the land was taken from the Indians that they were here first the only problem with that is there were Indians before those Indians and their Indians before those Indians and there's nobody living anywhere on planet earth today that didn't take it from someone else that someone was there originally\nThat's just what happens in life it's it's you could say it's unfortunate and shouldn't be that way but you need to know your history so even Indians took it from other Indians and in terms of the slave trade you also probably know this may be don't\nMany of the people who are involved in the slave trade were blacks were brought ... I'm not saying was good it was obviously terrible to bring people here against their will but you do you have to put this in perspective\nThe time it was in slavery was absolutely awful and horrible but if it's one country that's trying to atone for that more maybe more than any other country in the world it's the United states of America we understood that that came out you know they have ... no no no it's my turn now it's my turn\nAnd we understood I just had a black person that they are I mean the the overwhelming majority of Americans want the best for all their citizens they don't care about race in color and so on\nAnd the uh I don't I wasn't sure your last point I wanted to respond to it\nAh but then you said that the police when they do do some shooting I couldn't tell if you were trying to say that they ah they were not being responsible in some cases sometimes that does happen someone gets shot never should have been shot and they're they're they're good and bad policemen they're good bad talk show host\nBut in general you probably know the two most blacks are ... murders by blacks or buy from other blacks and in the inter many inner cities they want more police not fewer because they want to be protected I actually I'm going to keep going on so go ahead now you respond\n[noise] [noise] okay and like I said no matter how you look at it the one thing I can say if I Can't say anything about\n... president I appreciate everything he's done because the out he had done what Air America dirty laundry is that everybody sweep the racism under the under the rug like his dirt now that it out and being forecast that\nWould everybody would you got you have Republicans that gets to me\nBecause how he how and how he acts or whatever the case may be ...\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again for foreigners over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine promote flood of every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nA lot of ... like a lot a lot of people you often get mad at this man I Want to but the one good thing that he did bring about in this country with air the fact that the racism and hatred in America alone it's horrible it's horrible\nWay way way way where so where is he wears the race will see me with the lowest black\nUnemployment rate maybe ever but we were exactly see racist or ... I didn't catch that\nI'm not saying like I said he aired the dirty laundry this country had been right that for many many years but\nEverybody wants to know that now I say I didn't know that is done and you know I didn't ...\nRadio station ... because yeah very therapeutic expect black the beep to respond on here\nNo one would expect anybody responded by the way I'm by the way you kept saying my people I thought we're all Americans that we all live in you know read the same air as John Kennedy said we're all in this together ... ... people on your side and by your side I don't mean color I mean values in politics people on your side I have a group mentality I\nDon't see people that way I see people as individuals and\nI Want you know I like people to share my values are way way way way back no it's not your turn now I'm finishing so let's not talk over each other\nI Would be happy you may have heard me say this this week I'd be happy with nine a black women Supreme Court justices if they shared my point of view because I don't care about color and it looks like you do\n\nYou still there oh didn't you know and if you didn't make me I certainly didn't I just wanted to know that maybe something happened here we dropped her but uh\nYou know it's just it's it's sad because the old you are there some rations here yeah there are some people still think Elvis Presley is alive\nSo you can account for that you know there there's always going to be knuckleheads out there but the overwhelming majority of Americans want what's best for every but they live their lives they don't care about color did we make a mistake\nA long time ago we did we paid for that and try to make a difference and I think she's at our President Trump at least the showing how bad things are no I think the country's doing fantastically that's what we did last night\nOh how great the country is under President Trump yours says some things he shouldn't say but you notice they'll charge him with stuff like he's a racist but then they can't name anything to prove these races right\nUm [noise] it's very discouraging when you get calls like that might people I Love that phrase my people what do you mean then are you are people who are the one that's carrying about ...

won\nFlorida is more problematic you're correct my hand the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that\nUh we could be were behind in the governor's race I think the senatorial race is is also a iffy so that will depend on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal votes they can get from people outside of the country and the Democrat side\nBut you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate I think we're going to offer as individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm concerned about to have to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation is and I'm In you know Florida or Texas but um I don't understand you know I also don't understand why\nThe money when you look at the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrat who live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states\nAnd you don't they understand that they're going to have a ten percent tax if the governor's race is one by the Democrats in Florida\nAnd he wants to do a lot of radical things and you got as that gentleman a couple of callers ago said you know the states are they can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer\nHealth care they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't\nYou don't understand that for their own their own them being down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrats in this and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand that as I've been saying tonight is it's very hard to explain to conservative Republican positions especially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are ... are on the surface if you don't explored the oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about and I turned ... at the same job necessarily\nA and that it wouldn't make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of left this than liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now 'cause they know that I think the overwhelming majority of American people do not want to go through pitchman again I was wrong I was for it and with Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection\nUm people's of American people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing the saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did the gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leaves leaving that aside\nThey treated him some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and so they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the wave announced that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think at uh eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national forecast or video roads blocked\nEffect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dust\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars\nAll makes all models and incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John job now\nEerie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure\nAnd that means clear skies rain for Texas continues today we're looking at close to two months worth of rain for some parts of central Texas\nA solution to something else so you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing\nI Lived in Asia and I kept my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have the baby yeah of course they could go wrong with the babies late I guess very late\nBut then they figure out how to take advantage of you were dumb laws that that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville or Jeremiah\nGetting runners mark Yes sir hey I'm you're on the market you know well great\nI'm well I'm a recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant um well I wanted\nTo make sure that everything was okay we got married\nUh got married and then she ... she left she's gone and it's the fast track to a green card now the way they have you ever heard of the way they act and\nI'm just not just touching up from what the previous the previous speaker was talking about um\nYou know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here illegally have a have a you know get pregnant\nAnd then just totally disregard everything and then live off the government um you can't get deported you can't um you know all\nThat I don't know if you've ever no I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then\nThey want to just stay here and and uh it\nIt it's an amazing thing I'll I'll go on my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience I'm I'm having to live with it you know with a lawyer ...\nEverything I guess you don't ... you don't see your child and\nNo no um they do restraining orders I'm under the way they act as the women against violence\nUm act um\nSo if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here it's the fast track to a green card and\n... and you know um I I Would probably I've run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on talking about father's rights and what happens is the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to George in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nMoran Mart\nI keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a lab stone soup\nBut I think it's also a misnomer we do not have illegal immigration we haven't in Beijing going oh these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we're being invaded by the failures of each other ...\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nIf it was any if it was their military doing it we would be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and it happens because there are people on the other side of having agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America has said the United states they just see it differently than we do and they\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than any dealer around because we're surrounded by buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our high car buyers\nAt least one of his top and issues and the American people responded and I think they did it correctly let's go to somebody could calls here and let's go to San ... while loosing Pennsylvania I probably missed that up standing around with mark\nOh thank you mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate it I'm actually a Jersey in who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped enemy territory for a while\nHopefully we can get ... out of their\nUh God but uh I was calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where I heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people\nIllegals not only voting but bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and I was sick and um\nYou know how to stop that and if you remember like during the ah was when we were setting up governments here in Afghanistan or Iraq after the wars that we're taking a people who are voting and dying their ... you know their thumb purple\nYou know they wouldn't vote more than once\nAnd it seemed like if we could do that overseas why couldn't we do that here so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once and and uh you know disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nWell you you you know the whole controversy over voter id that the other side made money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's the big crime to ask someone to you aren't let me see if you are who you say you are\nSo you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal but you know the oh we're being races were made this how could you do that yeah I don't know by the way my position is different than most people I don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put some for some effort I'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I think also a about\nA year of the voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I'm saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes in to vote and you know you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that\nAnd while you're there voting wherever they just\nTake your picture\nAnd start the process of creating a voter id then you're already there\nIt's not like you had to go someplace to you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of person and say you a digital camera feed it into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area\nAnd see if that per person pops up\nIn another ward or district or state on the same day and you know like you said a digital camera you could check and check and see if they voted\nPreviously on that day and age but at the same time he could be starting of voter id for you know they sign that you got the picture you do that you have their dress\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know you go back and you bring the the id to them mail it to them and uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them\nTo see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered and more than one place\nAnd well there are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voted for something I think he was often often evidently I Know that do but there's another point I bet you didn't think of\nI don't know that your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures\nOr they can't even find my name is the Pennsylvania yes or no I didn't know originally you know I'm right right so you go in the ... who are you oh Martha and that's you go over to that table you're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out\nAnd if I ever want vision for visual valid yeah it is scary so if you had it also gives them cameras to take the picture I don't think so but you have stand you\nHave some ideas but they're not going to work I have a great evening\nOr tell you one one thing I did have a winning the vote one time it was a primary\n... group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nAnd uh\nAnd he said oh yeah yeah you you can never write in doubt I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nAnd it was like\nTotally amazed they say well you know what's going on you know and he said well uh oh oh you know you're a you're wanted vote Republican goes uh or or Democrat\nI couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do or writing ballot and I says well you said I could and he says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in dollars\nRight you know I I thought it was I thought it was gonna be worse than I thought it was gonna say you can only a
