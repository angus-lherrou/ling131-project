certainly is red eye radio and smart guys for back with you again I was with you in September for weaken as I said a straight to the fact that you can have had a great time talking with you the last couple of days and I look forward to the next two days and Jerry ... is actually the Sunday night Monday morning\nI can easily get used to filling in for them especially because you've been so gracious to me and you're kind comments about my work and you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at the market will show dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to\nAfter this week I'll next beyond October twenty nights on another show but again check that out of my way there are number of topics I said I Would get to tonight so I Want to keep my word\nOr someone to talk to you about illegal immigration\nFlood Lincoln is southern Rhode Island's for me or luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln and Casey and the only twenty eight Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nDay in my position the issue and you guys were bringing up the last few days so I thought I Would focus on in the first segment at least and see your response\nIssue is really not that difficult if you'd knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens one of the college last night said you know markets illegal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term document an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or loss\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over\nIf they are legal they're not allowed to be here in the store in another caller said that white you know why is this going on it's pretty simple\nSo as an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lack the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walks in tears to your bank and wants to take the money out of your account right there to be asked to prove that it's their account\nIf they said it was their account but they just didn't have the documents to prove it the bank would not permit them access isn't that obvious\nWhich is why it's so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this that can have your house in banking count if only they could find the misplaced documents for years now I've said the left as one of the argument over language\nBut how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to care if they cooperated with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that said these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and it'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRomney actually had a right to use the wrong language soft and then we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would venture to say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they'd be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough for the government sending out the wrong message message with actions like ball legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United bites language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Alice island they were so happy to have landed\nAt the land of freedom so let's

I. M. W. B. R. O.\n[noise] Marcus\nFor back with you again take your calls at eight six six Ninety ... we're talking about illegal immigration\nAnd let's see what friend in Washington DC has to say about it my friend\nHey well go ahead of a\nLanguage that you were talking about one of the biggest blaring things is that you even do it yourself I used to do it but I'll marry you say American what actually we are us citizens in America\nAnd the liberals are letting out a liberal that's called radical there they actually taken that word applied it to everyone on the side of this so when they\nWhen they're talking American you know we think that it's just sitting here now they're thinking the whole world this whole side of the world and immigration means nothing to them\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on affords also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nAnd they bring war so to think that we're saying citizens and they and they think they're brainwashed so that's the thing\nAnd everybody uses American but when you look at your passport if you have won it says us that is that what we are\nAnd that's a huge difference we have to be so deliberate with what we say words have got to be delivered and that's that's got to be a main thing that we have to do even on the air because the radicals or taking those words that's what\nThat's what I say\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that word to name I just refuse to do\nIt when I hear that word America or Americans in me you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them use or that and just because they think Americans you know north Americans whatever they want to use it for not going to let them get away with that oh and you know some of the songs right\nAmerica the beautiful that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them as NATO chance I'm going to do that\nAnd I don't want to concede the language at all that's why it's important and legal immigrants illegal aliens I Know people kept me on that\nUm but I don't I don't see anything to them and and if you do that and then you're kind of given up a little bit now we're Americans we passed for United States citizens great I get it\nBut there's something special about this country called America where the United states of America America usa whatever you wanna call it\nAnd so appreciate your call that's my take on it and now you're national forecast for cobra electrons\nAn area of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit's you can look for ... hours throughout the day and then in the region and in fact Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots of showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news there is showers will be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas are going to get about another inch of rain today\nYeah well we don't give any to the Soviet Union I mean you might say when now Russia there are certain countries you know you might say we get paid like the China you might say we give them aid because they take an unfair advantage of\nUs are right but there are a lot of countries where are we going to have those endeavors actually they were\nActually the Russians are helping us more with the satellites right now than we may be helping them financially but that's not your point your point is a good one which is we ought to charge the country's um for their illegals coming here I I I kinda liked that idea\nYeah even though\nNo no it's it's an idea\nFor them to monitor their own people at that point you know\nAnd as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they lost his sentence they're poor right a lot of especially Mexico right if I send us send us the poor and his ... not our problem right [laughter] you're ...\nAnd ... and then you can also add onto that health care bill of health care bill um ... we've got one for every\n... basically it will stop at the origins of all the stops here or living but\nI yeah there's nothing like the right in the Senate and that's the point right now it's been the wrong incentive you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get past free hospital care right\nAnd you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this is terrific by you you you know I I Would come here to that's why\nThey don't charge interest and we can make money so interest then you know what\nYeah you should have given this idea to President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for the wall\nYou know any better than I Do only about\n[laughter] that's a great coal thing Steve appreciate it very much\nActually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I'm thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be\nA way up there in the department of education but as a person I send to than I think eventually he was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's the head of communications for I think the department of health\nUh and so yeah it does happen then\n... group wants your car any make any model what pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nSays leaving the administration it's tough to work there especially if you're a conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it's tough it's tough and a lot of your points that out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot\nTo become president United States you could say well it's an ego trip this power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days if they can power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after tax because they're they're sure they're going to find something there\nThat though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of the all the Russians but even if they don't what business is it of there's\nWhat his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents have done I I don't think they should\nIt's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know my I I I pay what I'm supposed to pay him do my share but it's not anybody else's business by the way after the cabinet hearings and all this other stuff as they go after taxes\nWhy to good people exactly why good people want to serve ... especially people in that sense why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider\nDemocrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you had to live your life\nYeah they're the ... part of that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those said hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they're much more likely to say I want to go back to my family into my life because they didn't believe in this the whole part and that's what illegals don't know\nWhat makes America special one of the big things is limited government that government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least\nThat a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what are they do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's really bad\nSo the you because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and you know they say who's the vice president United States they can't name that that's not so important\nWhat's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country exceptional\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get and I don't try to indoctrinate them I given both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights you're going to have energy\nBut on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible that's why some people question is why I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military\nI Can't have a tank in my backyard or grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective where the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think well mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were had the strongest tribe and Eighteen century and when asked why they did what they do this because we can\nI don't I don't trust humanity I I don't trust that and there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night some caller mentioned that\nWe have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant\nSo there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of and the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose\nBut even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this is the house has to pass the Senate has to concur and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree he vetoes it and then the house and Senate could override it\nAnd then the Supreme Court could say you pass a law that's unconstitutional\nThey really were afraid of big government so that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special\nBut most you guys do and even if you're on the left I Want you to explain to me while I'm wrong about illegal immigration\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the

frankly is not a concert halls any US law maker there are many things happening in this country which are much more important than what happened to one individual or what may have had one individual that other country for instance\nThere are children in this country who are victims up sex trafficking uh mhm\nSexual violence et cetera and you don't see too many federal law makers proposing laws to curtail that personally I like to see a law on the books that would make it a federal crime to victimize children because they are one of the most intercept\nMembers of our society um ... eventually these individuals are going to grow up to become adults and they're not protected as children what type of all adults can we expect them to turn out to be secondly I'm\nI'm a lifelong Democrat

kind of a kind of us did obviously yeah I agree with that and of course we know some of the stuff that's gone on in the oval office that's why I mentioned President Reagan wouldn't walk in there without his suit and tie and I've learned I'm not always agree\nOn this though I I as much as you guys who are Democrats can't stand a Donald Trump or George Bush for that matter I felt the same way about a mile but I Know I've learned if he walked in the room you give credit to the office of the prison in the United states and you stand\nUp to like him nobody didn't couldn't wait for him to get

don't know about Texas but\nI don't know if you have any insight to what's going on there I Know that I'm a several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida after that terrible hurricane last year and the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because\nThey can vote or in in Florida I don't know what insight you have you heard about those two states and I had relatives who live in Florida\nAnd I really can't say with them because they're they just do not want to talk about politics\nYeah that's another topic I have down for tonight I don't know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side of you still get to keep them\nBut I Do have inside in Texas I I think Cruz is going to win I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's their fool's gold like he was for Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time although we finally won at\nFlorida is more problematic you're correct my hand the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that\nUh we could be were behind in the governor's race senatorial race is is also wifi so that'll depend on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal votes they can get from people outside of the country on the Democrat side\nBut you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate I think we're going to offer as individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm concerned about to have to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation is and I'm In you know Florida or tech this but um I don't understand you know I also don't understand why\nThe money when you look at the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrat\nWho live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have a ten percent tax if the governor's race is one by the Democrats in Florida\nAnd he wants to do a lot of radical things and he got as that gentleman a couple of callers ago that you know the states are\nThey can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer\nHealth care they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't\nYou don't understand that for their own their own them\nBeing down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrat to invest and and you know be\nTrying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying tonight is it's very hard to explain but conservative Republican positions especially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are on the surface if you don't explored the oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about and I'm Talking about the same job necessarily\nA and that it wouldn't make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of left us than liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know\nThat I think the overwhelming majority of American people do not want to go through impeachment again I was wrong I was for it with Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection\nUm people there and people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did a gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leaves leaving that aside\nThey treated him so badly the American people tend to be very fair and and\nSo they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when do\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nNinety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national forecast or D deal rose law\nAn area of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit so you can look for showers throughout the day and then in the region and facts Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots of showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news there is showers will be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas we're going to get about another inch of rain today\nA solution to something else so you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing I Lived in Asia\nAnd I think I could get my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have the baby now of course they could go wrong if the baby's late I guess very late what did they figure out how to take advantage of you are dumb laws that that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville or Jeremiah\nGetting runners mark Yes sir hey I'm your on your mark how're you doing well\nGreat I'm well I'm\nA recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant um well I wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married\nUh got married\nAnd then she ... she left she's gone\nAnd it's the fast track to a green card now the way they have you ever heard of the way the act and I'm just not touching up from what the previous a previous speaker was talking about um\nYou know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here illegally have a have a\nYou know get pregnant and then just totally disregard everything\nAnd then live off the government um you can't get deported you can't um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever no I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant\nAnd then they want to just stay here and and uh it\nIt it's an amazing thing that I'm going my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience I'm I'm having to live with it you know with a lawyer ... everything\nThat I guess you don't ... you don't see your child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders I'm under the way the actors the women against violence um act um\nSo if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here it's the fast track to green card and\n... and you know um I Would probably I'll run as time this week but I was going to have someone on talking about father's rights and what happens is the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to a Georgian Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nGood morning Mart\nI keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a lab stone soup\nBut I think it's also a misnomer we do not have illegal immigration we haven't in Beijing going on these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries\nAnd we were being invaded by the failures of each other ...\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nIt was any if it was their military doing it we\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition I was born in east Janeiro against it that's right over two hundred free on cars all all models had incredible prices on to flood Otto John calm now\nThis is absurd\nIt is absurd and it happens because there are people on the other side of having agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America has in the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against him President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issue and it's not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded\nAnd I think they did it correctly let's go to somebody could calls here and let's go to Stan in while loosing Pennsylvania I probably misled ups and you're on with mark\nOh thank you mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate it I'm actually a Jersey in who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped your enemy territory for a while hopefully we can get ... out of their\nUh God but uh I was calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people\nIllegals not only voting but bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and I was thinking uh\nYou know how to stop that and if you remember like during the uh when we were sitting up governments here in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war as they were taking a people who are voting and dying their ... you know there are some purple\nYou know you couldn't vote more than once and I'd say like if we could do that overseas why couldn't we do that here so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once and and uh you know disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nWell you you you know the whole controversy over voter id at the other side of the money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's the big crime to ask someone do you aren't let me see if you are who you say you are\nSo you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal but you know that oh we're being racist remain this you know how could you do that yet I by the way my position is different than most people don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put some for some effort\nI'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much here where we get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I was thinking also about\nA year so the voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is\nAnd I'm saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes into vote and you know you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're there voting wherever they just take your picture\nAnd start the process of creating a voter id then you're already there\nIt's not like you had to go someplace\nTo you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of person and say you a digital camera feed it into facial recognition say in the in the tri state area and see if that per person pops up\nIn another ward or district or state on the same day and you know when you said a digital camera you could chicken chicken see if they voted previously on that day\nAnd age but at the same time he could be starting a voter id for you know they sign that you got the picture you do that you have their address\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know or you go back and you bring the the id to them mail it to them and uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them\nTo see if they're voting and more than one place if they're registered more than one place\nAnd well there are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voted for ... I think he was often evidently I Know that do but there's another point that that you didn't think of\nI don't know how your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures or they can't even find my name is the time by Pennsylvania or you know originally\nYou know I'm right right so you go in the ... who are you oh my that's\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty Eighteen Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the
