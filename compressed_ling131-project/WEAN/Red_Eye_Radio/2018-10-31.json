immigrants because you can I mean that that the fortune ... was passed after reconstruction it was about former slaves everybody knows that for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nThere is a line of showers and thunderstorms today extending from Detroit down to Texas and we're going to see this line of showers continue to progress eastward slowly today as the front becomes more pronounced will see the showers extend into Dallas in central Texas\nWith some heavy thunderstorms likely for the architects today and the same band of showers will then move up through portions of Missouri southern Illinois central Indiana and northern Ohio to include Detroit\nSubject to a jurisdiction means more than simply being present in the United states\nWhere the fourteenth amendment was being debated in the Senate center Lyman ... figure in its strapping an adoption stated that quote\nSubject to the jurisdiction of the United states meant not only know legions to anybody else send up quote mhm and senator Jacob Howard who introduced the language of the claws\nOn the floor of the Senate contended that it should be interpreted in the same way as a requirement of the Eighteenth sixty six civil rights act which reported citizenship to all persons born in the United states and not subject to any foreign power\nOr the Supreme Court has never decided otherwise now the problem is though as\nA ... let\nMe see I've got the ... right here in the Eighteen Ninety eight ruling that that is being brought up by many people on the let me see Ninety eight ruling in the wrong Kim arc case the Supreme Court held the children of non citizens when born on us territory are us citizens by birth however\nThe parents in question in the long case were illegal immigrants meaning of the court did that they may have had it in their opinion but they did not address actually the status of children born to parents\nIn the U.S illegally they made that claim but that was not a a case where they actually made you know a decision on it it was an opinion in a case but not directly involved in that case right that makes it at that point\nBeing is that the parents were here legally right the parents were here and even though they said it did cover it\nAs he writes here he goes what the Supreme Court has held this will not go back to Johnny spent\nThe Supreme Court has never held otherwise some advocates for illegal immigrants point to the Eighteen da da da da da says is wrong and art but that case merely held but a child born on us soil the parents\nWho were lawful permanent legally ... residents was a citizen even though they said in it they expanded it out that wasn't part of the law so they actually did not create legal precedent to that point right\nNow the only other problem that the the the presents\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nOf course when you understood why they pass the fourteenth amendment to begin with you know after reconstruction you know it had to end the civil rights act of Eighteen sixties over right right where you knew what that everybody knew it had to do with former slaves yes that that's what that's what it was all\nAbout because the parents are of of those children being born the children being born slaves the the parents in that case were not subject to any foreign jurisdiction\nNow that the problem is because I as I said I don't believe will see it in our in my lifetime I'd I'd be you know that's really a dump statement because who knows how long I'm going to live\nBut [laughter] but if I Lived Thirty Years' war All right let's throw out a figure for Thirty years I'm you know I I I still don't think we'll we'll we'll see it because I think one of the road blocks is look the president's right I agree with the president on this uh\nBut the problem is the Congress in Nineteen fifty two added to the immigration and naturalization act\nThey added a portion that basically\nAgreed with the way that the fourteenth amendment was written they said\nWe agree with this this is the what immigration should be this now they didn't get they didn't specify and they didn't say a children of illegal immigrants become citizens all they said was we agree with that\nAnd so the court probably will looked at that saying well since at that time\nThey didn't say we disagree with how it's been interpreted and we disagree and the law should change and you know when it comes to illegal immigrants because they didn't make the change\nThat many judges in the federal system including the Supreme Court might just say well that's up to them too they they interpret it that way or we go back to Eighteen Ninety eight and even though the the courts it's not technically legal precedent wasn't opinion are based there that the court might just refuse to hear it\nRight\nAnd send it back down to and it may never get to the point of talk of defining what jurisdiction mean a venture early we will get a bench lead someday we will get to it but it took two hundred and over two hundred and Thirty years to get to the ... was it to hell or two thousand eight\nWas it two thousand eight hundred thousand five\nTwo thousand I forgot about roughly two hundred and Thirty years it it ... it it took ... to finally have the Supreme Court interpret the second amendment yeah that it was an individual right\nSo a two thousand it well time flies so\nThat that's the problem and that you you have you have to word it the exact same way I just don't don't see it but\nThose are the legal challenges that you face right now that the Eighteen Ninety eight opinion that's now law which are again this is where the fourteenth amendment was not written specifically to address it\nAs a true construction as she would look at it and say doesn't say it applies to non citizens\nAnd in order to apply in order and and you would need to that's how I Would do it as a construction is doesn't say it if you want to stay a differently than say it differently\nBut it but it doesn't include it but will it ever get to that point where they even\nThe Supreme Court actually hears and the whole goal is to define what subject to the jurisdiction of the fourteenth amendment actually means will we ever get to that legal place is my question Brian again I just I don't see it in the next\nThirty years I'll throw that out for example\nBut it's a way to start the ball rolling\n[noise] ... yeah I mean I I think ah it certainly brings up the the debate and we if if the president is you know going to take action near through executive order then you're going to see it in the courts the question is will the high court\nTake a case like this and and so when you look at the question yesterday where I struggled when I heard it I said well it's really the wrong question kind of president do this with executive order will of course he can if nobody challenges can\nDo it effectively as the question and and right now he's not going to be able to do anything effectively ... the only thing is is that it was a political reaction to the the care of it ... a too well illegal immigration in general um and and\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free own condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices flood\nOnto flood Otto John jobs now\nAnd the approach maybe that's the point maybe the whole point is let's see if we can if if that's the cause they know full well going to be challenged\nAnd so at that point you you decide when you know you're going to announce this now we understand to the\nUh the political leverage that that is is created quite possibly a by just the announcement of between you know now and and ah well six days for about the mid term\nBut beyond that it is also something that I think in the current political climate that has to be discussed\nBecause ultimately what does it do\nNow it it it brings up the discussion but I think it gets us closer to and hopefully somebody on the right will position the Democrats to finally say that they're for open borders mhm\nSo that's you know that's part of the I guess that's the political side of it the effect of it the legal side of it will be interesting but it won't be quick ... this isn't going to happen\nOr\nIt the the executive order will come out and it\nWill be immediate an injunction immediately will be a new media\nBlock from the courts and then they will go into the courts and it will sit there for however long it takes to get ...\nAnd I don't go to see if it ever get right and this is something that I I I again I doubt it would be fast tracked no because because it's it's not like to travel\nBan right that affected people immediately right\nSo it would just not jailing with what ... what what what you could make the the executive branch could make the case and the travel ban that there was a an immediate threat\nThat we had people traveling from certain parts of the world that had been trained and that were coming here and that yeah it was reasonable to review that process that travel process from those parts of the world\nAnd and that was something that they could make a the the case for in this case it's not that kind of wild many conservatives might say look at it is a it's an immediate threat or has been a threat for a long long time the problem is\nWell get technically it has been for you know a hundred and fifty plus years but it is not something that is going to be fast tracked because it is it is not adding any kind of

doesn't matter from what we know or the FBI still hasn't said whether those were alive explosives or not in fact we know one of them was not the one cent to CNN right we know that was not\nA but when you look at it when you\nLook at the reaction of the media to similar instances one and and those are the these are envelopes sent to the politicians in power right now and two appointed individuals'

it works for their side they stay on it for a long long time they will it ... it is the story but it doesn't work for them politically\nIf it's the other way around if the other side is targeted and\nWe can send that reminder to a ... of what happens is ... and the attempted assassination of multiple Republicans that something ah Don limited CNN apparently needs to be reminded of\nOh yeah I saw that yesterday that did come up yeah yeah impacts police wrote a a a toy box yeah you have to you know to that one right\nWell the interesting thing is as they talk about the fact that hateful and

Gary McNamara you know we spent the first hour the shows are talking about the fourteenth amendment and birthright citizenship and\nAnd all that you just made an interesting point here because we we had gone back and and as others have been\nAnd you know did the research of the original writing of the fourteenth amendment ... senators that were involved in actually writing it and you just made the great point here during the top of the hour you just are in our mid show meeting when you said\nWell because we talk about the citizenship clause which was authored by a a U.S senator from Michigan and his name was ah Jacob power\nAnd during the debate of the fourteenth amendment he described it he actually talked about the intent of the citizenship clause\nWhich was to exclude a it would exclude Native Americans who maintain their tribe a tribal size\nAnd persons born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers and when you look at that because historians have gone back over this\nYou have a lot of legal scholars right now saying well no because it didn't get specific what do you we often go to legal precedent and and everything else and certainly go to this is not exempt from that they will cite legal precedent\nUm but there is no greater in my opinion there is no greater legal precedent\nThan the description of the intent\nBy its author the clause had an author who was very vocal during the time of the debate\nAbout the intent of that clause there is no greater president\nSo we can go back and talk about our founders well what they intend to what they are and we don't always have on record\n... you know the the the the thought behind a what our founding fathers set up for us now we go back we have the debate and I think you know the interpretation has been a ... in terms of\nMany things are but in terms of the constitution um\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a

decides to say uh that the president can effectively changed this through executive order that this would have to be an act of Congress to change this\nIt would have to well it would have to be I mean what would they say would have to be an act of Congress or would they have to be a ... another ... under\nUnder lemon yeah I'm ... it's I guess\nBecause at that point now you're approaching interpretation\nA them essentially having to interpret and and define at the highest level the fourteenth amendment and and really outline who would applies to whether or not it applies to the children of illegal aliens\nAnd then you'd have to go to the Nineteen fifty to a a part of the immigration naturalization act ... that gets section I Believe it's I'm just from memory fourteen or one as we met earlier that the word Congress said okay you know we ... this is this is the law does Congress except the with the fourteenth amendment here\nAnd so you'd have to go back to Nineteen fifty two the justices to say OK did anybody even bring up the birthright citizenship that it didn't include it in any Congress person or anybody who uh you know who who submitted this bill to Congress even bring that up\nBecause as far as we know that that wasn't an issue at that point why they did it more research has to be done as to why Congress did that in Nineteen fifty two and what that specifically met\nOr if if ... were to decide to define who would applies to the uh the citizenship clause if they were to define clearly Ina decision I don't think this is going to happen but if they were to do that would that normal fi\nThat law from Nineteen fifty two\nIf it is if if the law says otherwise and the constitution the fourteenth amendment or the set is no ... ... ... all day to fourteenth amendment is clearly defined it if the if the Supreme Court heard it and the Supreme Court said\nNo here's what it says then the what Congress did in fifty two would be gone that's what I mean oh yeah yeah oh yeah the ... that notified that law also right that they could one one fell swoop and and that's the interpretation bunch means that route as much as you think about you have to get past\nThat part and that is what I don't see happening no no I said earlier I don't ... I don't think they're going to get to defining a very clearly what they based on interpretation who the ... look at us and shipped clause applies to and\nWho look it up a gun lawsuits over the last ... probably ah you know two hundred and forty years of the country and and the two hundred and Thirty years before Congress irks me for the Supreme Court finally saw the second amendment as an individual rights ... it took that long right even though to me was absolutely clear that it was an individual right\nAs it was too many of us because we knew what the founding fathers thought going back to the federalist papers and you could figure that out quite easily and still it wasn't defined for over two hundred and Thirty years and eight six six nine to eat right I\nWas told that he ... he wrote a [noise]\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accidents three miles than registered and joined the million mile club on line at red eye radio show dot com red eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nThe tough tested Bowers lead is on the road the tough tested truck we'll be traveling the country at truck shows truck stops and national retailers across the U.S stay tuned to read I radio for up to date to information and be sure to follow red eye radio and tough tested on Facebook Instagram and Twitter\nFor information on tour stop prevents and promotions if you see this truck take a picture posted on Instagram and be entered to win great prices at hash\nTag tack this truck keep listening for us for the next stop near you\nAttended an owner operators you tired of chasing empty promises RSVP is looking for you to join their team offering a dollar Seventy five per mile for ... drivers for two dollars per month for teens RSVP he's all miles that hadn't back home or not in their vocabulary\nThey're no treatment rentals need and I know some secrets are I think today at eight RSVP three six five that's a A R s me Pete three six five four apply\nOnline an RSP P.

up showers and thunderstorms today extending from Detroit down to Texas and we're going to see this line of showers continue to progress eastward slowly today as the front becomes more pronounced will see the showers extend into Dallas in central Texas\nWith some heavy thunderstorms likely for the architects today and the same band of showers will then move up through portions of Missouri southern Illinois central Indiana and northern Ohio to include Detroit\nA so an act of Congress can certainly be changed and overruled by the court\nNotified by the ... yeah so that's why you know if if if you if you had Congress come out\nToday and and pass a law standing look you know that the Nineteen fifty two law was just an you know an assertion that that we believe in the fourteenth amendment but we as Congress do not believe that the fourteenth amendment covered birthright citizenship that's up to the Supreme Court\nTo decide because we don't clearly see it in the in in the text and we believe that you know and and you you pass this law and so we we you know we either we either pull that Nineteen fifty law out or we amend the Nineteen fifty law\nTo include the fact that we're not making a a a judgment on birthright citizenship because that I don't think you'll ever see Congress do that I'm saying they could do that for a and and then at that point the the courts would say will Congress is looking for\nWhat we believe on this to begin with now we're never going to see that that's a complete total hypothetical delusional [laughter] you know delusional scenario 'cause it's not going to happen but I'm saying they could do that but because Congress in Nineteen fifty two said that many believe that the courts will use that\nIn order to different said nope sorry I'm\nThe Supreme Court gave that opinion and Nineteen Eighteen Ninety eight even though it wasn't a precedent that was that\nIt was an opinion the opinion lean that way Congress didn't object to it when they basically approved of the fourteenth amendment in the Nineteen fifty two law so sorry you don't have standing as the executive branch yeah they could do lower courts could do that in the higher courts might refused to hear it\nBut it has never been my my problem is\nAnd this is where you know occasionally we'll talk about the failure of the system I believe that we as a nation need to have when you have a a law\nThat clearly is and how it's been interpreted is not an amendment to the constitution which is clearly\nNot being viewed by modern society as the makers and the writers of that amendment and the people and the legislators that voted for that amendment back a hundred and fifty something years ago\nThat the Supreme Court does have to step in the times they did for they did with the second amendment that was two hundred and Thirty years yeah a lot of federal precedent not Supreme Court precedent but there was federal precedent in there that was said precedent to their the Supreme Court came in and said sorry uh owning a gun as an individual right yeah yeah\nYeah thank you Scott we appreciate it I because yeah that\nThe the\nArgument is often well it's been in place for so long this is what we've been doing up to this point that's really not a legal argument\nYou'll hear that if if they were to take this case if the if the let's just say this word fast tracked uh the the president issues the executive order it's challenging gets right up to the Supreme Court and ... and quick fashion I'm In the hearings you could you're going to talk you're going to hear the impact\nBut the impact remember is on would be on on on children that would be born to aliens in in in the future\nSo it's not on it's not even though we're not even talking about the legal status of anyone who was born here up to this point\nTo a parents who were here illegally that's not going to apply that's not going there is not going to be any grandfather ring of a revoking the citizenship of someone who was born here up to this point it would be those children born in the future to illegal parents\nAnd that's who would apply to and there's a certain a behavior there\nThat this ... that is not immediately effected right\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nThe word temporary how many different times because the media was making it play out like we were shutting the doors for ever\nOr on people coming from certain parts of the world and and it was ... you know again it was played out and it ended in a different\nIn a different way the media but it's not going to it's not going to be it wouldn't be the same in in consideration fear of what the impact would be because the impact would be future\n... but I'm a I'm afraid what you're going to have is you're going to have judges look at this and say\nCongress has never challenged what they did in Nineteen fifty two they never settle with\nCongress has never or there's never been a push to change the way in Congress the way that this law has been interpreted the only thing from the Supreme Court was the opinion that just was not a legal precedent that was set that they believed it was an Eighteen Ninety eight and Congress has never fought that\nThere's never been a serious legal challenge it has been accepted that the interpretation has been there for a hundred and fifty years and you're going to have judges even construction is judges even cabin on Gorsuch may look at it and say\nWell\nThere really hasn't been a fight over this the second amendment there's always been a fight over in a fight going on constantly for that\nAnd constant precedent being set on that on birthright citizenship maybe not so much and they may look at it and say it's been this way for a hundred and fifty years it has a specific law about a specific type of behavior that we allow were gun rights could be every gun issue was a different issue in a different law in a different state\nAnd they might look at it and said this is pretty clear that the interpretation whether the author wanted or not but the interpretation taken and accepted by the country for a hundred and fifty years even if the author that was not what the author of the amendment thought\nIt's been accepted all the way back not just recently that it should be changed that back in Nineteen Ninety eight that was their opinion of the Supreme Court\nAnd a lot of judges just don't want to touch it because they don't want to be the ones that change what they believe the country has come to a consensus of rightly or wrongly I'm just saying that's what they would\nThat's what I think we're I think it's going to go ...\nAnd it's a shame because you know and these things will happen in in any uh you know any republic any constitutional republic where a law can be passed it'll be vegan somebody will take an interpretation and it isn't challenged\nWell and and that's that's what I Would say is that the ... it doesn't matter what society it doesn't matter how new or old the challenges if it's a new challenge that's never it a new challenge means that no one has ever stepped up to travel\nI I agree I agree with you on that is why it took two hundred Thirty years to get you know that guns or you know you have an individual right to bear arms in this country\nEvery Eighteen Ninety eight case would be different because you had parents who were here legally you didn't have the question of ... what about the parents who aren't here\nRight legally but the opinion there was an opinion written which wasn't a precedent that right made the claim that they are writing that every court did which may be used and saying okay that opinion was out there it's not legal precedent for but nobody ever you challenge that and they were doing it at that time they were still allowing\nEven at that point you could be an illegal immigrant in this country and since it's been going on for ... it's not like it stopped for a hundred years and then came back again magically\nMhm that's the problem right well it hasn't been challenged ah so that's the question\nDo we ignore it because it hasn't been challenged because nobody challenged it or no one sought to to find that claws\nWell\nI I agree with you I Will leave without question you have\nSomebody on a ... a lot\nA you know when when you see that when if I was a judge and I say well look let me look at the average like looking at the federalist papers for the constitution you can't just look at the constitution say well I'm going to flip a coin\nAnd and see where it lands that's going to be my opinion you go back and you look at the first ... or the second amendment as many of the justice as the justices did you say okay what's in the federalist papers what were the founding fathers thinking when it came to guns why did they want the second amendment what was it about and once you do that\nYou know that was the original intent and you\nKnow\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the

six Ninety read I we go to Vincent in Las Vegas Vincent welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nHey I'm not sure if I tell you guys all discussion but uh but what was I don't understand why some people are sad or playing the birthright executive\nOrder proposed by Trump or the president is stupid 'cause ... clarify law by on\nMy understanding why can't a president clarify what the actual author and you've got to talk about Jacob our intention in order to enforce the fact that the fourteenth amendment does not extend to aliens or people vote for a nation giving birth in our nation\nWhile the the executive order does not necessarily a clarify the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment it may attempt to but then beyond that the court challenge ultimately if it got SCOTUS it would be the job of ...\nTo interpret that would be the right out of his ... you wouldn't be as job of his lawyers to defend it but the secular border in a self\nOr is an executive order to change what the immigration\nA law is right now under birthright citizenship the explanation would be in the ... that his lawyers would give where he would try to make that point of clarify in the original author would be in the actual right\nIt would yeah and the actual court case so the executive branch's interpretation of it is not the the final say now now and I am very pointed out\nThe president could write the executive order and if there were no challenge\n[laughter] that's a fantasy but if there were no challenge than it would it would stand and it would be the law the when well yeah 'cause that was the question going on yesterday which I thought was a stupid question\nKind of president regimen executive order to change the law and and what it hold on [noise] well yeah sure he could write an executive order for ham sandwich [laughter] nobody nobody challenges him yeah then yeah but it's going to say there'll be an injunction\nAnd there'll be an injunction and the law will never to which I find like would be a brilliant move by the president and or the attorneys or or the Justice Department maybe some input her idea and she's here to say that\nYou know left attempt to get this at at at least\nFor the president I think it's it's a it's part of his his fight whether you want to put it just purely political or not it is part of the campaign promise from two thousand sixteen on controlling the borders and I think it's worthwhile fight and then we're with him on that on the spirit of it and thank you for the call but ultimately\nIt is going to be about\nUh you know getting it to the Supreme Court to have that interpretation or at least the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment if it got that far I don't run out of the I I don't I don't I don't believe it ever will but\nBut still though when people say well he's just does she just campaigning\nAndme\nOur air and it it will not viewing this is part of the campaign promise from Saddam's not exceed that's my mind that that was where I'm going exactly is the fact that well he's not campaigning\nI could see if you're upset say he's just campaigning for example when you've got Democrats\nWhen you when you when you got to Claire McCaskill trying to paint herself as a Republican fried just who happens to be running as a Democrat yeah now that's something you should complain about because she's not telling you the truth right when you when you have now when you got many Democrats trying to portray themselves as oh we're not part of those crazy Democrats on it I don't know where\nWe're very very moderate they've gone back to that that you should be upset about when you campaign\nBut Trump as president\nThis is what he's always campaigned on and one of the reasons one of the major reasons he's he got elected was illegal or immigration\nAnd immigration issues across the board so anything that he does well he's doing it just to ah just to the campaign before the midterms well on the caravan thing the only way you could make that point is if he financed the caravan which I don't believe he did\nI don't think so and therefore when this was happening he's doing what he believes you should do my\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the whole new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nSet about her college strictly campaigning strictly campaigning is what the Democrats are doing trying to pretend they're Republicans ... right exactly that's a campaign that you should be upset about\nBecause that would be an action and I the president clearly knows this is going to be an executive order like this is going to be immediately challenged in the ... he knows that so he is setting it up for the fight but it is also part of the positioning yet politically\nAdded to that I told you about an old old friend of mine who I saw here in the last month and when I had last\nAsked the question a few years ago how many cats and dogs do you have no she said seven cats and for dogs ...\nWhen I saw her recently I said hey how many catch you have now and she said well I have four dogs I said oh what I said what nine cats ten thirty three\nThirty three cats yes her and her spouse actually put a extra room on the house so the cats can walk in and out to non heated room but that's where the cats can stay in congregate together well but thirty three\nThat's three cases of cat food a day [laughter]\n[laughter] I I don't know which is the name\nBut the study claims that human compulsion to seek out animal companionship is one of the primary factors affecting our climate by the way the two idiots overnight told you this was coming along time ago Belgium we told you this would be next\nResearchers at the University of Sydney in Australia claimed that those one hundred and sixty three million patch that'd be detrimental impact on the environment from the food they consume to the waste that they produce\nIn the U.S there are more than one hundred and sixty three million dogs and cats that consume\nAs a significant portion of their diet animal products and therefore potentially constitute a considerable dietary footprint the study proclaims ... here the energy in animal derived product consumption of these pets in the United states is evaluated for the first time\nAs are the environmental impacts from the animal products fed to them including Finkel production\nThe problem isn't just the United states now or just not the United states though the popularity of companion animals has grown worldwide Americans are the largest pet owners in the world and I don't mean that means we're the fattest pet owners are we on more pets probably both\nBut tradition of pet ownership in the United states has considerable cost as pet ownership increases in some developing countries\nEspecially China and trends continue and pet food toward higher content and quality of meat globally pet ownership ... compound the environmental impacts of human dietary choices it continues\nThere's only one solution no more pets\n...\nReducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar help that emotional benefits would considerably reduced those impact the study concludes one of the things we're talking about is the fact getting rid of your dog and getting a rabbit because\nThe dog eats meat and the rabbit ones or the or that test okay settles yes so so what do we do with the dog\nWas supposed to put the dog down or\nJust after this dog not get another one hey I never search for a cat and\nI rescued one it rescued you let's be clear right by the way you're not the only person that sets that to me this week yeah I think we all know that\nAh [laughter] and a\nAs a black cat just ... Halloween Halloween you know the funny thing is ... I had I had a a bad few weeks ago and I had all the autumn stuff up already I had a a a smoke detector\nActually the smoke detector I thought it was a battery but smoke detector went defective and it beeps that provide right I'm In a row yeah\nThe tallest part of my house of course so I you know so it's like fourteen feet up but I've got this incredible ladder wide base and everything else and so I was like you know Tim Allen very excited to bring that ladder out and really tested capabilities right so I get up there in ...\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont flood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\n... where I got a little studio there piano all that stuff so but it's way up so I get up there take it off bring it down realize it's not the battery so I order a new one on Amazon mhm takes a couple of days so do I take down the ladder not leave the ladder they've it or leave it why take it down yeah the letters there for a couple of days\nAnd I keep noticing that the cat lack that keeps walking under the ladder oh that is good luck with all that's on my ... should I be worried about yeah that's a good luck thoughts I never had before yeah uh but\nUh there's only one solution no more pets reducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets but offer similar help and emotional benefits would considerably reduced these impacts the other choice researchers recommend is having your pets pets go vegetarian\nNope something that's not recommended by veterinarians are animal health and welfare experts who can see that having some type of meat based protein is best for your pets yes particular those for whose ancestors were carnivorous yeah I Can't get my cat to eat a carrot\nNo no\nI mean so uh are there you go the study of the researchers say isn't designed to dissuade animal lovers from taking in the maximum number of pets possible yeah it is yeah that's actually a point but to encourage Americans to consume\nLess meat so that's the point All right I see what they're saying keep your pets you go vegetarian I'm literally falling to stakes right now I'm going to you both of them today\nI might have to go by a third one just because this article is making me hungry for meat\n[noise]\nMy favorite one remember this because that ten years ago I think you and I were the only been working together for a short time uh-huh remember the guy that came out that said that we need to get rid of all the cities in the United states right and we need to have cities no bigger than\nTwenty five thousand people ... and ... what was it was it over half of the people have to go yeah we don't want to go to I think was more than half we're gonna have to take them somewhere where do you do with him I don't know like we have to [laughter] what do you do with\nAnd who decides who goes and and I think it was out of the of the probably the closing in at that time seven billion people we only have like one right ... ... what do you do it to me\n[laughter] what's what's your plan I they are just going to be the weirdest lottery you guys ever heard of but here's how it works\n[laughter] are you committing suicide first is that\nRight hey
