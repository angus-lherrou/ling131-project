deplorable now\nAh and as soon as you look at you know parts of other cabinet isn't part of you know ... isn't part of the whole Trump ism thing\nRight he's he suffered from that can believe that we've talked about how many never Trump or as we mentioned this last week how boom I said ooh wow all of a sudden they are absolutely\nIn in support of of a cabinet and furious and I haven't talked about the never Trump or is that I Know that had built alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump and now they're fighting with each other\nBecause when it comes down to it\nWell except maybe for Bill Kristol [laughter] the one the one holdout [laughter] except for except for Bill Christ that I haven't seen anything from George and it's like ... yeah exactly so you know if

casting\nAnd it and you know and it's a great point spent twenty six years in public service and the hope what what and that's why it's not about him what I think it would I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh I think it's the realization\nFrom\n... from ... I think you're the realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump yeah and don't like where the Republican Party is going where they've realized\nUh we got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case you're Cortez yesterday said the writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what\nAre the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of innocence is is gone when an allegation itself is enough to destroy someone's life\nThis goes beyond a political issue it goes to what one Trump the election it is\nThe it is the culture war but it's also and and and I say a culture where because it's a war on it it's it's it's about it's about fairness it's about the belief in the constitution look\nWe don't we were never tremors we've criticized Trump when we were we were never on that never ever got about ... we voted for\n... are you and I don't practice political high dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see us in rallies going ra ra ra whatever my candidate does we will tell you who was the best you know who has the best idea and what particular issue and why\nAnd we end up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not everything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults will see that what do we know\nMay [laughter] [laughter] I mean we don't really know for as I read Rick Perry and one of his ... one of his first interviews after dropping out of the election and twenty six being you know well uh you know I guess he wasn't your first choice\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nStarted making alliances with people on the west yeah you know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people but I Know that are never Trump hers but all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this\nI mean you really ... this is what you really we it wow\nWhat will you know we thought you know this is almost like the McCain funeral what we thought that there were actually people out there in the Democratic side they don't want it to come together to find the common ground that we have and now the realization is no they don't and and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call look the party isn't perfect\n[laughter] if you listen to the show you know when we talked about the Republican Party\n[laughter] or or listen to the pocket from yesterday show [laughter] but the the the party isn't perfect but again everything's when you get to this point of the actual election it's a binary choice\nMhm it's a choice between this group and that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one\nAnd I think that's what a lot of uh never Trump or is looking at right now saying\nWhoa you know who you know when when um oh it was it a try to think of the the the the person oh oh yeah yeah it was ... was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump rather vote for Hillary right yeah\nUh I I thought this would because I I I saw that a a Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that and I saw it on social media and a lot of people furious excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary and and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now well except for Bill Kristol\nA and and uh that uh Jonathon is it ... they're at a use it on Fox News on the on the the the money block and I think Fox

I mean it's going to go down to the ... but I I\nI Do believe that because the ah Republicans most likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats will do everything they can to claim\nFor example is Adam Schiff has done all along and Adam Schiff ... not on this but Adam ... who will be talking about uh the whole a Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bomb shell\nOr out of a of a DC uh yesterday about the James Baker ... uh uh apparently telling the house or the house uh uh I don't know which handle it was\nBut uh in in test closed door testimony yesterday telling them he talked to the Democrat the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got the warrant right and and and James Baker top FBI official\nA at that time which without question shows that politics played apart and he talked to them about\nWhat was going on me talk to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is absolutely\nThe wrong thing to do right now you cannot nobody can defend that in an investigation so it's getting to where you and I ask questions over a year and a half ago is this where this is going and we ... you know what I'm saying is every question that we asked\nAbout where this where what might have happened here and what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on has come true\nIt is all come out in a in a series of reports you know if you look at it it it ... well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we could say right um that well first of all one of the first questions\nThe big question really was there a potentially is there\nAre we looking at possibly a gross abuse of power under the previous administration that that uh a person or persons\nKnowingly used false information to which is a the Giuliani pointed out you know there's a there you have it there's your your your perjury um but they they in soliciting for that or Pfizer court warrant\nWe'll get to that coming up falling off the top of the hour might point out Adam Schiff is though Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can't see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and out of the feeling the Democrats did the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah I Know in this because the Republicans won't release it so they won't release it all they know the Republicans won't release of because Republicans\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like flood out of town\nSo I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here in the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here\nIn the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours the rest of the show go home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM [laughter] so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in the ...

anything they want to but they they don't they can do\nHe's the no it's not he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah they can't scream that\nWell they they ... ... email us ... screaming all day long but they'll get nowhere sank anywhere with it\nOkay 'cause I've heard lawyers you know try and\nNo show that judges short recused himself oh Yeh straight out our well you know when\nThey lose the electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process we should change the way that Supreme Court justices are seated than we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules right\nAh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah I Can't remember we've even there's been some cases ... said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves or I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past and I remember I Can't\nWait we're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they receive the down the it got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argued a case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if it or\nOr there for example they're arguing the case of deals with the law you know with the company and their wife works for the company and writes for the economy here at that point you have to recuse yourself\nBut to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't ruin anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them that's not going to hold any more\nYeah I Do you remember when the talk about ah you know his nomination this is back during the Gorsuch nomination process uh the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister\nYou know and it was like okay that's [laughter] she would have to recuse herself from every case of that [laughter] well that company\nIs indirectly working with my brother's company and that and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that ah well she's part of his family but\nThe the\nProcess and you and I were having this discussion during the break\nThere is a great deal of respect by everyone that seated on the court right now for the process\nNot that they make a decision that we don't always agree with in fact a a while I can think of free that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but we can talk about that\nBut the procedure\nOn procedural issues all of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court\nHave a great deal of respect for those procedures and how you move forward with the case uh it is not it is not driven like the social media world of today\nAt the Supreme Court in terms of procedure\nNow the hearings often how these interesting comments that come out of him and questions that come out of them and then the media takes them and runs with um\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit letter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nPoint by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the\nFederal judges to begin with is not the social media world that I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that it's not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know that a former Justice Scalia\nAnd Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great great friends were great on Mondays to make that their their their family their families used to\nVacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we have and said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges\nPrivately what they believe about the process of Kavanaugh is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because they don't even\nTo the door this is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine\nControlled by the Democrats that keeps this\nProcess of the background checks secret and the content of the three oh two secret is likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is\nIf this uh if some content came out just imagine that we never her doctor Ford's name but the ... came out what they would do is look at that and go okay well is there anybody backing it up\nBecause the claim would be in the three oh two except if they found that they couldn't find any anyone with first hand knowledge of the event\nOr the claims then they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well\nThey know the Senate knew back then\nThat you take something like that a simple plain\nThat cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but here's here's the point that nobody's talked about with all the federal\nJudge to south or forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out there that background checks are done\nHow many thousands of claims that are uncorroborated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands\nOf allegations are made that are uncooperative I ordered to defeat somebody and never get known to the public eye only reason this one did\nWas because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rule ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the Senate complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority that is a more construction as well or journalists court and then\nLearning of this this rule now that puts it all into perspective she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI to vet as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official three oh to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nWhen it would have never it would if you know ... when you think about that that's the whole point\nNobody would've ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... ... we're not would not have been able to\nCooperate and then at that point it dies just like probably the thousands of other allegation s ... you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices\nOver the decades and that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now what makes sense as to why Feinstein for her politically white work to her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it\nNow you

other the other breaking\nNews and and this is really huge when you think about the whole Russia investigation over the last of a couple of years\nOr this it's been a you know a reporter that there was an explosive testimony or yesterday by a you know Well hi FBI law enforcement official a former official well the hilltop Tom John Solomon\nA has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out a\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney from Perkins Cooley the Democratic National Committee private law firms\nJust we we like to do this because we can do it within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats that ... used you know they accused or the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original a charge what we found out since that time\nWas and nobody disputes what I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee in Hillary Clinton's campaign gave money to their law firm Perkins ... law firm ...\nWho then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the Kremlin\nWhich was unverified still to this day and verified in order to uh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump\nDuring the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it to destroy the legitimacy\nOf his election after he was elected a lot of that information and that dossier promote we know it was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and so now we know that right before that the FBI\nLead counsel met\nWith the law firm Perkins too we\nThat really when you look at it they're the ones that started you know the the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign but we got to the law firm they were the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers\nRight and I would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and lead agents were there to question the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others in that law firm\nThat would be you could just easily I guess\nA compartmentalize that as part of an investigative process\nWhy would why would the counsel for the FBI do\nAs they say well as well as he says to talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was lawyers\nMeeting with lawyers right why why not an agent's asking some questions of the attorneys no it was attorneys and attorneys meeting\nSo former FBI general counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee he's private law firm that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay research firm fusion GPS\nWho then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy to compile the dusty a oven cooperated Ron televisions alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a Bible testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell\nRhode Island's number one born dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like flood out over time\nTrump yet failed to disclose that information to the ... court in October twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nSo high that Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed\nA Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to divulge the testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the Perkins cui law firm\nAnd the FBI we've often stated that said I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four yeah you can do a couple of season though you could do probably more seasons then law and order a couple of seasons of it because we've always broken down\nAnd since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking so many of the important questions on this and when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack\nOr changed because of change then to hack end or to change the outcome of the election and in reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones who colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump and verified\nInformation still today yes\nAnd oh by the way if it's on verified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's fall after [laughter] after ... after over two years right so and and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that\nIt was destroyed the legitimacy of a legit presidential election in the United states\nAnd they tried to do it by taking that information\nThat information and and just well faking it as intelligence instead of opposition research to the Pfizer court to spy on the Trump campaign exactly the accusations they and they still make it against Trump\nYes they still make the say he's treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party and all those things that I just brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole Pfizer court ... everybody knows it's true\nI don't know of anybody decide or or that as\nIt tried to even debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at ... news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out\nUm and what was going on the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together in the last two years here's the problem\nWith having something go on for so long where it is active because it is still active Mueller and his team are still working which means it's still relevant\nEven though right now on the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's the problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario\nWhat you think about it I didn't even applied to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right\nThe longer that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story start falling apart as more\nInvestigations go on as you've seen you know with the ah the ah you know ... right or a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains you know a note cooperation for these particular stories right\nThey they go nowhere ... and so the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth\nAnd like I said more of the truth of what we've seen of what the Democrats did would die and Feinstein did you know the the the fact of you and I talked about this earlier the fact that they actually could have kept her name's secret yes\nNow that we know how background checks for gun yet and they keep it secret they could have kept her name sacred now we know the process", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city":
