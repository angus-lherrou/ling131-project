B. R. O. [laughter]\n\nIt's run by radio he is Aaron hunting and I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety or read I we\nGo to Mary Ann in Michigan Marianne welcome you're on ... Radio Welcome to the show\nUm I I really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down there the number of races like you said a including perhaps at a political agenda\nWith respect to some businesses but the thing about it's about our country being able to produce everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that which is why not it was so bad the good thing about doing it here if we create more jobs\nNo its horror Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ever the last thing you would ever want to do is make a law that everything must be produced here because on prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies\nThat would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be Newt and retail doors shutting wrapped in right in the opposite ... you would go in a massive recession\nIf we had a policy that we produce everything in this country\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln ... Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nSome rare metals that we don't have access to that we absolutely have to get from from other countries but say we even had those rare metals\nI well it depends on\nWho's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is which would be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we ... really one of the most under reported stories\nOf the entire year ... is that the United states\nIs now on it happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil in the world mhm\nYeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of a ... that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did\nBy the way I think that's the number one reason or communist supporting a or the or the president his tax bill ... way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter]\nThat'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the thing to do that right\nSo the but but you put in place all of those dynamics for great economy and all it's working up until what the ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials is still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly\nControlled by the government that is something that is policy put in place that doesn't need to be there but\nThey'll have you know when and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yeah we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even\nA for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a few things different in in TPP but remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in TPP camera I had already agreed to that\nYeah I'm a you know ... before so that was a lot of just a great victory and uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided\nYou know not to uh to take that you and I went through and\nAnd and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old\nNAFTA the biggest victory that the president has claimed\nThat he claimed was the fact that the terrorists worked to get what he wanted with the automobile industry right law he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile\nIn Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah nobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's viewed as a victory well if I remember two of the president's major goals\nHis goals his state of goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nI don't see how this does it because the majority\nOf the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles\nThe dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent mhm uh and uh the rest is still the same right so you ask\nOkay what were the what were the because that the president's trying to make the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles what did you get you increase the cost of automobiles for people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries\nAnd because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods\nTo you know producing them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite of the two things that you wanted a reduction in the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere\nWell and and the\nRight now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry\nAre now you you talk about you know the farmers I mean ...\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our high car buyers are tough\nAh you know set up before a few minutes ago but they feed the world that food goes all over the world\nUm you and and they're telling the administration look your your your money that you gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business that's what we need\nAnd and that's the because\nForget about the political pots president doesn't need them\nHe doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need that\nAnd they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite\nRight because it it is you know it's just protectionist policy which brings about\nRetaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers [laughter] it's I mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate\nSo I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably scrambling\nWell in terms of of getting things done as you said it was likely it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced you know\nYes yes and and that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the uh the supportive of a lot of people and other and I know people who are otherwise conservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well this is all negotiation\nWell wait he was a master negotiator why does he need to threat threatened and ultimately cost people a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get them to go she Asian done he's a master negotiator if he doesn't need to do that\nOr as I said you know ... and again him or we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA right well and that's it except for the\nYou know ... and you can look as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share\nFor the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm but then they really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually ... but the president did a lot of what what we\nExcept for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall was that worth the loss of business with the terrorists that the president\nHas put on that does raise the cost of goods and services\nAnd affected the cost of raw materials and other goods and services for American businesses\nAre businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule right because now but now he mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this is an our opinion\nWas the automobile thing I got what I wanted in automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made it so some uh some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour ... some have to do that won't find you've just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker\nRight ah and even with the was it I think it was a Wall Street journal said most and I forgot who else said well it's only a two point five percent tariff so really isn't going to affect that it isn't that great\nSo we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that but the other than the president want to do is make sure that\nWe could in the United states sell our vehicles overseas well that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up as to his caps on what what Mexico you know could send us in cars before other terrorists hit\n... we have an ... they haven't reached that cap and car buying in the United states has stagnated so they looked at that promote Canada and Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea where they said okay you can only you we've now doubled the amount of cars a with these\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda
