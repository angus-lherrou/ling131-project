John now\nAh I just ... since the lottery fever was out there I just I hadn't mentioned this Fox News had a great\nArticle a liberty written by liberty a veteran the mega millions jackpot while you're not being told the truth not being told the truth as\nA in an effort to create jak pots like this one lottery officials have not only made it harder to win but it continued to lie\nTo us about the benefits of the lottery ... about half of Americans play the lottery according to the most recent survey compared to almost Seventy percent of people in the Nineteen eighties\nYou know that doesn't make sense though because I I've often told the story in the Nineteen eighties I remember I was going to a party ... and I stopped by this liquor store to pick up a bottle of us who were Christmas Party and there was ... apparently some lottery going on but I didn't even know about it because right\n... that's not to to use a cliche the lotteries never even on my radar really is right I'll pass by it as I'm doing show prep for the show but it's something that's never been on my radar and all ...\nSo there I was in the liquor store and I just immediately I as I got it for about a second I stood in a real long line of about twenty five people\nBut as soon as I got on the line I didn't even look to see what if they were holding bottles or whatever I just saw the long line ... twenty five people there and I just did it in the ... no no no you you appear why am I going to cut goes no no no you're buying alcohol\nNobody in line for alcohol the liquor store everybody is in line for the lottery tickets yeah never forget that once I started thinking we're laced with alcohol you already know you're a loser\nA huge coyote it looked more like a wolf because it was filled out it was it was a heavy set coyote just sitting there just looking at traffic one wasn't a dog it was a coyote\nAnd it was just thinking to myself man it's crazy you know you've got all this wildlife like you said it's it's all spread out yeah and you\nKnow in this neighborhood here there's wild animals all the time you took a coyote come you think it's a cat but it's kind of [laughter] we didn't work but\nIt's more like as as somebody when they came over to my house one time and they'd seen pictures of my cat that came over and they said\nThat's not a cat I said it talking about the ... it's the Panthers [laughter] I'm pretty sure that when he was hanging out [laughter] it was like okay this is sixteen pounds yeah are coming up on the show today the latest poll on the tax plan what other issues could affect the outcome of the\nMid term elections and we'll talk just a little bit about John bathe her because that story\nOn the whole pot thing has has come up will tell you about the new company that will help you move out of San Francisco and\nThe Turkish president says his show geese killing was premeditated will say about the owners of a bakery will appeal to the U.S Supreme Court the EPA report on ethanol that came out we never got a chance to talk about it\nA lot of uh you yesterday and just are are complete and total election coverage and everything that's going on and and I think it's important because we talked about the polls but I think it's more important to talk about the issues\nThat may be affecting what's going on the stock market yesterday in the volatility of the stock market\nYou know caterpillar not worried why because they're building their parts more expensive why the terrorists we look at issues that could possibly affect\nAnd hurt the Republicans one of the things that we didn't talk about yesterday was the farmers farmers aren't happy because of the tariffs slug you may you may have destroyed family farms that have existed for a long time\nA big because you've taken away because of the terrorists taking away their supply chain yeah and as we told you win even though the president came out and said okay we're going to free up money for them they said that's not going to save us right because that doesn't that doesn't make up for the last is that right ... and the fact that we're not we're going to be shut out of the supply chain\nThat for ... and we don't know for how long I mean uh they could lose their livelihood with farmers I mean this is for them if it is their livelihood so that that towers over Kavanaugh and the caravan and and and anything else that might influence\nVotes and this is they could lose their lively and you've had a ton of small businesses out there that have been affected by the tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs you think about that if I'm going to hit them\nIn any industry in any region right\nHow would you like motor treads twenty gene truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty anti Ford F. one fifty best for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a plug for it and he went into and there were again but\nThere are every ... every other business is essentially related to that economy the farming economy so it's not just the farmers but at the altar yet uh businesses in that area that are supported by the\nEnd and that's an unknown quantity right I don't know how you figure I don't know how a lot of these things I don't know how you figure it in and come up with a formula as to what's going to win in in two weeks all I can tell you is the issues\nThat have a great probability of affecting the election both on the Democrats' side as we spend a lot of time out and also the Republican side sure what it could hurt the Democrats in what could hurt the Republicans because there are things out there that could hurt the Republicans in this election that more I mean up plus your calls and comments eight

I Believe my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm a\nYeah my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of people moving to it um but even aside from that if you've got a a home that's worth more\nThan ... where's your your taxes are higher and with a lower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of a ... and and remember ... ... ... the the the people that will be at that edge\nA aren't we're not talking the super rich were I heartland about what is viewed in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class\nRight and they're getting hit and they don't like it and what's their only recourse right now\nThere's still a supporter of Trump but what's their recourse to send the message my Republican congressman mhm and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to then paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that\nAnd even though won't change everybody's vote\nHas the potential of changing five percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election\nSo that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nI'm just the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nSo many of them coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax is going to we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually admitting where they're going to raise taxes which could hurt that we've also talked about the care of it\nRight in the ... in the Republican Party that's one I'm\nYesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears along expected decline is here now the economy overall may not ... and and and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected and a caterpillar a worse at the the the caterpillar story and then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are killing us write the stealing and autumn the the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't the China thing\nRight it's the United states and Europe and and and Mexico that they're still in effect ... and it's killing them it's raising the price as we said\nWhen the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only success that that he claimed\nThe the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's an unbelievable but he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing was a story last week about poured grumbling\nGoing to be losing a billion dollars and they believe the tariffs are guns that are hurting them remember every supplier and every small business of deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming or or or or feeling it already and every dealership\nAnd every deals you remember the steel tariffs really been affects we're from China which has increased the costs from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were up ... percent by the time we got\nTo June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in price because of steel costs and now because of terror of cost and because of the new NAFTA\nAh and then the farmers as we mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about your your talk if you're talking about a\nManufacturing people would manufacturing jobs that have technical skills ton of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump\nCountry when you're talking about farmers that are stream Lee upset because it's not only their current profits\nBut it's the fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our personal meaning you started wonder if that's why he went to you know even though was wishy washy ethanol plan\nI Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because by the internal polls were saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now yeah there was\nA couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt ... it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa\nIt's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry the farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry are you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nAre and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nAnd I don't know what you do in terms of of ah reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about or they need to have those farmers those companies\nNeed to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada\nOr any nation that they're selling to those farmers\nIf they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff or a tour of the that went into place\nA or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time a lot of time you don't get that back right away\nYou're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this was one of the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look ah thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar a handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our losses\nRhode Island's number one Ford dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nRight took us deck I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty as a killer this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out all the banks were are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government or during the recession or in two thousand they to the end of two thousand eight and into a two thousand nine they there were three apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a\nPossible high risk but they didn't want to run on those banks so they put money in all of the coffers well they made all the banks look risky\nAnd that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade trade deals between nations that are set up\nUm you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up or bridge and believing you could rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that's going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that\nThen your former customers are going to stick with someone else a another nation in this case and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this ... election we talked a lot yesterday about how the Republicans in so many ways\nWere set up in a way that you don't see a political party ... in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are in a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now for the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is the ... you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very where wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to their livelihood so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting the selection both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more realistic\nFlying J you can reserve odd shower posse real time parking war started from ... even get savings in reward is always a

we we looked at history of for example the midterms and then we look at the issues that we believe are driving it\nBecause I think it's very very hard you know you can look and you can look at the the the polls overall and you can give some credibility to it and we find the credibility of polls actually after an election anyone I've done that before we you know we have gotten\nCalls we don't get as many because we have spent his time especially after a presidential elections looking at the polls that actually got it right\nAnd you know we but we you know talked about the the the polls even for you know because we were getting the calls after Trump's victories and they said the polls were completely off they weren't\nBecause the polls measured the popular vote not the electoral vote right and on the popular vote you had two or three that were dead on as to you know Hillary winning by what roughly two points I think it was ...\nAnd and so you know there are some polls that are that are dead on so people that say the polls are always wrong that is paid wrong statement to make a lot of the polls are wrong and a lot of them the sampling that they use\nA you know distort the way that America feels but some polls actually get it right it's just the fact that we don't know which of the polls to get it right\nBefore an election we have to wait till after so we can look at the issues\nThat are are of that are affecting at a you know another thing is and and I don't think it's going to have that much of an impact at all on this election it may if if it goes on for another two years and right and this is this is where\nUh I I call it a a\nTrump exhaustion\nAnd I've I've just clean that were just popped into my head right now and and it goes back to last week when I was on vacation and I go back to ... I've often talked about there's roughly five women that I Know\nThat that I abused as examples these are all women that are in executive positions either own their companies are in management up or you know a high management in the company's up the rent or own their own companies\nThings that the only people he has to satisfy is his base ... in his rhetoric mhm\nHe's satisfied I Believe his base for the most part\nUh and and I think the the base has has his base has expanded because of the whole cabinet thing what's your pace isn't going anywhere from space isn't going anywhere they're staying with him and and the people surrounding his base are going to stay with him that it's ... it's those people\nWho are okay there's some good things and bad things where am I going where you know what am I think and then boom\nAnd and so I just thought I bring up what the the the one loyal Trump supporter told me who will vote for him again and vote probably straight ticket Republican I'm I I guess you know I'm not sure but it probably would vote straight ticket Republican who was just finally ... that was the limit the horse race was the limit it was because\nYou had the when you had the when it was a slam dunk win and then you made it less civil went right why why are you doing that why do you feel you need to do that\nWhat their Chevy GMC ... Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what board and he's written a generic ... that's right over two hundred three on cars all make all models and incredible prices are going to flood Otto John job now\nAnd so there you go but up when it's your calls in comments coming up your life you know we do have a wide open eight six six Ninety red eye\nTips from Jay Jay Keller and associates incorporated on customer service dispatcher serve as a sort of air traffic controller for the company's fleet\nEnsuring drivers get where they need to safely and as soon as possible\nThere often juggling duties between multiple trucks and drivers so patients from both the\nDriver and the dispatcher is essential for us to the operation when times get challenging like when there's bad weather or a driver gets a bad route the relationship between dispatcher and driver inexperienced rough moments negatively affecting all parties and removing the customer from the equation\nAs a priority to both driver and dispatcher maintaining a good working relationship with your dispatcher\nAnd communicating with him or her regularly especially when there are problems helps keep all parties focused on what's most important keeping customers happy and drivers safe\nThis ship was brought to you by Jay Jay Keller and associates incorporated visit us on Jay Jay Keller dot com\nThis has been the merit George driver report Roger you buy pilots flying J shell road jello and marriage or after market run with the bowl [noise]\nWhat book read more readily radio with a record ... tomorrow [noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shell roads I'm a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shoveled tell us what matters is inside\nProfessional truck drivers now with ultra one from T.

I mean we've seen it he's a liar um he's a he's an end by the way these lawyers that have lined up against Trump you know he can go after them as a group and include having that ... in that and and there's a there's there's nothing wrong with that\nOr he can go after them and\nBe I I mean that that's something that's an effective tactic that you know does work because it's true he doesn't have to make anything up I mean he he doesn't have to call anybody names\nYou call Evan Eddie a liar well that's just that's just true or that the guy brought a nothing lawsuit against you it was baseless then you've got again\nYou've got something that if you go you go to bring you go to the baseless lawsuit you go to the um uh ... you go to a a cabin on and you say these are the people that are against me right and to me I I people say well what do you mean that's a well no that's a positive what came out ... of the news story that\nYou get the capital of thing you get the caravan thing you get all these other things that\nYou know and and of course ah you know I'm a Cory bookers plan\nA you get the you know ... Harris plan you know this is what they want to do or the or or ... or any of that you know there are promoting this but that's not going to work we're promoting this and look what's working you can demonstrate that your ideas are working\nAnd you can point out we're there aren't going to work and that's something that is\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like flood out over time\nYou know you can show already a track record of getting things done that are helping the economy\nYou know and and that's it and and and by the way I I Do want to um clarify you know we criticized the former President Obama speaking in Nevada ... on yesterday's show or when you know because he said don't forget who started this and I think he's right we should Donald Trump started this good\nEconomy we shouldn't forget who started this all your writing Mr Obama or so the the the whole thing is again you you you have those positives stay on them because what is the rally\nWhat is a rally a rally is a a ton of positives and this map this massive group of euphoric people that are ready to take action\nYou know that's that's where if you think about it every day on social media should be that rally between now and November I mean it's not that you have to have positives you can go after Chuck Schumer right it buddy also because I I think it's very important\nTo understand that in the real political world I mean you'll have the purest out there saying I'm against the negative advertising this ridiculous right of course you have to point out one out so now you've got you've got to point out the negatives of your ah you know of your candidate you have to point out the negatives that\nThe government can't give you all the Iran right that somebody is lying to you when they tell you that they can make it a beautiful like the frustration that our last caller abs all solved cry you know not really made right well I'll tell you that that that it then that's why I started ... I started laughing because\n... you know that isn't going to happen you have to point out and and I believe the times you have to get blood is we've gotten London passionate about it during the cabin on here instead it's unacceptable to us and we'd been blunt that you're not an American\nThat if you ... if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even for capital\nYou know they were ... Democrats were trying to we use a lot of that in every well [laughter] it's it's not a quarter law it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under oath under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but it was a political cord that had much\nOf the same enforcement mechanisms that are criminal court has when you testify right and and so a ... a a person's reputation\nIs at stake it was a political court and yes Americans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact\nThat they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment they now don't believe in due process under the law they don't believe a presumption of innocence\nIf you're not on their side the American civil liberties union has just shocked away\nAny print tense up carrying about\nAmericans and our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabin I hearings we don't care we point out in a very passionate ways you can see I get passionate about this because I think it's very important to point out\nThat people say well you know it's it's offensive if you tell somebody they're not paid for it because they believe they're a patriot well know there are some standards\nOf why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American I mean what makes you an American it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you reject the basic tenants of the constitution if you reject free speech if you were jak freedom of religion if you if you reject\nThe second amendment if you reject\nA due process under the law if you were jak the electoral college if you reject this that\nAnd and you wish to change all of it then you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say it right it's it's not and people's votes a shocking thing that you're saying no it's not they're the ones that are shocking by claiming we believe in America\nOr just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is\nYes that's that's it I'm you and\nWhat they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say you know we believe in free speech ... no you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to jail\nThat free speech oh\nNo no no see your free speech as bigoted your freedom of religion as bigoted\nAnd so no we believe me we believe

know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them\nAnd you can proudly say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country mhm because they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country and so nobody's saying that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you know when you have\nThe way in the ... move onto the next when well again I think we\nGot to win for calling out a O'Rourke or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're calling out what they're promoting\nAnd saying

I wouldn't mind taking it out to Eddie gossip just plays the Texas anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank\nIt would it would um I think there would be a bit disturbed there's yeah there's nothing I'm I'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] died out to be clear it would it would be a huge hassle mhm I like my life mhm I don't want to change mhm\nAnd I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your life I have\nA a a friend who uh a friend or family member who a bat boy at one time was working for a a multibillion it um\nAnd it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day mhm and my family member told me that this person was the exact same way only because there's not enough time of the day we're talking about\nWith our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although ... at least one listener thinks we are um but but the point was is there's so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still\nRhode Island's number one born dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like flood out I was tired\nOld time job as a you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else to do I couldn't trust\nAnyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people ... what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kind of money you're not going to be able to keep your name private so this\n... it would be it would be hard to manage you can you can do that legally in in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars\nSomeone's going to notice eventually yeah exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money because of a sudden you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of ... what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you've got to run the foundation so this jobs gone or I don't want to run my in laws\nThere are laws about receiving the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it\nYou claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you've got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nRight well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job triggering out what to do even if you're not going to give it all the way that's what I mean it's still going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh this life I have is gone my life is life five right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah\nAll right let's let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older you're like well like what I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life\nWell yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life yeah I I don't do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things and I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so I'm\nI'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be\nGreatly excited about that mhm oh yeah 'cause I don't know I Would you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about the defining if this is one dumped off it goes through a mine but it's still a thought oh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion\nMhm because every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't you and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other title oh we've we've ever done you really I mean it's not I never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up and little did a a little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know where you're I mean we really got it it's almost like we come to work in a warehouse where the end of the show we grab our lunch pills and go home do it that's what the\nFeeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nOutside of being a machinist and so the mentality store to the same for it so I but the the the thought and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and\nYou know a a just and financial decisions and everything else that become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal life were you one point six billion\nAll that goes away and and I always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my way because I've on one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right but I got all these other things but I can think about it basically keep that the thinking of debt at a distance well all those challenges and problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going\nTo get all this money death [laughter] I was a you\nKnow I talked to one time about this uh there was a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed the game and he sold it\nAh I I I don't know I'll I'll have to look it up but anyway the guys told his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars and his take of that was a you know roughly\nLike one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a ranch just a series of tweets and he was talking about it was that the party\nAnd it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires\nAnd I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire\nHow would you like motor trends twenty eight gene truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty Eighteen Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a plug for it and he joined Narragansett\nHe talked with a girl who you know work you know for a living had a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her and it was what I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird are pleased to be in\nBecause I'm you know I'm not from money I'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's a here's the problem\nWith being famously wealth or like the the the person in my family member works for you've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the other you're famously wealthy so you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president has ... security detail that\nIs is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean and so you're going to have to be very careful because there are ... girl threats against you all the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "24"}
