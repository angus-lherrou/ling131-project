B. R. O. [noise]\n\nAnthrax radio he is there a comedy and I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety or read I we\nGo to Mary Ann in Michigan Marianne welcome you're on ... Radio Welcome to the show\nA high I really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down there the number of reasons like you said\nA including perhaps a ... a political agenda with respect to some businesses\nBut the thing about it's about our country being able to produce everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that which is why not it was so bad the good thing about doing it here if we create more jobs\nNo its horror Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ever the last thing you would ever want to do is make a law that everything must be produced here because prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies\nThat would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be dude and retail doors shutting wrapped and right on the opposite for ... you would go in a massive recession if\nWe had a policy that we produce everything in this country prices of goods and services would skyrocket through the roof it's not whether you are ...\nHow would you like motor treads twenty or gene truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty ... for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for not only a flood forward and he joined there were against it\nIt depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we the ... really one of the most under reported stories\nOf the entire year ... is that the United states is now and it happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil\nIn the world mhm yeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of a ... that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did\nBy the way I think that's the number one reason I continue supporting a or the or the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter]\nThat'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to you that right\nSo the but but you put in place all of those dynamics for a great economy and all it's working up until what the ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials is still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly\nControlled by the government that is something that as policy put in place that doesn't need to be there\nWhat they'll have you know when and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yet we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even\nA for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a few things different in in TPP but remember\nThe great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the pie Taylor had already agreed to that yeah I'm a you know ... before so that was lauded as a great victory and uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided\nYou know not to uh to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old NAFTA the biggest victory that the president has claimed\nThat he claimed was the fact that the tariffs worked\nTo get what he wanted with the automobile industry right all all he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile\nIn Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah\nNobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's viewed as a victory well if I remember two of the president's major goals his goals his state of goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nI don't see how this does it because the majority of the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent mhm\nUh and\nUh the rest is still the same right so you ask okay what were the what were the because at the president's trying to make the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles what did you get\nYou increase the cost of automobiles for people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries and because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods\nTo you know producing them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite of the two things that you wanted a reduction in the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere\nWell and and the\nRight now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry\nAre now you you talk about you know the farmers so I mean if you if you say\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in East Village and there were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent NPR for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nThat's a good but they feed the world\nThat food goes all over the world um you and and they're telling the administration look your your your money that you gave us a thanks but no thanks\nWe need the business that's what we need and and that's the because forget about the political pawns president doesn't need them he doesn't need\nTo uh I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need that\nAnd they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite right because it is you know it's just protectionist policy which brings about\nRetaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers [laughter] it's ... I mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate\nSo I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably scrambling well in in terms of of getting things done as you said it was likely it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced you know yes yes and and that's\nThe other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the ah the supportive of a lot of people and other and I know people who are otherwise conservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well was dissolved negotiation\nWell wait\nHe was a master negotiator why does he need to fret threatened and ultimately cost people a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get them to the grocery Asian done he's a master negotiator he doesn't need to do that\nAs I said you know ... and again him or we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA right\nWell and that's it except for the\nYou know ... and you can look as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share for the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm but then\nThey really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually ... but the president did a lot of what we except for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall\nWas that worth the loss of business with the terrorists that the president\nHas put on that does raise the cost of goods and services\nAnd affected the cost of raw materials and other goods and services for American businesses\nAre businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule right because now but now he mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this isn't our opinion\nWas the automobile thing I got what I wanted an automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made it so some uh some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour ... some\nHave to do that well fine you just\nMade them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker right ah and even with the was it uh I think it was a Wall Street journal said Boston I forgot who else said well it's only a two point five percent tariff so really isn't going to affect that it isn't that great\nSo we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that\nBut the other thing the president want to do is make sure that\nWe could in the United states seller vehicles overseas but that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up ... as to his cap on what what Mexico you know could send us in cars before other terrorists hit\n... we have an ... they haven't reached that cap and\nCar buying in the United states has stagnated so they've looked at that promote Canada and Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea where they said okay you can only you we've now doubled the amount of cars or with the safety precautions to twenty thousand\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting

[noise]\n\nInternet radio he is their accounting I'm Gary McNamara a chick six Ninety a run I just haven't had that you know at a discussion about\nUh the the upcoming election and and trying to tie everything in in together you know the president talking about\nYou know going back to China and and ah you know starting trade negotiations again the whole ethanol thing and you made a great point because you're talking about Larry\nSabato the the the pollster on a with a a Chuck Todd right talking about the that the Republicans looking weak in the in in the mid west and and we asked that directly has agriculture has the\nHas the agriculture industry and does it make their money off of it have they you know have they looked at the president said\nLook Republicans in the day they look and they just they were voting against the party of the president if it's true it's about I was saying that it's weak in the mid west for the Republicans is it because of the terrorists and agriculture well and and that's\nIt uh there are I think right now if you look at the the farming community especially sending that message back to the president and the administration on you know giving the money is saying they would rather have the business or that shows that they believe this could be long term pain for video roadblock here is your forecast\nA big drop to the south of where we've seen snow so far this year we're now talking about Colorado Nebraska portions of even western Oklahoma and north Texas where a snow\nBlood Lincoln is southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln him can you actually get MTC and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for leaking of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nStand a twenty five in the west snow mixed precept and then all rain as you move closer to Texas a small band of snow will be moving out of North Dakota into the upper Great Lakes mainly rain just south of Detroit\nIn flames anybody knew or pleases anybody new\nIt's going to and playing the same people and it's going to make the people that love when he when he does that still love him\nBut it's not going to change what's in it think about it who can this day and age how can tend to twelve percent possibly be undecided and death and and most definitely be going to the polls\nIn November yeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just one small indicators\nOf small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sleepy and the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats and one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats\nOne Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up district still remains at thirty too early to yes\nI Would love to see what your district that was that that that that shifted and I and again not from Tulsa\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those thirty to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number a for a majority right so right now\nOnly Nineteen those thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nSo\nIt will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls are and we and we will more and more are in the coming weeks that's going to be at the I think by the time we get back a week from Monday\nThings will start shaping up because those undecideds more and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens and what is the impact of the capital and the entire thing\nAnd really look at the our CPA for example in Montana isn't a tossup state right with test or you know up or the last one was done not you know nine twenty two\nWhich had test her up for the one before and and uh with the margin of error three point seven ... and the one before that was tester up just to why isn't that a toss up state why is that definitely yeah on the on the Senate race yeah unemployment rate right and and ... my point is so yeah it is the legitimacy of\nThe R. C. P. average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell ... ... and\nI guess historically can shift happened\nAh with ... if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done\nOut of the recent polls that were done in that race or the the uh you know test her up by by four and the grab us a margin of error is three point seven\nSo that you know that right there could be neck and neck are they calling a toss up because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error once we ought to consider is not a toss up that's my point ... my point is it's our CPA has it has definitely blew\n'em\nOn my map it still showing great it's just when gray\n[laughter] I didn't get it when it just went grey eye of thanks to the staff at our cp for world around them aware of what happened that just when it just went gray yeah All right I'm I'm I Apologize yeah I don't know if it updated it and then what I had was from a week ago or something\nBut it's just one great extent tiny brain asked myself like I Do wonder am I looking at the right Montana well and the look at the end when you're paws on my way and all of a sudden it updates Edwards gray in front of me down\nBecause arid Arizona was in grade before\nArizona was like blue which flashes or what men slightly favoring blues and I was going to ask that next because it makes Sally and all of a sudden boom that appears in that comes up is great\nAnd that because ... there's been a huge swing there okay in recent polls\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nUm and it is a it's a different uh the polls are in fact I'm well\nOkay I Know what I was looking at I had the one that said there's the R.

a I'm I'm voting because uh I don't believe that uh you know\nPopular opinion or you know should a substitute for\nUh the presumption of innocence and due process and I started thinking about it when you know you and I I said a last hour the the one thing that I got out of the whole cabinet thing\nIs the Democrats were tried to sell us that if you believed in due process and the mindset of due process and that's the accusation alone isn't enough and you disagreed with them with this message think about this\nThat if you don't believe the accuser no matter what\nIf you believe that not the allegation but the evidence is what should be the determining factor than you are an enabler\nAbout rapist of a gang rape is that's what they were trying to sell us think about that and that's why ... when he said you know he's probably because of that\nThat I started thinking just in our popular culture that all the different lawyer shows from Perry Mason matlock to law and order from just I think law and order started what an eighty nine a\nHundred and Ninety I yes Eighteen eighty nine [laughter]\nBefore TV so much but you you think of all the lawyer shows\nOut there uh-huh right that ... and so when we talk about the fact of the ignorance of the American public ignorance does not mean stupid\nNow the Democratic leadership may think people are stupid we believe people may be uninformed we don't believe people are stupid and never had it had ignorance simply means you lacked the fax it doesn't mean that you can't understand the facts and you can't go search for the facts or that you're

pass it along to the\nConsumer ... plain and simple\nUh this news item the co founder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier ... for those of you that are brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly and update you so you understand completely what we're talking about are the Democrats accused the Trump a campaign of colluding with the Russians\nTo hack and or change the outcome of the election mhm the evidence we found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a law firm\nPerkins Cooley who paid and opposition research from a ... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got a information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order\nTo change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use\nIn order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information\nAs a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a part of it well\nThe cofounder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress according to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte\nThe Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\n... really know the average Virginia Republican subpoenaed Simpson on September twenty ninth or after\nThe lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committee\nSimpsons firmed up fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign by the law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\n... fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele to conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion\nBetween the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the ...\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course all or is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\nWell then what does the lawyers say they're trying to find here's I either get are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think that's all right are are they going to ask him about a a\nWho he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you were listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought that up\nUh I don't think so what are they going to ask him about money I Would either going to ask him about Kanye West probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and the ...\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai kid Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free own condition I bought bought any religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices love onto flood Otto John calm now\nOutcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed at fusion GPS yes\nThe\nInspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the and an associate deputy attorney general\nUh\nThe inspector general would have been access to any communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking a\nDoes he oh he but he yes from the department of justice yeah well yes because it because\nThey were done internally yesterday right on right on unofficial yes device from the department and I and and again if the those are the ... that's the number of it right away from the point being is that you look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because\nYour GPS doesn't want to cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that but\nHow so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with a you know a\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do\nAs you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still preserved in any way\nWe we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm yes I have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand ... what I Would wonder is a blend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't\nLet let's take him at his word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask ... lawyer then\nWhat do you think they're going after right if they're not well look at ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing\nAs a Mueller investigation\nTo you that there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know of of fusion GPS committing any crime\nI don't know I'm One I don't know where there is any evidence of it you would uh concerning you know get gathering the information and getting the money from ... thrown opposition research firm that just on the level is is that is what you do you get dirt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you you do opposite while the what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what does he worried about\nWhat would they be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\n\nWell and and finding the time it gets interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I testify I'll go under oath I'll do there are plenty of people that do under oh mhm so what is the crime that he is ... ... that what is the charge\nThat Glenn Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does she think they're going\nTo try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n\nOr is there someone else there and fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget
