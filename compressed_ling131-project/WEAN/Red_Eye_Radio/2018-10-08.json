Republicans learned who might have forgotten about it is\nA the anger isn't just a Trump the anger was never all just at Trump\nFrom the left the anger has always been there the rage has always been there well excuse me it's been there for the last couple of decades right now I Will say but it had been there last couple of decades it was there a Bush like I said we forget we have short memories Bill Maher was the one who said\nWell yeah you know we we said Bush was Hitler we said Romney was Hitler but they really weren't but this guy really is\nNo as we found out it doesn't matter who you are\nIf you are on the other side they will come after us they will defame you their rage will be amplified and will continue to be amplified to the point where you're like I really can't believe when you when you look at it when you saw some of these protesters you say I really can't believe\nThat you know these these people have\nA critical thinking bought that actually goes through their head\nWell keep in mind I mean you know for a at least five days or so Jeff Flake was a hero remember when Coontz called him a hero he was a hero in all this when he delayed the process\nA that was until the vote\nYour hero until the ... the ... and it doesn't matter who you are even if you're on the left they don't you're not useful to them anymore Beto O'Rourke does not need ...

incredible prices logged on to flood auto jobs now\nI was talking about in ... not going to happen\nIt's not going to happen because you're not going to move on it when when you know you want to well if you want to open this door if you want to go down that road\nGo for it I'm sure you'll have some radicals on the left on Capitol Hill that will keep talking about it but it's not going to happen for a reason because there's nothing there\nIt's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed you're not going to have them well we can move and we can do this\nIt those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change their mind they elect tours no that didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad a net loss of life doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election because these people don't live in reality they don't look at the facts and anything they don't\nThey don't care about the process they want you to believe that that the process is that they slap on their Superman Cape and they're going to be a hero\nIn a moment and it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet confirmation process that was while it was distorted if you look at it the President Trump was the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out\nSo there was a supplemental background check\nThere was zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit but the people\nHe wants to get to get credit from the the media or the left\nOf course but the people\nThe everyday people look at it and they'll they'll look back on this process and go well one of the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean that don't follow it every day and we know people work\nAnd some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and you don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound would do so you don't have all the details but they look back on this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself\nThat allowed to process it was Chuck Grassley that allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gay for every single chance to prove her case and she could not\nThat's the reality of this all\nNot that the you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters in the ... and the baby's\nWant you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it nope they opened it wide you could not have given them or her\nMore of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but just something just to stand to go to a preponderance of\nThe of of running of the the evidence something to back it up and she couldn't do it now\nI and neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done the uh there what what didn't what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out\nWas Ford who said that her the the uh the note and whether she had video whatever the polygraph doesn't and the therapist notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know and then I think she refused\nAnd her lawyers refused to to turn them over everything that we now\nI mean there there isn't it if you can point to the the as the FBI said we only we know that you know we know that are not ... but when the ... uh came out and said that uh you know that that her lawyers oh you're twenty people we wanted to interview well that's not the point\nThe point is they asked her directly who are the people that you say are witnesses\nTo this actual event right she pointed out the witnesses they interviewed them none of them right could cooperate and say that anything happened in that case and none of them said anything she had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee or Dr Ford could and she never did\nAnd with those no she could've answered them over a nearly well it was two weeks ago when the uh when the Judiciary Committee and the chairman asked asked for them right because the the story came out\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nLittle background check that really is convenient\nOh no we're we're willing we call them we were going to give them you know you weren't you knew there in Bay where you have to come to you know had\nPlenty of opportunity or are they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee out where they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee ... and the Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over that right there isn't anything of substance that the left has I'm not\nThe only thing the left has is again and it was ever changing\nYou always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman\nOr a you know you ... you never believed the you'd never believe the uh the the man you had white males in the Senate Judiciary committee but when it came to the substance of the actual case\nYou know of of the political trucks that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview uh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI and a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath\nUnder penalty of perjury for the average job interview so if you're saying it was just like an average job interview or you're a little bit of a you're a little bit mistaken it got down to the point for all they had was an allegation and they believe in an allegation should be enough\n... rarely if we reversed roles would that be enough ... really is that where you are now the allegation is enough\nAnd then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well or it doesn't matter the the whether he's guilty or innocent doesn't matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yeah that's yeah so then you get what you want just to have multiple unverified allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing that\nThe left are brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right clarify this because we always get those road that's not just the if this was the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy\nThey were trying to get you to buy that the allegation is enough\nThat up a woman says it in this case it must be bully not another cases but just this particular case it must be bullied now I Know that they generally said all women must be believed but then the women that said well why don't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right\nYeah and and so that's what we're being told that the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence uh uh you know doesn't exist are up for for a man or defending yourself in a passionate way shows guilt mhm\nUh everything that they sure while does not past the rational thought or critical thinking test ...\nNone of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not the fringe Democrats this is the main stream of the Democrat Party it is the Senate it is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party\nAnd they're trying to get you just to throw away any mind set of due process site\nWell as we saw even independence when the polling came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that\nAll her witnesses said they couldn't cooperated with the no\nConfirm yeah and and that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers ah the the process was even distorted to that extent\nSo in order to facilitate that\nAnd then ultimately it came down to ... while I was voted along party lines with with what two exceptions really and then other than that\nThat's what it's always going to be and it doesn't matter that it's Trump as president it doesn't matter that it's kept when I was the nominee\nIs where we are as a nation politically right\nNow if Trump wasn't president if it was somebody else yup and he was Kavanaugh was up there yet it would've been the exact same ... same right than the division was not created by Trump it was not eight

Bush or anybody else that came together in most did on the right ah for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about what the work and and and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh\nBut also the Senate or more importantly more recently uh the work there and why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together a because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure\nOf the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates\nUm but the end and one of those moderates along the way would include a Lindsey Graham I was just going to I was just going to a mentioned that that\nWe knew that three weeks ago mhm that the less was motivated because I hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know right to sway motivate them more or whether there'll be a\nA whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know that young young people and I haven't seen a change in that said young people that vote Democrats are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term well that and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight\nTo defend Trump and his pick yeah\nBecause if you're defending his ... year defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that called Collins numerous times ah to tell her how to a vote when you see the colon speech\nYeah and and except for yeah it's\nReally a ... there were some things I disagreed with her honors and beach or like when she gave\nA Dianne Feinstein the pass and the big pass which she shouldn't have done because Dianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with and to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nUh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walk through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins\nDefending the great Trump pick of Brett Kavanaugh um you know you can only fight\nSo much within your own party before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to uh uh get done as a Republican or Republican\nIs real party right now it's a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is just money when you come when it comes to spending culturally\nUh probably a more right than they've been in a while\nA more constitutional is and they've been in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues are there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah ah ah right now and you know and and that's a shame but\nOverall when you look at it you have unity in that party as I said last week like I Can't remember when we had such unity part of it is the fight or from the present\nRhode Island's number one born dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont flood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like flood out over time\nGoes after them as he did others early on made you think OK doesn't really know who is picking doesn't really have confidence in the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know ... what was the spark that drove Lindsey Graham\nTouched still be on the Sunday Morning news show same he'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state yeah\nRight ... you know and that's it ... because\nThat's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right\nOn issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending to change fiscal policy\nOr to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country I I think we are light years right now or to say that this kind of momentum can get us to that point where we can change the spending habits I mean for Republicans\nAnd their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably a ways from that because that goes back to again what we said the base of the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the left while in social media and in the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process of the uh Democrats of California you know not backing her officially\nA for her run and that kind of again that's their that's an anomaly\nOften on the left they are better than the right at\nLetting the uh mansions of the world and even maybe a high camp\nA a ... do what they do in their state because it gives them the seat\nUltimately on other and the vote on other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill of\nBuilding building the wall really if you if you think about it that guards guards this nation\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks this is not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process and other items if they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate\nAnd we predicted this the moment they talked about getting away with a good well in the way we did after all ... the Democratic senators won't be for you know that's it's not going to have you know it's not ... but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that and and\nIt means if the because of they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of moving growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which again will never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that power that castle\nIf you will that wall that ... has to be built around this nation to protect this constitution\nYou can get a few things done if you're not unified but I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified over the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence right due process constitutional issues not defending somebody when you talk about those are all ... ... moral issues\nAnd that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they are able to take the house\nIt'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed\nThat is extremely productive and conservative and hopefully give Trump a chance to win in twenty twenty again state\nYeah ... ... or a book or right by the way I remember after the Roy Moore last that's when they got the tax deal done and that's when they got that legislation done they couldn't get it done before they lost that seat when they lost that seat that was motivating it shouldn't have been they should have been ... motivated before

I think it is about the fact that you have\nThe as I said why'd I think it will Washington Examiner said a a quarter of Republicans are identified themselves as socialist a quarter and a half a democratic about a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is uh\nRight now and this and the anger and the unity comes from the fact that they've listened to a Democratic Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party\nWhen you listen to it you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about the mainstream leadership those in the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat are talking insane ... they're talking about things that are completely against fairness and constitutional issues that are just so important to so many of us the presumption of ...\nOf of of innocence yeah and it's just driving the Republicans crazy for video world log here's your forecast\nBegin the week with a very active weather map there are at least three other systems in the north Atlantic that are being monitored by the national Hurricane Center but we're focused now on tropical storm Michael expected to bring to the north eastern Gulf Coast by mid week the risk of dangerous storm surge rainfall\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne as over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine per month that's right one twenty nine per month blood as every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nThere is a tough pollen in the New York times today than that attacks you I Want to put some about Frank Bruni writes I Can't think of another Republican whose journey from anti Trump outraged approach from\nObscene ... was quite so illogical or half a sad end he suggests that you are auditioning for a play is Jeff Sessions as attorney general your response or\nA Frank you don't know what you're talking about in your world Frank is a noble cause to destroy judicial candidates whose conservative whether think Thomas Alito for now have enough I'm bipartisan when it makes sense [noise]\nUh I Try to have a good disposition costs are like my job but don't mistake that I don't care\nAbout the conservative cause so if I made you upset because how would not want to generalize McCarthyism thing good and I think I can survive in South Carolina is\nWell you know the thing is is that um I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning\nI'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from uh the uh the outrage that he delivered\nA there on Capitol Hill that day I think will I I think\nThat is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election it needs to be carried through and that attitude needs to be carried through a\nOn important things that that ah the matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows what kind of her nomination process we may go through a while a Trump still president but uh you know making some very solid point uh the what was going to\nYou know they used to him it when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right ah Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president\nThe left one do you use that and and and and really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the by porters and willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was\nBut of course you're demonized now you're Hitler\nBecause you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly\nSo well you know the thing is and reading Frank Bernice column in the New York times that none of it relates to the actual\nCase and what he was talking about their marriage it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and you know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been mean to him and called him names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore\n[laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump's side with Trump's candidate I mean I did it change\nDoesn't get what we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump it really wasn't a a burning doesn't get that and I don't know I have to\nGo back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump\nOr from Lindsey Graham ... Lindsey Graham's a when he issued his concern that day a week ago last Thursday\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case and the ... and on the larger a much larger than a pretty much the treatment of Kavanaugh by the Democrats\nAnd and not the not the liberals with the signs outside look right the Democrats on the committee Frank Bruni has nothing to the article he's got nothing well he's angry he's yeah they're they're they're wrong as I've said we discuss this for the last two and a half weeks\nWe didn't have anyone I Am not seen any rational thought were critical thinking statement\nCome from the mainstream media or the Democrats just say that the position that I hold and you hold which would be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah where is flawed at all\nExcept for rhetoric and bringing up other things\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\n... single point that we have made\nWhich are the same what I can see is Lindsey Graham are all legit and the oldest is going to drive the nuts and moral and correct and right and you're wrong and reading Frank Bernie's column in the New York times you're a simple ten Mr Bruni\nTalk about the actual things that Lindsey Graham brought up go point by\nPoint and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be lined up\n\nYeah I mean it is again a the ... they just lack the will to have the debate they don't have the debate Canada debate so they have to step out and now everyone what Lindsey Graham said on that day\nSo they do what well they used to be for Trump now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right\n\nWell from their world absolute loyalty is expected as we've said in the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this all the right over there that's a good nominate that's that's a good nomination pick over there I like that I don't like this\nReal people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bernie can do that\nI can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed with Lindsey Graham and I might in the future\nYou are you running for attorney general right [laughter] what ... what do you want to eat or to general what are you trying to get out of ... ... well that's it he's only doing this well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have as he was against Trump and now he's four trough\nWe've we've said with the simple ten you know a arguments that will never and I called them simple ton arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always tried to bring up side issues that aren't\nAren't even a pertinent to what you're discussing right and you read really telling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump's fought to become attorney general yeah\nYou have no evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because he was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump you must always disagree with Trump which of course is hogwash yes\n\nYeah it it it is the insanity of the left and and again uh they ... well ... it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the site that had the greater intellect [laughter] still trying to tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... they keep going for the low hanging fruit\nBand and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is well he's just trying to get something out of Trump or he used to hate Trump and now he likes Trump\nDebate him on the point made on that day\nMr Bruni can't can't do it eight

super slander a stock report or\nOther not eat whatever his name is uh uh I think that some I think I think that may slow them down a little bit in their efforts because I agree with you guys are going to continue to and from the sky um but I think that if judge were super slander or level a\nHe's a private citizen yet he ... not under the same rules of capping off down or anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who was\nThen I think brought him I said it would slow them down that we give them food food for thought yeah I I mean\nYou look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically\nNot pursue this any further um maybe there's something there and maybe there's the they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is fact is that he would\nHave a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but um he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was ... was made public\nA through this with with the league and everything else\nAh that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the leaked to the media and all that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting\nYou the names were brought out as a result of the leak\nForward as far as we know she didn't leak it so if that if that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it because what responsibility do they have in a case\nBrought by ... by mark judge and or his lawyers whoever leaked to the media would also be partially responsible or for getting his name out there and that\nYou could see I think ... part of that and you have in any case there that was that was him yes you have in any case eliminate because that's actually the ... of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yes right\nRight right the only possibility of backlash when I'm ... you wouldn't want to put it is a good buddy ... ... they already the wind is yeah yeah you know got tempered problems and I wouldn't want them to think that they're ... destroyed theirs in spite of using his buddy to do this for a spy and\nYeah well they you know it's it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out uh in every up predictable and even some uh unpredictable ways we can we can try and come to use our imagination to come up with things\nAnd and thank you a market for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question\nUh he definitely would have standing as you point out very and pointed out during this process\nUh you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination a as the capital capital did and and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge\nA that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden but you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that ... that survived at all was Dr forged claim and and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further so that's\nWhy I'm ... and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so she wasn't trying to link it to the\n... a a media but in the ... case yeah to me that would even be a ... and again I don't know who leaked and so I I don't know I'm just I'm On the doctor or right I'm just using right that that as a possible exception here right ah but with the other case to me that's clear\nI mean it go in going after Kavanaugh with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time right and there are public figures for the law used them differently\nYeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm spiking drinks you know things like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out in print that right ... and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm\nAnd says then you've got to make your case it's the worst of probable cause while I think it might have happened that's not good enough no no absolutely not so I I like to just to ... percent only\nWell I'm In a while because [laughter] worth the ... the claims that were carried out and how he pursued this\nAnybody's like for for perjury or Hillary Clinton or Dianne Feinstein and so on it's like telling a bank robber I'm complaining about it\nWe were both well we're not going to hell whoa whoa where's the perjury hardy approved the perjury\nHow do you prove that perjury prime well you know ... if you don't want to take that one guy and finds fang\nOkay well I Know I I ... well\nMy point is legal point by point by what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge for who's an excellent\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with a ... she has a spy a at a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe than yes of course\nRight I I I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree with you on that\nAnd I I Believe they had I'm Down in their promise their their ... I Believe they're promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make a charge very kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nWell that one's that all that that process that followed everybody that that wasn't Republicans fault now\nAnd that was the only guy\nThat was combing who clearly was politically driven and and that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats to stop doing any of\nThese now with I don't know what they get them but what does this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen mass of loss it is but\nBecause of the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody in elected office would bring these up of these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe've set about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with ah with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's the which wasn't enough itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email or investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would ah prosecuted\nWe said well it what matters here's the court of public opinion what you're dead and ultimately she lost in November of twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call it is not\nAlways that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice\nHaving her in jail or is not as great as not having her in the White House\nYou know here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding ... sparks Nevada responding to\nWhen we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit ... well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened\nBut he said she said all of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove\nYou would have to have another witness stating she's lying about it right uh you know ... or it was you know about you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of wins you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know\nThe doctor Ford situation is there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah ah any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can cooperated so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nAnd and our point was is Eric just said that will there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen\nUh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't\nAh when the seats that they should be winning a in a first term of a president in the first midterm afterwards that almost always the party in power\nLoses seats and that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was ah was confirmed ... ah and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explain Clinton wasn't the Republicans ... ... you know if you're ...\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nThat Hillary Clinton was never charged is because there was a majority there's there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty would wander charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted mhm and so the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know of some\nOf his ... for example Susan Rice sure why we laugh when you said she said you know that that she would like to ... she would consider running against Collins and putting it gives me you're on the line item on big gassy now it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line\nAbout a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone in the United states

that is what she did and there would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with it\nAnd can't do anything about it the best that we can hope for in any thing is that the truth\nIs told I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right I don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said\nOkay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to relieve some of this information and uh so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make ... Michael ... we're going to give it to Michael Horowitz\nFrom I don't give it to my husband and I don't have that [laughter] whatever you do\nGive it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went dead mhm because it doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\nOh wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption ... improprieties right oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not release it immediately\nAnd give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd so we don't know what's gonna happen there but get us the truth and if the American people if they get the truth and still decided to do the wrong thing that's on them yeah and that's that\nThat's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency on on all of it the whole Russians scandal thing\nWe've said multiple times ... regardless of where it falls politically as long as it is fully transparent and the process the American people can decide up because we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want an investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really\nReally want from three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this is this would play out in the public\nOver and over and over for a very very\nLong time eight six six Ninety red eye [laughter]\nThe Sixers rid Iraq [noise]\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accidents three miles than registered to joined the million mile club on line that red eye radio show dot com red eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nThe tough tested powers led is on the road the tough tested truck we'll be traveling the country at truck shows truck stops and national retailers across the U.S stay tuned to read I radio for up to date to information and be sure to follow red eye radio and tough tested on Facebook Instagram and Twitter\nFor information on tour stop events and promotions if you see this truck\nHow would you like motor trench twenty eight gene truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty anti Ford F. one fifty the best drug for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a plug for it and he went into and there were against it", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "08"}
